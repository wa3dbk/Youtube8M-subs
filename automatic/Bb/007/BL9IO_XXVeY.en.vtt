we<00:05:35.409> can<00:05:35.559> also<00:05:35.710> add<00:05:35.949> some<00:05:36.219> characters<00:05:36.729> to<00:05:36.879> the

00:05:36.989 --> 00:05:36.999 
we can also add some characters to the

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:39.299 
we can also add some characters to the
map<00:05:37.180> by<00:05:37.419> specifying<00:05:37.659> a<00:05:38.229> spawn<00:05:38.529> point<00:05:38.860> and<00:05:39.099> what

00:05:39.299 --> 00:05:39.309 
map by specifying a spawn point and what

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:40.549 
map by specifying a spawn point and what
should<00:05:39.460> be<00:05:39.490> spawned<00:05:39.939> at<00:05:40.090> those<00:05:40.270> coordinates

should be spawned at those coordinates

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:42.989 
should be spawned at those coordinates
I'm<00:05:41.559> going<00:05:41.860> to<00:05:41.919> add<00:05:41.979> one<00:05:42.039> controller<00:05:42.729> book

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:42.999 
I'm going to add one controller book

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:52.270 
I'm going to add one controller book
character<00:05:43.629> to<00:05:43.779> the<00:05:43.930> map<00:05:44.110> now

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.020 

you

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.189 

the<00:05:56.030> final<00:05:56.389> thing<00:05:56.419> I'm<00:05:56.719> going<00:05:56.900> to<00:05:56.960> show<00:05:57.020> you

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 
the final thing I'm going to show you

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:01.080 
the final thing I'm going to show you
show<00:05:58.069> today<00:05:58.370> is<00:05:58.430> editing<00:05:59.090> the<00:05:59.240> trial<00:05:59.509> graphics

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
show today is editing the trial graphics

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.640 
show today is editing the trial graphics
iterating<00:06:02.090> on<00:06:02.180> how<00:06:02.629> the<00:06:02.689> tiles<00:06:02.990> looking<00:06:03.439> game

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650 
iterating on how the tiles looking game

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.709 
iterating on how the tiles looking game
can<00:06:04.129> be<00:06:04.159> slow<00:06:04.610> if<00:06:04.909> you<00:06:05.210> need<00:06:05.330> to<00:06:05.449> constantly

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:05.719 
can be slow if you need to constantly

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:07.990 
can be slow if you need to constantly
reload<00:06:06.289> the<00:06:06.469> game<00:06:06.650> and<00:06:06.949> maybe<00:06:07.280> even<00:06:07.490> navigate

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
reload the game and maybe even navigate

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.249 
reload the game and maybe even navigate
to<00:06:08.150> the<00:06:08.240> part<00:06:08.479> of<00:06:08.599> the<00:06:08.689> map<00:06:08.870> that<00:06:09.050> you<00:06:09.199> are

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:09.259 
to the part of the map that you are

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:11.619 
to the part of the map that you are
currently<00:06:09.469> working<00:06:09.800> on<00:06:10.069> we<00:06:11.060> implemented<00:06:11.599> a

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:11.629 
currently working on we implemented a

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:13.570 
currently working on we implemented a
very<00:06:11.960> basic<00:06:12.139> system<00:06:12.650> to<00:06:12.770> reload<00:06:13.009> the<00:06:13.189> graphics

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
very basic system to reload the graphics

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.520 
very basic system to reload the graphics
on<00:06:13.699> the<00:06:13.789> fly<00:06:14.000> to<00:06:14.719> make<00:06:14.900> this<00:06:15.169> kind<00:06:15.379> of

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
on the fly to make this kind of

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.390 
on the fly to make this kind of
iteration<00:06:16.189> much<00:06:16.400> faster<00:06:17.740> alright<00:06:18.740> that's<00:06:19.189> it

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
iteration much faster alright that's it

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.390 
iteration much faster alright that's it
