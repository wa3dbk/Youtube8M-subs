00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.270
 today seriousness 3 as the president 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.740
 heading that will be elected the third of the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.929
 desk and I would like to greet a person 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.549
 that always follows us so Janira Majello 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.199
 cavani re then today we pay document 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.430
 serious for those who also sit today because of us 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.710
 they said to do so completely 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.449
 we must be a forerunner and 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.490
 ecipar the things that will happen are correct 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.990
 Friday at 8 pm will be elected is present 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.340
 therefore almost sloppy this video the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.289
 first correct then when it came out to this 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.970
 I will therefore vote today or tomorrow 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.619
 this exact republic 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.570
 what's important in this nothing 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.760
 he never fucked me so much 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.920
 but here we are new people if 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.840
 no I have to talk about it in a desecrating way 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.550
 which is the president the present 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.250
 republic the commander of italy 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.379
 go through the commander in chief file 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.690
 all though in reality then you are tanning 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.489
 monastic but who is qi at 95 years dogs 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.960
 exact average when you hear but that 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.430
 American with the French that it 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.440
 those important to present the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.129
 france and holland that the president of 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.890
 republic and ours the 10 while 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.780
 dances while the president of Italy is 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.400
 an open institutional figure that 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.439
 most of the time the flowers are placed on the graves 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.450
 of the dead and 61 but not to recover of 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.000
 exact hand who will come we were 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.590
 reading small advances e 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.159
 there was talk of d'alema the fact 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.650
 daily 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.780
 massimo d'alema has already won ok, but 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.000
 so a quotation mark of someone for 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.369
 particular reasons on the skin 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.680
 we hope this happens because 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.820
 the number of immigrants would increase by 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.470
 70 percent 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.540
 we would be among these 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.000
 yet another demonstration of disgust 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.360
 right on the internet the big favorite 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.280
 for Mario macalli it would be for him 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.110
 glad to do it certainly not if found 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.640
 a paragraph in which it is written that 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.860
 maybe he retires 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.200
 it's fake because I don't pick myself up maybe not 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.430
 yes no 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.770
 I hope that maybe inca elections is not 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.600
 possible because republic presence that 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.340
 good if s 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.810
 representative of the Italian people a 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.790
 around that the world is elected by one 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.360
 herd of dickheads we're not 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.369
 we 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.170
 are people unfortunately elected by us but 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.150
 do n't even hurry you do it because 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.830
 we have not clicked on the name 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.119
 when they click, in short, mark up 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.649
 none but when we read but 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.450
 we voted for a list because for whom 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.030
 did not know you do not vote for people 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.670
 but vote for lists and cascade elections 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.709
 Senator Lanzi sees all the shit 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.080
 we look for when we go to the newspaper 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.430
 public surprise taste that I read 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.500
 sandwich lines that are there among you 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.900
 you know what you get the senator 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.750
 shovel piece for itself there is not then take it 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.709
 then you have the times talk about this piece 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:37.130
 bread coffee campaign bribes charge with 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.450
 you do fairies said I say wolves you 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.040
 give me 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.250
 gasparri us what he knows how to do what 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.690
 he knows what home comes after he does 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.950
 the battle is intelligent 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.170
 for those who do not know it presents 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.910
 republic elected me from parliament 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.650
 everything then senate and room then 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.239
 basically we don't act those 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.799
 who are in parliament and so here 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.110
 the person who does not represent us 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.209
 so for the maximum of alma it sounds 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.700
 like a grandfather it is plausible that you know 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.980
 because renzi the legendary magi has 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.959
 said we will vote after the third lesson 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.570
 because we discovered something that in 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.280
 actually we didn't know the acs this 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.010
 not all of us are on directions 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.380
 about the first three courts and then if the 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.060
 case reports need two thirds 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.989
 of the parliament where you can elect the 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.820
 president 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.500
 no after the third vote is enough 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.140
 absolute majority ie both the door 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.570
 in front of you then the quarry looks then 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.790
 just 50 percent plus one 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.440
 the absolute majority of course if 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.799
 there is a party that does not reach us with 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.660
 votes 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.700
 as long as they have the name of chiavari a 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.100
 them therefore the pd in this case to the 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.910
 power to do it but the name passes that 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.740
 they like it there is the spinning 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.770
 and then the moment of seriousness is now 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:45.630
 that we will continue to stay in the shit 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.870
 exact site we would like you to wake up 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.590
 a little as we continue to do nothing 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.150
 so try doing done not doing 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.580
 old school is always paying in 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:01.110
 cash but on the cards to never trace 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:03.030
 nothing assigns anything but the card 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.800
 method will not shake paypal and fat 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.280
 and reload from them on their behalf 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.870
 you have not seen anything ok me 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.440
 I recommend in this regard I would like 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.150
 different I am even more drastic 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:19.590
 this situation and I don't get paid 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:22.110
 from anyone you see there is my way of doing 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.790
 turn the economy and don't turn it six 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.340
 just seen then brought into this 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.800
 moment control system stefano persists 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.100
 people come out and stefano serra is in 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.380
 able to launch this house always 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.240
 success and suddenly from the other 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.500
 yesterday present always been elected to 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.300
 parliament only that maybe once 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.770
 there were well I remember that I 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.230
 I remember they told me there is a 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.600
 preference lasted five minutes 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.700
 what you don't prefer only prefers 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.860
 a preference to someone is prefer 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.930
 good and healthy people of mind is 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.460
 therefore a new good foolish that 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.680
 they do not know that he will talk but he is not 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.960
 unfortunately he is also interested in the question 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.430
 we are not interested in politically 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.930
 because we actually have no 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.850
 interest in politics and also makes us 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.280
 a bit disgusting a name that may not be 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.780
 because it is quite banal that you would like 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.430
 see how the representative 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.840
 of Italy arrest do not say what he says 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:17.250
 rocco siffredi and then my candidate 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:20.040
 perfect is giorgio moroder invented 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.880
 the music of if you know who's here 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.340
 way there is a profound esteem for 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.350
 I'm not kidding 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.250
 because we are called emergency site no no 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.510
 because it is such a person and bags 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.570
 this communist name was dominated 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.220
 of four there are all there is is one that 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.889
 he always does the work on and above all he is 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.540
 how do you write herons that are kind 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.750
 making greenpeace launched with the a8 audio 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.160
 then pollution abelli what 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.580
 instead towards a series with a beard 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.710
 economic the pennetta da la 30 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.240
 dry years term real ones we 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.240
 they really believe I'm kidding 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.940
 I would like feudalism but we are pure 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.790
 want to go or refused to with noises 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:08.470
 but it didn't happen 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.470
 then the appeal of the desire to return 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.540
 it produces them
