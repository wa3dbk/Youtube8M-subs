00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
left starts flashing and as soon as it's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.560 
left starts flashing and as soon as it's
finished<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.870> been<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> bit<00:00:50.300> so<00:00:51.300> that's<00:00:51.390> what

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
finished it's been a bit so that's what

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.750 
finished it's been a bit so that's what
happens<00:00:51.920> when<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.039> apply<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.489> firmware

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
happens when you apply the firmware

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.720 
happens when you apply the firmware
upgrade<00:00:54.000> that's<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.480> battery<00:00:54.719> does

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.110 

it's<00:00:59.730> almost<00:00:59.910> completed

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
it's almost completed

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.100 
it's almost completed
so<00:01:03.120> we've<00:01:03.300> before<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.570> do<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.719> make<00:01:03.899> sure<00:01:03.930> you

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
so we've before you do is make sure you

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.469 
so we've before you do is make sure you
download<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.500> latest<00:01:04.530> software<00:01:05.250> cyst<00:01:06.240> which

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
download the latest software cyst which

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.630 
download the latest software cyst which
is<00:01:09.049> 3.8<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.080> think<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:11.220> make<00:01:11.369> sure<00:01:11.400> you

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
is 3.8 I think it is to make sure you

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.750 
is 3.8 I think it is to make sure you
have<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.970> loaded<00:01:12.240> first<00:01:13.010> before<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.490> all

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
have that loaded first before you do all

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.730 
have that loaded first before you do all
your<00:01:15.119> upgrades<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.840> your<00:01:16.080> phantom<00:01:16.530> because

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
your upgrades on your phantom because

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.640 
your upgrades on your phantom because
then<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.950> give<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.159> all<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.460> latest<00:01:18.409> ones<00:01:19.409> as

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
then it give you all the latest ones as

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.530 
then it give you all the latest ones as
well<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> red<00:01:20.640> red<00:01:20.970> bits<00:01:21.150> flash<00:01:21.360> now

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
well so the red red bits flash now

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:29.660 
well so the red red bits flash now
saying<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.290> for<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:23.130> firm<00:01:23.640> upgrade<00:01:24.380> so

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:44.620 

or<00:01:30.270> my<00:01:30.390> son<00:01:30.450> halfway<00:01:30.960> through

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.530 

oh<00:01:44.719> my<00:01:45.350> stump

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.570 

as<00:01:50.110> you<00:01:50.230> can<00:01:50.320> see<00:01:50.530> it<00:01:50.620> stays<00:01:50.800> constant<00:01:51.370> on<00:01:51.550> the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
as you can see it stays constant on the

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.890 
as you can see it stays constant on the
green<00:01:52.120> in<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.330> middle

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.540 

so<00:01:55.900> hopefully<00:01:56.080> this<00:01:56.500> be<00:01:56.710> successful<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:57.460> it

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
so hopefully this be successful and it

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.300 
so hopefully this be successful and it
should<00:01:57.700> go<00:01:57.760> back<00:01:57.790> to<00:01:57.940> normal<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:02.830> new<00:02:02.980> version

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
should go back to normal the new version

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.920 
should go back to normal the new version
of<00:02:03.370> sister<00:02:03.610> software<00:02:03.940> actually<00:02:04.150> corrects<00:02:04.780> the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
of sister software actually corrects the

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.090 
of sister software actually corrects the
issue<00:02:05.080> with<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.190> old<00:02:06.220> firmware<00:02:07.890> where<00:02:08.890> it

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
issue with the old firmware where it

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.470 
issue with the old firmware where it
actually<00:02:09.369> did<00:02:09.700> damage<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.240> battery<00:02:12.480> so

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
actually did damage to the battery so

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
actually did damage to the battery so
