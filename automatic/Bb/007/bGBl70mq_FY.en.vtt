00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
we're going to experiment with some

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.790 
we're going to experiment with some
ideas<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:18.170> compost<00:00:19.170> showers<00:00:19.439> where<00:00:19.590> you<00:00:19.650> heat

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
ideas of compost showers where you heat

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.140 
ideas of compost showers where you heat
the<00:00:19.890> water<00:00:19.920> coming<00:00:20.369> from<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.640> hose<00:00:20.880> with

the water coming from the hose with
compost<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:23.300> so<00:00:24.300> whatever<00:00:24.660> blob<00:00:24.990> will<00:00:25.140> block

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
compost and so whatever blob will block

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.599

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.060 
here we use zip ties that's what we had
the<00:01:58.110> world<00:01:58.350> about<00:01:58.680> being<00:01:59.040> thrifty<00:01:59.340> and<00:02:01.070> up

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
the world about being thrifty and up

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.810 
the world about being thrifty and up
there<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.549> took<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.850> piece<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.180> one<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.899> these<00:02:04.020> um

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
there I took a piece of one of these um

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.730 
there I took a piece of one of these um
pallets<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.270> made<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.540> crosshatch<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.560> this

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
pallets and I made a crosshatch so this

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.410 
pallets and I made a crosshatch so this
way<00:02:07.860> maybe<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.250> could<00:02:08.399> support<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:09.030> solar

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
way maybe you could support a solar

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.050 
way maybe you could support a solar
shower<00:02:09.629> or<00:02:10.470> even<00:02:11.370> just<00:02:11.400> be<00:02:12.150> able<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.480> put<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
shower or even just be able to put the

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.380 
shower or even just be able to put the
the<00:02:15.060> fittings<00:02:15.450> for<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:16.910> compost<00:02:17.910> shower<00:02:18.120> there

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
the fittings for a compost shower there

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.960 
the fittings for a compost shower there
but<00:02:19.170> in<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.320> meantime<00:02:19.500> it's<00:02:20.040> just<00:02:20.340> helps

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
but in the meantime it's just helps

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.750 
but in the meantime it's just helps
support<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.360> whole<00:02:21.600> thing<00:02:22.250> then<00:02:23.250> you<00:02:23.370> go<00:02:23.490> look

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
support the whole thing then you go look

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.800 
support the whole thing then you go look
at<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.910> beautiful<00:02:24.120> floor<00:02:24.390> does<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.690> look

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
at the beautiful floor does that look

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.290 
at the beautiful floor does that look
like<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:25.020> spa<00:02:25.440> is<00:02:25.740> that<00:02:26.010> spa<00:02:26.400> like<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.940> think<00:02:27.210> it's

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
like a spa is that spa like I think it's

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.950 
like a spa is that spa like I think it's
spa-like<00:02:27.830> so<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:28.920> come<00:02:29.100> on<00:02:29.220> inside<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.960> so

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
spa-like so you come on inside and so

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.020 
spa-like so you come on inside and so
that<00:02:31.110> this<00:02:31.200> wouldn't<00:02:31.320> flap<00:02:31.620> around<00:02:31.770> I<00:02:32.220> stapled

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
that this wouldn't flap around I stapled

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.920 
that this wouldn't flap around I stapled
it<00:02:33.150> pretty<00:02:33.990> easy<00:02:34.110> right<00:02:34.500> I<00:02:35.570> nailed<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.750> there

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
it pretty easy right I nailed it there

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.410 
it pretty easy right I nailed it there
along<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.170> top<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:38.030> don't<00:02:39.030> know<00:02:39.090> how<00:02:39.180> much<00:02:39.300> you
