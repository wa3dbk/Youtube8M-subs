he corrected ok with a bit of effort or

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.200 
he corrected ok with a bit of effort or

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
maybe not much effort ok that's the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.450 
maybe not much effort ok that's the
witness<00:01:24.390> point<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.439> tablet<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.220> screen
