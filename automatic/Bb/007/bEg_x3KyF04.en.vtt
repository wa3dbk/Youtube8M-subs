00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.070
 stamp is that finally seriously at last and 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.520
 long ago it would not be an abandonment of 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.130
 vettel 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.690
 once he left from the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.020
 season pass in this Christmas has a 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.800
 finally finally abandoned seriously at last 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.110
 finish 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.370
 you can not go anymore anymore 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.950
 abandonment 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.079
 alonso on the podium come back in paul and 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.809
 ross see on the podium finally abandoned 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.019
 vettel seriously a carrerÃ³n took to 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.109
 vettel also went first but it was 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:45.629
 stella has broken the gearbox and 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.899
 you can not do something else like that 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.399
 that abandonment of vettel 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.410
 Fernando Alonso was third came out 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.410
 ninth a career piece has also 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.780
 come out losing positions the skating 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.070
 very much the car and well then it has 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.870
 continued recovering little by little 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.670
 stopped just did not come out the second 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.830
 septic 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.140
 has won has not won positions there 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.450
 none actually lost but then already 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.770
 talking new and has been happening to all 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.010
 until in the end it happens here has 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.100
 left and third 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.140
 to felipe massa also another piece of 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.270
 meat has made a very good exit has 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.530
 had very bad luck with the punctures 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.320
 that this is something that I will talk about now 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.000
 then the blowouts of the wheels has 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.010
 had to stop has done four to 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.930
 there in the end it was seventh 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.050
 fairly good 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.260
 I have not done anything wrong 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.409
 but well let's talk right now about 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.990
 the blowouts of the wheels 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.619
 I honestly do not know why they have 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:48.100
 busted they said it was because of the roadsides 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.049
 those of pirelli have still said it was because 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.259
 the verges that maybe had something 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:56.920
 sharp but good I do not believe that 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:59.979
 because we are not going to see those hard shoulders 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.719
 they have been there for 50 years of Formula 1 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.579
 little and has never happened that equally 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:08.799
 I would have punctured them because they have all gone 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.720
 by the same do then I doubt that 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.150
 be the shoulders that's a problem of 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.610
 the tires as already seeing problems 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.760
 this whole year with the damn 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.420
 pirelli tires so let's see if by 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.830
 end it goes back michelin though only 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:30.100
 whether or not it falls as before several 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.440
 go tire suppliers every 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.120
 team and choose the tires that 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.310
 wants and is already 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.709
 Well, maybe there would be more stops or 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.629
 better would be less a few would win 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.269
 we would lose more whatever but 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.220
 each the tires that we two with 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.010
 these because this one proved is a whore 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.099
 shit for the year they're serious about is 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.810
 who changed them and will bet health 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:57.049
 being harder for red bull and for 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.870
 mercedes to mercedes help with this 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.599
 with the damn test with the damn test 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.930
 He who in the end has not said anything 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:08.480
 mercedes but absolutely nothing or 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.120
 there have been points or nothing 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.650
 If you arrive Ferrari makes them falling 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.500
 Mercedes also but nothing yet 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.260
 they still have problems in Mercedes and 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.720
 all the half that before normal they go to them 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.780
 helping well of course so anyone has 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.720
 problems let's go 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.760
 and basically it's already 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.770
 the tires that change them already 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.770
 order because it is please because it is that if 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.620
 they do not change them seriously as mom are 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.910
 more seasons like this with these tires 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.970
 that more is talked about the tires that 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:48.770
 of other things there have been four or five 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.870
 hamilton mass blowouts and more 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.960
 people there have been a lot of blowouts of pee 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.960
 that almost gives the wheel alonso 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.940
 is that I do not know how they allow this is 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.150
 that does not make any sense to follow 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.060
 allowing because it is that it does not have 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.300
 sense in the race has been quite 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.680
 entertaining 2 explain the first one by 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.910
 the blowouts the second by the 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.660
 abandonment of vettel that has remained the 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.280
 car stopped right on the main straight 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.890
 and then with artistic forms and those that 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.750
 they have already new tire have come out to butt 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.560
 they have thrown as webber alonso and rosberg 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.780
 I saw them first webber ahead and 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.520
 alonso also 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.880
 now we have reached third webber 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.900
 advance to kimi raikkonen and I do not know if 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.850
 someone else 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.130
 has been second and alonso since 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.350
 eighth place that was arrived 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.410
 to be third going to kimi 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:45.889
 raikkonen to the two mclaren to subtle ya 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.830
 ricciardo it seems to me that these have been 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:51.060
 just as I think it was this 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.380
