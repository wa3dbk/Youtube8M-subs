00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.220 
pump seal installation tool it looks
like<00:00:47.700> he<00:00:47.879> made<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:48.930> himself<00:00:49.520> on<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.640> lathe

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
like he made this himself on a lathe

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.299 
like he made this himself on a lathe
either<00:00:52.230> way<00:00:53.090> it's<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.210> work<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.480> art<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.070> I<00:00:56.070> have

either way it's a work of art and I have
the<00:00:56.399> water<00:00:56.550> pump<00:00:56.850> back<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.320> can't<00:00:58.500> see

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the water pump back on so you can't see

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.319 
the water pump back on so you can't see
exact<00:00:59.039> exactly<00:00:59.489> how<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.760> worked<00:00:59.969> but<00:01:00.180> check

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
out my last video mainly how this works

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.810 
out my last video mainly how this works
is<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.439> fits<00:01:04.439> right<00:01:04.650> over<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.070> shaft<00:01:05.400> that

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
is this fits right over the shaft that

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.570 
is this fits right over the shaft that
comes<00:01:06.000> out<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.270> timing<00:01:06.570> cover<00:01:07.250> you<00:01:08.250> slide

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
comes out of the timing cover you slide

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.429 
comes out of the timing cover you slide
the<00:01:08.729> seal<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.210> there<00:01:10.189> it<00:01:11.189> points<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.880> lip<00:01:12.439> the

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
water pump out that I don't want to

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.740 
water pump out that I don't want to
start<00:01:56.310> with<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.490> engine<00:01:56.670> with<00:01:57.450> antifreeze

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
start with this engine with antifreeze

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.420 
start with this engine with antifreeze
and<00:01:57.960> then<00:01:58.200> what<00:01:58.590> we're<00:01:58.710> eating<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.130> when<00:01:59.310> I'm

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.429 
and then what we're eating it when I'm
had<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.119> thing<00:02:00.329> run<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.659> have<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> huge<00:02:01.290> air

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
had this thing run and have a huge air

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.289 
had this thing run and have a huge air
bubbling<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:01.979> I'm<00:02:02.070> going<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.250> fill<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.549> right

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
bubbling so I'm going to fill it right

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.270 
bubbling so I'm going to fill it right
through<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.540> top<00:02:03.750> first<00:02:04.439> then<00:02:04.979> put<00:02:05.130> the

through the top first then put the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.300 
through the top first then put the
thermostat<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:06.619> just<00:02:07.619> got<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:07.829> put<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.069> pulley

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
thermostat in just got to put the pulley

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.380 
thermostat in just got to put the pulley
on<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.789> front<00:02:09.090> harmonic<00:02:09.810> balancer

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
on the front harmonic balancer

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.040 
on the front harmonic balancer
for<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> clutch<00:02:12.840> fan<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:14.540> I'll<00:02:15.540> be<00:02:15.780> ready<00:02:15.960> to

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
for the clutch fan and I'll be ready to

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.890 
for the clutch fan and I'll be ready to
start<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:16.530> thing<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.580> am<00:02:18.450> hoping<00:02:18.840> that

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
start this thing so I am hoping that

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.280 
start this thing so I am hoping that
that<00:02:19.170> opti<00:02:19.530> spark<00:02:19.860> which<00:02:20.540> is<00:02:21.540> new<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.810> replace

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
that opti spark which is new I replace

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.590 
that opti spark which is new I replace
that<00:02:22.320> as<00:02:22.650> well<00:02:22.860> which<00:02:23.580> is<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.790> whole<00:02:23.940> cause<00:02:24.570> of

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
that as well which is the whole cause of

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.490 
that as well which is the whole cause of
this<00:02:25.160> teardown<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.780> hope<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:28.050> that<00:02:28.200> was<00:02:28.350> the

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
this teardown I hope that that was the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.270 
this teardown I hope that that was the
problem<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:29.160> tested<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.090> all<00:02:30.360> tests<00:02:31.280> pointed

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
problem I tested it all tests pointed

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.600 
problem I tested it all tests pointed
that<00:02:32.490> it<00:02:33.180> was<00:02:33.420> bad<00:02:34.170> which<00:02:34.830> is<00:02:35.010> common<00:02:35.400> on<00:02:35.460> these

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
that it was bad which is common on these

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.740 
that it was bad which is common on these
cars<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:38.090> next<00:02:39.090> video<00:02:40.100> I'll<00:02:41.100> go<00:02:41.250> ahead<00:02:41.340> and

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750
