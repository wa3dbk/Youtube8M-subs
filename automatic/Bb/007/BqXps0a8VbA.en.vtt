knowing I'll probably earthquake or
something<00:01:04.530> like<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.799> it's<00:01:05.070> definitely

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
something like that it's definitely

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.390 
something like that it's definitely
coming<00:01:05.909> after<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.840> attack<00:01:07.130> also<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.159> get

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
coming after this attack also I get

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.010 
coming after this attack also I get
there<00:01:08.549> are<00:01:08.670> defense<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.420> special<00:01:09.780> defense

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
there are defense and special defense

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.590 
there are defense and special defense
drop<00:01:10.350> there<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.640> little<00:01:11.670> bit<00:01:12.000> frail

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
drop there so it's a little bit frail

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.539 
drop there so it's a little bit frail
after<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.439> course<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.040> popped<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.460> air

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
after that of course so I popped the air

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.820 
after that of course so I popped the air
balloon<00:01:14.790> that's<00:01:15.030> um<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.689> guess<00:01:16.439> that's<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.680> good

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
balloon that's um I guess that's a good

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.380 
balloon that's um I guess that's a good
thing<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.100> he<00:01:17.250> goes<00:01:17.369> for<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.580> guy<00:01:17.759> oh<00:01:17.790> boy<00:01:18.150> I

thing but he goes for the guy oh boy I

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.940 
thing but he goes for the guy oh boy I
guess<00:01:18.720> that's<00:01:18.930> not<00:01:18.990> gonna<00:01:19.170> do<00:01:19.380> very<00:01:19.500> much<00:01:19.740> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
guess that's not gonna do very much to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.179 
guess that's not gonna do very much to
me<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.970> was<00:01:21.450> expecting<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.380> was<00:01:22.710> expecting

go<00:01:32.759> um<00:01:33.150> into<00:01:33.810> my<00:01:33.930> Dugtrio<00:01:34.549> this<00:01:35.549> was<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> banded

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
go um into my Dugtrio this was a banded

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.830 
go um into my Dugtrio this was a banded
Dugtrio<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:38.369> was<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.970> pretty<00:01:39.630> much<00:01:39.810> a

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
Dugtrio so it was a pretty much a

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.859 
Dugtrio so it was a pretty much a
revenge<00:01:40.320> bringing<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:40.920> revenge<00:01:41.280> kill

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
revenge bringing in revenge kill

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.230 
revenge bringing in revenge kill
anything<00:01:42.869> one<00:01:43.170> low<00:01:43.380> HP<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:44.159> steelix<00:01:44.909> is<00:01:45.060> going

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
anything one low HP so steelix is going

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.780 
anything one low HP so steelix is going
to<00:01:45.299> go<00:01:45.390> down<00:01:45.600> there<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.130> I'm<00:01:47.130> off<00:01:47.310> dives<00:01:47.579> off

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
to go down there so I'm off dives off

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.550 
to go down there so I'm off dives off
they're<00:01:47.970> all<00:01:48.030> kind<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.360> an<00:01:48.509> average<00:01:48.630> start<00:01:49.200> and

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
they're all kind of an average start and

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.980 
they're all kind of an average start and
this<00:01:50.159> mantra<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.670> really<00:01:50.939> did<00:01:51.149> not<00:01:51.600> help

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
this mantra is really did not help

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.480 
this mantra is really did not help
things<00:01:52.409> either

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
things either

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.480 
things either
so<00:01:54.380> obviously<00:01:55.380> I'm<00:01:55.530> banned<00:01:55.890> there<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.430> I've

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
so obviously I'm banned there so I've

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.880 
so obviously I'm banned there so I've
got<00:01:56.670> no<00:01:56.790> choice<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.240> switch<00:01:57.630> out<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.740> go

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
got no choice to switch out and I go

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.260 
got no choice to switch out and I go
back<00:01:59.040> into<00:01:59.280> my<00:01:59.750> my<00:02:00.750> hippo<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.880> was<00:02:02.880> thinking

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
back into my my hippo so I was thinking

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.050 
back into my my hippo so I was thinking
if<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.659> could<00:02:03.719> least<00:02:04.079> just<00:02:04.439> take<00:02:04.710> one<00:02:05.399> at<00:02:05.700> one

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
if I could least just take one at one

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.479 
if I could least just take one at one
attack<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:06.810> he<00:02:07.469> sets<00:02:07.740> up<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.979> sunny<00:02:08.190> day<00:02:08.429> so

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
attack so he sets up a sunny day so

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.669 
attack so he sets up a sunny day so
solar<00:02:08.940> beams<00:02:09.209> obviously<00:02:09.780> going<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.050> come<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.500> I

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
solar beams obviously going to come so I

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.890 
solar beams obviously going to come so I
just<00:02:11.550> hoping<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.120> could<00:02:12.150> at<00:02:12.330> least<00:02:12.420> take<00:02:12.660> one

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
just hoping I could at least take one

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.640 
just hoping I could at least take one
attack<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.379> rule

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
attack to rule

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.679 
attack to rule
this<00:02:13.769> out<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.280> um<00:02:14.610> as<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.299> can<00:02:15.420> see<00:02:15.510> the

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
this out so that um as you can see the

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.020 
this out so that um as you can see the
stealth<00:02:15.989> rock<00:02:16.230> damage<00:02:16.560> does<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> hell<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.879> lot

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
stealth rock damage does a hell of a lot

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.530 
stealth rock damage does a hell of a lot
of<00:02:18.060> our<00:02:18.299> damage<00:02:18.689> tumult<00:02:19.170> res<00:02:19.760> okay<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:20.819> the

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
of our damage tumult res okay so the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.470 
of our damage tumult res okay so the
solar<00:02:21.780> beam<00:02:22.019> comes<00:02:22.349> in<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:22.650> hits<00:02:23.480> really

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
solar beam comes in it hits really

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.830 
solar beam comes in it hits really
really<00:02:25.110> really<00:02:25.680> hard<00:02:26.030> so<00:02:27.030> say<00:02:27.420> anybody's

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
really really hard so say anybody's

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.539 
really really hard so say anybody's
definitely<00:02:28.260> going<00:02:28.439> to<00:02:28.590> go<00:02:28.709> down<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.069> that<00:02:29.099> of

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
definitely going to go down to that of

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.819 
definitely going to go down to that of
course<00:02:30.480> so<00:02:30.659> I<00:02:30.689> did<00:02:31.019> have<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.200> bring<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.680> right

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
course so I did have to bring the right

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.429 
course so I did have to bring the right
ability<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:33.450> would<00:02:33.599> not<00:02:33.780> have<00:02:33.900> happened<00:02:33.930> so

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
ability that would not have happened so

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.429 
ability that would not have happened so
anyway<00:02:34.769> but<00:02:35.040> that's<00:02:35.189> whatever<00:02:35.760> that's<00:02:36.540> that's

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
anyway but that's whatever that's that's

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:38.899 
anyway but that's whatever that's that's
the<00:02:37.560> game<00:02:37.739> so<00:02:37.980> anyway<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.310> bring<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.609> my<00:02:38.640> dog

the game so anyway I bring to my dog
trio<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.450> was<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.780> little<00:02:40.079> bit<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.409> got<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:41.010> bit

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:41.189 
trio I was a little bit I got a bit

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.830 
trio I was a little bit I got a bit
overconfident<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:42.060> went<00:02:42.209> for<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.420> sucker

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
overconfident and went for a sucker

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.990 
overconfident and went for a sucker
punch<00:02:43.079> thinking<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.620> would<00:02:43.769> kill<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.159> but<00:02:44.430> it

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
punch thinking it would kill it but it

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.750 
punch thinking it would kill it but it
didn't<00:02:45.329> so<00:02:45.829> yeah<00:02:46.829> that<00:02:47.099> was<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.220> bit<00:02:47.579> of<00:02:47.670> a

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
didn't so yeah that was a bit of a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.069 
didn't so yeah that was a bit of a
bummer<00:02:48.000> because<00:02:48.180> I'm<00:02:48.420> definitely<00:02:48.750> gonna<00:02:48.870> go

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
bummer because I'm definitely gonna go

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.080 
bummer because I'm definitely gonna go
down<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.409> this<00:02:49.530> Solomon<00:02:50.459> as<00:02:50.609> well<00:02:50.790> in

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
down to this Solomon as well in

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.520 
down to this Solomon as well in
hindsight<00:02:51.329> I<00:02:51.629> definitely<00:02:52.139> should<00:02:52.260> have<00:02:52.290> golf

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
hindsight I definitely should have golf

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.710 
hindsight I definitely should have golf
a<00:02:52.620> stone<00:02:52.889> edge<00:02:53.099> but<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.579> was<00:02:54.269> a<00:02:54.359> little<00:02:54.480> bit

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
a stone edge but I was a little bit

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.660 
a stone edge but I was a little bit
shaky<00:02:55.139> that<00:02:55.319> it<00:02:55.470> might<00:02:55.650> may<00:02:55.950> have<00:02:56.099> missed<00:02:56.340> as

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
shaky that it might may have missed as

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.509 
shaky that it might may have missed as
well<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:57.470> anyway<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.530> after<00:02:58.889> the<00:02:59.159> life<00:02:59.340> walk

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
well so anyway so after the life walk

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.520 
well so anyway so after the life walk
damage<00:02:59.849> is<00:03:00.030> basically<00:03:00.599> one<00:03:00.930> hit<00:03:01.139> two<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.379> died

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
damage is basically one hit two it died

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.289 
damage is basically one hit two it died
so<00:03:01.859> I<00:03:01.889> guess<00:03:02.129> I<00:03:02.220> didn't<00:03:02.430> turn<00:03:02.579> out<00:03:02.730> all<00:03:02.939> that

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
so I guess I didn't turn out all that

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.110 
so I guess I didn't turn out all that
bad<00:03:03.659> alright<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:04.709> into<00:03:05.010> locario<00:03:05.519> he<00:03:05.879> can't

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
bad alright so into locario he can't

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.429 
bad alright so into locario he can't
switch<00:03:06.450> because<00:03:06.689> the<00:03:06.780> stealth<00:03:07.019> rocks<00:03:07.260> up

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
switch because the stealth rocks up

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.440 
switch because the stealth rocks up
there's<00:03:07.650> no<00:03:07.769> point<00:03:08.069> switching<00:03:08.579> I<00:03:08.819> go<00:03:09.239> for<00:03:09.389> the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
there's no point switching I go for the

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.899 
there's no point switching I go for the
extreme<00:03:09.810> speed<00:03:10.049> to<00:03:10.260> finish<00:03:10.590> he's<00:03:11.340> melted<00:03:11.760> off

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
extreme speed to finish he's melted off

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.170 
extreme speed to finish he's melted off
so<00:03:12.269> that<00:03:12.959> Moffat<00:03:13.139> Moltres<00:03:13.889> did<00:03:14.099> a<00:03:14.129> really<00:03:14.340> nice

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
so that Moffat Moltres did a really nice

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.199 
so that Moffat Moltres did a really nice
job<00:03:15.510> on<00:03:15.930> my<00:03:16.049> team<00:03:16.319> so<00:03:16.590> he<00:03:17.489> goes<00:03:17.669> into<00:03:17.849> the<00:03:18.000> slow

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
job on my team so he goes into the slow

that's not too bad unless I get

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
paralyzed on my because I do carry

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.580 
paralyzed on my because I do carry
extreme<00:03:35.730> speed<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.419> that<00:03:36.900> actually<00:03:37.290> negates

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
extreme speed so that actually negates

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.220 
extreme speed so that actually negates
the<00:03:38.060> moving<00:03:39.060> really<00:03:39.209> slow<00:03:39.540> unless<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.139> get

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
the moving really slow unless I get

the moving really slow unless I get
paralyzed<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:40.889> course<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:41.819> I<00:03:41.849> get<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.299> extreme

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
paralyzed of course so I get the extreme

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.300 
paralyzed of course so I get the extreme
speed<00:03:42.840> off<00:03:42.989> which<00:03:43.139> was<00:03:43.290> really<00:03:43.560> really<00:03:43.650> good

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
speed off which was really really good

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.259 
speed off which was really really good
cuz<00:03:44.879> that<00:03:45.000> is<00:03:45.150> step<00:03:45.419> plus<00:03:45.959> two<00:03:47.000> excuse<00:03:48.000> me

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269

Power<00:05:03.490> Rangers<00:05:03.910> reference<00:05:04.300> I'm<00:05:04.449> pretty<00:05:04.660> sure

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
Power Rangers reference I'm pretty sure

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.629

so I go for the Esper here stab
so<00:05:09.639> rather<00:05:09.850> almost<00:05:10.630> chose<00:05:10.900> stab<00:05:11.169> as<00:05:11.380> well<00:05:11.620> and

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
so rather almost chose stab as well and

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.070 
so rather almost chose stab as well and
