definitely definitely for a fact assault
rifle<00:02:00.380> it's<00:02:01.380> more<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.680> an<00:02:01.770> assault<00:02:01.979> rifle

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100

x<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.100> probably<00:02:05.490> one<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.329> better<00:02:06.960> guns<00:02:07.290> in

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
x is probably one of the better guns in

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.059 
x is probably one of the better guns in
the<00:02:07.590> game<00:02:07.829> being<00:02:08.520> an<00:02:08.700> SMG<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:10.440> other<00:02:10.590> SNGs

the game being an SMG the other SNGs

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.740 
the game being an SMG the other SNGs
really<00:02:11.370> aren't<00:02:11.640> too<00:02:11.790> powerful<00:02:12.360> at<00:02:12.480> because

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
really aren't too powerful at because

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.980 
really aren't too powerful at because
they

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
they

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.400 
they
they<00:02:13.230> can't<00:02:13.470> kill<00:02:13.740> at<00:02:13.890> longer<00:02:14.250> ranges<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.410> it

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
they can't kill at longer ranges and it

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.500 
they can't kill at longer ranges and it
kind<00:02:16.710> of<00:02:16.770> sucks<00:02:17.100> but<00:02:17.430> it's<00:02:17.730> just<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:17.940> way<00:02:18.120> the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
kind of sucks but it's just the way the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.510 
kind of sucks but it's just the way the
game<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.720> with<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.740> maps<00:02:19.920> being<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.220> little<00:02:20.370> bit

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
game is with the maps being a little bit

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.070 
game is with the maps being a little bit
bigger<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.970> need<00:02:21.120> those<00:02:21.300> guns<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:22.020> are

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
bigger you need those guns that are

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.570 
bigger you need those guns that are
going<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.560> be<00:02:22.650> able<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.920> kill<00:02:23.190> at<00:02:23.430> those

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
going to be able to kill at those

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.480 
going to be able to kill at those
further<00:02:23.880> distances<00:02:24.870> but<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> mtar<00:02:25.710> x<00:02:25.950> it's

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
further distances but the mtar x it's

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.040 
further distances but the mtar x it's
kind<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.790> like<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:26.970> two-in-one<00:02:27.360> it's<00:02:27.660> an<00:02:27.750> SMG

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
kind of like a two-in-one it's an SMG

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.090 
kind of like a two-in-one it's an SMG
but<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.950> can<00:02:29.190> kill<00:02:29.610> at<00:02:29.880> ranges<00:02:30.360> close<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.590> that

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
but it can kill at ranges close to that

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.940 
but it can kill at ranges close to that
assault<00:02:32.520> rifles<00:02:32.820> can<00:02:33.030> kill<00:02:33.180> s<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:33.620> it's<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.770> good

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
assault rifles can kill s so it's a good

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.040 
assault rifles can kill s so it's a good
gun<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.430> don't<00:02:35.910> want<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.090> say<00:02:36.270> go<00:02:36.630> use<00:02:36.870> it

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
multiple guns so I would recommend using

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.130 
multiple guns so I would recommend using
guns<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.830> aren't<00:02:56.220> as<00:02:56.340> powerful<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.450> make

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
guns that aren't as powerful to make

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.960 
guns that aren't as powerful to make
yourself<00:02:58.740> a<00:02:58.860> better<00:02:58.890> player<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.490> get<00:02:59.640> that<00:02:59.760> gun

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
yourself a better player to get that gun

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.480 
yourself a better player to get that gun
skill<00:03:00.270> a<00:03:00.480> little<00:03:01.260> bit<00:03:01.380> better<00:03:01.470> use<00:03:02.070> guns<00:03:02.310> like

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
skill a little bit better use guns like

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.940 
skill a little bit better use guns like
the<00:03:02.610> ARX<00:03:03.210> use<00:03:03.750> guns<00:03:04.080> like<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:07.020> Bison<00:03:07.590> as<00:03:07.830> an

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
the ARX use guns like the Bison as an

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.760 
the ARX use guns like the Bison as an
SMG<00:03:08.310> use<00:03:09.120> guns<00:03:09.390> that<00:03:09.630> aren't<00:03:10.080> necessarily<00:03:10.110> the

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
SMG use guns that aren't necessarily the

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.400 
SMG use guns that aren't necessarily the
best<00:03:11.100> like<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.910> fat<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.390> very<00:03:12.690> very<00:03:12.930> good<00:03:13.170> but

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
best like the fat is very very good but

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.990 
best like the fat is very very good but
it's<00:03:13.530> not<00:03:13.800> it's<00:03:14.130> definitely<00:03:14.580> not<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.820> best

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
it's not it's definitely not the best

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.300 
it's not it's definitely not the best
gun<00:03:15.210> in<00:03:15.240> the<00:03:15.360> game<00:03:15.480> use<00:03:15.750> guns<00:03:15.960> like<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.350> just
