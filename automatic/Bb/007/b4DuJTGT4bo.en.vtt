use nice and light you know when you're
fishing<00:00:42.789> floats<00:00:43.789> Wagler<00:00:44.270> stick<00:00:44.719> boats<00:00:44.960> you

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
fishing floats Wagler stick boats you

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.740 
fishing floats Wagler stick boats you
can<00:00:45.530> mend<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:45.800> line<00:00:45.980> quickly<00:00:46.280> as<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:47.480> rods

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
can mend the line quickly as the rods

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.569 
can mend the line quickly as the rods
are<00:00:47.899> very<00:00:48.050> responsive<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:48.890> they<00:00:49.250> recover

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
are very responsive and they recover

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.240 
are very responsive and they recover
well<00:00:49.960> when<00:00:50.960> you<00:00:51.050> hook<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:51.230> fish<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:51.710> that's<00:00:52.100> when

well when you hook a fish so that's when

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.610 
well when you hook a fish so that's when
you<00:00:52.370> really<00:00:52.640> feel<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:52.969> power<00:00:53.320> but<00:00:54.320> it's<00:00:54.440> not

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
you really feel the power but it's not

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.009 
you really feel the power but it's not
polka<00:00:54.859> stick<00:00:55.250> it's<00:00:55.640> got<00:00:55.850> a<00:00:56.090> forgiving<00:00:56.629> action

fishing where you need a little bit bit
more<00:01:22.070> softness<00:01:22.520> so<00:01:22.670> you're<00:01:22.790> not<00:01:22.880> pulling

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
more softness so you're not pulling
