00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.530
 to be efficient the software does not 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.290
 the ease of use must be complex 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.389
 and the new parameter for efficiency in 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.720
 future the best user interface 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.080
 will not be of him will remain in the background and 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.910
 not in the foreground the result will be a 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.220
 perfectly natural way of working 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.870
 and an exceptional system of 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.870
 communication of their ideas 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.850
 this time not for an architect 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.949
 biggest challenge in the realization of 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.230
 a project and never lose sight of 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:49.909
 the basic vision during development 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.650
 of the project the sun at the planet ci 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:54.140
 accompanies all phases of the 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.739
 planning and in all the services of the 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.739
 study of architecture 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.230
 when I 'm entrusting the hd project 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.730
 I immediately knew it was a 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.860
 complex geometry 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.270
 we were aware that we would not have 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.970
 could design in a manner 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.390
 traditional we would have committed too many 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.050
 mistakes 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.880
 so yes we will do it in 3d 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.710
 I think it was a huge success 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.390
 that the 220 230 prefabricated elements 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.030
 arrived at the construction site without errors 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.200
 in the building site a really has been created 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.790
 nice atmosphere 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.150
 because no errors have emerged in the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.150
 mounting 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.069
 d6 stian for one nantes and needs 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.290
 everyday architecture grows 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.390
 materials are constantly produced 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.930
 different etc. 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.060
 a lack of interest in this sector 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.220
 software also evolved for us 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.590
 it would be very important and we would be 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.590
 well happy manual or even for the future 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.250
 the milanello wines usual singh 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.200
 I am convinced that within three years at 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.930
 maximum in all disciplines yes 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.090
 will work only in 3d I hope in i 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.170
 next two or three years will be many 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.170
 to use to the clan
