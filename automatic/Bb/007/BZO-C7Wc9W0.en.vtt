00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
of these three things that we're gonna

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.710 
of these three things that we're gonna
go<00:00:29.310> over<00:00:29.580> I'm<00:00:30.029> going<00:00:30.269> to<00:00:30.390> start<00:00:30.599> by<00:00:30.689> outlining

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
go over I'm going to start by outlining

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.690 
go over I'm going to start by outlining
mistakes<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:31.740> explaining<00:00:32.219> what<00:00:32.399> they<00:00:32.550> are

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
mistakes and explaining what they are

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.250 
mistakes and explaining what they are
and<00:00:33.300> then<00:00:33.510> providing<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.960> with<00:00:33.989> some

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
and then providing you with some

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.130 
and then providing you with some
knowledge<00:00:34.410> about<00:00:34.559> how<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.890> fix<00:00:35.130> each<00:00:35.370> mistake

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
knowledge about how to fix each mistake

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.780 
knowledge about how to fix each mistake
let's<00:00:37.140> start<00:00:37.410> off<00:00:37.500> with<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.770> csing<00:00:38.219> because

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
let's start off with the csing because

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.400 
let's start off with the csing because
you<00:00:38.910> often<00:00:39.210> associate<00:00:39.660> mechanics<00:00:40.200> with

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
you often associate mechanics with

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.229 
you often associate mechanics with
farming<00:00:40.860> there<00:00:41.670> are<00:00:41.790> three<00:00:41.910> different<00:00:42.149> ways

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
farming there are three different ways

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.479 
farming there are three different ways
you<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.480> potentially<00:00:42.870> miss<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> CS<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:44.340> can

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
you can potentially miss a CS you can

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.369 
you can potentially miss a CS you can
sliver<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.910> menu<00:00:45.149> meeting<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.930> as<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> sliver

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
sliver the menu meeting it as a sliver

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.080 
sliver the menu meeting it as a sliver
of<00:00:46.500> Health<00:00:46.739> left<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.129> few<00:00:47.190> Auto<00:00:47.550> tag<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.969> and

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
of Health left a few Auto tag it and

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.180 
of Health left a few Auto tag it and
then<00:00:48.420> another<00:00:48.660> creep<00:00:48.899> takes<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.980> can<00:00:50.129> do

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
then another creep takes it you can do

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.040 
then another creep takes it you can do
the<00:00:50.309> opposite<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.789> late<00:00:51.030> hit<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> minyan<00:00:51.629> where

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
the opposite and late hit a minyan where

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.170 
the opposite and late hit a minyan where
your<00:00:52.170> auto<00:00:52.350> attack<00:00:52.649> animation<00:00:53.160> starts<00:00:53.520> but

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
your auto attack animation starts but

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.810 
your auto attack animation starts but
your<00:00:54.300> allied<00:00:54.629> creeps<00:00:54.809> exit<00:00:55.320> first<00:00:55.469> and

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
your allied creeps exit first and

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.650 
your allied creeps exit first and
finally<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:57.000> lose<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> minion<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.629> a

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
finally you can lose a minion to a

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.810 
finally you can lose a minion to a
splitter<00:00:58.140> what<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.160> means<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.520> two

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
splitter what this means is that two

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.099 
splitter what this means is that two
allied<00:01:00.210> minions<00:01:00.359> are<00:01:00.570> dying<00:01:00.750> at<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> same

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
allied minions are dying at the same

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.840 
allied minions are dying at the same
time<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> choice<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.520> which<00:01:02.789> one

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
time and you have a choice of which one

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.759 
time and you have a choice of which one
to<00:01:03.120> Auto<00:01:03.320> you<00:01:04.320> would<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.650> use<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
to Auto you would have to use the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.490 
to Auto you would have to use the
ability<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.489> take<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.820> other<00:01:05.939> day<00:01:06.439> now<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
ability to take the other day now the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.020 
ability to take the other day now the
solution<00:01:07.890> for<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.250> fairly<00:01:08.430> simple<00:01:08.670> you

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
solution for this is fairly simple you

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.359 
solution for this is fairly simple you
want<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.080> watch<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.350> projectiles<00:01:10.890> with<00:01:11.100> enemy

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
want to watch the projectiles with enemy

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.440 
want to watch the projectiles with enemy
Canada<00:01:11.760> minions<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.630> caster<00:01:13.020> minions<00:01:14.450> if

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
Canada minions and the caster minions if

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.520 
Canada minions and the caster minions if
you're<00:01:15.600> going<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.840> lose<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> minion<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.409> lay

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
you're going to lose a minion and lay

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.320 
you're going to lose a minion and lay
something<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.430> your<00:01:17.520> team<00:01:17.729> probably<00:01:17.939> stole<00:01:18.299> it

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
something on your team probably stole it

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.149 
something on your team probably stole it
from<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.869> most<00:01:19.350> likely<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:20.009> was<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
from you and most likely it was the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.640 
from you and most likely it was the
higher<00:01:20.490> damage<00:01:20.759> caster<00:01:21.330> minion<00:01:21.600> that's<00:01:22.500> what

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
higher damage caster minion that's what

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.100 
higher damage caster minion that's what
you're<00:01:22.770> competing<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:24.020> fortunately<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
you're competing with fortunately the

you're competing with fortunately the

projectors are visible and are
relatively<00:01:26.820> slow<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:28.020> see<00:01:28.229> them<00:01:28.380> coming

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590
