00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 yes indeed but we are leaving 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.580
 in short, from the young and to build 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.429
 let's say a new political project that 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.049
 somehow sees people together who 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.240
 they come from different political backgrounds 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.440
 who managed to involve so many 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.750
 many young professionals 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.689
 entrepreneurs in support of ours 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.990
 design and understand how in some way 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.660
 put this thing together 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.060
 somehow made us 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.680
 we used important resources 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.419
 because just one thing to do a 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.550
 campaign by tips were things to create 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.940
 an apparatus a structure that must 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.900
 to support the candidacy of one 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.489
 person in short that is a candidate to 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.410
 become mayor of the city 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.059
 we believe in this project because 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.650
 we consider it an important project a 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.330
 free project of people who do not 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.860
 they look at the logic of the parties 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.210
 traditional and that you want 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.510
 bet with absolute freedom 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.750
 absolute enthusiasm to change a little 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.640
 the things that are not going in this city on 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.960
 starting point is certainly a 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.460
 appearance and a critical spirit in 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.750
 against what was up to 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.159
 this moment 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.680
 let's say the administration passed 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.409
 I say he did good things because 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.180
 when you're working it's not all to be thrown away 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.549
 indeed there are also things 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.920
 that must absolutely be changed e 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.180
 improve and we have a relationship between 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.979
 quotation marks backwards of this 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.320
 design the best that the administration 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.540
 outgoing expressed in terms of work 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.320
 in terms of commitment and therefore us 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.180
 we share 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.950
 let's start from this we have people 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.509
 authoritative who support us and who have 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.549
 demonstrated their little ones of 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.259
 being able to truly represent the best 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.000
 of these cities then I say is true 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.710
 in political action all is not well 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.149
 there are so many things to change 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.170
 in this sense we have had a 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.090
 a clear role an opposition role 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.789
 to the administration we claim 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.549
 with absolute pride we never have 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.350
 in short, changes of jacket during 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.999
 these five years for which we start from 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.310
 this to build a new project 

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:54.200
 that can really see us as protagonists 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.369
 of a better future for this 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.979
 community I can call again 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.450
 sciacca advisor and she and the 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.219
 Little councilor you have been the most 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.619
 voted for the last election you are still 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.240
 young and this means that she can 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.759
 still give so much for this city in 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.440
 terms of establishment 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.780
 surely this time of flight will be 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.340
 he this guy 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.530
 I want to underline it precisely because 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.610
 I campaign as mayor I say vi 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.560
 you are put together 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.780
 absolutely yes we had done 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.730
 politics at the time of high school in such a way 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.530
 also opposed today we join because 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.970
 I understand that in short, even young people 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.220
 busy pauly also engaged in 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.870
 policy can restart just one 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.220
 project 9 the rebirth of this 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.290
 community he will play an important role 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.630
 in short, the treasure was designated for 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.370
 which an important shoulder on which 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.319
 rest our project in short 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.690
 hoping that indeed the voters 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.430
 in short, they understand our commitment 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.890
 also to know the risk between 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.570
 quotation marks because they would not be at risk 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.860
 advisor would be that in the last 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.019
 period in short we have done some 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.450
 important choices also in terms 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.830
 electoral we have lost someone in 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.090
 some way it surely would 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.610
 represented an added value in 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.530
 electoral terms but they work 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.300
 in short, honesty of correctness 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.010
 we also have political renewal 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.680
 chosen somehow to go it alone 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.510
 follow our path and hope with them 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.950
 voters really understand this thing 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.690
 because a project made for that is 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.610
 honest honest and who really want 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.680
 commit and that they are committed 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.600
 especially during these five years 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.640
 even during the past few years 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.440
 in short, we have a long history that you 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.390
 you know and that people know for 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.900
 from which we will reverse for one 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.760
 best forget about this moment 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.030
 we have 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.950
 a role I recommend the position you 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.060
 as an adviser to the opposition I can 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.060
 say all citizens
