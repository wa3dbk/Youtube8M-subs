00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.529
 hello how about youtube friends it seems 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:09.299
 that there are people interested in knowing 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:12.219
 how is it that I wash with water the 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:17.470
 electronic cards when they are 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:19.030
 too dirty what at this moment 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.760
 I'm going to disconnect what is the source of 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.940
 feeding this TV and I'm going 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.800
 to wash to teach them 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:30.390
 always before disconnecting cables 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.230
 remember to mark the position 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.230
 how are they 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.339
 in this case I already have them marked 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.640
 now I'm going here to disconnect the pacifier 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.930
 Of course it is already downloaded 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.070
 discharge the voltage with a pair of tweezers 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.070
 long nose 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.759
 with long nose pliers simply 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.180
 to easily disconnect the pacifier is nothing 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:12.560
 more to put together and put together these insurances 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.570
 equally at the time of putting it then 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.430
 they just keep 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.430
 pressed and ready 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.909
 ah 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.130
 it will be necessary to remove from the card 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.460
 electronic cable because it does not 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:40.000
 has a way to disconnect more I have 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.050
 to break this cable that is here 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.970
 in the yoke 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.970
 already be then then the sun 2 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.869
 Y 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.740
 I had to remove from the card by 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.310
 Of course I have it marked to know 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.310
 how's it going 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.980
 here I already have 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.980
 the power supply 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.740
 I need a little cable 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.980
 and a cable is missing from which we are going to cut 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.590
 and then I'm going to show you how to wash 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.830
 an electronic card I will see if that 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.830
 mine 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.930
 and I already have the water hose what 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.810
 you have to do is open the hose 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.250
 water with the pressure you have 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.250
 and you just do that 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.160
 here we have already the card washed no longer 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.520
 more from putting it in the sun for three or 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.520
 four hours 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.710
 here we place him since he gets the sun from 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.910
 compared to 100% and in 34 hours is already 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.910
 ready to put it 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.910
 I'm going to install the source back here 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.950
 power of a television 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.250
 panasonic that as you already saw what 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.150
 I washed it is already dry before 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.150
 install it 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.900
 5 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.700
 or not 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:28.030
 I'm going to install to turn on the TV 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.800
 so they see that there is no problem 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.900
 because there are friends then here already install 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.350
 the electronic card that you like 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.760
 they saw the wash with hose with water and 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.270
 I have to connect the TV now I'm going 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.270
 to turn 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:59.199
 I do not know if you can see but here it is 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:02.250
 already the television because I have connected 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.250
 the cable and it is very short 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.800
 ah 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.270
 here we have working the television 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.780
 friends after having washed the 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.340
 card to see that it is not a trick 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.650
 that can be washed perfectly 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.630
 I have years doing this I also have 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.950
 an air compressor but I like it more 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.240
 wash them with water because they look good 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.240
 washed and is very clean if you're 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.430
 how can you watch the TV work 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.320
 perfectly after having washed the 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.320
 electronic card 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:52.590
 you have to be a music disc just 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.590
