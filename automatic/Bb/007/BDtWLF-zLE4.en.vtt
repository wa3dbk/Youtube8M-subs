showed us how to quickly change out the
spindles<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.880> wrought<00:02:22.120> iron<00:02:22.390> first<00:02:23.080> we're

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
spindles to wrought iron first we're

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.410 
spindles to wrought iron first we're
gonna<00:02:23.380> take<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.370> spindle<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:24.940> cut<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.239> at<00:02:25.390> the

gonna take the spindle and cut it at the
smallest<00:02:26.019> point<00:02:26.230> of<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.470> spindle<00:02:26.769> and<00:02:27.580> we're

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
smallest point of the spindle and we're

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.400 
smallest point of the spindle and we're
gonna<00:02:27.880> cut<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.480> three-quarters<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.290> way

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
gonna cut it three-quarters of the way

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.860 
gonna cut it three-quarters of the way
through<00:02:29.549> there<00:02:30.549> for<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.000> top<00:02:31.420> part<00:02:31.600> won't

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
through there for the top part won't

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.630 
through there for the top part won't
fall<00:02:32.110> out<00:02:32.290> if<00:02:32.440> it<00:02:32.560> wasn't<00:02:32.799> properly<00:02:33.130> nailed<00:02:33.400> on

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
fall out if it wasn't properly nailed on

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.820 
fall out if it wasn't properly nailed on
the<00:02:33.730> installation<00:02:34.000> or<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.480> first<00:02:34.690> time<00:02:34.870> then

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
the installation or the first time then

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.100 
the installation or the first time then
you<00:02:35.950> hold<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.310> at<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.459> cut<00:02:36.760> break<00:02:37.269> it<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.630> pull

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
you hold it at the cut break it and pull

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.210 
you hold it at the cut break it and pull
out<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.319> top<00:02:38.769> and<00:02:39.040> bottom<00:02:39.310> parts<00:02:40.980> next<00:02:41.980> you

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
out the top and bottom parts next you

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.870 
out the top and bottom parts next you
pull<00:02:42.430> out<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.700> nails<00:02:44.310> then<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.519> measure<00:02:45.730> the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
pull out the nails then you measure the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.970 
pull out the nails then you measure the
length<00:02:46.269> of<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.569> space<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.080> add<00:02:47.260> an<00:02:47.440> inch<00:02:47.680> to

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
length of the space and add an inch to

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.400 
length of the space and add an inch to
an<00:02:48.100> inch<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.489> quarter<00:02:48.930> then<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.080> cut<00:02:50.290> the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
an inch and a quarter then you cut the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.110 
an inch and a quarter then you cut the
wrought<00:02:50.620> iron<00:02:50.650> balusters<00:02:51.430> to<00:02:51.640> that<00:02:51.819> length

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
wrought iron balusters to that length

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:02.479 
wrought iron balusters to that length
order<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:52.900> make<00:02:53.140> it<00:02:53.170> 35<00:02:53.769> and<00:02:54.010> 3/8
