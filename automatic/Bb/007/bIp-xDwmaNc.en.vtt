00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.740
 Do not jog him why not synonymous Nordic now have this is the Friday 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.740
 Unna has to work very quietly last day 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:14.529
 then finally weekends 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.019
 I was my last outfit on CD I have to admit 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.599
 but that Anderson the area and the animals so OK 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:22.970
 Accreditations 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.970
 So I have a lot smaller open 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:29.939
 come to life 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.370
 and answers 1 1 and stuck there 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.600
 then I applied a little black natives 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.550
 very small 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.050
 swallowing our little ones 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.180
 bad at only yet he appreciates Latvia 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.180
 because the clash has been 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.440
 then I would be a black one 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.460
 Long-sleeve jacket 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.640
 why clock can take place 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.680
 on a gray percent 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.840
 around 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.780
 in the market 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.780
 so and now it starts 48 percent 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.520
 I have a brown t-shirt on 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.790
 Gallen 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.790
 France carries one needed 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.670
 Borken 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.670
 this opinion is t-shirt by Michael 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.400
 that left more behind SID now 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.030
 not to 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.370
 I guess 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.710
 suitable for this 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.710
 that means fit but that he also before 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.130
 a black pantyhose 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.480
 and why 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.550
 to have these 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.550
 because they do not fall 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.620
 so does eBay 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.530
 lie 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.680
 we are looking for 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.680
 and then we can say concretely 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.340
 Pope Benedict XVI 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.630
 wants to create the ticket revenue 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.419

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:11.359

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:14.389
 I wish you just got a really great last 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:15.479
 Guilt was 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:16.739
 working day 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.959
