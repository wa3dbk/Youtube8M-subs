00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
so tell me a little bit more about the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.680 
so tell me a little bit more about the
bike<00:00:31.739> what's<00:00:32.130> what's<00:00:32.669> special<00:00:32.970> about<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.420> and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
bike what's what's special about it and

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.150 
bike what's what's special about it and
if<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:33.989> could<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.140> take<00:00:34.649> off<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> few<00:00:35.130> things

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
if you could just take off a few things

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.250 
if you could just take off a few things
the<00:00:36.060> the<00:00:36.329> goal<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.960> competition

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
the the goal of the competition

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.850 
the the goal of the competition
originally<00:00:38.010> was<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.640> redesign<00:00:39.060> or<00:00:39.830> design<00:00:40.830> a

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
originally was to redesign or design a

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.290 
originally was to redesign or design a
bike<00:00:41.540> for<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.810> the<00:00:43.140> modern<00:00:43.440> urban<00:00:43.560> landscape

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
bike for the the modern urban landscape

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.860 
bike for the the modern urban landscape
our<00:00:45.300> approach<00:00:45.690> was<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.110> try<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.560> make<00:00:46.950> a

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
our approach was to try to make a

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.910 
our approach was to try to make a
experience<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.050> gets<00:00:49.230> people<00:00:49.530> out<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.740> cars

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
experience that gets people out of cars

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.600 
experience that gets people out of cars
and<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> bikes<00:00:50.580> and<00:00:51.740> so<00:00:52.740> we<00:00:53.130> tried<00:00:53.400> to<00:00:53.490> do

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
and on the bikes and so we tried to do

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.090 
and on the bikes and so we tried to do
is<00:00:53.760> mirror<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.240> lot<00:00:54.630> of<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.050> experience<00:00:55.710> that

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
is mirror a lot of the experience that

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.480 
is mirror a lot of the experience that
people<00:00:56.310> would<00:00:56.490> normally<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:56.970> in<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.150> car<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:59.460> a

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
people would normally have in a car to a

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.330 
people would normally have in a car to a
bike<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.780> what<00:01:01.380> are<00:01:01.500> some<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.890> design

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
bike and what are some of the design

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.670 
bike and what are some of the design
factors<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.120> included<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.750> do<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.049> so

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
factors that you included to do that so

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.560 
factors that you included to do that so
it<00:01:04.799> included<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.430> lot<00:01:05.579> of<00:01:05.700> automatic<00:01:06.090> features

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
it included a lot of automatic features

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.840 
it included a lot of automatic features
like<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> power<00:01:07.290> assist<00:01:07.470> functions<00:01:08.220> automatic

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
like a power assist functions automatic

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.930 
like a power assist functions automatic
transmission<00:01:09.600> automatic<00:01:09.930> lights<00:01:10.940> and

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
transmission automatic lights and

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.480 
transmission automatic lights and
integrated<00:01:12.630> locking<00:01:12.870> solutions<00:01:13.560> we're

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
integrated locking solutions we're

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.180 
integrated locking solutions we're
trying<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.790> make<00:01:14.909> sure<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.440> the<00:01:16.440> bike<00:01:16.680> feels

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
trying to make sure that the bike feels

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.540 
trying to make sure that the bike feels
like<00:01:17.610> something<00:01:18.120> that<00:01:18.260> it's<00:01:19.260> secured<00:01:19.800> it's

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
like something that it's secured it's

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.120 
like something that it's secured it's
safe<00:01:20.760> to<00:01:20.909> ride<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.200> provides<00:01:22.800> enough

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
safe to ride and it provides enough

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.770 
safe to ride and it provides enough
conveniences<00:01:23.820> where<00:01:24.000> people<00:01:24.360> are<00:01:24.479> going<00:01:24.690> to

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
conveniences where people are going to

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.820 
conveniences where people are going to
choose<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.170> over

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
choose it over

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.540 
choose it over
perhaps<00:01:26.250> commuting<00:01:26.640> by<00:01:26.790> car<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:28.100> okay<00:01:29.100> tell

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
perhaps commuting by car and okay tell

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.010 
perhaps commuting by car and okay tell
me<00:01:29.580> about<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.880> brain<00:01:30.150> what's<00:01:30.479> what's<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
me about the brain what's what's the

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.289 
me about the brain what's what's the
brain<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.590> bike<00:01:31.800> got<00:01:31.830> going<00:01:32.280> on<00:01:32.370> so<00:01:33.150> we're

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
brain of this bike got going on so we're

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.219 
brain of this bike got going on so we're
currently<00:01:33.479> using<00:01:33.890> Intel's<00:01:34.890> Edison<00:01:36.229> micro

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
currently using Intel's Edison micro

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.870 
currently using Intel's Edison micro
controller<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.830> guess<00:01:38.070> we'd<00:01:38.250> call<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.580> micro

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
controller I guess we'd call it a micro

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.240 
controller I guess we'd call it a micro
controller<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.430> basically<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:43.250> you

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
controller and that is basically the you

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.740 
controller and that is basically the you
like<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.670> described<00:01:45.000> that's<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.390> brain<00:01:45.570> of

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
like you described that's the brain of

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.450 
like you described that's the brain of
the<00:01:45.840> bike<00:01:46.020> that's<00:01:46.320> controlling<00:01:46.740> all<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.280> our

a<00:02:16.340> brain<00:02:16.760> we<00:02:17.299> don't<00:02:17.510> have<00:02:17.659> a<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:18.200> know<00:02:18.319> you

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
a brain we don't have a you know you

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.199 
a brain we don't have a you know you
haven't<00:02:18.769> had<00:02:18.890> a<00:02:18.950> website<00:02:19.459> for<00:02:19.670> your<00:02:19.760> bike<00:02:19.970> and

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
haven't had a website for your bike and

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.300 
haven't had a website for your bike and
so<00:02:20.330> we<00:02:20.480> ask<00:02:20.659> ourselves<00:02:20.780> what<00:02:21.769> can<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:22.040> do<00:02:22.190> with

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
so we ask ourselves what can you do with

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.830 
so we ask ourselves what can you do with
the<00:02:22.400> website<00:02:22.790> when<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:22.970> have<00:02:23.209> for<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.420> bike<00:02:23.629> and

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
the website when you have for a bike and

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.720 
the website when you have for a bike and
you<00:02:23.930> can<00:02:24.080> look<00:02:24.230> at<00:02:24.470> any<00:02:24.860> of<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.220> data<00:02:25.430> logging

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
you can look at any of the data logging

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.940 
you can look at any of the data logging
any<00:02:26.360> of<00:02:26.599> where<00:02:26.810> you<00:02:26.959> are<00:02:27.140> you<00:02:27.440> can<00:02:27.620> remote

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
any of where you are you can remote

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.410 
any of where you are you can remote
unlock<00:02:28.400> or<00:02:28.610> lock<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:28.970> can<00:02:29.180> figure<00:02:29.360> out

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
unlock or lock it you can figure out

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.339 
unlock or lock it you can figure out
where<00:02:29.629> your<00:02:29.810> bike<00:02:30.019> is<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:31.370> bike<00:02:31.549> has<00:02:31.819> a

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
where your bike is the bike has a

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.780 
where your bike is the bike has a
bluetooth<00:02:33.349> lock<00:02:33.680> for<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.010> handlebar<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:34.489> so

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
bluetooth lock for the handlebar and so

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.190 
bluetooth lock for the handlebar and so
you<00:02:34.849> can<00:02:35.060> control<00:02:35.360> all<00:02:35.540> that<00:02:35.750> through<00:02:36.049> the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
you can control all that through the

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.539 
you can control all that through the
interface<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:36.890> that's<00:02:36.950> what<00:02:37.129> the<00:02:37.220> Edison

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
interface and that's what the Edison

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.640 
interface and that's what the Edison
actually<00:02:37.640> provides<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:41.060> run<00:02:41.810> me<00:02:41.959> down<00:02:41.989> the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
actually provides and run me down the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.449 
actually provides and run me down the
electric<00:02:43.579> assists<00:02:44.090> part<00:02:44.390> that<00:02:44.629> is<00:02:45.220> you've<00:02:46.220> got

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
electric assists part that is you've got

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.910 
electric assists part that is you've got
a<00:02:46.489> separate<00:02:47.000> battery<00:02:47.359> for<00:02:47.569> that<00:02:47.739> yes<00:02:48.739> so

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
a separate battery for that yes so

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.530 
a separate battery for that yes so
there's<00:02:49.099> two<00:02:49.340> main<00:02:49.370> power<00:02:49.790> systems<00:02:50.030> on<00:02:50.420> the

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
there's two main power systems on the

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.170 
there's two main power systems on the
bike<00:02:50.690> one<00:02:51.140> is<00:02:51.470> is<00:02:51.859> for<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.370> electric<00:02:52.849> assist

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
bike one is is for the electric assist

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.990 
bike one is is for the electric assist
that's<00:02:54.019> our<00:02:54.140> high<00:02:54.260> voltage<00:02:54.650> system<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:55.340> one

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
that's our high voltage system and one

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.910 
that's our high voltage system and one
is<00:02:56.150> our<00:02:56.269> low<00:02:56.450> voltage<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:57.109> that's<00:02:57.260> that's<00:02:57.709> for

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
is our low voltage and that's that's for

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.530 
is our low voltage and that's that's for
all<00:02:58.010> of<00:02:58.159> our<00:02:58.250> critical<00:02:58.700> systems<00:02:59.120> including

system is always active you don't ever

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.490 
system is always active you don't ever
have<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.819> worry<00:03:11.000> about<00:03:11.120> any<00:03:11.989> kind<00:03:12.290> of<00:03:12.349> a

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
have to worry about any kind of a

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.800 
have to worry about any kind of a
battery<00:03:12.829> recharge<00:03:13.430> for<00:03:13.700> that<00:03:13.849> the<00:03:14.599> big

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
battery recharge for that the big

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.479 
battery recharge for that the big
battery<00:03:15.139> though<00:03:15.349> we<00:03:15.530> can't<00:03:15.739> recharge<00:03:16.099> off<00:03:16.340> of

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
battery though we can't recharge off of

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.420 
battery though we can't recharge off of
that<00:03:16.609> system<00:03:16.880> so<00:03:17.269> that<00:03:17.419> is<00:03:17.599> better<00:03:18.430> battery

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
that system so that is better battery

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.599 
that system so that is better battery
packs<00:03:19.700> that<00:03:20.169> get<00:03:21.169> you<00:03:21.319> about<00:03:21.500> 25<00:03:22.040> minutes<00:03:22.280> of

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
packs that get you about 25 minutes of

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.750 
packs that get you about 25 minutes of
active<00:03:23.090> runtime<00:03:24.160> which<00:03:25.160> is<00:03:25.340> enough<00:03:25.549> to<00:03:25.669> get

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
active runtime which is enough to get

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.099 
active runtime which is enough to get
you<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:25.940> work<00:03:26.750> on<00:03:27.470> an<00:03:27.680> average<00:03:27.799> day<00:03:28.959> so<00:03:29.959> that

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
you to work on an average day so that

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.080 
you to work on an average day so that
part<00:03:30.319> is<00:03:30.410> separate<00:03:30.829> but<00:03:31.040> we<00:03:31.190> do<00:03:31.310> provide<00:03:31.609> a

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
part is separate but we do provide a

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.030 
part is separate but we do provide a
removable<00:03:32.720> battery<00:03:33.019> pack<00:03:33.379> so<00:03:33.590> that<00:03:33.769> you<00:03:33.859> can

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
removable battery pack so that you can

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.159 
removable battery pack so that you can
take<00:03:34.220> that<00:03:34.280> in<00:03:34.669> to<00:03:35.269> your<00:03:35.299> home<00:03:35.569> or<00:03:35.780> your<00:03:35.989> office

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.169 
take that in to your home or your office

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:37.809 
take that in to your home or your office
and<00:03:36.560> charge<00:03:36.799> it<00:03:36.949> there<00:03:37.129> while<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.400> bike<00:03:37.549> stays

new Auto shifting eAssist hub and so

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.809 
new Auto shifting eAssist hub and so
originally<00:03:45.949> part<00:03:46.160> of<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.250> competition<00:03:46.489> we

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
originally part of the competition we

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.080 
originally part of the competition we
had<00:03:47.000> an<00:03:47.540> e<00:03:47.750> assist<00:03:48.109> hub<00:03:48.349> and<00:03:48.650> we<00:03:48.739> had<00:03:48.919> a<00:03:49.090> the

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
had an e assist hub and we had a the

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.509 
had an e assist hub and we had a the
auto<00:03:50.269> shifting<00:03:50.810> hub<00:03:51.099> sort<00:03:52.099> of<00:03:52.190> two<00:03:52.310> different

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
auto shifting hub sort of two different

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.189 
auto shifting hub sort of two different
ones<00:03:52.639> and<00:03:52.910> we've<00:03:53.030> been<00:03:53.359> working<00:03:53.569> with<00:03:53.629> ceramic

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
ones and we've been working with ceramic

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.650 
ones and we've been working with ceramic
in<00:03:54.739> their<00:03:55.340> combine<00:03:55.730> one<00:03:55.970> which<00:03:56.150> has<00:03:56.329> a<00:03:56.359> torque

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
in their combine one which has a torque

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.080 
in their combine one which has a torque
sensor<00:03:57.049> inside<00:03:57.410> so<00:03:57.709> as<00:03:57.829> you<00:03:58.010> start<00:03:58.699> pedaling<00:03:58.849> a

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
sensor inside so as you start pedaling a

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.759 
sensor inside so as you start pedaling a
little<00:03:59.269> hard<00:03:59.510> automatically<00:04:00.079> down<00:04:00.290> shifts

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
little hard automatically down shifts

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.860 
little hard automatically down shifts
kicks<00:04:01.400> in<00:04:01.579> the<00:04:01.669> ear<00:04:01.819> system<00:04:02.359> so<00:04:02.449> you<00:04:02.540> actually

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
kicks in the ear system so you actually

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.380

have<00:04:03.049> that<00:04:03.230> power<00:04:03.500> when<00:04:03.680> you<00:04:03.799> need<00:04:03.949> it

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
have that power when you need it

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.710 
have that power when you need it
and<00:04:05.050> I<00:04:05.890> understand<00:04:06.460> you<00:04:06.640> use<00:04:06.880> some<00:04:07.300> 3d

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
and I understand you use some 3d

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
printing in this project too could you

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.580 
printing in this project too could you
tell<00:04:09.610> me<00:04:09.700> how<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:10.390> where<00:04:10.540> yes<00:04:11.140> so<00:04:11.410> the

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
tell me how and where yes so the

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.400 
tell me how and where yes so the
original<00:04:12.340> prototype<00:04:12.700> we<00:04:13.420> used<00:04:13.600> a<00:04:13.780> number<00:04:14.320> of

something<00:04:43.060> that<00:04:43.180> we<00:04:43.300> didn't<00:04:43.510> have<00:04:43.630> access<00:04:43.780> to

something that we didn't have access to
for<00:04:44.290> building<00:04:44.590> the<00:04:44.680> bike<00:04:44.830> we<00:04:45.460> were<00:04:45.520> able<00:04:45.669> to<00:04:45.850> 3d

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
for building the bike we were able to 3d

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.300 
for building the bike we were able to 3d
print<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:46.540> parts<00:04:46.810> and<00:04:46.960> then<00:04:47.050> weld<00:04:47.380> up<00:04:47.620> sort<00:04:48.220> of

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
print the parts and then weld up sort of

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.550 
print the parts and then weld up sort of
stock<00:04:48.580> tubing<00:04:49.060> to<00:04:49.810> that<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:50.169> so<00:04:50.260> working<00:04:50.440> with

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
stock tubing to that and so working with
