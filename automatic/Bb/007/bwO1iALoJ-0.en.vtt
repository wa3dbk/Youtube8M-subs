00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 on one hand skiing 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.680
 lesson number three basic movements there 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.660
 a few basic steps that you 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.550
 will need to be overcome before 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:21.270
 you can go to skating for more 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:23.510
 steep slopes this difficult terrain is sharp 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.510
 turns 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.740
 and movement on virgin soil 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:52.870
 the most important movements are movement on 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.870
 cante and up and down 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:05.180
 major movements during a sharp 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:07.040
 quick turn to make 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.350
 such a turn you need to move 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.330
 side to side such movements 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.729
 make skis move at the ends 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.740
 so skis go in fast 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:21.080
 twist your knees slightly bent 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.860
 move in the direction in which you 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.860
 want to turn 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.280
 mastering this technique you can 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.800
 get much more pleasure from 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.690
 quick turns then tilt all 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.040
 body in the same direction with which 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.040
 move your legs 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.090
 an up and down motion helps to pass 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.090
 turns more clearly 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:03.280
 as moving up and down 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.209
 you load your skis more during 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.099
 turning tilt your knees 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.910
 in order to make a move 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.830
 up and down start turning at the top 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.129
 the position of the knee in this case 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.959
 ski load will be less 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.450
 when you do turn in you should 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.700
 start downhill skiing 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.920
 this movement helps you effectively 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.260
 complete the turn the more you 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.250
 load skis in a turn so he will 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.250
 more cool 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:45.550
 one more trick rhythmic descent he 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.550
 helps to save your energy 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.100
 no need to overload as much as above 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.650
 it makes it a skier so you spend 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:01.620
 a lot of power on turns and skating 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:04.140
 you quickly ask, be alert before 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.550
 start turning where is he 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.590
 only when you start 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.800
 turn you can start them 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.060
 loaded just so you get 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.270
 perfect turn with the right 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.270
 trajectories 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.740
 try to connect together right away 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.750
 several turns 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.800
 as soon as the first turn is completed 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.600
 start next if your skis will 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.520
 move naturally you will 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.810
 turn out in a more elegant and 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.810
 effective skating 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.070
 also you must learn correctly 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.080
 behave in the face of change 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.420
 directions and speed by changing 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.740
 your body positions if you move 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.420
 at high speed 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.610
 you must keep correct 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.260
 the distance between the skis and the correct 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.260
 lower body position 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.790
 if you are on sections of the slope with 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.129
 Difficult relief try save 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:18.259
 constant contact with the slope of the moving 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:21.090
 up and down and skirting all the snowdrifts and hollows 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:23.660
 on virgin soil try to save conditionally 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.660
 slow pace 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:28.889
 if at the same time you will try 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.000
 keep you together you will not be much 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.000
 dive into the snow
