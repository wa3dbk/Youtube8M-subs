00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
the first thing we got in here is the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.009 
the first thing we got in here is the
1800<00:00:39.350> kV<00:00:39.710> motor<00:00:40.000> it's<00:00:41.000> pretty<00:00:41.300> good<00:00:41.510> just<00:00:41.780> gets

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:42.019 
1800 kV motor it's pretty good just gets

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.500 
1800 kV motor it's pretty good just gets
hot<00:00:42.730> here's<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:43.879> 50<00:00:44.239> amp<00:00:44.420> controller<00:00:45.050> and

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
hot here's the 50 amp controller and

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.220 
hot here's the 50 amp controller and
then<00:00:47.510> we<00:00:48.469> here's<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:48.980> water<00:00:49.429> cooling<00:00:50.030> system

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
then we here's the water cooling system

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.099 
then we here's the water cooling system
so<00:00:51.230> it<00:00:52.129> actually<00:00:52.309> sucks<00:00:53.030> it<00:00:53.239> up<00:00:53.359> right<00:00:53.870> through

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
so it actually sucks it up right through

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.650 
so it actually sucks it up right through
here<00:00:54.640> like<00:00:55.640> this<00:00:55.940> little<00:00:56.210> black<00:00:56.390> thing<00:00:56.629> right

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
here like this little black thing right

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.979 
here like this little black thing right
here<00:00:57.010> sexed<00:00:58.010> it<00:00:58.070> up<00:00:58.190> goes<00:00:59.120> through<00:00:59.420> it<00:00:59.600> goes

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
here sexed it up goes through it goes

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.680 
here sexed it up goes through it goes
through<00:01:00.230> everything<00:01:00.940> cools<00:01:01.940> everything<00:01:02.449> down

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
through everything cools everything down

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.499 
through everything cools everything down
and<00:01:03.019> then<00:01:03.079> actually<00:01:03.980> sucks<00:01:04.400> it<00:01:04.610> out<00:01:04.759> through

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
and then actually sucks it out through

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.420 
and then actually sucks it out through
right<00:01:05.689> there<00:01:05.720> or<00:01:06.439> shoots<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:07.009> out<00:01:07.130> through<00:01:07.369> it

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
right there or shoots it out through it

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.600 
right there or shoots it out through it
they're<00:01:09.549> got<00:01:10.549> this<00:01:10.700> cool<00:01:10.970> water<00:01:11.450> sealed<00:01:11.990> box

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
they're got this cool water sealed box

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
whenever you're done that could be a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.690
