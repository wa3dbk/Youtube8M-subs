00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.830
 to querrien on the family farm 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.660
 eric vallégant has 200 sows 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.920
 fattener breeder to be in 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.990
 compliance with the standards 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.340
 animal wellbeing 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.449
 the farmer rehabilitated part 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.100
 of buildings she built a 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.080
 new that will welcome a thousand of 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.330
 pork commissioned just ago 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.130
 two months the building has a module 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.280
 scraping pig effluent ago 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.960
 therefore under the gratings of the modules 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:38.450
 precast concrete and who are fit 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.130
 v of which there is a slope at the bottom 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.090
 so at the bottom of the module there is a gutter 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.650
 who gets the urine and on the module 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.710
 pass a scraper 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.570
 made of stainless steel which is towed by engines 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.730
 electrical and cable thanks to this 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.040
 practiced system what is called the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.140
 direct phase separation that is to say 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.710
 than 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.520
 we put 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.520
 on the one hand 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.520
 liquid effluents and effluents 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.860
 solids are 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:13.390
 transferred to the end of the building 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:23.230
 in a shed that will serve as a zone of 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:25.090
 composting a ramp to climb to 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.240
 the end of the individual contractors that allows 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:33.420
 to make a base in the in the 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:37.439
 corner of the shed and one adjoins to 7 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.080
 evacuator one will run straw which is 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.070
 automated with the operation of the 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.560
 the evacuator which allows 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:51.119
 to introduce the straw right away 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.090
 in the in the first is to have a 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.780
 structured product of 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.470
 departure since for them 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:04.450
 make compost once a product 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:10.060
 which contains 3 4% straw so as to 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:12.220
 wander well fermented way to 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.840
 value this compost comparable to 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.660
 compost distributed in garden centers 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.130
 will then be sold sensitize to 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.290
 animal welfare and savings 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.850
 of energy eric vallégant installed in 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.920
 one of his buildings two interchanges 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.810
 thermal a facility set in 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.590
 place after the isolation of the entire 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.720
 roof of the building 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.489
 this breakdown is comparable to a 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.090
 vmc double stream in a house 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.000
 individual 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.350
 we considered that we could still 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.820
 make improvements on it 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:46.819
 so installing his two collectors 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:50.329
 of heat whose role is to 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.280
 on the one hand to extract air 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:03:00.040
 stale of the building since there are two 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:02.180
 fans in the device and also 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.950
 recover calories in the air 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.530
 outgoing to reintroduce them into the 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.450
 in the building when the temperature 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.160
 fall below a certain threshold of 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.450
 blow the building is healthier and 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.150
 especially less humid 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.160
 I have drier soils 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.260
 it's more comfort for animals 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.770
 it's less lameness it's less 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:29.100
 infertility is an improvement 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.100
 general performance and then also 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.620
 less food consumption since 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.060
 the temperature is better controlled on 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.340
 improves consumption index of 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.780
 animals weight and the circle is virtuous 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.580
 these improvements increases the 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.380
 productivity of the farm 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.040
 will eventually produce five thousand five hundred 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.040
 for each year
