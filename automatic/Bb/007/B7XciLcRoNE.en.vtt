do you thing the thing with the heck I

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.220 
do you thing the thing with the heck I
might<00:02:16.100> I<00:02:16.190> want<00:02:16.340> region<00:02:17.000> code<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:17.960> I<00:02:18.170> don't

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
might I want region code and I don't

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.380 
might I want region code and I don't
want<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.500> press<00:02:18.800> okay<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:20.030> once<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.240> press

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
want to press okay so once you press

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.920 
want to press okay so once you press
okay

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
okay

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.590 
okay
both<00:02:21.290> of<00:02:21.530> these<00:02:21.620> are<00:02:21.890> not<00:02:22.250> encrypted<00:02:22.940> so

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
both of these are not encrypted so

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.300 
both of these are not encrypted so
basically<00:02:23.960> if<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.200> there<00:02:24.590> are<00:02:24.680> not<00:02:24.800> encrypted

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
basically if you there are not encrypted

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.040 
basically if you there are not encrypted
they<00:02:25.760> won't<00:02:25.940> really<00:02:26.150> be<00:02:26.450> recognized<00:02:26.840> by<00:02:26.990> the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
they won't really be recognized by the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.960 
they won't really be recognized by the
ps3<00:02:27.440> so<00:02:28.100> right<00:02:28.970> here<00:02:29.150> where<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:29.990> says<00:02:30.020> encrypt

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
ps3 so right here where it says encrypt

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.120 
ps3 so right here where it says encrypt
PFD<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.660> want<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:32.930> click<00:02:33.230> that<00:02:33.470> you<00:02:33.920> want<00:02:34.070> to

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
to keep the other version as well like

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.690 
to keep the other version as well like
us<00:02:39.170> or<00:02:39.380> EU<00:02:39.710> we<00:02:39.950> want<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.160> encrypt<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.580> one<00:02:40.700> too

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
us or EU we want to encrypt that one too

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.090 
us or EU we want to encrypt that one too
so<00:02:43.700> basically<00:02:44.210> that's<00:02:45.110> how<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:45.440> do<00:02:45.740> it<00:02:46.150> but<00:02:47.150> um

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
so basically that's how you do it but um

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.350 
so basically that's how you do it but um
so<00:02:49.100> I'll<00:02:49.190> also<00:02:49.370> show<00:02:49.730> you<00:02:49.790> how<00:02:49.970> to<00:02:50.120> actually

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
actually it works but I can't really

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.120 
actually it works but I can't really
show<00:02:56.510> you<00:02:56.540> if<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:56.960> EU<00:02:57.080> version<00:02:57.380> because<00:02:57.770> I<00:02:57.980> do
