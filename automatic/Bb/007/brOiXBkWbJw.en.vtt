00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:46.070
 okay is mathematics and cordial 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.170
 welcome to another on my 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.470
 channel the winter well you see a black 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.910
 ops creates two gameplay with the mk 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.470
 fast magazine then i still had 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:00.230
 doing c4 raider ability hardliner 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.450
 and left here bulletproof vest and 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.020
 the strings were drone control and 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.700
 orbital satellite yes the whole is here 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.450
 the fifth nuclear now I believe for 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.590
 the storm rifles class for that 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.509
 storm rifles nuclear series 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.850
 and yes, the whole thing became a multi team 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.009
 he plays with the deathmatch mode 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.719
 impact ex-partner and the infectious xj 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.189
 First of all thanks again to you that you 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:24.499
 let me then finally the kids left 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.329
 because then it was pretty close 

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:28.549
 but you have to say the funny kids around 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:31.549
 you definitely see very big 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.990
 class yes water is not here with so 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.310
 a good score for he has and 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.399
 As I said, I believe in this round 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.630
 is not shit 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.429
 yes I wanted you now first 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.659
 let me know , I 've been there recently 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.399
 this video is made for this voting 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.939
 with uncharted 3 if this continues 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.770
 should or should this be completely and 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.460
 yes there is now the majority for is 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.260
 keep going 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.290
 I will do that too 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:58.340
 I think tomorrow comes then comes 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.050
 a uncharted 3 commentary i have to 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.340
 Watch if I have gameplay then I will 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.930
 because maybe something to say that 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.400
 you can send me gameplay that will 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.330
 Although pretty tough because it will be 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.190
 probably many are the men 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.470
 be sent 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.730
 but then we will see everything 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.410
 any case, yes , i have rai now 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.310
 last time played then as 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.100
 shooting went straight on the day 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.350
 first then went back not so so 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.040
 it is so mediocre 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.960
 but I think if that's more 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.970
 play and get used to it 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.430
 then it will be on everyone again 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.440
 Then we will see how we do that 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.240
 do with the live commentary ries and 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.620
 I have to look now I had me 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.520
 I put this cable on 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.300
 my little screen now 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.920
 can record 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.510
 but that does not work yes that did 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.100
 I now again I returned 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.430
 I'll probably be back later 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.200
 the e gaming capture hd order completely 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.810
 simply because they are simple 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.950
 is better than year celebration and me then 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.709
 just record live 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.390
 I can do a lot more with it and 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.920
 can also just this 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.420
 Gameplay as always traces back then 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.050
 does not have to be recorded in the 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.610
 cinema mode and such a shit 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.240
 yes that's definitely the better one 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.240
 it 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.510
 and yes I have a look that is yes 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.530
 not cheap thinks 160 euros 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.450
 provided what I have with the hd before 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.860
 I do not make this possible here 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.880
 go for you the functions 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.890
 So sell it or I will 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:26.890
 maybe even lose it then I have to 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.970
 Let's see how it fits and 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.440
 what else can you say on this 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.750
 in any case a little something to 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.790
 Gameplay The offices I thought first is 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.450
 now clearly the heaviest thing is the 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.400
 assault rifles 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.570
 but it is then already off as 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.140
 if you have the economy then it works 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.940
 right off 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.880
 But I think the economy and 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.580
 fast magazine the rain pulls her 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.680
 you have to be fast with that 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.480
 magazine in any case play the full 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.280
 shit after without a fast magazine 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.319
 that's kind of no idea why 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.750
 but that takes a bit too long 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.640
 long reign anyway at the 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.180
 Storm guns always have to be there easily 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.920
 and the world will be on everyone soon 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.360
 case for the endgame play here i have 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.630
 In any case, what really good he 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.190
 plays for the one nuclear what right 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.930
 It's really awesome, I have to go now 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.390
 Just say it is a piece of cinema 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:18.140
 cafÃ© yes you believe it comes with me 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.880
 really that was not my first 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.490
 Just say that was my first 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.140
 doing nuclear in the gameplay and that 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.580
 clear shipping was clearly capable 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.560
 somehow again on an 18 aspic 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.860
 died and finally on a 20er 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.260
 Street was the end of it all 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.450
 farewell and 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.340
 yes I would say if you have the video 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.470
 the free then gives the thumb up 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.630
 if not then and yes I would 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.070
 me over 200 reviews in any case 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.870
 that's for everyone 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.580
 event times really horny when I so 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.380
 coco's ratings are really high 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.080
 so if you want to do the favor 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.660
 then just give a rating and 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.840
 yes we listen the next time skin 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.840
 purely
