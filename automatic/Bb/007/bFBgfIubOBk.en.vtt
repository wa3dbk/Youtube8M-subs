00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
not another found-footage horror film

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.620 
not another found-footage horror film

that you go and see it anyway then this

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.999 
that you go and see it anyway then this
is<00:01:40.750> not<00:01:40.900> going<00:01:40.990> to<00:01:41.049> win<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.350> over<00:01:41.500> so<00:01:41.799> we'll

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
is not going to win you over so we'll

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:43.710 
is not going to win you over so we'll
say<00:01:42.159> stay<00:01:42.430> away<00:01:42.670> so<00:01:42.729> back<00:01:43.150> in<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:43.390> bush<00:01:43.540> it

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
say stay away so back in the bush it

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.999 
say stay away so back in the bush it
does<00:01:43.869> have<00:01:44.020> its<00:01:44.170> problems<00:01:44.320> but<00:01:44.530> I<00:01:44.680> think<00:01:44.920> it

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
does have its problems but I think it

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.310 
does have its problems but I think it
does<00:01:45.130> apply<00:01:45.400> to<00:01:45.490> hardcore<00:01:46.450> found-footage

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
does apply to hardcore found-footage

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.859 
does apply to hardcore found-footage
horror<00:01:47.409> fans<00:01:48.009> so<00:01:48.310> at<00:01:48.579> this<00:01:48.729> movie<00:01:49.030> as<00:01:49.540> I<00:01:49.659> said

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
horror fans so at this movie as I said

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.810 
horror fans so at this movie as I said
it<00:01:50.020> does<00:01:50.170> have<00:01:50.409> a<00:01:50.590> stronger<00:01:50.860> resemblance<00:01:51.430> to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
it does have a stronger resemblance to

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.580 
it does have a stronger resemblance to
Blair<00:01:52.030> Witch<00:01:52.299> as<00:01:52.570> opposed<00:01:52.990> to<00:01:53.229> that<00:01:53.259> of

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
Blair Witch as opposed to that of

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.740 
Blair Witch as opposed to that of
paranormal<00:01:54.400> activity<00:01:54.490> now<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:55.540> whole

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
paranormal activity now the whole

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.010 
paranormal activity now the whole
gimmick<00:01:55.990> to<00:01:56.829> found<00:01:57.369> footage<00:01:57.579> now<00:01:58.000> what<00:01:58.360> Blair

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
gimmick to found footage now what Blair

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.109 
gimmick to found footage now what Blair
Witch<00:01:59.259> created<00:01:59.770> so<00:01:59.979> well<00:02:00.189> was<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:00.579> feeling<00:02:01.000> of

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
Witch created so well was the feeling of

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.240 
Witch created so well was the feeling of
amateur<00:02:01.720> film<00:02:02.020> work<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:02.470> that's<00:02:03.040> something

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
amateur film work and that's something

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.920 
amateur film work and that's something
that<00:02:03.369> is<00:02:03.549> lacking<00:02:03.759> in<00:02:04.000> mega-budget<00:02:04.479> harm

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
that is lacking in mega-budget harm

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.600 
that is lacking in mega-budget harm
horror<00:02:05.259> films<00:02:05.590> of<00:02:05.740> this<00:02:05.920> nation's<00:02:06.310> because

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
horror films of this nation's because

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.240 
horror films of this nation's because
the<00:02:07.030> camera<00:02:07.329> work<00:02:07.509> is<00:02:07.689> so<00:02:07.899> slick<00:02:08.290> they<00:02:08.470> have

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
the camera work is so slick they have

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.100 
the camera work is so slick they have
actors<00:02:09.790> from<00:02:10.209> other<00:02:10.420> films<00:02:10.840> so<00:02:10.989> you

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
actors from other films so you

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.770 
actors from other films so you
automatically<00:02:12.070> have<00:02:12.190> that<00:02:12.400> sense<00:02:12.880> of<00:02:13.000> amateur

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
automatically have that sense of amateur

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.449 
automatically have that sense of amateur
film<00:02:14.049> work<00:02:14.230> out<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.620> window<00:02:14.920> therefore<00:02:15.400> it

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
film work out the window therefore it

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.069 
film work out the window therefore it
doesn't<00:02:15.640> create<00:02:15.940> what<00:02:16.329> everything<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:16.989> is

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
doesn't create what everything that is

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.050 
doesn't create what everything that is
found<00:02:17.290> footage<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:18.040> I<00:02:18.130> think<00:02:18.190> fan<00:02:18.549> footage<00:02:18.910> is

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
found footage and I think fan footage is

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.240 
found footage and I think fan footage is
a<00:02:19.090> place<00:02:19.360> for<00:02:19.390> lazy<00:02:19.930> horror<00:02:20.380> filmmakers<00:02:20.799> to

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
a place for lazy horror filmmakers to

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.220 
a place for lazy horror filmmakers to
get<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.459> quick<00:02:21.760> buck<00:02:22.000> because<00:02:22.510> they're<00:02:22.870> forming

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
get a quick buck because they're forming

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.229 
get a quick buck because they're forming
a<00:02:23.319> cash<00:02:23.530> cow<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:24.040> basically<00:02:24.849> they're<00:02:25.090> not

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
a cash cow and basically they're not

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.770 
a cash cow and basically they're not
trying<00:02:25.540> so<00:02:25.870> I<00:02:25.900> actually<00:02:26.050> think<00:02:26.379> that

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
trying so I actually think that

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.330 
trying so I actually think that
footage<00:02:27.140> can<00:02:27.319> be<00:02:27.440> very<00:02:27.650> effective<00:02:27.980> when<00:02:28.310> it

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
footage can be very effective when it

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.430 
footage can be very effective when it
wants<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.670> be<00:02:28.819> but<00:02:29.300> it<00:02:29.390> can<00:02:29.510> also<00:02:29.600> be<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:29.959> recipe

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
wants to be but it can also be a recipe

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.470 
wants to be but it can also be a recipe
for<00:02:30.620> laziness<00:02:31.010> from<00:02:31.580> directors<00:02:32.000> who<00:02:32.120> are<00:02:32.150> just

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
for laziness from directors who are just

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.660 
for laziness from directors who are just
there<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.780> make<00:02:32.990> jump<00:02:33.470> scares<00:02:33.770> and<00:02:33.950> not<00:02:34.490> really

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
there to make jump scares and not really

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.430 
there to make jump scares and not really
create<00:02:35.120> an<00:02:35.270> environment<00:02:35.630> that's<00:02:35.900> everything

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
create an environment that's everything

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.170 
create an environment that's everything
that<00:02:36.560> Blair<00:02:36.770> Witch<00:02:37.040> did<00:02:37.280> so<00:02:37.490> well<00:02:37.670> as<00:02:37.819> create

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
that Blair Witch did so well as create

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.000 
that Blair Witch did so well as create
the<00:02:38.330> environment<00:02:38.630> create<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.560> suspense

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
the environment create the suspense

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.100 
the environment create the suspense
create<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.520> atmosphere<00:02:40.670> that<00:02:41.180> slowly<00:02:41.630> creeps

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
create the atmosphere that slowly creeps

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.900 
create the atmosphere that slowly creeps
up<00:02:42.290> on<00:02:42.410> in<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:42.800> when<00:02:43.100> I<00:02:43.130> first<00:02:43.400> watch<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.790> as<00:02:43.880> a

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
up on in and when I first watch it as a

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.449 
up on in and when I first watch it as a
kid<00:02:44.209> I<00:02:44.450> thought<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.380> myself<00:02:45.500> is<00:02:45.830> this<00:02:45.950> real<00:02:46.250> I

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
kid I thought to myself is this real I

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.130 
kid I thought to myself is this real I
had<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.090> double<00:02:47.360> check<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.720> make<00:02:47.750> sure<00:02:47.900> it

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
had to double check to make sure it

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.020 
had to double check to make sure it
wasn't<00:02:48.319> real<00:02:48.590> because<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:49.040> just<00:02:49.190> felt<00:02:49.550> so<00:02:49.640> real

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
wasn't real because it just felt so real

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.729 
wasn't real because it just felt so real
is<00:02:50.420> because<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:50.780> didn't<00:02:51.020> have<00:02:51.110> all<00:02:51.290> these<00:02:51.440> jump

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
is because it didn't have all these jump

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.290 
is because it didn't have all these jump
scares<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.190> it<00:02:52.310> just<00:02:52.489> slowly<00:02:52.790> builds<00:02:53.180> like

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
scares and it just slowly builds like

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.820 
scares and it just slowly builds like
you've<00:02:53.450> got<00:02:53.569> these<00:02:53.690> people<00:02:54.050> in<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.200> woods<00:02:54.410> who

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
you've got these people in the woods who

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.979 
you've got these people in the woods who
are<00:02:54.980> documenting<00:02:55.580> stuff<00:02:56.000> going<00:02:56.390> on<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.720> it

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
are documenting stuff going on and it

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.720 
are documenting stuff going on and it
just<00:02:57.170> slowly<00:02:57.410> gets<00:02:57.739> worse<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.190> worse<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:58.610> as

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
just slowly gets worse and worse and as

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.220 
just slowly gets worse and worse and as
I<00:02:58.820> said<00:02:59.000> there's<00:02:59.150> no<00:02:59.300> jump<00:02:59.630> scares<00:02:59.930> every

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
I said there's no jump scares every

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.500 
I said there's no jump scares every
second<00:03:00.620> minute<00:03:00.680> therefore<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:01.790> creates<00:03:02.209> such

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
second minute therefore it creates such

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.840 
second minute therefore it creates such
an<00:03:02.750> impending<00:03:03.350> sense<00:03:03.680> of<00:03:03.830> doom<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.340> it's<00:03:04.670> done

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
an impending sense of doom and it's done

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.400 
an impending sense of doom and it's done
in<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:05.000> very<00:03:05.120> realistic<00:03:05.450> way<00:03:05.780> because<00:03:06.140> of<00:03:06.320> the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
in a very realistic way because of the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.530 
in a very realistic way because of the
low-budget<00:03:06.620> feel<00:03:07.340> it<00:03:07.610> had<00:03:07.940> a<00:03:07.970> very<00:03:08.180> grainy

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
low-budget feel it had a very grainy

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.449 
low-budget feel it had a very grainy
fielder<00:03:08.959> had<00:03:09.080> a<00:03:09.110> very<00:03:09.380> bad<00:03:09.590> quality<00:03:10.160> sort<00:03:10.400> of

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
fielder had a very bad quality sort of

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.460 
fielder had a very bad quality sort of
vibe<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:10.880> it<00:03:10.910> which<00:03:11.390> really<00:03:11.660> contributed<00:03:12.350> to

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
vibe to it which really contributed to

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.930 
vibe to it which really contributed to
the<00:03:12.560> fact<00:03:12.830> that<00:03:12.890> it<00:03:13.040> wanted<00:03:13.310> what<00:03:13.610> it<00:03:13.700> wants<00:03:13.880> to

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
the fact that it wanted what it wants to

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.030 
the fact that it wanted what it wants to
be<00:03:14.030> in<00:03:14.180> what<00:03:14.420> found<00:03:14.690> footage<00:03:14.930> is<00:03:15.200> is<00:03:15.500> amateur

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
be in what found footage is is amateur

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.009 
be in what found footage is is amateur
film<00:03:16.310> work<00:03:16.489> so<00:03:16.819> I<00:03:16.850> think<00:03:16.970> low-budget<00:03:17.510> films

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
film work so I think low-budget films

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.110 
film work so I think low-budget films
really<00:03:18.440> can<00:03:18.650> capture<00:03:19.130> that<00:03:19.430> essence<00:03:19.850> a<00:03:19.940> lot

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
really can capture that essence a lot

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.490 
really can capture that essence a lot
better<00:03:20.300> than<00:03:20.600> films<00:03:20.900> like<00:03:21.019> Paranormal

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
better than films like Paranormal

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.140 
better than films like Paranormal
Activity<00:03:21.530> I<00:03:21.920> actually<00:03:22.100> feel<00:03:22.459> that<00:03:22.910> fan

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
Activity I actually feel that fan

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.970 
Activity I actually feel that fan
footage<00:03:23.480> belongs<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.380> lower<00:03:24.560> budget

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
footage belongs to the lower budget

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.710 
footage belongs to the lower budget
stuff<00:03:25.220> so<00:03:25.760> beckoning<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.180> bush<00:03:26.390> it<00:03:26.540> comes

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
stuff so beckoning the bush it comes

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.180 
stuff so beckoning the bush it comes
along<00:03:26.930> and<00:03:27.080> yes<00:03:27.410> it's<00:03:27.590> nothing<00:03:27.920> that's<00:03:28.040> going

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
along and yes it's nothing that's going

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.530

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
to blow out of the world of originality

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.720 
to blow out of the world of originality
but<00:03:30.140> it<00:03:30.290> emulates<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.860> vibe<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.459> Blair

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
but it emulates the vibe that Blair

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.520 
but it emulates the vibe that Blair
Witch<00:03:31.970> had<00:03:32.180> it<00:03:32.269> has<00:03:32.390> a<00:03:32.420> very<00:03:32.660> slow<00:03:33.049> start<00:03:33.110> it

slowly creeps up on you the setting of
the<00:03:38.000> farmhouse<00:03:38.540> was<00:03:38.690> greater<00:03:39.019> so<00:03:39.200> it<00:03:39.260> was<00:03:39.380> very

was slightly annoying but the rest of
them<00:04:03.709> actually<00:04:03.859> felt<00:04:04.280> like<00:04:04.430> genuine<00:04:04.850> friends

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
thought the chemistry between them all

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.270 
thought the chemistry between them all
was<00:04:07.970> very<00:04:08.180> very<00:04:08.359> good<00:04:08.630> and<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:09.470> slow<00:04:09.799> build-up

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
was very very good and the slow build-up

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.670 
was very very good and the slow build-up
to<00:04:10.340> bad<00:04:10.820> things<00:04:11.120> happening<00:04:11.510> is<00:04:11.720> what<00:04:12.410> really

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
to bad things happening is what really

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.460 
to bad things happening is what really
reminded<00:04:13.190> me<00:04:13.340> of<00:04:13.549> the<00:04:13.730> Blair<00:04:14.540> Witch<00:04:14.570> so

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
reminded me of the Blair Witch so

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.229 
reminded me of the Blair Witch so
although<00:04:15.890> back<00:04:16.250> in<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.519> book<00:04:16.669> show<00:04:16.850> isn't

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
although back in the book show isn't

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.849 
although back in the book show isn't
anything<00:04:17.479> brilliant<00:04:18.019> I<00:04:18.079> still<00:04:18.440> think<00:04:18.470> it's

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
anything brilliant I still think it's

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.319 
anything brilliant I still think it's
worth<00:04:19.039> it<00:04:19.250> if<00:04:19.370> you're<00:04:19.459> a<00:04:19.549> fan<00:04:19.760> of<00:04:19.789> Blair<00:04:20.150> Witch

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
worth it if you're a fan of Blair Witch

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.360 
worth it if you're a fan of Blair Witch
because<00:04:20.630> as<00:04:20.780> that<00:04:20.989> low<00:04:21.140> budget<00:04:21.530> feel<00:04:21.709> it<00:04:21.979> has<00:04:22.340> a

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
because as that low budget feel it has a

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.070 
because as that low budget feel it has a
genuine<00:04:22.789> feeling<00:04:23.300> that<00:04:23.450> these<00:04:23.570> people<00:04:23.840> are

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
genuine feeling that these people are

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.870 
genuine feeling that these people are
real<00:04:24.260> and<00:04:24.470> I<00:04:24.919> just<00:04:25.160> thought<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.490> impending

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
real and I just thought the impending

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
trailers and you think yourself you've

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.659

seen<00:04:44.930> it<00:04:45.050> all<00:04:45.139> before<00:04:45.260> but<00:04:45.710> as<00:04:45.919> I<00:04:46.220> said<00:04:46.280> it

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
seen it all before but as I said it

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.490 
seen it all before but as I said it
doesn't<00:04:47.060> try<00:04:47.360> too<00:04:47.419> hard<00:04:47.570> it's<00:04:47.990> not<00:04:48.050> hitting

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
doesn't try too hard it's not hitting

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.930 
doesn't try too hard it's not hitting
you<00:04:48.530> with<00:04:48.680> cheap<00:04:48.919> tricks<00:04:49.220> there<00:04:49.580> is<00:04:49.699> some

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
you with cheap tricks there is some

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.610 
you with cheap tricks there is some
slight<00:04:50.330> imagery<00:04:50.840> towards<00:04:51.169> the<00:04:51.290> end<00:04:51.410> that<00:04:51.500> was

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
slight imagery towards the end that was

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.080 
slight imagery towards the end that was
a<00:04:51.650> little<00:04:51.770> bit<00:04:51.949> off<00:04:52.100> but<00:04:52.550> that's<00:04:52.699> few<00:04:52.910> and<00:04:52.940> far

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
a little bit off but that's few and far

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.870 
a little bit off but that's few and far
between<00:04:53.210> so<00:04:53.660> I<00:04:53.720> thought<00:04:53.900> it<00:04:54.139> all<00:04:54.400> it<00:04:55.400> all<00:04:55.639> built

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
between so I thought it all it all built

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.000 
between so I thought it all it all built
up<00:04:56.030> to<00:04:56.180> a<00:04:56.210> very<00:04:56.449> satisfying<00:04:56.930> climax<00:04:57.470> and<00:04:57.620> I

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
up to a very satisfying climax and I

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.650 
up to a very satisfying climax and I
like<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.280> documentary<00:04:58.940> style<00:04:59.150> approach<00:04:59.419> as

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
like the documentary style approach as

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.960 
like the documentary style approach as
well<00:04:59.810> it<00:04:59.930> felt<00:05:00.590> like<00:05:00.800> although<00:05:01.400> it<00:05:01.520> wasn't<00:05:01.729> an

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
well it felt like although it wasn't an

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.879 
well it felt like although it wasn't an
original<00:05:02.419> concept<00:05:02.870> at<00:05:02.990> least<00:05:03.229> the<00:05:03.410> directors

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
original concept at least the directors

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:05.409 
original concept at least the directors
well<00:05:04.130> the<00:05:04.280> director<00:05:04.639> was<00:05:04.790> trying<00:05:05.180> to<00:05:05.300> do

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
well the director was trying to do

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.000 
well the director was trying to do
something<00:05:05.660> different<00:05:05.810> he<00:05:06.440> was<00:05:06.470> trying<00:05:06.919> to

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
something different he was trying to

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.890 
something different he was trying to
make<00:05:07.280> something<00:05:07.610> and<00:05:07.850> you<00:05:08.180> felt<00:05:08.479> that<00:05:08.600> he<00:05:08.870> was

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
make something and you felt that he was

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.750 
make something and you felt that he was
proud<00:05:09.350> of<00:05:09.380> what<00:05:09.680> he<00:05:09.800> was<00:05:09.949> doing<00:05:10.250> he<00:05:10.340> wasn't

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:10.760 
proud of what he was doing he wasn't

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.670 
proud of what he was doing he wasn't
just<00:05:10.940> flogging<00:05:11.300> a<00:05:11.449> cash<00:05:11.660> cow<00:05:11.870> like<00:05:12.380> the<00:05:12.500> higher

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
just flogging a cash cow like the higher

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.620 
just flogging a cash cow like the higher
budget<00:05:12.889> films<00:05:13.340> do<00:05:13.520> and<00:05:13.760> so<00:05:14.210> you've<00:05:14.360> got<00:05:14.510> the

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
budget films do and so you've got the

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.600 
budget films do and so you've got the
actors<00:05:15.050> who<00:05:15.289> did<00:05:15.500> a<00:05:15.530> fantastic<00:05:15.800> job<00:05:16.190> I<00:05:16.400> thought

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
actors who did a fantastic job I thought

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.370 
actors who did a fantastic job I thought
the<00:05:16.699> script<00:05:16.940> was<00:05:17.090> very<00:05:17.330> subdued<00:05:17.570> very<00:05:17.990> subtle

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
the script was very subdued very subtle

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.170 
the script was very subdued very subtle
very<00:05:18.410> realistic<00:05:19.160> and<00:05:19.340> I<00:05:19.639> said<00:05:19.820> nothing's

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
very realistic and I said nothing's

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.879 
very realistic and I said nothing's
exaggerated<00:05:20.840> to<00:05:20.930> the<00:05:21.020> point<00:05:21.260> where<00:05:21.440> it<00:05:21.560> feels

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
exaggerated to the point where it feels

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.620 
exaggerated to the point where it feels
like<00:05:22.039> a<00:05:22.130> movie<00:05:22.490> for<00:05:22.610> entertainment<00:05:23.180> say<00:05:23.300> it

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
like a movie for entertainment say it

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.969 
like a movie for entertainment say it
actually<00:05:23.990> feels<00:05:24.139> like<00:05:24.380> you've<00:05:24.530> got<00:05:24.770> some

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
actually feels like you've got some

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:26.260 
actually feels like you've got some
amateur<00:05:25.340> footage<00:05:25.550> and<00:05:25.760> you're<00:05:26.120> actually

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
amateur footage and you're actually

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.330 
amateur footage and you're actually
watching<00:05:26.600> it<00:05:27.139> unfold<00:05:27.289> before<00:05:27.740> your<00:05:28.039> very<00:05:28.190> eyes

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
watching it unfold before your very eyes

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.520 
watching it unfold before your very eyes
so<00:05:28.789> it<00:05:29.090> emulates<00:05:29.479> the<00:05:29.780> feeling<00:05:30.169> that<00:05:30.320> Blair

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
so it emulates the feeling that Blair

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.960 
so it emulates the feeling that Blair
Witch<00:05:30.710> had<00:05:30.949> although<00:05:31.130> Blair<00:05:31.460> Witch<00:05:31.610> is<00:05:31.639> a<00:05:31.760> much

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
Witch had although Blair Witch is a much

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.909 
Witch had although Blair Witch is a much
better<00:05:32.000> film<00:05:32.449> but<00:05:32.660> that<00:05:33.260> leaves<00:05:33.470> beckoning

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
better film but that leaves beckoning

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.200 
better film but that leaves beckoning
the<00:05:33.979> butcher<00:05:34.250> is<00:05:34.340> going<00:05:34.580> back<00:05:34.760> to<00:05:34.880> the<00:05:35.000> roots

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
the butcher is going back to the roots

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.000 
the butcher is going back to the roots
of<00:05:35.389> what<00:05:35.870> makes<00:05:36.050> a<00:05:36.169> found<00:05:36.380> footage<00:05:36.410> film<00:05:36.800> and

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
of what makes a found footage film and

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.890 
of what makes a found footage film and
for<00:05:37.370> that<00:05:37.460> I<00:05:37.520> really<00:05:37.940> appreciate<00:05:38.419> and<00:05:38.630> so

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
for that I really appreciate and so

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.900 
for that I really appreciate and so
after<00:05:39.500> all<00:05:39.770> that<00:05:39.889> considered<00:05:40.460> I<00:05:40.550> was<00:05:40.580> aiming

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
after all that considered I was aiming

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.520 
after all that considered I was aiming
an<00:05:41.000> R<00:05:41.120> in<00:05:41.150> between<00:05:41.539> two<00:05:41.720> and<00:05:41.750> a<00:05:41.900> half<00:05:42.050> thousand

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
an R in between two and a half thousand

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.659 
an R in between two and a half thousand
three<00:05:42.740> but<00:05:42.919> I'm<00:05:43.010> going<00:05:43.130> to<00:05:43.190> give<00:05:43.310> it<00:05:43.340> three

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
three but I'm going to give it three

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.610 
three but I'm going to give it three
because<00:05:44.240> it<00:05:44.360> does<00:05:44.510> have<00:05:44.720> attention<00:05:45.139> to<00:05:45.229> detail

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
because it does have attention to detail
