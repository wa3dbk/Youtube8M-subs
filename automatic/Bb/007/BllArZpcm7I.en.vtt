this<00:02:19.390> out<00:02:20.130> last<00:02:21.130> play<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.730> is

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.580 

and<00:02:41.140> lots<00:02:41.739> of<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.280> lot<00:02:42.790> of<00:02:42.819> kids<00:02:43.150> in<00:02:43.299> here<00:02:43.590> geared

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
and lots of a lot of kids in here geared

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.270 
and lots of a lot of kids in here geared
toward<00:02:45.209> dancehall<00:02:46.209> stuff<00:02:46.510> too<00:02:47.280> against

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
toward dancehall stuff too against

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.679 
toward dancehall stuff too against
something<00:02:48.430> I<00:02:48.579> think<00:02:48.730> is<00:02:48.849> really<00:02:49.090> cool<00:02:49.299> down

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
something I think is really cool down

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:51.720 
something I think is really cool down
you<00:02:50.530> know<00:02:50.650> it's<00:02:50.890> almost<00:02:51.069> like<00:02:51.250> you<00:02:51.370> know<00:02:51.579> they

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
you know it's almost like you know they

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.390 
you know it's almost like you know they
really<00:02:51.939> wanted<00:02:52.329> to<00:02:52.390> focus<00:02:52.659> on<00:02:53.400> dancehall

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
really wanted to focus on dancehall

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.979 
really wanted to focus on dancehall
stuff<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:54.970> I<00:02:55.030> think<00:02:55.090> they<00:02:55.390> actually<00:02:55.450> did<00:02:55.840> that

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
stuff and I think they actually did that

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.509 
stuff and I think they actually did that
really<00:02:56.200> well<00:02:56.470> over<00:02:56.650> reggae<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.220> things<00:02:57.370> like

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
really well over reggae and things like

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.699 
really well over reggae and things like
that<00:02:57.579> I'm<00:02:58.030> not<00:02:58.629> big<00:02:58.989> on<00:02:59.140> reggae<00:02:59.379> but<00:02:59.590> the

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
that I'm not big on reggae but the

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.410 
that I'm not big on reggae but the
reggae<00:02:59.920> songs<00:03:00.280> that<00:03:00.459> I<00:03:00.579> hear<00:03:01.000> these<00:03:01.209> sounds

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
reggae songs that I hear these sounds

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.849 
reggae songs that I hear these sounds
really<00:03:01.750> remind<00:03:02.079> me<00:03:02.170> something<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.530> hear<00:03:02.709> from

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
really remind me something I hear from

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.800 
really remind me something I hear from
those<00:03:02.980> songs<00:03:03.280> but<00:03:04.060> again<00:03:04.359> I<00:03:04.389> think<00:03:04.659> these

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
those songs but again I think these

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.140 
those songs but again I think these
again<00:03:05.409> work<00:03:05.620> really<00:03:05.889> well<00:03:06.159> for<00:03:06.219> hip<00:03:06.609> hop<00:03:06.849> R&amp;B

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
again work really well for hip hop R&amp;B

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.899 
again work really well for hip hop R&amp;B
pop<00:03:08.189> likes<00:03:09.189> instead<00:03:09.400> of<00:03:09.489> public<00:03:09.730> you<00:03:09.819> know

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
pop likes instead of public you know

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:11.759 
pop likes instead of public you know
like<00:03:10.030> your<00:03:10.150> Katy<00:03:10.420> Perry<00:03:10.750> Lady<00:03:10.810> Gaga<00:03:11.349> I<00:03:11.379> think

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
like your Katy Perry Lady Gaga I think

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.619 
like your Katy Perry Lady Gaga I think
these<00:03:11.889> would<00:03:12.069> actually<00:03:12.220> really<00:03:13.030> really<00:03:13.299> well

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
these would actually really really well

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.360 
these would actually really really well
for<00:03:13.810> that<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.439> I<00:03:14.470> think<00:03:14.530> they<00:03:14.769> did<00:03:14.919> a<00:03:14.950> really

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
for that and I think they did a really

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.390 
for that and I think they did a really
really<00:03:15.549> good<00:03:15.939> job<00:03:16.299> here<00:03:16.359> I<00:03:17.079> want<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.769> just<00:03:18.250> go
