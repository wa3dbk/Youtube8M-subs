00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
map out our head now the problem with

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.950

the<00:00:46.860> Powerpuff<00:00:47.280> Girls<00:00:47.340> they're<00:00:48.300> really

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
the Powerpuff Girls they're really

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.920 
the Powerpuff Girls they're really
simple<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.710> draw<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.550> hardens<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.660> know<00:00:51.780> at

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
simple to draw but hardens you know at

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.540 
simple to draw but hardens you know at
the<00:00:52.020> same<00:00:52.230> time<00:00:52.440> like<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.739> said<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.070> formed

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
the same time like I said that formed

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.650 
the same time like I said that formed
some<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.850> other<00:00:54.000> breakdowns<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.570> you

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
some of the other breakdowns that you

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.180 
some of the other breakdowns that you
see<00:00:54.780> then<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.620> because<00:00:55.800> they're<00:00:55.920> so

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
see then it's just because they're so

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.560 
see then it's just because they're so
simple<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.449> if<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.750> kind<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.079> mess<00:00:58.260> up<00:00:59.570> you

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
simple that if you kind of mess up you

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.790 
simple that if you kind of mess up you
know<00:01:00.660> there's<00:01:00.840> not<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> lot<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.230> leeway<00:01:01.500> you're

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
know there's not a lot of leeway you're

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.439 
know there's not a lot of leeway you're
like<00:01:01.920> whoa<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.579> totally<00:01:02.940> off<00:01:03.120> so

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
like whoa it's just totally off so

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.789 
like whoa it's just totally off so
that's<00:01:03.840> why<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.080> have<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.350> make<00:01:04.470> sure<00:01:04.650> you

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
that's why you have to make sure you

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.530 
that's why you have to make sure you
really<00:01:05.010> map<00:01:05.250> out<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> character<00:01:05.909> well<00:01:06.150> before

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
really map out the character well before

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.620 
really map out the character well before
you<00:01:06.630> draw<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.650> when<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> key<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.270> getting

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
you draw it so when the key is getting

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.840 
you draw it so when the key is getting
the<00:01:09.869> good<00:01:10.110> circle<00:01:10.680> or<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> good<00:01:11.189> ol<00:01:11.430> for<00:01:11.729> their

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.219 
be fluid so we've had that oval down
there<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.540> we're<00:01:30.630> going<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.780> draw<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.960> line

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
there and we're going to draw the line

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.200 
there and we're going to draw the line
of<00:01:31.259> action<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.829> her<00:01:31.950> head<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.700> depending<00:01:33.090> where

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
of action in her head so depending where

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.359 
of action in her head so depending where
our<00:01:33.329> head<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.630> facing<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.920> know<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.130> kind<00:01:35.310> of

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
our head is facing you know it's kind of

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.609 
our head is facing you know it's kind of
facing<00:01:35.759> right<00:01:35.909> there<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.960> have<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.110> head

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
facing right there so we have a head

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.440 
facing right there so we have a head
mapped<00:01:37.860> out<00:01:38.070> right<00:01:38.280> there<00:01:38.549> then<00:01:39.119> let's<00:01:39.270> draw

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
mapped out right there then let's draw

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.910 
mapped out right there then let's draw
the<00:01:39.509> rest<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> line<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.380> action<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.770> her

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the rest of the line of action of her

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.760 
the rest of the line of action of her
body<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.750> so<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.869> line<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.079> action<00:01:43.470> is

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
body and so the line of action is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.740 
body and so the line of action is
basically<00:01:44.399> what<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.909> character<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.450> kind<00:01:45.600> of

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
basically what the character is kind of

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.620 
basically what the character is kind of
doing<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.229> we<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.500> basically<00:01:47.130> map<00:01:47.729> out<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
doing and we can basically map out the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.340 
doing and we can basically map out the
drawing<00:01:49.049> just<00:01:50.210> a<00:01:51.210> few<00:01:51.450> simple<00:01:51.899> lines<00:01:51.930> right

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
drawing just a few simple lines right

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.780 
drawing just a few simple lines right
there<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:54.890> stick<00:01:55.890> figures<00:01:56.250> are<00:01:56.399> actually

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
there and stick figures are actually

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.340 
there and stick figures are actually
really<00:01:57.030> cool<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.360> remember<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.840> didn't<00:01:58.110> want<00:01:58.259> to

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
really cool I remember I didn't want to

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.469 
really cool I remember I didn't want to
draw<00:01:58.799> stick<00:01:59.100> figures<00:01:59.130> but<00:01:59.759> they're<00:02:00.240> actually

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
draw stick figures but they're actually

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.950 
draw stick figures but they're actually
really<00:02:00.659> key<00:02:01.140> and

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
really key and

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.090 
really key and
you<00:02:02.350> should<00:02:02.530> definitely<00:02:02.680> practice

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
you should definitely practice

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.730 
you should definitely practice
stick-figure<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:04.060> we<00:02:04.540> have<00:02:04.690> that<00:02:04.900> head<00:02:05.200> mapped

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
stick-figure so we have that head mapped

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.470 
stick-figure so we have that head mapped
out<00:02:05.980> right<00:02:06.220> there<00:02:06.430> we<00:02:06.580> have<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.820> body<00:02:07.060> kind<00:02:07.360> of

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
out right there we have the body kind of

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.260 
out right there we have the body kind of
going<00:02:07.720> on<00:02:07.900> so<00:02:08.590> now<00:02:08.770> we<00:02:08.830> know<00:02:09.100> where<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.060> leg

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
going on so now we know where the leg

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.390 
going on so now we know where the leg
goes<00:02:10.570> and<00:02:10.899> then<00:02:11.020> usually<00:02:11.650> when<00:02:11.800> their<00:02:11.920> leg<00:02:12.130> is

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
goes and then usually when their leg is

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.050 
goes and then usually when their leg is
kind<00:02:12.850> of<00:02:13.000> like<00:02:13.240> in<00:02:13.750> bent<00:02:14.470> it<00:02:15.220> makes<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.730> nice

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
kind of like in bent it makes a nice

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.670 
kind of like in bent it makes a nice
little<00:02:16.120> pod<00:02:16.870> shape<00:02:17.230> right<00:02:17.470> here<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:19.560> use<00:02:20.560> that

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
little pod shape right here and use that

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.440 
little pod shape right here and use that
Center<00:02:21.040> lines<00:02:21.250> kind<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.730> like<00:02:21.850> map<00:02:22.060> out<00:02:22.270> let's

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
Center lines kind of like map out let's

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.300 
Center lines kind of like map out let's
draw<00:02:22.600> a<00:02:22.630> circle<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:23.290> usually<00:02:23.650> draw<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:23.860> circle

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
draw a circle I usually draw a circle

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.870 
draw a circle I usually draw a circle
right<00:02:24.430> there

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
right there

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.910 
right there
to<00:02:25.330> kind<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.570> know<00:02:26.080> where<00:02:26.320> I<00:02:26.350> want<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.650> put<00:02:26.800> the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
to kind of know where I want to put the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.370 
to kind of know where I want to put the
feet<00:02:27.190> so<00:02:27.459> when<00:02:27.610> I'm<00:02:27.700> drawing<00:02:27.940> I<00:02:28.270> know<00:02:28.900> that

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
feet so when I'm drawing I know that

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.290 
feet so when I'm drawing I know that
that<00:02:29.770> circle<00:02:30.250> is<00:02:30.370> where<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.610> foots<00:02:30.880> gonna<00:02:31.030> go

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
that circle is where the foots gonna go

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.449 
that circle is where the foots gonna go
and<00:02:31.780> especially<00:02:32.140> with<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.470> hands<00:02:32.709> too<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.040> draw

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
and especially with the hands too I draw

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.910 
and especially with the hands too I draw
the<00:02:33.520> usually<00:02:34.120> little<00:02:34.360> circles<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.770> kind

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
the usually little circles and it kind

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.100 
the usually little circles and it kind
of<00:02:35.980> helps<00:02:36.280> me<00:02:36.310> just<00:02:36.970> map<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.390> out<00:02:37.480> see<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:38.050> I

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
of helps me just map it out see so I

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.800 
of helps me just map it out see so I
have<00:02:38.260> that<00:02:38.350> circle<00:02:38.739> right<00:02:38.770> there<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.810> then

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
have that circle right there and then

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.530 
have that circle right there and then
their<00:02:40.930> hands<00:02:41.110> right<00:02:41.320> there<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:42.510> same<00:02:43.510> thing

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
their hands right there and same thing

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.190 
their hands right there and same thing
with<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:43.959> foot<00:02:44.670> see<00:02:45.670> just<00:02:46.570> by<00:02:46.720> having<00:02:47.020> that

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
with that foot see just by having that

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.979 
with that foot see just by having that
circle<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:48.550> mapped<00:02:48.790> out<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.000> foot<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.540> her

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
circle and mapped out the foot and her

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.880 
circle and mapped out the foot and her
body<00:02:50.700> Powerpuff<00:02:51.700> Girls<00:02:51.970> bodies<00:02:52.330> aim<00:02:52.890> usually

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
body Powerpuff Girls bodies aim usually

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.400 
body Powerpuff Girls bodies aim usually
a<00:02:53.950> rectangle<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:55.480> we<00:02:55.600> can<00:02:55.750> just<00:02:55.900> divide<00:02:56.230> the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
a rectangle and we can just divide the

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.020 
a rectangle and we can just divide the
rectangle<00:02:56.980> kind<00:02:57.190> of<00:02:57.250> like<00:02:57.370> in<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.550> middle<00:02:57.820> and

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
rectangle kind of like in the middle and

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.960 
rectangle kind of like in the middle and
we<00:02:58.120> usually<00:02:58.450> that's<00:02:58.959> where<00:02:59.200> we<00:02:59.290> find<00:02:59.970> their

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
we usually that's where we find their

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.120 
we usually that's where we find their
clothes<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.660> little<00:03:02.500> stripe<00:03:02.800> right<00:03:03.040> there<00:03:03.250> and

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
clothes a little stripe right there and

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.170 
clothes a little stripe right there and
this<00:03:06.130> line<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:07.230> that<00:03:08.640> line<00:03:09.640> of<00:03:09.820> action<00:03:10.120> in

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
this line that that line of action in

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.270 
this line that that line of action in
the<00:03:10.269> head<00:03:10.450> well<00:03:10.989> that's<00:03:11.260> how<00:03:11.410> we<00:03:11.440> usually<00:03:12.010> find

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
the head well that's how we usually find

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.130 
the head well that's how we usually find
where<00:03:12.549> their<00:03:12.700> hair<00:03:12.910> splits<00:03:13.299> so<00:03:13.660> right<00:03:13.900> there

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
where their hair splits so right there

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.440 
where their hair splits so right there
see<00:03:14.440> boom<00:03:14.799> it<00:03:14.980> touches<00:03:15.310> right<00:03:15.459> there<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.330> we

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
see boom it touches right there and we

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.170 
see boom it touches right there and we
come<00:03:16.660> around<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.709> we<00:03:17.769> just<00:03:18.459> found<00:03:18.610> her<00:03:18.910> hair

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
come around and we just found her hair

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.880 
come around and we just found her hair
you<00:03:19.450> know<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:19.750> that's<00:03:20.140> how<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.320> really<00:03:20.620> tell

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
you know and that's how you really tell

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.400 
you know and that's how you really tell
them<00:03:21.010> apart<00:03:21.340> is<00:03:21.820> their<00:03:22.269> hair<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.720> for<00:03:23.260> their

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
them apart is their hair and for their

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.590 
them apart is their hair and for their
for<00:03:24.010> her<00:03:24.130> little<00:03:24.280> kind<00:03:24.549> of<00:03:24.640> pigtails<00:03:25.060> I<00:03:25.330> just

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
for her little kind of pigtails I just

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.100 
for her little kind of pigtails I just
usually<00:03:25.750> draw<00:03:26.110> a<00:03:26.140> nice<00:03:26.440> big<00:03:26.799> circle<00:03:28.110> come

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
usually draw a nice big circle come

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.100 
usually draw a nice big circle come
around<00:03:29.380> right<00:03:29.620> there<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.720> we<00:03:31.720> can<00:03:31.870> do<00:03:31.989> the

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
around right there and we can do the

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.509 
around right there and we can do the
same<00:03:32.410> thing<00:03:32.709> over<00:03:33.010> here<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:34.260> then<00:03:35.260> we<00:03:35.380> just

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
same thing over here and then we just
