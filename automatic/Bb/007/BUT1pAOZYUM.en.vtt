00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:04.690
 hello to all his duels even for the blog n97 for the holidays 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.850
 today we will review the text of 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.749
 the mother who beat 1-4 

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:13.329
 to start the year on this home screen you already have quite 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.249
 I was showing something else that I could not show you 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:18.630
 so m2 theme by theme like that 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.609
 this is the rule m 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.329
 I will draw the light 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.269
 so I'm there things in a lot much clearer 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.609
 for now both are nice but for the video I was preparing black who 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.119
 do not be death in general and for the video you will see this group 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.190
 much better 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.190
 for a commune 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.540
 the next writing 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.540
 so the imposing happened on the place 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.950
 the main interface of the application 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.240
 heyer he analyzes is useful percentage of price votes will remain you have a 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.650
 little pile with the percentage remaining angry in this case 83% 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.800
 you have it tells you through risks 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.090
 according to his estimates play 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.230
 five hours 20 minutes five works music minutes 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.230
 2 had 9 hours on the wolf on the web 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.770
 walk for four hours 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.320
 and let it standby active views I imagine it's the day before for a 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.310
 year to date and 22 hours 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.430
 so here's the justi fi cation that these estimates were relatively 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.320
 current course 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.110
 However 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.780
 so here we enter the statistics 2 is the berry and nagui of the tube 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.310
 chain is the world for his future didier triplet a day 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.550
 so the army Sunday rainy day almost nothing 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.720
 merignac 1% other things that were spent 42% of dollhouse 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.390
 hill 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.979
 cibox waves music more tomic students 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.270
 well 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.270
 it's strong 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.130
 then the parents searched the information 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.590
 renault who beat monitor of a link I believe the citizens on full of 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.730
 points 3 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.480
 maybe I say nonsense judge of summary and if we neglect you the 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.430
 put 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.430
 a part of course 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.690
 where m is nice the application p still heavy and without 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.269
 use 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.709
 but I will also game me 3 in the east 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.149
 much more reactive do not put as it was worth it 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:23.289
 a lot your against the gap is mounted to the point by hole excuse me 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.409
 Iran is received 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:34.499
 meadows where you pick 5 an info so here I chose and that's the worst but 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:38.049
 it's true it's hungary you have a bounce at 0 bull 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.499
 reconcile house and live music 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:44.009
 we chose the music and trails trails hide it comes back with the dates that 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:46.369
 the home screen yes it's a little time to change 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.869
 and here it tells you guys percentage is because it stays 80% 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:50.719
 battery 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.769
 and we can be a little before midnight which you can of course that I am 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.579
 the 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.579
 she but there 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.579
 did you listen more down 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.049
 chronic 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.989
 but me in general I put it for 100 th 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.230
 in a way it was the turn of France 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.479
 of athila like that a little wise and the percentage 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:14.589
 eric afp so long that's what we want is what I find more 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:17.289
 optimal to realize that I say it all before the remaining percentage 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:19.569
 and that tells you and that's it 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.569
 and it also gives us the game 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:27.309
 this percentage remaining high 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.679
 this Tuesday a six-year-old to curb 

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:33.619
 a first 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.169
 so I think that's it for this application 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.569
 kepler I recommend it 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.319
 she is pretty after the shot
