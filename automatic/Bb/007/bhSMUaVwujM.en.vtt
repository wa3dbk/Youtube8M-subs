 give you another moldy month 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.390
 so here we are going to put small 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.860
 slices in the bottom of glasses I have is 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.770
 that it goes back a little bit 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.060
 edges like that for it to be olive 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.080
 we still see the layers 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.380
 successive to the UN with powers 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.110
 on indicated it is possible to prepare if the line 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.790
 and 12 min verrines 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.800
 we will now prepare the sauce 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.729
 mixing the cream with the juice of 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:39.010
 lemon for herbs I got myself my 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.010
 favorite utensils scissors 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.470
 the mixture is ready we will be able to 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.630
 put in the verrines and I'm going 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.850
 add over small shrimps 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.070
 the more I'm going to do it's going to take the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.600
 half of the shrimp to cut them into 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.520
 little dice and put them in the 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.289
 verrines and then their sg gadret for 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.869
 the decor we found just now 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:12.920
 with I was trying to do that so I 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.380
 now go dispatcher my little ones 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.890
 shrimp in the verrines I'm going 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.319
 now drop a whole shrimp 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.750
 there I took salmon eggs 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.980
 simply because I wanted 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.870
 to make a verrine all orange 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.760
 but if you want to put a little more 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.010
 colors you can take eggs from 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.250
 black herring then there the 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.420
 only worry with rim the eyes of this world 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.410
 know that they are all glued to each other 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.940
 others so what I advise you is 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.560
 to put a little rain drop of water 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.970
 in it will allow to relax 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.160
 slightly it will be easier to 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.140
 catch cold 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.459
 there we will go to the stage where just 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.709
 before serving so that the rest you 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.019
 have it prepared in advance for example 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.420
 in the morning keep in the fridge 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.070
 on the other hand, as we will add the 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.609
 numbers of shrimp bibs turns out 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.070
 immediately if not the chips what are we going 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:04.850
 we do is dropped me a hop 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:07.840
 two-second spoon on it and 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.840
 a small sprig of dill 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.020
 this time it really has to come 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.890
 take an aperitif 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.210
 especially since I prepared another 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.210
 recipe she's right here 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.080
