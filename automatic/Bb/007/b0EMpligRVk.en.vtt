00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.650
 in organic breeding protocol one of the 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.380
 great goals is the question of good 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.720
 being of animals to be slaughtered and 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.320
 of the people who carry out the work of 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.750
 care and care for these animals to 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.760
 a more accurate approach is needed 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.699
 define animal welfare 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.940
 according to the normative instruction 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.949
 animal welfare 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.250
 remain the same free from pain and 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.220
 suffer anguish and live in a 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.480
 environment in which it can express 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.649
 proximity to the behavior of your 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:53.500
 original habitat movement 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:57.610
 territoriality loitering rest and 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.829
 reproductive ritual if the organism fails 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.559
 or has difficulty adapting to the 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.449
 This is an indication of lack of 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.460
 of well being 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.410
 however the lack of well being 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.320
 is not necessarily synonymous with 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.509
 suffering when the animals show 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.259
 unmistakable signs that reflect pain 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.310
 anguish fear frustration anger and others 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.429
 emotions 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.800
 these indicate suffering is not what 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:25.959
 you observe in these matrices that 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.979
 calmly rest on the picket with 

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:32.940
 access pass to scenes promotes lewis 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.979
 a pleasant shade in the afternoon 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:39.209
 see through this broader view the 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:42.369
 division of the pickets at the awards doors 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:45.640
 the pickets are divided by wire 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.399
 barbed wire fence around 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.649
 to operate properly 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.349
 It has to be clean because if I kill it 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.630
 to lean on the fence it decreases and 

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:56.979
 even cancel the electricity by making a 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.959
 Earth 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.770
 peaks with access to 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:03.099
 pasture 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.140
 the animals will socialize and perform 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:07.349
 their inherent functions to the species of 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.330
 exploration of the environment 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:12.910
 This dynamic minimizes stress and 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.120
 competition between pigs 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.450
 effectively reduce 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.870
 vary according to each 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.420
 credentialing 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.910
 so check carefully which 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.820
 indicated by the 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.860
 your creditor is interesting that the 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.260
 steps have natural shelters with 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.710
 shrubs where animals can 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.860
 hide in times of strong sun 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:41.190
 see the welfare of pigs 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.190
 the pig is an animal that enjoys cleaning 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.760
 and you need to have at your disposal 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.770
 clean for drinking and bathing 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.680
 heat is necessary to maintain the 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.160
 normal body temperature at the 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.560
 swine breeding 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.990
 the production of heat must be 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.090
 religiously observed because we 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.760
 first days of pig life 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.940
 production is insufficient and the 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.920
 newborns can die of cold 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.640
 heat should be complemented by 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.040
 heaters in loose pig farming 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.050
 we can observe more death for lack 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.990
 of artificial heating in the first 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.000
 childhood than by being cold during the 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.950
 winter and they attend the 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.680
 environment 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.350
 in adulthood the loss of this heat is 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.990
 insufficient and animals may die 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.660
 heat if the building is not 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.700
 thermal comfort 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.260
 obtained through coverages that 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.260
 mainly must be of origin 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.070
 through curtains of events and 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.080
 shadows on the roofs of the 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.600
 white house farm this is achieved 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.810
 with the elephantgrass plantation in the 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.930
 place of stronger winds on site 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.239
 neighboring the leucena trees promotes 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.930
 shading of the roof favoring a 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.209
 nice atmosphere swine 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.670
 due to the heat felt by the animals is 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.300
 also very common for them to seek 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.510
 water to cool off at this 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.060
 moment the strong sun finishes 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.070
 to go unnoticed and end up causing 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.950
 lesions on your skin 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.690
 to avoid this you can cover the 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.730
 places of bath water 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.760
 This is done here on the farm of two 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.870
 ways one through shade you like 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.449
 on here 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.320
 and another more economically and recently 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:36.990
 tested is the use of palm leaves 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.940
 this is an example of material but you 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.250
 you can use another substitute 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.250
 available on your property or region
