00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.970
 tutorial voucher maker that pretty 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.590
 installation of the x king and good that does 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.390
 we are in full what it does is that 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.510
 when we are with a key 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.010
 so we'll activate a x ray that 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.800
 we could see where all of them are 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.470
 materials of the map since the diamond 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.990
 the iron the gold the coal and everything in 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.759
 precious materials for simply what 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.249
 we will see everything perfectly and we know by 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.320
 where did I come to that if I do not recommend you 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:32.239
 To use this sea ​​a lot is worthwhile because 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.670
 grace of this game is to mine and search 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.070
 all materials little by little but good 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.780
 everyone plays as he likes too 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.640
 You have to comment, it's wrong, it's not 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.950
 it is very well seen to use it in 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.110
 multiplayer since they could vary 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.330
 the administrators because I could take out 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.420
 all materials from several zones without 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:53.390
 leave nothing to the other players and of course 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.520
 the ministers could bathe you but every 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.370
 you use this mode on your own and your 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.440
 responsibility and good everyone does what 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.660
 what you want to install is worth 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.110
 first we have to download some 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.330
 dogmas the king x and the minister force 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.850
 that here I will leave these two link vélez 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.220
 in the description of the video and good or what 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.550
 downloads you put in a folder like 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.580
 I have done here x raid worth you would have 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.490
 these two files and that if I go to 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.710
 do tutoring voucher for version 17 10 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.020
 but this tutorial would also serve to 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.510
 future versions may already be 1819 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.060
 since the installation method is the 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.610
 same in all well then let's go to 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.190
 install this to install forge voucher 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.660
 I'm going to install it fast but if 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.360
 you want everything in detail in the 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.310
 description of the video you have a video 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.460
 tutorial on how to install for gto 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.460
 in detail good is secondary button 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.850
 about forge open with the open with the 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.920
 java and opens this little window we give it 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.899
 here install client default route 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.660
 where minecraft is installed and accept 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.030
 library is worth a download to 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.670
 force hey would be now to install 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.369
 the x raid is worth putting it inside 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.560
 the forge mods folder but first 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.440
 we have to create by the folder many 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.790
 of strength that would be starting the main 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.210
 for the first time 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.820
 [Music] 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.820
 and once it starts we give it here edit 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.860
 profile and we select by version 17 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.040
 day or the version that you are going to use 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.040
 more forge as we see here full we give 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.110
 now jungle profile and we see starts the 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.040
 version 17 diego the version they use 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.810
 more forge comes from doha play now it 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.680
 would be creating by the match folder 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:45.810
 to be able to install then the former king in a 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.810
 we see this little window that starts 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.450
 and we see here has to install microphones 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.220
 it's worth 3 mods of version 17 10 and we see 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.909
 here the three default modes of the 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.280
 minecraft del jorge good you're going to do 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.630
 this because it will install the x king that 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.450
 take out the client 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.810
 we close now what needs to be done is 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.090
 press the windows + key and do not 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.230
 come out this little window run here 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.870
 we put percentage app data percentage and 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.570
 we give you accept ok here we go to the 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.630
 minecraft point folder and here we go to 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.460
 the mods folder that was just created 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.470
 now to start for the first time 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.800
 reinforce and nothing here simply 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.630
 we copied the x king that we have not come down and 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.450
 we paste it here 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.400
 and already be installed how easy it is now 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.730
 we simply start what is the 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.459
 client 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.200
 and we select the saddlebag profile that 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.569
 we see here it's going to start about seven 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.569
 days as is ok we will accept 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.860
 as we see here we now have four more 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:59.200
 let's put four more and 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:03.099
 low that if we see the three forge more 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.260
 the x king is worth that would be normal though 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.690
 be in red works equally you 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.810
 we give one more player here the map of x 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.090
 king 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.459
 and we already see here that is working 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.709
 we see up there on the left 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.239
 coordinates that these to know the 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.070
 coordinates where do we go in each 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.930
 moment though if we go movements 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.460
 well we know in what coordinates and not 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.850
 we will have to give it the effect of 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.860
 pass them 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.780
 then we have another option is valid for 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.530
 remove and put coordinates that is 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:35.790
 pressing the key j let's go 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:40.110
 changing coordinate function the 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.390
 fps the songs are changing even what 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.870
 you can remove it like that and if this bothers you 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.330
 the window the coordinates are worth other 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:52.620
 functionalities that we press of key 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:55.200
 x we see all the materials down there 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.550
 as we see here the coal would be 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.600
 iron below be the lapis lazuli the 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.030
 parrot 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.490
 and below, I suppose I will be 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.370
 the diamond but from this height it does not 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:13.150
 see but the diamond and the reason now that 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.940
 it has been charged more is worth another function today 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.770
 the X is given four times we remove it 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.230
 another function of this one 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.129
 of the x-raid ale is that if we press the 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:25.939
 key 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:28.550
 we see the cave mode that we see here 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:31.249
 all the games are you that we see there and 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.009
 we do not know where to mine and all the 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:35.340
 little squares where they are already chopped and everything 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:38.880
 this 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:42.360
 press the ce key and it would be 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.580
 removed the cave mode now we can see 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:49.340
 where all the circuits of the 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.340
 rest simply press the r key 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.380
 and we see there ahead it is worth a 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.690
 reston circuit that we would know that there 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.880
 there's a subtraction circuit and there's no 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.120
 apply it because we could fuck then the 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:06.640
 circuit was we would already know and 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.880
 then have a function of giving the 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:13.450
 key l for when we are in these 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:17.050
 caves all dark because if we give the 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:19.360
 air because it lights up everything is as if not 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.420
 there would be darkness and good we can continue 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.100
 on all sides 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.870
 very good people I hope that I have 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.820
 liked this tutorial since he explained 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.820
 perfectly how to install the mod and 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.160
 how all this works and good we 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:35.330
 we see in another video subscribe to give you 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.330
 light and come see you
