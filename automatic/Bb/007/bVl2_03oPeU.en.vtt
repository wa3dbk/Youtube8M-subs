00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.290
 Hello everyone guys came this 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.300
 minecraft portal today we are here for 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.160
 talk about another fashion day 172 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.010
 very interesting and very fast it 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.990
 same then this fashion adds us in 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.880
 practice a little embellishment in the 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.009
 our homes in our world because of the 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.960
 end but also 8 we know he said then 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.260
 we always need something to embellish 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.690
 not only technical mounts and so this one 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.050
 motorcycle what introduces us this way yes 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.360
 call white papers as the name implies 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.370
 it would be background however in practice it would be 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.020
 the wallpaper indeed wallpaper 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.879
 Wall paper is precisely this fashion is 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.359
 reasoning 172 is an example of the 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.370
 same color as the previous fashions of 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.739
 this fashion is very simple to 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.100
 use in the sense then as 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.910
 we can see genius in hand or 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.040
 object and I will show you how 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.470
 it is therefore very easy to handle three pieces of 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.470
 paper and three by nando 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.630
 of any color then decide if 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.850
 you are then now that they use creatives 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.710
 so I will not consume them, I will 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.120
 understand more or less how you work 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.410
 you can place this beautiful 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:27.290
 supernumerary shop and nothing here 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.130
 special with colors for example like 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.620
 the yellow 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.600
 you can color your design 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.600
 practice your card from us 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.250
 the same thing applies to wallpaper instead 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.700
 example who now why they connect 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.140
 they will become from the same color 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.450
 rightly you will consume this network 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.820
 always remember this if you want 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.350

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.210
 palarie card you can do in this 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.460
 link way link over that card 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.259
 of will consume a new year card 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.800
 will reciprocate with texture in that 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:02.580
 following even looked at color 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:05.780
