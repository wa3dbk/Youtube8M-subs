solution at the same time you dip in the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.000 
solution at the same time you dip in the
tip<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.730> anode<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> solution<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:52.649> sure

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
tip of the anode in the solution be sure

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.090 
tip of the anode in the solution be sure
that<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.760> doesn't<00:00:54.059> touch<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.899> coin<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.860> you

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
that it doesn't touch the coin and you

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.060 
that it doesn't touch the coin and you
live<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:57.000> can<00:00:57.239> see<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.800> gold

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
up you can pull it out once in a while

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.920 
up you can pull it out once in a while
check<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:06.299> out

cold<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:39.479> as<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.930> said<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.610> really<00:01:41.610> really

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
cold it's as I said it's a really really

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.749 
cold it's as I said it's a really really
easy<00:01:42.320> process

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
easy process

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.249 
easy process
no<00:01:45.350> it's<00:01:46.350> same<00:01:46.710> process<00:01:47.310> cause<00:01:47.579> with<00:01:47.820> every

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
no it's same process cause with every

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.560 
no it's same process cause with every
plating<00:01:49.259> system<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:50.250> we<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.610> like<00:01:50.850> 30<00:01:51.149> amp

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
plating system that we have like 30 amp

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.090 
plating system that we have like 30 amp
60<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.530> then<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.520> two<00:01:54.000> am<00:01:54.210> five<00:01:54.720> am

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
60 and then we have like two am five am

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.800 
60 and then we have like two am five am
process<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.460> same<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.780> only

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
process it's the same the only

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.980 
process it's the same the only
difference<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:59.130> when<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.880> have<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> sixty<00:02:00.869> I'm

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
difference is when you have a sixty I'm

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.350 
difference is when you have a sixty I'm
plating<00:02:01.380> machine<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.490> one<00:02:02.549> or<00:02:03.060> thirty

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
plating machine like this one or thirty

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.020 
plating machine like this one or thirty
amp<00:02:03.659> like<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.170> one<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.770> makes<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.520> difference

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
amp like this one it makes a difference

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.180 
amp like this one it makes a difference
that<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.329> can<00:02:06.360> do<00:02:06.719> much<00:02:07.220> larger<00:02:08.220> parts<00:02:09.050> also

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
that you can do much larger parts also

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.990 
that you can do much larger parts also
with<00:02:11.190> some<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.910> plating<00:02:12.450> machine

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
with some of the plating machine

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.170
