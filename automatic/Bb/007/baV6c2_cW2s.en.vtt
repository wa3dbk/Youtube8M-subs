 lemon 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.409

 essences and a spoon to measure 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.880
 the 60th this formula I want to dedicate 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.979
 especially to rubÃ©n marta and nereida de 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.540
 tarragona because I know they are about 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.580
 indefatigable workers of the 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.289
 energies and they will like the formula and the 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.050
 wood ready to test I'm going to 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:50.270
 put first 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:53.049
 three quarters or three 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.049
 quarter 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.690
 put the essences in the first place I'm going to 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:03.390
 put a teaspoon of essence of 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:07.440

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.440
 and calm discussions 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.920
 a teaspoon of lavender essence 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.520
 a teaspoon of lemon essence that 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.730
 purify clean and remove the energies 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.730
 negative 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.400
 a teaspoon of orange blossom that is 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.860
 fantastic to improve relationships 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.450
 between people calm 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.450
 and offers harmony 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.390
 half teaspoon of clove essence 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.170
 that offer protection and stabilize 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.170
 positive energies 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.299
 3 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.890
 and a half teaspoon of cinnamon 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.890
 which is fantastic to sweeten 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.330
 mix well to dissolve the 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.670
 metal or powder essences 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.430
 and let's add a few drops of 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.060
 glycerin as a fixative I'm going to 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.060
 add seven drops 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.920
 do not overdo the glycerin 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.340
 because if there is not very print bozzo 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.340
 touch 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.380
 you see how it is taking the golden color 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.970
 and now I'm going to add a glass A 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.790
 quarter of distilled water the water is 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:03.400
 I'm adding little by little so I do not know 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:07.739
 precipitate so that it does not turn white 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.739
 and I'm stirring slowly little by little 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.590
 so that it is perfect 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:22.850
 although it is that if you rushed white 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.850
 you can add a tad more alcohol 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.440
 to clarify 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.680
 To decorate the bottle you must include 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.960
 a few petals of roses to remind us 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.410
 that love is the energy that unites it 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.820
 everything and that heals everything and a few crusts 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.820
 citrus orange peel 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.080
 perfect I put another one 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.920
 and the flowery water is already going to leave 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.830
 sit overnight to finish 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:02.770
 to hunt the essences and finish 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.919
 mix well and once 24 hours pass 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.500
 will be ready to use just 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:11.860
 label florid water to cleaning 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.080
 ipad harmony external use and you're ready 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.260
 to use it can be stored in the closet 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.000
 always away from sunlight if you want 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.590
 that is a little more practical you can 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.120
 pass it to an atomizer a sprayer 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.770
 and so we can take the bottle from here 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.320
 over there without any problem I just 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.660
 to pass it to this plastic bottle 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.160
 and so I remember having on the altars or 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.410
 If I'm not traveling, I have to make you 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.890
 some house cleaning or spraying 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.060
 some business forever is a lot 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.880
 more practice 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:45.250
 You see murray florida water is 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.720
 fantastic but florida water 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.430
 homemade is not far behind 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.919
 if you are going to use it to make 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.720
 spoils I advise that while going 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.820
 pulverizing, the 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.660
 prayer that runs the water that runs the 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.010
 Water 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.630
 it is a prayer that I have published many 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.850
 times on the channel in other videos 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.040
 you can also pray another type of 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.660
 prayers but if we use water 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.640
 florida in combination with the prayers 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.680
 it is always more effective and multiplies 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.560
 The effect can be used for many 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.840
 things serve for tired feet with 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.760
 burning sensation we can pulverize 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.170
 us feet for skin care 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.240
 because it takes into account that the essences 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.340
 who are healers we can also 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.080
 use them on the skin too 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.390
 we can pulverize the room of the 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.360
 children or the elderly or 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.830
 sick to renew the energies 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.960
 we can also spray on the 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.090
 cervical are the hands if we have 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.000
 headaches also also 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.310
 we can pulverize the pillow or use it 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.540
 as a colony before going to sleep if 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.570
 we have nightmare dreams 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:46.510
 unpleasant we can also spray 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.910
 about clothes after washing them because 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.340
 it gives a light touch also we can 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.320
 use after the bath after the 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.750
 spray shower us to stay clean 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.090
 and purified when we have a fever and 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:01.540
 we can also associate the 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:04.030
 is classic to the water of Colombia of 1800 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.410
 because it comes from there the formula seems 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.199
 as if it were a cologne water of 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.880
 children and the moment you start to 

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:12.070
 use it as a spiritual vehicle 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.800
 you will see it with different eyes because in its 

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:18.520
 results are fantastic I hope that you 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:21.389
 serve and see you in the next video 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.389
 see you soon
