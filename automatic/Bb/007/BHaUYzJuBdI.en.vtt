packages and then you can do it you can
build<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.559> car<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.890> stages<00:00:53.370> really<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.760> make<00:00:53.850> it

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
build a car in stages really to make it

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.720 
build a car in stages really to make it
easier<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.449> more<00:00:55.110> affordable<00:00:55.469> for<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
easier and more affordable for the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.260 
easier and more affordable for the
average<00:00:56.760> person<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.690> like<00:00:58.910> we<00:00:59.910> haven't<00:01:00.180> even

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
average person it's like we haven't even

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.270 
average person it's like we haven't even
ever<00:01:00.690> considered<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.230> yet<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:01.770> I'm<00:01:01.859> sure<00:01:01.920> we

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
ever considered that yet but I'm sure we

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.009 
ever considered that yet but I'm sure we
it<00:01:02.760> wouldn't<00:01:03.000> be<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> bad<00:01:03.300> thing<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.539> do<00:01:03.750> really

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
it wouldn't be a bad thing to do really

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.620 
it wouldn't be a bad thing to do really
I<00:01:04.320> mean<00:01:05.129> it's<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.339> nice<00:01:05.489> idea<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.450> get

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
I mean it's a nice idea that you can get

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.260 
I mean it's a nice idea that you can get
a<00:01:06.689> bespoke<00:01:07.170> personal<00:01:08.130> commission<00:01:08.729> fit<00:01:09.119> your

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
a bespoke personal commission fit your

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.420 
a bespoke personal commission fit your
body<00:01:09.479> everything<00:01:10.020> absolutely<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:11.130> that

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
body everything absolutely is that

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.160 
body everything absolutely is that
that's<00:01:11.729> why<00:01:11.909> we<00:01:12.030> planned<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.630> we<00:01:12.720> kind<00:01:13.080> of

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
that's why we planned it and we kind of

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.399 
that's why we planned it and we kind of
built<00:01:13.409> modeled<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.610> our<00:01:15.060> own<00:01:15.119> superpro<00:01:16.049> car

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
built modeled it on our own superpro car

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.240 
built modeled it on our own superpro car
that<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:16.890> built<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.189> few<00:01:17.340> years<00:01:17.400> ago<00:01:17.700> now<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:19.250> as

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
that we built a few years ago now and as

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.740 
that we built a few years ago now and as
soon<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.820> finish<00:01:21.000> building<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.420> car<00:01:21.600> you

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
soon as you finish building a car you

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.730 
soon as you finish building a car you
think<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.049> all<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.229> clever<00:01:22.409> things<00:01:22.619> you

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
think of all the clever things you

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.990 
think of all the clever things you
should<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:22.979> done<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.670> think<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.970> a

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
should have done and you think of a

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.640 
should have done and you think of a
better<00:01:24.119> way<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.330> do<00:01:24.509> something<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
better way to do something and so the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.130 
better way to do something and so the
new<00:01:25.770> car<00:01:26.009> has<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> lot<00:01:26.460> more<00:01:26.670> ideas<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.600> we've

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
new car has a lot more ideas that we've

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.050 
new car has a lot more ideas that we've
put<00:01:28.350> into<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.740> ourselves<00:01:28.890> Scott<00:01:29.610> does<00:01:29.790> CAD

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
put into it ourselves Scott does CAD

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.300 
put into it ourselves Scott does CAD
drawing<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.780> we've<00:01:30.960> drawn<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.740> chassis<00:01:32.100> up

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
drawing so we've drawn the chassis up

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.240 
drawing so we've drawn the chassis up
and<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.790> get<00:01:33.270> thrown<00:01:33.600> brackets<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.710> tabs<00:01:34.950> and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
and and get thrown brackets and tabs and

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.399 
and and get thrown brackets and tabs and
stuff<00:01:35.400> or<00:01:35.579> manufactured<00:01:36.450> specifically<00:01:37.170> for

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
stuff or manufactured specifically for

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.080 
stuff or manufactured specifically for
the<00:01:37.500> dragster<00:01:37.860> project<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:38.850> a

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
the dragster project and so we have a

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.450 
the dragster project and so we have a
whole<00:01:39.450> stock<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:40.049> parts<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.590> will<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.340> know

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
whole stock of parts that will you know

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.179 
whole stock of parts that will you know
shift<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.180> mounts<00:01:42.600> parachute<00:01:43.140> males<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
shift the mounts parachute males the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.399 
shift the mounts parachute males the
idea<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.090> make<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.509> first<00:01:45.750> stage<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
idea is to make the first stage of the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.060 
idea is to make the first stage of the
car<00:01:46.649> as<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:47.420> as<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.479> bare<00:01:48.869> chassis<00:01:49.290> with<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.799> body

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
car as a as a bare chassis with the body

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.520 
car as a as a bare chassis with the body
and<00:01:50.430> then<00:01:51.030> mounts<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.140> absolutely

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
and then mounts for absolutely

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.810 
and then mounts for absolutely
everything<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.100> engine<00:01:53.399> mounts<00:01:53.700> are

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
everything so the engine mounts are

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.700 
everything so the engine mounts are
there<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.299> brake<00:01:54.600> mounts<00:01:55.020> are<00:01:55.140> there<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.649> you

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
there the brake mounts are there so you

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.469 
there the brake mounts are there so you
haven't<00:01:56.130> got<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> single<00:01:56.790> thing<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
car once you get it apart from assemble

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.800 
car once you get it apart from assemble
it<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.700> makes<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.909> easy<00:02:00.119> for<00:02:00.299> everybody<00:02:00.600> so
