00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.170

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:16.890
 dahlan the episode 1 desert desert 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:20.189
 so that's crocodile to you and the other day 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.080
 was on the desert adventure 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.920
 experience and the uci is very dangerous 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.400
 you have to know 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.099
 But the biggest danger in the desert is 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.759
 the boredom already many before him 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.290
 had bored to death 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.460
 but the concert coco then not to the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:42.840
 happen because he always has his 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:50.100
 Formed employee for dinner 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:54.050
 it was also sand cake he was looking for 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.050
 a comfortable accommodation for the night 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.110
 and then already also broke the next 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.750
 day and coco it was back 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.990
 meanwhile had seeds in the desert 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.479
 crocodile to the big thirst and there too 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.710
 he knew how to help himself 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.630
 He took his carving and 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.520
 carved a bowl of water and there 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.740
 times in the desert very sparingly 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.540
 must take a big one with water 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.540
 swallowed and washed his hands in it 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:45.770
 There are many animals in the desert 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:51.560
 example, the predator or the 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:54.740
 chameleon or even the most dangerous 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.590
 animal of the desert namely the desert profile 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.110
 and suddenly crocodile stood up to the 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.159
 directly across from such a colossus 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.560
 desert and looked the crocodile in the eyes 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.259
 from face to face and what makes 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:19.670
 you are correct in such a situation 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:22.010
 first 111 ii then coco turned to there 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.730
 the one old trick he still has 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.319
 knew and indeed took a start and let 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.180
 to swallow the alligator because 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.950
 in a crocodile is the only place where 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:37.430
 To be absolutely safe from a crocodile 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:39.290
 the next day was the crocodile 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.200
 municipal to the long since behind 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.730
 left and it was hot again and the 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.109
 did not continue in the meantime was 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.310
 hungry and had great thirst and 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:50.690
 opened up in search of 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.690
 to make people 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.480
 He wanted to go back to civilization 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.850
 in the end then be 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:04.730
 pyramid actually and was sure 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:10.690
 people lived closer here 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:18.290
 and he saw a driver in the front yard 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:20.620
 middle guinea and tapped him from behind 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:24.200
 in the face 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:28.400
 the pharaoh turned around and he was 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.260
 actually quite friendly told 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.000
 a little overview of the driver where he 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.980
 was 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.960
 300 years old and never been ill 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.960
 His name was Tutankhamun 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.480
 it gets even better 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:55.990
 the driver was inventive and inventive 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.130
 his greatest invention was the bicycle 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:01.750
 which we also the humorous 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.750
 peak of the evening 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.860
 scene applause 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.520
 the driver wore or to the one in the 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.410
 Pyramid and they drank a drink that 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:22.940
 a specialty was a harmonic one 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.520
 Grain Grain grain and you carry 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.770
 several glasses of it and sometime was 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:33.770
 the driver drunk he just talked 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:35.840
 incomprehensible stuff had a cup at the 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.820
 no more desire and fell off again 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.560
 back out into the desert again in the 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.220
 wilderness and built a safe 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.110
 accommodation for the night 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.970
 the next day brutal to the election 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.720
 between on the verge of madness 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.850
 Madness can be said 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.050
 he just dragged on he was 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.020
 completely dehydrated 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.760
 it was not good for him and you could 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.540
 also say a damocles sword hovers 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.540
 about him 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.620
 He took one last big sip 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:11.080
 salt in stock flask and he knew 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.080
 not anymore what was real 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.270
 it was illusion and he pinched his eyes 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:22.150
 together and back at the horizon could 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:24.039
 he knew something and that he knew 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.210
 not exactly on his father morgana or 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.960
 not and that is a juice shop 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.070
 small children had him there 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:35.139
 set up and often spent it and 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.430
 crocodile to the dragged himself with 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:43.180
 Last power continued and it was still 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.190
 three meters, two meters and another 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:51.780
 meter 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:51.780
 There he said with his last strength apple juice
