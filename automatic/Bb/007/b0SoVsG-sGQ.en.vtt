00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
in and being a starter so it's it's thin

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.200 
in and being a starter so it's it's thin
right<00:02:50.780> now<00:02:50.810> it's<00:02:51.470> unproven<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.550> that's<00:02:53.030> my

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
right now it's unproven and that's my

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.780 
right now it's unproven and that's my
biggest<00:02:53.480> question<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:54.200> think<00:02:54.740> outside<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.640> say

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790
