done<00:00:42.850> with<00:00:43.210> it<00:00:46.830> so<00:00:47.830> still<00:00:48.550> do<00:00:48.820> with<00:00:49.000> this

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:49.180 
done with it so still do with this

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.530 
done with it so still do with this
bundle<00:00:49.450> of<00:00:49.780> stuff<00:00:49.989> but<00:00:51.090> got<00:00:52.090> everything

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
bundle of stuff but got everything

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
bundle of stuff but got everything
filled<00:00:52.840> up<00:00:53.230> so<00:00:53.980> we'll<00:00:54.579> let<00:00:54.730> it<00:00:54.790> dry<00:00:55.120> and

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
filled up so we'll let it dry and

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.140 
filled up so we'll let it dry and
probably<00:00:56.560> sand<00:00:56.829> everything<00:00:57.130> down<00:00:57.310> again

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
probably sand everything down again

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.979 
probably sand everything down again
tomorrow

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
tomorrow

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.300 
tomorrow
get<00:00:59.710> it<00:00:59.829> off<00:00:59.950> moved<00:01:00.340> out<00:01:01.680> but<00:01:02.680> I<00:01:02.860> know<00:01:03.040> how<00:01:03.130> that

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
get it off moved out but I know how that

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.200 
get it off moved out but I know how that
go

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
go

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.630 
go
so<00:01:06.210> that's<00:01:06.390> what<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.690> got<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.620> a<00:01:07.890> shiner

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
so that's what we got it's a shiner

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.450 
so that's what we got it's a shiner
but<00:01:09.240> you<00:01:10.200> know<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.380> still<00:01:10.440> got<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> couple<00:01:11.070> spots

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
but you know I still got a couple spots

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.040 
but you know I still got a couple spots
where<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.760> probably<00:01:11.940> could<00:01:12.300> have<00:01:12.330> did<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> little

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
where I probably could have did a little

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.740 
where I probably could have did a little
better<00:01:13.200> with<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.530> bondo<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.340> I'm<00:01:15.180> not<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> body

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
better with the bondo but I'm not a body

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.630 
better with the bondo but I'm not a body
person<00:01:16.200> right<00:01:16.380> now<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.650> hate<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.100> give<00:01:17.460> up<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
person right now I hate to give up the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.830 
person right now I hate to give up the
bondo<00:01:18.030> but<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.720> redo<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.470> one<00:01:19.620> day<00:01:19.800> but<00:01:20.690> got<00:01:21.690> my

bondo but I redo it one day but got my

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:30.320 
bondo but I redo it one day but got my
switch<00:01:22.910> you<00:01:23.910> can<00:01:24.000> see<00:01:24.260> if<00:01:25.260> that<00:01:25.620> come<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:29.330> right

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
switch you can see if that come on right

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.880 
switch you can see if that come on right
now<00:01:30.510> it's<00:01:30.720> just<00:01:30.780> showing<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.260> star<00:01:31.560> screen

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
now it's just showing the star screen

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.500 
now it's just showing the star screen
because<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.490> got<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.670> USB<00:01:33.120> thing

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
because I just got this USB thing

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.160 
because I just got this USB thing
holding<00:01:34.070> powering<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.160> up<00:01:35.330> but<00:01:36.330> I<00:01:36.660> get<00:01:37.140> a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
holding powering it up but I get a

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.480 
holding powering it up but I get a
charge<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.620> fighting<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.980> little<00:01:38.130> bit<00:01:38.660> but

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
charge of fighting a little bit but

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.970 
charge of fighting a little bit but
switch<00:01:41.490> turns<00:01:41.880> back<00:01:42.210> off<00:01:45.500> so<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.620> will<00:01:46.860> be

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
switch turns back off so this will be

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.490 
switch turns back off so this will be
looking<00:01:47.190> like<00:01:49.100> if<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.400> come<00:01:50.730> on<00:01:50.910> just<00:01:51.300> fine<00:01:51.540> work

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
looking like if I come on just fine work

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:00.520 
looking like if I come on just fine work
regular

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530

so<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:01.860> got<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.040> good<00:02:02.220> little<00:02:02.460> side<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.970> it

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
so it's got a good little side to it

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:16.190 
so it's got a good little side to it
turn<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.920> light<00:02:05.159> off<00:02:13.040> just<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.160> side<00:02:14.400> note<00:02:15.200> this

I'll under the bottom so you don't have
been<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.090> suggested<00:02:24.569> get<00:02:24.750> some<00:02:24.959> just<00:02:25.380> 194

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
been that suggested get some just 194

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.540 
been that suggested get some just 194
LEDs<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.780> rear<00:02:28.170> bright<00:02:28.620> compared<00:02:29.310> to

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
LEDs and the rear bright compared to

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.610 
LEDs and the rear bright compared to
today<00:02:30.420> stock<00:02:30.750> light<00:02:31.019> up<00:02:31.230> there<00:02:32.030> but<00:02:33.350> yeah<00:02:34.350> this
