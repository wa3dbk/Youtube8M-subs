 dear gaming friends of my sirius and 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.040
 this is the daily news on 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.550
 Wednesday afternoon hopefully today 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.290
 themes like witcher 3 rainbow six there are 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.910
 what about battlefield or you can too 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:21.990
 great mario now in the browser game 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.400
 or maybe you could 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.779
 can you still remember that 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.029
 she has already reported that 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.369
 because it is currently on a community map 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.900
 for battlefield 4 does not work 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.880
 for the current hotline but for the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.710
 predecessor and has become the community 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.140
 now for a jungle setting 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.270
 pronounced and thus becomes for the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.460
 conquest mode equipped or 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.649
 mainly designed multiplayer 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.200
 map just received a jungle setting 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.120
 with an ancient temple with waterfalls 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.020
 a ghost town and what ever so 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.789
 will belong ubisoft has now too 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.219
 officially the assassin's creed 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.320
 chronicles trilogy presented and yes 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.629
 right it is not called triology one 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.300
 love friends sun trilogy and that 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.100
 is just this 2d scroller so want 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.479
 so side to side with the assassin 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.280
 and ubisoft calls it that 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.770
 interestingly, a two and a half 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.340
 disc roller and it will total in 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.540
 Three areas are playing while you three 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.890
 truly masterful assassins 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.869
 stories will play after and 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.729
 The whole thing will start in China and 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.900
 of course there was a guess guess 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.900
 a gameplay trailer 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.530
 why did you stay at ubisoft because 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.490
 they have a new gameplay trailer 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.140
 expand to rainbow six is ​​just running 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.280
 I have already uploaded next door 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.860
 I have many comments underneath 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.840
 people like to read how 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.220
 hardliners with cs go or call of 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.869
 duty and so on and so forth 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.579
 and honestly my life friend 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.619
 rainbow six somehow looks in mine 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.810
 Look like rainbow six and that's why 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.910
 I have only ten tonight 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.400
 minutes of vegas 2 included 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.250
 play was 2008 as a successor of the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.870
 In 2006, vegas came out where you can 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.860
 quite simply can see that it 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.959
 at least one too 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.819
 singleplayer campaign enormously tactical 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.980
 going on that's always comes that 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.019
 to position teammates correctly 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.700
 and such stories so if he bock 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.989
 I have uploaded it to myself anyway 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.010
 think very well I 'm looking forward mega 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.810
 The title has to be quite simple now 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.340
 let's say and ubisoft has at the same time 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.170
 said that she is also a collector's 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.690
 edition will be published then 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.519
 fittingly, with a 120-sided 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.519
 tactician comes from 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.989
 so I do not know yet if I am 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.280
 dare this trailer with in the daily 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.720
 maybe incorporate news for five 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.280
 seconds very big with sound 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.750
 otherwise I have the whole thing up 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.090
 facebook uploaded and I think so 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.480
 Pretty cool and that is the tv 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.060
 spot for the upcoming mortal kombat 10 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.680
 and goes really really cool off 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.049
 and live action trailer where the people 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.280
 have a look and say half time 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.750
 and i like it enormously i like it 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.340
 my facebook page uploaded though 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.109
 So you really want to check it out 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.760
 for me that was the trailer of the week 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.760
 That's why the news also appears 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.060
 short press release from home 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.579
 activision on the topic of call of duty and 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.549
 although is currently since 31 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:53.000
 march the newest and second call 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.489

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.140
 exclusive time on xbox live 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.579
 The whole thing seemed like 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.920
 usually four multiplayer maps and the 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.180
 killing around zombie killing and such 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.980
 continue and immediately you can coach 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.930
 check or download or whatever 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.930
 you so bock to join 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.910
 so now a message with me 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.320
 personally just do not start anything anymore 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.470
 can and indeed here comes then so what 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.000
 purely from square enix, something like love 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.190
 Press media representatives and indeed happy 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.890
 to announce that from now on 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:33.110
 final fantasy 14 reborn the update 2.5 5 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.810
 is present and therefore the whole on 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.090
 and I do not know your opinion 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.350
 keeps current final fantasy playing 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.550
 I like to be there 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.780
 a little better assess whether that in 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.110
 future also next to news 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.800
 there will be a whole series 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:52.580
 of 9 and short info switcher 23 of 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.440
 senior game designer damien monier on 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.940
 twitter took the time to ask your questions 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.380
 to answer directly live and that were 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.550
 Last night they also have it over 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.990
 the german facebook page for example 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.940
 you could then post on 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.240
 Inquire in English and it became 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.290
 I really answer in a jiffy 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.050
 I'll just get a few points 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.940
 the giga appeal to you 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.250
 German side has summarized and 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.770
 Although the fighting system of dark souls 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.470
 had a very big influence on that 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.810
 pfizer 3 what I like very much 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.919
 find interesting and the npcs in the 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.510
 game world were due to the 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.580
 individuality and one's own 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.570
 daily sequences the largest technical 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.370
 challenge the witch to horses 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.590
 are for example those signs skills 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.800
 by gerald like the character art just like that 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.990
 How to walk the ps4 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.510
 Gameplay was relatively little so far 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.130
 was shown no problems 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.710
 that would have been just a coincidence 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.780
 they have said now and they are planning 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.430
 currently not the first two 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.960
 parts for playstation 4 to 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.490
 then simply portion them 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.940
 We'll take care of it now 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.580
 witcher 3 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:59.140
 Everything that comes afterwards, we will become ourselves 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.140
 then take care of it 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.650
 it was still possible at the beginning of the week 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.210
 Super Mario in the caution in the browser too 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.030
 if they do not hear that 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.460
 should have a fan has a quasi 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.390
 a hd-remake made by her completely 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.860
 just that part not yet 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.140
 Download had but it was 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.300
 Really in your internet browser 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.800
 So play bye bye real life 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.420
 work could be said if you have this 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.780
 left clicked in between times 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.160
 Now, of course, who's surprised Sony has 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.290
 there on the plaster hewn said 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.880
 man that was really only the first 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.340
 level of the type has as fan projectes 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.110
 first level in hd recreated that one 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.730
 could play and nintendo has been there 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.280
 Of course, immediately before closing 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:49.050
 pulled and said copyright strike was 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.150
 Of course, neither their good right is 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.220
 if everyone says yes now 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:55.170
 my face does not turn out completely 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.460
 that was funny on the browser too 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.650
 Play that was really cool 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.910
 you can still download it you can 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:04.140
 While not a browser game you can 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:05.520
 but always on pc gambling but yes there 

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.350
 it was still a relative for me yesterday 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.530
 sad news and that will be the 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:12.540
 leave anne from giga giga games and 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.610
 in the direction of hamburg on the job 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.960
 that would actually have to pull from me 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.240
 but thumbs down to give the 

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.830
 of course wish him all the best for 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.080
 But that would be your option 

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:25.110
 to learn that from the first time 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:26.910
 to take over the giga news in berlin 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.560
 Maybe something will happen that 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.970

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.770

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:40.080
 that I listed you as a giga partner 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.430
