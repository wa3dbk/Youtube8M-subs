I<00:04:50.220> recently<00:04:50.640> found<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:51.390> this<00:04:52.020> could<00:04:52.169> be

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
I recently found and this could be

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.010 
I recently found and this could be
purchased<00:04:52.500> on<00:04:52.919> Western<00:04:53.610> calm<00:04:53.940> as<00:04:54.180> usual<00:04:54.780> it

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
purchased on Western calm as usual it

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.900 
purchased on Western calm as usual it
feels<00:04:55.350> like<00:04:55.650> if<00:04:55.830> you<00:04:55.950> wear<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.340> foundation

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
feels like if you wear the foundation

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.570 
feels like if you wear the foundation
your<00:04:57.090> skin<00:04:57.120> can<00:04:57.600> breathe<00:04:57.810> through<00:04:58.290> so<00:04:59.100> I<00:04:59.310> think

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
your skin can breathe through so I think

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.610 
your skin can breathe through so I think
that<00:05:00.000> is<00:05:00.150> just<00:05:00.180> amazing<00:05:00.720> and<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.229> finish<00:05:01.500> of

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
that is just amazing and the finish of

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.070 
that is just amazing and the finish of
this<00:05:01.830> is<00:05:02.070> very<00:05:02.400> natural<00:05:02.880> it's<00:05:03.150> not<00:05:03.300> matte<00:05:03.810> it's

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
this is very natural it's not matte it's

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.680 
this is very natural it's not matte it's
not<00:05:04.290> overly<00:05:04.680> dewy<00:05:05.130> and<00:05:05.520> I<00:05:06.090> think<00:05:06.330> it<00:05:06.479> could

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
not overly dewy and I think it could

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.200 
not overly dewy and I think it could
depend<00:05:06.840> on<00:05:07.350> your<00:05:07.770> skin<00:05:08.190> type<00:05:08.400> if<00:05:08.550> you<00:05:08.640> have<00:05:08.910> dry

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
depend on your skin type if you have dry

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.090 
depend on your skin type if you have dry
skin<00:05:09.479> and<00:05:09.510> you<00:05:09.810> build<00:05:10.080> enough<00:05:10.560> of<00:05:10.770> your

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
skin and you build enough of your

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.590 
skin and you build enough of your
moisture<00:05:11.280> on<00:05:11.729> their<00:05:11.910> knees<00:05:12.060> this<00:05:12.330> could

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
moisture on their knees this could

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.260 
moisture on their knees this could
really<00:05:12.840> like<00:05:13.280> enhance<00:05:14.280> that<00:05:14.550> moisturize

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
really like enhance that moisturize

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.690 
really like enhance that moisturize
effect<00:05:15.780> and<00:05:16.140> if<00:05:16.380> you<00:05:16.530> have<00:05:16.680> oily<00:05:17.070> skin<00:05:17.460> this

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
effect and if you have oily skin this
