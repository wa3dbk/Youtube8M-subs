00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
and then effort to not work you know

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.089 
and then effort to not work you know
that<00:04:18.510> that's<00:04:18.720> not<00:04:18.930> good<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:19.349> that's<00:04:19.590> actually

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
that that's not good and that's actually

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.300

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
console that might not work and that's

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.360 
console that might not work and that's
exactly<00:05:51.940> why<00:05:52.390> I'm<00:05:52.600> waiting<00:05:52.990> it's<00:05:53.890> just<00:05:54.190> not

worth it in my opinion but if you got a

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.890 
worth it in my opinion but if you got a
console<00:05:56.890> you<00:05:57.310> got<00:05:57.640> a<00:05:57.670> ps4<00:05:57.970> that<00:05:58.330> actually<00:05:58.690> just
