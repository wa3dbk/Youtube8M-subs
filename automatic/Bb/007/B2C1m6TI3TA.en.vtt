togas<00:03:27.600> still<00:03:27.750> gonna<00:03:27.900> hold<00:03:27.959> at<00:03:28.140> nine<00:03:28.290> chemistry

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
togas still gonna hold at nine chemistry

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.170 
togas still gonna hold at nine chemistry
anyway<00:03:29.010> Oh<00:03:29.690> Michael<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.780> hold<00:03:31.019> it<00:03:31.140> too<00:03:31.230> um<00:03:32.180> but

yeah<00:03:33.769> then<00:03:34.769> obviously<00:03:35.010> PK<00:03:35.489> I'm<00:03:36.030> changing<00:03:36.540> team

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
yeah then obviously PK I'm changing team

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.840 
yeah then obviously PK I'm changing team
around<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.930> bit<00:03:37.140> so<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:37.470> /<00:03:37.950> PK<00:03:38.130> in<00:03:38.370> there<00:03:38.610> and

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
around a bit so I / PK in there and

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.820 
around a bit so I / PK in there and
obviously<00:03:39.269> julissa<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:39.930> will<00:03:40.260> go<00:03:40.380> and<00:03:40.530> go<00:03:40.769> to

why I don't run with the manager and a
lot<00:04:03.330> of<00:04:03.360> people<00:04:03.420> have<00:04:03.630> 100<00:04:04.230> chemistry

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
lot of people have 100 chemistry

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.320 
lot of people have 100 chemistry
nowadays<00:04:04.860> and<00:04:05.130> if<00:04:05.549> they<00:04:05.730> see<00:04:05.790> someone<00:04:06.090> with<00:04:06.239> a

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
nowadays and if they see someone with a

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.759 
nowadays and if they see someone with a
hundred<00:04:06.510> chemistry<00:04:06.930> they<00:04:07.049> all<00:04:07.200> just<00:04:07.380> back<00:04:07.590> out

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
hundred chemistry they all just back out

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.770 
hundred chemistry they all just back out
so<00:04:08.670> by<00:04:08.760> having<00:04:08.880> known<00:04:09.120> on<00:04:09.299> chemistry

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
so by having known on chemistry

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.210 
so by having known on chemistry
obviously<00:04:09.989> they<00:04:10.590> don't<00:04:10.739> think<00:04:10.980> you've<00:04:11.070> got

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
obviously they don't think you've got

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.479 
obviously they don't think you've got
100<00:04:11.549> chemistry<00:04:11.940> which<00:04:12.510> you<00:04:12.630> don't<00:04:12.780> obviously

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
100 chemistry which you don't obviously

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.680 
100 chemistry which you don't obviously
which<00:04:14.489> just<00:04:14.700> means<00:04:14.820> one<00:04:15.000> people<00:04:15.209> play<00:04:15.329> is<00:04:15.510> just

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
which just means one people play is just

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.180 
which just means one people play is just
as<00:04:15.750> simple<00:04:15.840> as<00:04:16.049> that<00:04:16.079> and<00:04:16.200> it<00:04:16.620> just<00:04:16.829> helps<00:04:17.070> when

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
as simple as that and it just helps when

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.400 
as simple as that and it just helps when
people<00:04:17.519> play<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:17.729> and<00:04:17.970> stuff<00:04:18.229> yet<00:04:19.229> that's<00:04:19.320> the

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
people play you and stuff yet that's the

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.409 
people play you and stuff yet that's the
team<00:04:19.590> guys<00:04:19.769> I<00:04:19.979> can<00:04:20.820> put<00:04:20.940> a<00:04:20.970> couple<00:04:21.150> of<00:04:21.269> goals

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
team guys I can put a couple of goals

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.480 
team guys I can put a couple of goals
off<00:04:21.570> with<00:04:21.810> them<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.200> song<00:04:22.470> I'm<00:04:23.160> not<00:04:23.280> sure<00:04:23.340> when
