00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.330
 I 'll send you a scholar to avoid being said to be a landmine . 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.330
 It is a rifa 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:14.650
 I am now a little addicted to a scholar 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:19.480
 We are going with high-end content or various scholars 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:22.750
 Toka's or stretched encamped in Well according to the It is Speaking of scholars situation 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.590
 After that, shoot recovery magic that should be immediate 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:30.910
 Or it is very good to use various things and do various things 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:35.940
 It's a multi-scracy job that makes it challenging 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.940
 Well, let's see the performance of the scholar 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:49.750
 First of all , the key recovery skills of scholars are here 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:56.230
 Minute and I am drawing aiff class recovery of will span the damage reduction barrier per 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:57.300
 Biei recovers alone, but how to use and 2 is bought before the battle like Aston Spear of work 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:03.450
 Sweetheart 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:06.589
 Going to the main recovery also entangled with the two the Ifije ECTS this bet it Is Kos in combat 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.589
 It is the flow 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:19.260
 It is a measure of morale and enthusiasm. This is a scholar's only range recovery magic. 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:23.420
 Some to have a range of lowering the power of the bet inspire It is the encouragement as performance 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:29.270
 It means that I was able to meet you with the power 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:35.600
 Because it is a result to everyone party members everyone of damage cut is marked with a little 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:37.670
 Is purely after is pretty radical idea over just before the Oaza you know the timing of the other party 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.970
 Bytes or hit often in combat 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.409
 It is feeling that it is used for the range recovery once placenta 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:48.390
 Furniture was a bit heavy on 8 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:51.140
 When you switch to and crab churning it is entitled to get the target there is sufficient care 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.140
 Please attach 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:00.110
 Then there is a vitality law, but this isn't it cast 25% recovered without cast 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.150
 It is a white thing that 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.409
 It consumes only one ether flow From this system It is a skill that is quite important in the scholar 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.660
 Will be 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.630
 Mainly large damage cladding is large and would be you I high-end content used in the study group second-year-old 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.180
 That eats damage 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.420
 It is quite useful because there are more 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.250
 Therefore it is best to be able to hit even a squirrel 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.250
 Disease is the stock number of ether flow 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:32.780
 Now it is still one of the main skills of the scholar 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:37.790
 In field treatment, this is the center of points designated by specifying points . 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:40.740
 Range damage of party members in a thing of reducing 10% 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.340
 This also consumes a bit of ether pro 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:48.270
 It is recast and always from the relation of ether black 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:54.090
 I can not expand this guy, so my partner 's 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:58.050
 It is required to expand according to the timing of the letter 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:03.810
 (1) The explanation of the main body of the scholar is about this 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:08.459
 Next I hope to get in the explanation of the fairy . 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.090
 There are two types of fairy calling scholars , and pressing Fairy to Airy Tele 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.860
 is 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:18.740
 A male is a recovery-only type , but I just said it was a buff. 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:23.319
 It is out of the question if choose the Eos If Te elephant you also want to recover importance and how to 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:29.260
 When made you want to little bit raise the firepower should we call a in Serre 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:33.410
 As far as the operation of the fairy, especially unless it is high-end content 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:39.140
 I think that there is no problem if it leaves it to fairy ai 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:41.750
 High-end content too Some people think that it is all right with ai separately 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.770
 Because I want to go a little bit 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:52.010
 I try to give instructions by myself 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:53.270
 I think that I want to describe for the case to use from the request it is earlier in the semi-order here 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.040
 I will 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:01.760
 At first it is healing of common ability light by letting you push to fairy 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:06.799
 This is a skill to recover the target 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:12.620
 It is also good to recover the tank with the fairy and you recover the tank 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:14.510
 In the meantime , I 'm going to give instructions to chanting and let Fairy recover tbs. 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.910
 It can be said or higher 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.780
 That's a scholar 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.780
 It is a good place 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:27.860
 Followed by the silence of it exclusive ability light to Fairy 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.639
 Is that to silence the target but is I've never used this magic until now 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:35.639
 I do not know when to use 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:38.249
 The next step is hardship, this is the spelling speed of yourself and other party members 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:44.129
 Raise 30% 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:47.039
 The point is that it has the effect of shortening the cast and recasting too 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:50.099
 A very good ability 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:56.039
 Please use it when you need eradication speed 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:58.240
 I'm going down to the corner of the Gal's feather Titan, and so on. 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:02.860
 You need to be careful about it 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:06.370
 I introduced it a little while ago, but it's a funny thing. Confident party members 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:12.970
 Increase your skill speed by 30% 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:14.650
 When Well essential is this guy's gonna be by the next recast is a little shorter required annihilation rate 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.230
 Please use it by all means 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:23.420
 Just because it is a mutual overwrite relationship with rice hardship 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:25.370
 If you use one of them and the effect goes out, it's better to use one or the other 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:30.919
 I think 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:35.800
 Serene is about to come soon, and next will be Eos's explanation. 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:41.350
 First of all, it's a whisper of light. 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:45.460
 I feel that I wonder if this guy is good if you hit every time around the cast 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:49.790
 About fey covenant こ 受 信 受 信 受 信 受 信 周 囲 周 囲 周 囲 周 囲 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:53.120
 It is an ability to increase magic defense by 20%. 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:58.370
 It leads to the data Meiji reduction of what is defense up 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:04.330
 Effective is when I'll also use this guy against therefore of the opponent's timing, which are winning Oaza 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.330
 Please take care because just can not be expected and mitigation is not a work of magic system 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:13.470
 Fairy Eos Last Square Fe Illumination 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:14.850
 Increase the amount of recovery magic of yourself and surrounding party members by 20% 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:19.000
 It is an ability 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:23.680
 I guess is a nice guy now Bal line of Monk of the mantra and the mother knife 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:28.720
 You should always use it against the other party's great skill. 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.180
 Recovery is faster and keep hitting in advance because it is assumed that significantly eats damage 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.310
 It is to say 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:37.370
 By the way, the last is an extra child, but when you can afford it, if you have bio, Laer Miyajima 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:41.360
 Around 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:43.760
 Please support pps. It is better to sell shadow flares . 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.690
 But I do not enter if I have a professional occupation 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.969
 Crusade Stars together to try by all means because the thermal power can be up in the scout and 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.059
 Please give me 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:56.589
 And if you feel your own mp is less 

00:06:52.059 --> 00:07:00.139
 Recover energy by energy drain, or if someone falls, it will be quick to collect 

00:06:56.589 --> 00:07:04.909
 Please try to say something to lift 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:09.740
 Scholars are full of things that can be done like this 

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:13.249
 So it's a very rewarding job, but the whole thing you can say is the other person's action 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:17.289
 It is to say that it is necessary to know the cycle 

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:19.660
 Toka I aerial blast will come when speaking in Garuda 

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:22.810
 Toka I wedge will come when 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:24.270
 That's why the flames make it 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:29.850
 The timing is 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:31.500
 If you do n't know in advance what's inconspicuous, you have the ability to make a percentage 

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:36.780
 It can not be pulled out 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:39.440
 Please take care only there , I think it is a spring very fun job to break through it 

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:42.820
 Please try it by all means 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.820
 More than rihwa
