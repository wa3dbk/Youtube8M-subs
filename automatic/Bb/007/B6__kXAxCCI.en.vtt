00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
it may feel painstaking but suddenly you

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.290

that was because I lifted my left elbow

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.809 
that was because I lifted my left elbow
a<00:02:14.450> little<00:02:14.600> bit<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.230> it's<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:15.830> gratifying<00:02:16.459> once

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
a little bit and it's so gratifying once

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.630 
a little bit and it's so gratifying once
you<00:02:17.000> get<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.390> correction<00:02:18.019> so<00:02:18.370> miniscule<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.580> it

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
you get a correction so miniscule and it

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.450 
you get a correction so miniscule and it
affects<00:02:20.060> everything
