00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:11.420
 at youtube you can throw them here today 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.110
 Let's have a look in the 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.240
 spider tank minigame to hot dogs yes all the way 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.310
 I do not watchdog myself 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.270
 I will not buy it 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.650
 probably not get it first 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.030
 I have already in advance yes 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.470
 I said I'll take a look at it first 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.780
 've as well as fears that in the 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.050
 principle always and always and always and 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.920
 to do the same again and again 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.880
 my dread now have 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.829
 principle not so one hundred percent 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.210
 confirmed and you find if you are 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.949
 still want to get the game for the pc 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.600
 Of course, this would have a link in it 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.159
 my video description to direct 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.960
 get support realistic then 

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:43.550
 from the dealer still a small euro 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.050
 shut off in case it suits you 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.120
 but I should think about it 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.249
 drops is already eaten because it 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.620
 of course, a few days now for 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.969
 All of us too late is two antennas 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.600
 one of these mini games i have myself 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.280
 thus not one hundred percent 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.329
 So, from that point of view, I can now 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.940
 just a little my first impressions 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.440
 to send to the gameplay itself and that 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.120
 is synonymous directly my keyword 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.399
 because the gameplay is this time 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.110
 put by the alex of point 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:07.880
 for gamers link to his channel 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.799
 course below in the video 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.689
 Thanks a lot to you alex 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.520
 for the submission or respectively 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.380
 for that, make this very special 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.600
 Gameplay has been a lot of trouble 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.969
 given and gave me a 7 gigabyte 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.450
 Great file sent I found really great 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:25.399
 alex or funny I found what you like cool 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.979
 Of course, here is only this 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.390
 pure saves enke gameplay I have 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.740
 of it on youtube already the one or 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.759
 seen another thing and thought before I did 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.109
 now here as boring as 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.759
 upload or 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:35.780
 let's play try to start or just 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.799
 what in the direction I am with myself 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.820
 not at all know about me 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.799
 have played 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.289
 take it is it small mini game then 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.659
 It's one of those parts that counts 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.840
 hotdogs under the stroke then but one 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.329
 make a bit more interesting 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.490
 the eyes because the actual gameplay 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.899
 that I looked at and also the 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.939
 first bands place like you already are 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.579
 the show can show me in principle 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.049
 the actual hacking of the game 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.520
 So that's what it basically in the one 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.000
 little has been aligned to the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.640
 Beginning 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.590
 that's just like me 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.270
 that initially thought too easy 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.799
 that means you get even think I believe 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.090
 Just press the mouse button or 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.700
 just a button for just before two 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.310
 seconds pressed and then you have already 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.930
 basically in the devices or in 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.640
 the phones of those of the others 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.130
 dwellers of the holding hooked I find 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.900
 personally a bit too i say now 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.700
 just have to go on the other side 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.680
 It's a bit easier, of course 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.030
 and unstoppable in the plus there 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.130
 But as I said, that's just mine 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.780
 opinion to watch from the first 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.489
 first time so a few live stream 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.870
 to look at and of course eternal night 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.049
 about videos of you on youtube about it 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.940
 I've seen them and I thought so 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.349
 mentality here many mini games too 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.620
 integrate as well as others 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.870
 playing is already seen is natural 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.980
 standard meanwhile I do not know what 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.720
 for a direction that continues here 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.459
 So if it would be later once again in the middle 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.750
 There are games or not so many because 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.000
 what I now from a few people 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.970
 have seen or heard that the story 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.400
 a not so strong ties to hot now 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.569
 Of course, I can also do dogs for myself 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.069
 Just confirm if you know 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.760
 I am not a single player player and 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.799
 That's why I'll probably 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.329
 I do not even get that at all 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.620
 game also has a multiplayer 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.260
 or in the basket 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.630
 and I found that by looking now 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.130
 not enough for me the game 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.450
 I still have to pick it up for me 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.609
 of course and for you too 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.829
 absolute in the mini player game very clear 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.989
 nonsense singleplayer game not mini 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.760
 player plays and these mini games the 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.349
 you stop here in between 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.030
 can be any successes 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.099
 unlock each other quarterly 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.019
 he should of course as long as possible 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.299
 stick to it and give it the opportunity 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.859
 give besides besides so by the side 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.989
 actual main game any amount 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.010
 things to do so at least I have 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.110
 that was true for me 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.000
 if this is the right way I can 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.650
 That's basically why 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.790
 Examples are not important 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.950
 I really have to play, though 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.090
 Admit that these mini games are 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.920
 so have a little change with there 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.030
 bring in and that should not 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.470
 review here now that's like 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.360
 only a first small one said 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.040
 impression to the whole thing if you 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.890
 I'll have another two 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.180
 to publish three videos writes 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.520
 then please just in the comments 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.020
 pure what you think of the game and whether 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.790
 a little bit with me on the channel 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.830
 would like to see this then I'm going to the 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.240
 request next days respectively 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.530
 I have two more people, too 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.180
 still wanted to send gameplay alex 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.640
 will certainly send me another one too 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.739
 because he has forgotten in 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.940
 Turn off the radio for the gameplay 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.200
 Of course, this always leads to 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.850
 any container the meetings 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.070
 we do not mind as youtuber 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.600
 that is who is more gameplay for this 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.980
 would like to send but as I said 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.600
 that you please now to word stocks 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.310
 I do not already have two people there 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.070
 always remember so no matter which 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.660
 play in game radios so at gta die 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.090
 radio stations or now here too 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.010
 let the music always off that 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.150
 only leads to problems on youtube though 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.830
 Of course it's the normal one 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.390
 not the spectator I say that 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.780
 now I'm heading here now 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.610
 once the youtuber among you so 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.770
 So much for this game looks first 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.030
 Of course, I'm funny 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.380
 few people talked about this too 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.060
 among other things have also gambled 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.430
 my colleague tg and he has me 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.800
 written yes the control is but 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.720
 but we say something spongy him 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.090
 that's why if you 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.440
 for example , if you say so now 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.270
 for example, he plays with the 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.919
 controller on the pc in another 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.690
 direction then wants to come first 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.120
 such animations steps 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.710
 intermediate steps before the figure 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.820
 There's something going on in that direction really 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.229
 of course a bit cooler 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.390
 should and a little bit the whole moment 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.780
 I should be more realistic about this 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.330
 at times 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.410
 but underlined it does that 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.300
 control a bit somehow 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.229
 spongy and somewhat inaccurate that is 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.669
 just as much a thing for me 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.280
 personally do not leave at all 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.930
 this is of course that 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.850
 this game mechanics owed and should 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.590
 of course somehow contribute 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.850
 that's not so choppy looks 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.350
 bit more realistic and 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.540
 somehow a bit cooler is somehow 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.250
 yes , we are so general or are we whole 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.510
 Honestly, the controls are just that 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.669
 most important before the game when you 're there 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.650
 does not feel that what you have 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:48.270
 just to call or at his 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.130
 controller is really just like that 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.470
 then it can happen something 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.210
 nauseous and a bit critical are well 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.130
 so be it knee one wants one in such 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.380
 bit the rest of this spot shows 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.750
 Gameplay I find ourselves really cool 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.750
 idea here such an armored vehicle in 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.430
 form a giant spider 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.840
 to let and how we see here 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.040
 are currently already scarce before the end 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.550
 I'll say that again thanks for that 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.720
 watch 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.340
 thanks also to you alex for that 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.840
 send in from this guest gameplay link 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.220
 to his channel of course in the video 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.960
 description and if you now 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.470
 I still have to get that 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.090
 still pick 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.130
 then you will find the link to the game 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.290
 of course, as I said in the beginning 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:25.380
 the video describes this as I said 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:27.540
 spyder complexion gameplay fresh from
