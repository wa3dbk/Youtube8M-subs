00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
 collectivity is according to sony ericsson has flagship of xtc pills with 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.420
 an HDMI connection makes blood and fast internet you are with the whole world 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.359
 found it 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:13.309
 but the area the phone also more 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.300
 trade fair because the device has two cameras, one of which is 8 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.199
 megapixel camera with flash mission and the food and you do not draw 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.559
 usable operating system and that for 330 euros 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.200
 my first impression of the meo is that he is a bit rude too 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.800
 he is the ball at the back as you can see is the best album thick phone 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.589
 what also does not really help is that it is made of plastic that you also hear when you 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:42.910
 click on it and it seems a bit like giving a voice 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.360
 sony ericsson soothes the pain of that plastic casing the public could do it 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.260
 know how to talk 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.460
 and in addition, the device is also nice in the hand you can easily with 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.900
 for a year everything is just right 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.850
 and that is very nice to do the city 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.260
 the ret sony ericsson xperia neo has an hdmi and a psp connection 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.870
 and therefore imeao can easily connect to your computer or an hd 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:10.870
 screen 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.720
 But before you want to transfer something to your computer you must of course take photos 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.300
 and the pictures that the world takes 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.430
 they are pretty good 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.730
 condition is that it is good right to be but then you really have a beautiful 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.970
 photos 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.870
 and when it all gets dark then it becomes grainy and then I don't see 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.910
 so much with the device despite the tax authorities 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.320
 Also done on the Dutch Antilles which is handy if you have pictures of yourself 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.940
 want to deal with it is therefore not a hand 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.860
 but it is also handy to see plenty of people calling via skype 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.510
 This smartphone films in HD quality that sounds pretty fancy and that works too 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.530
 pretty nice 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.320
 only they should not be damper again 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.800
 I have made recordings of doormaal at the black cross 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.240
 and despite the music from normal, the audio still sounds 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:12.620
 these smartphone workgroups and by fc twente not in 2010 napkins 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.279
 operating system 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:19.409
 and and along with a gigahertz processor it just works really fast and 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:20.149
 flexible 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:22.239
 then I also get on the internet right away 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.989
 because counting is also a particularly fast 7 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.260
 this group continues to tweet what it works actually works very well and 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.819
 all for 330 euros 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.799
 all in all these phones and more money
