00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.670
 several people do at the same time 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.860
 acrobatic movement 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.170
 justice of a certain height 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.430
 for many it's youth spending time 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.380
 it is not yet clear but parkurists could 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.950
 declare themselves in many cities of Russia 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.930
 Pervouralsk three areas hope that 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.850
 this will also be noticed and understood by Vladislav 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.990
 peterson do parkour around five 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.160
 years of a young man attracted philosophy 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.859
 of this discipline which is 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.800
 overcoming obstacles first 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.489
 such 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:27.890
 the treatment is simple 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.659
 watched video 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.729
 saw how guys are training 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:33.200
 so decided 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.200
 estimated to do this 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.260
 watch video something about pain something not 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.860
 it turned out of course 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.470
 the guys helped 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.830
 started to learn according to Vladislav 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.020
 wanting to engage in parkour for another two years 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.460
 backwards 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.090
 we had a lot in town but 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.790
 gradually the guys started throwing their 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.230
 hobbies reason to send and 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.920
 the french movement is that 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.870
 local tracers no special site 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.800
 for training time competition no one 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.489
 not inviting their hopes they pin 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.320
 on its official PR 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.930
 Dimitryâ€™s manager is from Tula 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.970
 For some time lived abroad parkour 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.430
 also when it was engaged from now on 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.750
 injury was forced by these occupations 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.830
 stop seeing arrival grow up 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.970
 Dmitriy guys decided to help them just 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.230
 continue to help you and how 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.090
 do so to have this sport 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.430
 activity like 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.050
 iran like parkour 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.460
 he did not die in this city oooh flourished 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.460
 and as if more and more but both times 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.180
 Dmitri says that parkour with samples is not 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.119
 Hami rumored the first of them is dangerous for 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.690
 life and health a certain proportion 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.840
 there is truth in this but no more than any 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.860
 other extreme 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.560
 sports 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.340
 the second myth is parkour youth 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.770
 which has nothing to do after hearing such weak 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.740
 tracer offended almost all of 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.590
 they lead a healthy lifestyle in what 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.659
 help including hobbies parkour 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.799
 we are doing the same 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.500
 four and a half years and wind 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.760
 we seem to have another 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.240
 returns worth doing 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.250
 forward yes of course 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.250
 but we still have an offer from him 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.289
 in one hand, of course I wanted 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.519
 that is, show people what you have 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:13.379
 parkour 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.319
 that is, for all the youth than that 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.779
 there is 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:19.629
 I sat there not on the benches did not walk 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.669
 victims of standing in traffic jams 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:24.310
 few of them smoke 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.020
 we practically nobody even uses 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.700
 alcoholic drinks they constantly 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.410
 train in july before he probably 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.250
 first because I wanted us very much 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.249
 much help 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:35.729
 to identify noticed and further how 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:37.209
 here I recognize invited still in 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.939
 demonstrations to 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.739
 the guys had a sense of being a man what 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:42.329

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.829
 your tricks 3 style video one 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.519
 from populist clips became the best in the field 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.499
 among the commercials official topics 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:50.790
 only now parkurists have already forgotten about it 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.749
 again in free flight 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:54.819
 or I am glad that the clowns pervouralsk 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:55.299
