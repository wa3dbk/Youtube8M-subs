00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
RL on the outside alright so as you can

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.980 
RL on the outside alright so as you can
see<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> same<00:01:28.799> battle<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.780> for

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
see it's the same battle and this is for

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.010 
see it's the same battle and this is for
finger<00:01:31.259> fighting<00:01:31.590> at<00:01:31.680> its<00:01:31.799> best<00:01:31.920> right<00:01:32.070> here

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
finger fighting at its best right here

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.420 
finger fighting at its best right here
so<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.049> as<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:34.710> see<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.860> just<00:01:35.070> dropped<00:01:35.340> them

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
so I as you can see I just dropped them

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.819 
so I as you can see I just dropped them
on<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.610> outside<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.119> base<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.570> just<00:01:36.829> went

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
on the outside of the base and just went

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.069 
on the outside of the base and just went
back<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.189> forth<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.700> then<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.509> switched<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
back and forth and then I switched to

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.200 
back and forth and then I switched to
archers<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.799> do<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> same<00:01:41.220> thing<00:01:41.490> make<00:01:42.060> sure

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
archers and do the same thing make sure

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.490 
archers and do the same thing make sure
you<00:01:42.329> don't<00:01:42.479> click<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.659> your<00:01:42.899> spell's<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.409> that

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
you don't click on your spell's so that

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.880 
you don't click on your spell's so that
could<00:01:43.619> probably<00:01:43.740> be<00:01:43.950> pretty<00:01:44.130> bad<00:01:45.380> but<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.409> hope

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890
