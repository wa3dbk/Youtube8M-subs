often<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.470> sheath<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.700> bill<00:01:29.909> made<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
often in this sheath the bill made and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.230 
often in this sheath the bill made and
and<00:01:30.770> does<00:01:31.770> have<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> tech<00:01:32.189> lock<00:01:32.430> system<00:01:32.909> on<00:01:33.060> here

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
and does have a tech lock system on here

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.539 
and does have a tech lock system on here
so<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.659> generally<00:01:33.960> do<00:01:34.229> carry<00:01:34.530> appendix<00:01:35.340> tile

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
so I generally do carry appendix tile

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.030 
so I generally do carry appendix tile
right<00:01:35.670> next<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.939> my<00:01:36.060> pistol<00:01:36.770> it's<00:01:37.770> actually

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
right next to my pistol it's actually

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.380 
right next to my pistol it's actually
quite<00:01:38.220> comfortable<00:01:38.670> as<00:01:38.790> well<00:01:38.939> because<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
quite comfortable as well because the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.969 
quite comfortable as well because the
knife<00:01:39.689> generally<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.290> little<00:01:40.500> bit<00:01:40.619> smaller

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
knife generally is a little bit smaller

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.580 
knife generally is a little bit smaller
than<00:01:41.159> most<00:01:41.729> fixed<00:01:42.090> blade<00:01:42.270> knives<00:01:42.500> but<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
than most fixed blade knives but the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.499 
than most fixed blade knives but the
balance<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.040> knife<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.520> great<00:01:44.820> too<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.270> was<00:01:45.420> a

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
balance of knife is great too I was a

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.230 
balance of knife is great too I was a
little<00:01:45.689> bit<00:01:45.780> heavier<00:01:46.049> where<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.290> handles<00:01:46.680> at

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
little bit heavier where the handles at

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.200 
little bit heavier where the handles at
but<00:01:48.240> makes<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:49.020> nice<00:01:49.920> beefy<00:01:50.250> handle<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
but makes it a nice beefy handle the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.060 
but makes it a nice beefy handle the
grip<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.720> nice<00:01:52.200> weight<00:01:52.500> on<00:01:52.770> there<00:01:52.950> and

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
grip on to a nice weight on there and

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.649 
grip on to a nice weight on there and
