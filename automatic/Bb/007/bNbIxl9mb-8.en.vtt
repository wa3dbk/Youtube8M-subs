 the pop 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.830
 Hello 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.389
 welcome to paper folios today without 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.459
 alicia and today I bring you a 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.830
 good father video of how to make ones 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.480
 Christmas trees that are eaten and are 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.360
 of sweets and you can use them for 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.490
 give them at your school to your friends to 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.649
 your friends whoever you want and are 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.040
 super easy to do so we're going to 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:33.790
 see how the ingredients are made 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.820
 we're going to need are cereal chocolates 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.399
 preference which is as inflated 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.520
 green vegetable coloring butter and 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.500
 chocolate is to decorate the first thing that 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.330
 let's do is melt the butter 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.950
 and I put it a few seconds in the 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.650
 microwave so that the 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.170
 retired then I took the chocolates and the 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.570
 I put in a glass container and the 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.220
 I put in the microwave oven for 15 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.260
 seconds to melt 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.810
 completely after we are going to mix 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.880
 the chocolates with the butter so that 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.009
 they revolves super well and once 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.259
 we have this mixture we are going to put some 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.270
 droplets of green dye I put him 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.759
 enough droplets for the coloring 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.170
 it would be very powerful now we empty 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.580
 this mixture over 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.770
 in our cereal schools 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.500
 for the next step I recommend you 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.470
 very much grease your hands either with 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.530
 a little spray oil or with a 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.900
 little bit of butter the fact is that this 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.790
 mixture is very very very sticky and you 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.620
 I swear it's going to hit you in the hands 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.630
 you hurry up if that happens you may be 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.790
 it's easy to wash your hands and you're done 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.430
 but what we are going to do is stir 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.480
 with our hands and as a guy to spend 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.640
 or something like that 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.240
 so let's knead and knead and knead 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.740
 until we have the perfect mixture 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.290
 let's take a little ball of our 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.760
 rare mixture of green leaflets and what 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.130
 let's put on some paper 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.350
 waxed to be much more 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.900
 easy to start doing the shape of the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.910
 pretty that is like the shape of a tree 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.619
 Christmas for this step also if 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.270
 you want to re -grease that hands 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.340
 it's super good because it's going to be more 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.869
 easy work but what we are going to 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.430
 to do is very simple let's start 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.430
 form our conical 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.750
 since we have them there very nice there 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.510
 than let them dry completely and now 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.489
 let's take our chocolates and 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.379
 decorations and decorate it to our liking 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.540
 what I did was put one of these 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.430
 little chocolatitos in the part of 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.400
 down the pine to be like the 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.190
 trunk and I pasted them using a bit of 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.980
 cookie glaze and now with that 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.900
 same glaze I did him as a guy 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.670
 I do not know what they are called about the 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.470
 Christmas pines but it's like a Band-Aid 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.329
 and I think it looks very pretty and before 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.819
 it was dry I put some of these 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:52.670
 round chocolatitos to simulate 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:56.090
 the spheres and finally I put a 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.000
 more yellow chocolate on the tip 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.400
 so that our star was this 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.680
 that's how you have to be treated 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.780
 that they dry super super well and once 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.700
 that are dry and you can serve them 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.190
 You can put in sachets to give him 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.019
 to your friends or you can eat them clear 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.660
 also this truth will be very very rich 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.220
 I recommend them a lot and that 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.350

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.630
