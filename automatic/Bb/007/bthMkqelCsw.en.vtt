00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.130
 please 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.999
 to add measures we can use 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:11.499
 both the ram while in the south all forward of compass 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:16.409
 oo the tool d selection all environments of 700 selection 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:19.279
 either of us will do the same operation 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.829
 because in the two it appears 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:25.299
 the same pull-down menu therefore the operation more attacks 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.989
 I'm going to use the selection tool all the 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.540
 to add purchases 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.920
 when we want to add bars to the same site where we click on what 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.000
 same that we select the last measure of the score 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.710
 or that we select 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.790
 any other compass even the first because whenever we add 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.900
 compasses the computer or the program loar bathes them always go to the end of the 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.440
 music sheet 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.990
 pÃ©rez we can give him right button in any compass as he has done 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.010
 I 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.790
 and we choose the option in your hand agne only waiters or add compasses 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.340
 when we click on it 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.580
 the window appears 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.900
 who designs and prost buy compasses and asks us how many purchases we want 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.940
 add we can say that if it is for example 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.090
 I said that the computer adds them to us 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.640
 at the end of the score 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.460
 there's another way 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.190
 very comfortable and very fast d 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.110
 to add measures 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.190
 What is it 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.340
 combining 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.240
 the tool in the south all with 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.740
 the control key activated 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.880
 continued pressed the key with the control key and I keep it skynet activated 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.090
 and click on 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.980
 I'm sorry that's all 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.150
 automatically not knowing we get the same window from before the window 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.380
 add measures 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.450
 so 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.640
 for example add 5 i 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.180
 the computer adds the compasses at the end of the game
