00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
have to do certain goals ah but this one

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.090 
have to do certain goals ah but this one
is<00:03:43.630> basically<00:03:44.200> pretty<00:03:44.470> much<00:03:44.590> straight

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
is basically pretty much straight

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.690 
is basically pretty much straight
forward<00:03:45.520> port<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:47.590> that<00:03:47.620> means<00:03:48.010> now<00:03:48.280> creating

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
forward port so that means now creating

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
history of always having kind of a

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.529 
history of always having kind of a
confusing<00:05:54.310> control<00:05:54.910> scheme<00:05:55.300> on<00:05:56.229> consoles<00:05:57.099> and

confusing control scheme on consoles and
this<00:05:58.539> one's<00:05:58.810> really<00:05:59.289> no<00:05:59.530> exception<00:06:00.159> it's<00:06:00.550> a

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:00.699 
this one's really no exception it's a

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:02.430 
this one's really no exception it's a
little<00:06:01.000> bit<00:06:01.180> better<00:06:01.300> they<00:06:01.570> improved<00:06:01.930> on<00:06:02.139> some

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
little bit better they improved on some

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.740 
little bit better they improved on some
things<00:06:02.470> such<00:06:03.130> as<00:06:03.159> a<00:06:03.849> different<00:06:04.570> button

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
things such as a different button

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.950 
things such as a different button
placements<00:06:05.409> for<00:06:05.470> certain<00:06:05.979> stuff<00:06:06.310> but<00:06:07.090> it's

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
placements for certain stuff but it's

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.040 
placements for certain stuff but it's
not<00:06:08.110> horrible<00:06:08.680> it's<00:06:09.190> just<00:06:09.610> not<00:06:10.389> like<00:06:10.659> having<00:06:10.990> a

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
not horrible it's just not like having a

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.260 
not horrible it's just not like having a
keyboard<00:06:11.229> in<00:06:11.650> front<00:06:11.919> of<00:06:11.979> you<00:06:12.039> in<00:06:12.159> a<00:06:12.190> mouse<00:06:12.400> so

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
keyboard in front of you in a mouse so

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.770 
keyboard in front of you in a mouse so
if<00:06:13.830> but<00:06:14.830> it's<00:06:15.370> bearable<00:06:15.699> and<00:06:16.120> it<00:06:16.479> is

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
if but it's bearable and it is

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.689 
if but it's bearable and it is
definitely<00:06:16.990> still<00:06:17.680> fun<00:06:17.949> on<00:06:18.099> home<00:06:18.310> consoles

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:18.699
