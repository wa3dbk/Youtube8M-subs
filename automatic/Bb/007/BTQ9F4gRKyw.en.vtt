basically if the frame is like this I

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.510 
basically if the frame is like this I
adjust<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.390> like<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.649> kind<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.129> push<00:00:56.370> it

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
adjust it like that I kind of push it

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.860 
adjust it like that I kind of push it
all<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.789> way<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.300> end

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
all the way to the end

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.950 
all the way to the end
just<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:59.010> see<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> picture<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.780> it's

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
just so I can see the picture and it's

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.650 
just so I can see the picture and it's
gonna<00:01:01.079> mesh<00:01:01.410> together<00:01:01.680> very<00:01:02.219> nicely<00:01:02.660> so

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
gonna mesh together very nicely so

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.329 
gonna mesh together very nicely so
basically<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.229> looks<00:01:04.530> really<00:01:04.680> blank<00:01:05.070> and

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
basically it just looks really blank and

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.149 
basically it just looks really blank and
then<00:01:05.640> we're<00:01:05.880> gonna<00:01:05.970> choose<00:01:06.439> the<00:01:07.439> picture<00:01:07.950> that

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
then we're gonna choose the picture that

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.149 
then we're gonna choose the picture that
I<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:08.460> showed<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.760> which<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.540> one

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
I just showed you which is this one

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:17.179 
I just showed you which is this one
we're<00:01:11.159> gonna<00:01:11.310> choose<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.700> twice<00:01:13.729> and<00:01:14.729> then<00:01:16.189> so

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
we're gonna choose it twice and then so

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.499 
we're gonna choose it twice and then so
see<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.400> guys<00:01:17.430> there's<00:01:17.729> basically<00:01:18.240> like<00:01:18.479> no

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
see you guys there's basically like no

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.690 
see you guys there's basically like no
white<00:01:19.049> line<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.619> then<00:01:19.740> when<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.040> flip<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.520> it

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
white line and then when you flip it it

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.620 
white line and then when you flip it it
just<00:01:20.880> looks<00:01:21.090> even<00:01:21.479> better<00:01:22.939> flip<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.509> way

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
just looks even better flip it that way

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.149 
just looks even better flip it that way
and<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:28.259> how<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.560> remember<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.009> picture

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
and that's how I remember that picture

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.999 
and that's how I remember that picture
just<00:01:31.460> like<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.060> then<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:33.990> will<00:01:34.590> usually

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
just like that and then I will usually

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.740 
just like that and then I will usually
save<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.520> my<00:01:35.549> camera<00:01:36.119> roll<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:38.329> then<00:01:39.329> I

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
save it to my camera roll and then I

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.109 
save it to my camera roll and then I
will<00:01:39.990> usually<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.439> edit<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.340> um<00:01:41.549> vsco<00:01:42.479> cam

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
will usually just edit it on um vsco cam

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.270 
will usually just edit it on um vsco cam
so<00:01:45.119> we're<00:01:45.360> gonna<00:01:45.509> add<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:49.470> then<00:01:50.040> we're

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
so we're gonna add it and then we're

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.560 
so we're gonna add it and then we're
gonna<00:01:50.430> edit<00:01:50.670> it

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.930 

so<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:54.560> looks<00:01:54.770> like<00:01:54.980> that<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:55.520> then<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:55.790> just

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
so it looks like that and then you just

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.720 
so it looks like that and then you just
want<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.210> choose<00:01:56.480> whichever<00:01:57.110> filter<00:01:57.980> you<00:01:58.340> like

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
want to choose whichever filter you like

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.060 
want to choose whichever filter you like
or<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:59.120> feel<00:01:59.270> comfortable<00:01:59.540> with<00:02:02.710> so<00:02:03.710> there's

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
or you feel comfortable with so there's

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.360 
or you feel comfortable with so there's
just<00:02:04.160> all<00:02:04.550> these<00:02:04.820> nice<00:02:05.630> filters<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.860> I

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
just all these nice filters and I

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.560 
just all these nice filters and I
