00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
is actually very good when you playing a

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.070 
is actually very good when you playing a
lot<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.159> people<00:01:11.430> there's<00:01:11.670> no<00:01:12.540> explosions

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
just one or two people kind of adds to

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.249

the<00:01:19.229> fear<00:01:19.619> concept<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.840> when<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.869> have

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
