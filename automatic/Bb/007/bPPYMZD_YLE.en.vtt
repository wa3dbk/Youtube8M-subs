okay<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.340> we<00:01:02.670> open<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.059> box<00:01:03.300> up<00:01:08.270> there's<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
okay so we open this box up there's the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.179 
okay so we open this box up there's the
final<00:01:09.659> first<00:01:10.530> thing<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.770> actually<00:01:10.920> just

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
final first thing I actually just

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.310 
final first thing I actually just
mentioned<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.729> there's<00:01:12.689> no<00:01:12.840> soft

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
mentioned is that there's no soft

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.100 
mentioned is that there's no soft
padding<00:01:13.680> in<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.830> top<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.189> box<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:15.540> TT<00:01:15.930> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
padding in the top of the box the TT and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.070 
padding in the top of the box the TT and
I<00:01:16.170> think<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.439> 3G<00:01:16.950> had<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.689> little<00:01:18.689> bit<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.869> foam

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
I think the 3G had a little bit of foam

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.080 
I think the 3G had a little bit of foam
into<00:01:19.500> there<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:19.920> now<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.220> just<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.490> molded

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
into there but now it's just a molded

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.320 
into there but now it's just a molded
bit<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.650> plastic<00:01:22.650> really<00:01:22.979> not<00:01:23.939> sure<00:01:24.060> why<00:01:24.299> I

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
bit of plastic really not sure why I

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.880 
bit of plastic really not sure why I
prefer<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.810> idea<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.320> being<00:01:25.470> mad<00:01:25.770> at

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
prefer the idea of it being mad at

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.649 
prefer the idea of it being mad at
