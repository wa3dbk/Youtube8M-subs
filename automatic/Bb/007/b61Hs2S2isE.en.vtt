00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
have a quick question I used to do these

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.890 
have a quick question I used to do these
back<00:01:36.560> in<00:01:36.740> high<00:01:36.860> school<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:37.430> one<00:01:38.420> thing<00:01:38.630> least

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
drop our knees and we would turn our

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.760 
drop our knees and we would turn our
body<00:01:41.060> is<00:01:41.570> that<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.960> wrong<00:01:42.170> way<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:42.380> do<00:01:42.620> it<00:01:42.740> or

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
body is that the wrong way to do it or

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.990 
body is that the wrong way to do it or
is<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.040> it<00:01:43.190> just<00:01:43.340> an<00:01:43.460> alternate<00:01:43.910> version

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
is that it just an alternate version

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.100 
is that it just an alternate version
well<00:01:44.270> one<00:01:44.540> thing<00:01:44.660> I've<00:01:44.780> found<00:01:44.810> is<00:01:45.080> that

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
well one thing I've found is that

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.170 
well one thing I've found is that
people's<00:01:45.500> lower<00:01:45.710> backs<00:01:45.950> are<00:01:46.220> really<00:01:46.520> tight<00:01:46.760> so

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
people's lower backs are really tight so

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.430 
people's lower backs are really tight so
if<00:01:47.270> you're<00:01:47.420> coming<00:01:47.630> in<00:01:47.810> ahead<00:01:47.900> of<00:01:48.020> time<00:01:48.260> with<00:01:48.410> a

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
if you're coming in ahead of time with a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.200 
if you're coming in ahead of time with a
really<00:01:48.740> tight<00:01:48.920> lower<00:01:49.130> back<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.520> hips<00:01:49.730> that's

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
really tight lower back and hips that's

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.550 
really tight lower back and hips that's
gonna<00:01:50.390> put<00:01:50.570> you<00:01:50.630> a<00:01:50.690> greater<00:01:50.900> chance<00:01:51.140> for<00:01:51.380> risk

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
gonna put you a greater chance for risk

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.440 
gonna put you a greater chance for risk
of<00:01:51.830> injury<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:52.850> that's<00:01:52.970> why<00:01:53.090> I<00:01:53.120> also<00:01:53.330> have

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
of injury and that's why I also have

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.180 
of injury and that's why I also have
people<00:01:53.570> face<00:01:53.960> forward<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.440> whole<00:01:54.560> time<00:01:54.770> and

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
people face forward the whole time and

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.800 
people face forward the whole time and
what<00:01:55.310> that<00:01:55.460> does<00:01:55.580> is<00:01:55.760> it's<00:01:55.910> less<00:01:56.210> twisting

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
what that does is it's less twisting

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.990 
what that does is it's less twisting
from<00:01:57.020> your<00:01:57.140> neck<00:01:57.320> in<00:01:57.440> your<00:01:57.560> lower<00:01:57.770> back<00:01:57.830> so<00:01:58.250> the

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
from your neck in your lower back so the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.130 
from your neck in your lower back so the
majority<00:01:59.240> of<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.480> twist<00:01:59.750> comes<00:01:59.840> actually

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
majority of the twist comes actually

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.840 
majority of the twist comes actually
from<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.500> mid-back<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.160> they<00:02:01.490> can<00:02:01.670> get<00:02:01.760> the

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
from the mid-back and they can get the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.370 
from the mid-back and they can get the
obliques<00:02:02.030> engage<00:02:02.480> at<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.720> same<00:02:02.900> time<00:02:03.080> so<00:02:03.260> it's

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
obliques engage at the same time so it's

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.570 
obliques engage at the same time so it's
just<00:02:03.530> safer<00:02:03.800> good

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
just safer good

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.340 
just safer good
so<00:02:04.850> even<00:02:05.120> I<00:02:05.300> learned<00:02:05.540> something<00:02:05.840> today<00:02:06.170> and

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
so even I learned something today and

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.500 
so even I learned something today and
hopefully<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:06.980> guys<00:02:07.160> did<00:02:07.460> too<00:02:07.670> don't<00:02:08.240> forget

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:08.510 
hopefully you guys did too don't forget
