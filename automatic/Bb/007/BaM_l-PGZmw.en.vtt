 Ben me personally it's okay and 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.449
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.690
 video on dofus it's been a very long time 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:43.000
 I did not make a video about dofus 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.180
 so I present you my skull you 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.120
 did you follow in followed adventure 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.890
 on dofus 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.300
 now the levels 143 is not beating our 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.940
 not us but the complete so it's up to 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.129
 to say that I said pea and 4 pm not 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.330
 normally 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:06.039
 here I have a dddd emerald road 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.009
 for those who do not know that 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:11.009
 gives a pv a pm and 300 in vitality 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:20.009
 so I play in 10 pts 5th so the my 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.009
 characteristics 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:45.360
 so here is my characteristics 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:49.580
 his 1500 in vitality 197 in wisdom 712 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.710
 in strength 0 intel and wisdom 31 in 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.700
 agility so that's so very 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.070
 long time I have not made videos 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.039
 seroma string it must do two three 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:03.210
 weeks roughly and so here it is 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.490
 it's true it was to tell you that in 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.780
 same time I am a little bit lost 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.160
 in this case really not but it's that 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.019
 I really have too much work and actually 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.750
 I have a new editing software 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:20.040
 adobe premiere pro so I'd like 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.900
 I would like to do montages with 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:30.140
 so I'll wait a little bit on 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:30.140
 time that I get used to that then 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.690
 to resume level 50 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:52.590
 I'm going to introduce you to my little one 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:55.560
 cra so that's so then already we're going 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:00.410
 see positive record his boost that's the 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:05.579
 less than 77 and an arrow 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:10.650
 destructive that's at least 257 in 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:14.329
 less than 127 so here you go 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.500
 tend to take in time that the ad 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:20.010
 phase of doing it we will boost it 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.780
 powerful arc control powerful shot 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.700
 to silence such critic to the sweet name 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.700
 it does not matter we will get rent 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:34.889
 to a positive arrow boost his voice and 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:36.900
 well at least screw 108-105 a fake 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.770
 unitive a good now it's 155 seen 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.750
 that he is ko 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:46.710
 so she'll take the 75 voice finally if 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.710
 I am debugging 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.190
 Okay 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.230
 here are babies face excuse me for the 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.350
 full screen it was to see if the 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.070
 connection was still there so that's it 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.330
 punitive arrow 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:15.520
 we're going to make punitive arrows not 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:19.780
 booster up to basel at the first flash 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:22.720
 positive is 294 we do not move on 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:30.790
 goes on and the second fake cultivates it 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:35.650
 worth how much - 547 reasonable is the 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:37.200
 third at least 792 it starts to 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.690
 to hurt anyway 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.000
 I think if I boost myself to the next 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:50.890
 I think I can do at least 1000 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:54.790
 we will try hop hop I grow and 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:58.230
 that was at least 1000 - 1046 that's it 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:01.960
 it says that if I booster I I 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:04.480
 I could have these pages would have more and 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.970
 I could have done is that I did 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:14.800
 minus one thousand men 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:17.560
 well after this game show you the 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.580
 object failure here so I already have a 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.980
 million six hundred and twenty million a 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.270
 million six hundred miles of cammas is this 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.160
 that I can sell it how much 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.220
 from me that I 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.600
 see you soon I can change it soon 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.810
 I have not sell it very expensive with level 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.280
 1 I think so here I do not really have a 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.280
 good boards there in the trophies all 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:43.950
 I have almost nothing here so we see it 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:47.169
 the gdd ddm route 4 mulhouse 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:51.760
 I have ours this is good I find 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:55.479
 pass like that we can put a 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.640
 shield with a headdress praises me to all 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.830
 these players there are so here 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.070
 well I'll tell you next time for a 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:05.200
 video next time it will be in a 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.570
 week big maximum the time that I 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.330
 get used to your first pro that I you 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.440
 make two mounting benches 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.600
 so here I tell you very soon 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.780
