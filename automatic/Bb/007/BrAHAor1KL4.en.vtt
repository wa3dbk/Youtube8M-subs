00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
drank my first class of goat milk and it

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.930 
drank my first class of goat milk and it
wasn't<00:06:15.320> as<00:06:15.410> bad<00:06:15.620> as<00:06:15.680> I<00:06:15.950> was<00:06:16.130> expecting<00:06:16.190> it<00:06:16.850> to

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
wasn't as bad as I was expecting it to

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.670 
wasn't as bad as I was expecting it to
be<00:06:17.060> so<00:06:17.210> I'm<00:06:17.540> quite<00:06:17.690> happy<00:06:17.870> about<00:06:18.080> happening

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
be so I'm quite happy about happening

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.620 
be so I'm quite happy about happening
especially<00:06:19.190> considering<00:06:20.000> the<00:06:20.210> horrible

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
especially considering the horrible

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.730 
especially considering the horrible
experience<00:06:21.020> I<00:06:21.050> had<00:06:21.170> with<00:06:21.290> the<00:06:21.410> coast<00:06:21.560> milk

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
experience I had with the coast milk

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.130 
experience I had with the coast milk
yogurt<00:06:22.130> I<00:06:22.280> was<00:06:22.850> pretty<00:06:23.060> sure<00:06:23.330> that<00:06:23.360> the<00:06:23.810> horrid

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140 
yogurt I was pretty sure that the horrid

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.080 
yogurt I was pretty sure that the horrid
flavor<00:06:24.440> from<00:06:24.650> that<00:06:24.800> was<00:06:25.340> probably<00:06:25.670> from<00:06:25.850> the

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
flavor from that was probably from the

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.270 
flavor from that was probably from the
from<00:06:26.780> the<00:06:26.810> goat's<00:06:27.080> milk<00:06:27.170> but<00:06:27.650> I<00:06:27.680> guess<00:06:27.980> it<00:06:28.130> must

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
from the goat's milk but I guess it must

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.170 
from the goat's milk but I guess it must
have<00:06:28.370> been<00:06:28.430> something<00:06:28.670> else<00:06:28.790> that<00:06:28.970> they<00:06:29.030> added

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
have been something else that they added

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.740 
have been something else that they added
into<00:06:29.510> it<00:06:29.630> oh<00:06:30.170> yeah<00:06:30.650> one's<00:06:31.490> going<00:06:31.670> to<00:06:31.700> say<00:06:31.820> like
