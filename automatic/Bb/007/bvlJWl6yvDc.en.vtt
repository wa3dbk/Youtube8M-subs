00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.840
 good evening with you as always video 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.759
 killer and today we will become astronauts 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.460
 plunge into the world of dead space already in 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:24.539
 third time yes yes that's what it will be 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.539
 about dex ps3 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.930
 after the terrible circumstances connected 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.360
 together isaek and ate at the station titan 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.699
 each went his own way and the language from 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.350
 I sit with my hiding place like 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.570
 always remembering the past 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.180
 mercilessly booze doing all sorts of 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.280
 the depravity of the mosque duniya thereby 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.800
 paying for their apartment in the center 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.559
 Moscow or during mercilessly vrug 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.050
 August, from the side of Isaac, was looking for a way 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.210
 end the epidemic of stones with red 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.040
 glow well you know english in 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.800
 one fine moment two military 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.380
 find or persuade her to find some 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.080
 a planet with a fancy name ouy 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.330
 andes soon she is successful 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.330
 disappears into orbit of the ice planet 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.009
 after this government of the earth 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.289
 looking for and forcing the tongue 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.600
 go on this mission brave warriors 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:33.050
 try for getting off language siege 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.750
 vomit slept on happens next 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.179
 something but i don't want to say what exactly 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.789
 so as not to spoil the obvious sequel 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:43.039
 parties gameplay component of the game 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.380
 suffered quite big changes by 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.590
 compared with the second part we have become 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.959
 rolls and shelters available oh yeah baby 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.090
 what is it played there is no console 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:55.910
 lotions well though life itself is not 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.580
 restored and nato thank you so much 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.860
 abundance of new enemies in the third part of us 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.140
 destined to fight on two fronts at once 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.450
 namely crazy fanatics 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.979
 soldiers and no about lags which 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.950
 for some reason I don't like it very much 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.020
 language but already familiar to the series 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.900
 a lot of necromorphs appeared 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.330
 the number of new individuals and kill them became 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.489
 much more difficult if in past parts 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.660
 it was desirable to cut them off a few 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.910
 extremities 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.310
 and you could just kill them 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.010
 cartridges then here with ps3 chopping off 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.620
 limbs will become a necessity since 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.319
 Necromorphs are practically unkillable either 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.719
 you cut them off at least 2-3 limbs 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.790
 and tentacles either they chop into you 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.469
 But if you have in your hands good 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.989
 weapons will be no problem 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:43.280
 in addition, the upgrade system has changed 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.469
 and making weapons 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.900
 major changes can be considered 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:50.540
 adding a crafting system from enemies 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.400
 not money and resources will fall out 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.590
 which you can create weapons 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.840
 first aid kits ammunition and so on 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.480
 resources can also be obtained by 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.459
 special search bot now 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.780
 weapons can be created not only by 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.930
 drawings but also by yourself 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.090
 experiment on different variations 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.069
 someone might like it but 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.000
 I really had this innovation 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.859
 taste 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.469
 but there is good news 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.659
 side task during which you can 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:19.909
 stumble upon some easter eggs and 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.189
 useful equipment besides these 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:23.900
 extra missions are quite interesting 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.299
 another good news is 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.969
 appearance in the game is very high quality 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.310
 auto save game almost always saved 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:33.530
 in convenient locations in graphic terms 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.959
 the game is not too far from his Katya 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.370
 its predecessor seemingly in places 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.889
 the game looks better 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.959
 and sometimes worse but in general terms 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:44.479
 the graphics are all less good and 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.549
 it does not make sense to carp 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:48.560
 engine knows its business 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.870
 Well, do not forget about chic 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.400
 character dubbing and atmospheric 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.439
 musical accompaniment 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.870
 although what else could you expect from 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:58.909
 electronic art can play lost 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.989
 a bit of its charm but still very 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.689
 even nothing 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.180
 the atmosphere of the house delivers to the same 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.019
 anywhere from the game do not share epic Kuik 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.959
 time event 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.560
 and also the game can still scare 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.560
 relaxed player 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.150
 well, no one has canceled his stasis 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.150
 gadgets 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:35.590
 and I never get tired of it 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.530
 Overall, dead space 3 turned out pretty 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.290
 not a bad game and deserves a rating of 8 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.660
 points out of ten maybe well then a review 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.540
 finally coming to an end thanks 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.640
 for attention we put our fingers up and 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.920
 Of course, we subscribe to our space 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.310
 channel in order to win against 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.310
 necromorphs
