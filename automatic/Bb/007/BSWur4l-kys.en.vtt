00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 William Nielsen was referring to the strong 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.750
 fall of the real estate market a bit 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.030
 motivated by this disagreement between 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.219
 buyers and sellers for lack 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.139
 a reference currency and in this 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.450
 context of the sector entrepreneurs 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.119
 they ask how can I do to sell 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.369
 when nobody buys and so these arise 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.810
 these alternatives like for example 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.880
 take leasing to the market 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.750
 real estate if the same instrument that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.519
 you use 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.039
 when you buy a machine like that you go to 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.410
 also be able to buy a property are 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.820
 very specific private initiatives that 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.500
 they have to do with developments that already 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.239
 are consolidated and that 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.160
 developers need to move 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.320
 they need the market to start them 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.760
 move are big projects not of 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.920
 units departments but of neighborhoods 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.180
 closed that they want to mobilize for 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.730
 We began to tell a little what the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.200
 leasing is a rental option with 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.910
 option to purchase 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.280
 is a rental contract with option to 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.020
 purchase in which you can acquire the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.629
 property is good for fabrics 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.550
 three quarters of the canon and you're going 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.590
 to finance your property without need 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.539
 to go to the bank for example in this case 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.270
 with credit that is a neighborhood closed in 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.520
 the northern area of ​​the citadel 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.270
 buenos aires- you can enter by paying a 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.090
 25% cash and the remaining 75% the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.719
 developer finances you way of 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.159
 leasing do not notice you mortgage the house but 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.740
 if you have to have to have to have 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.060
 very careful to the fine print because the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.789
 reality is that you have to wait 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.850
 to dispose of the good or you will pay month 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.799
 a month a fee and a percentage of that 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.679
 fee is going to be like a kind of 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.600
 rent and the other way will settle part 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.219
 of the property that you have thus for 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.770
 example you can buy a house to 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:43.140
 from 260 thousand dollars or a lot to 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.270
 from 42 thousand dollars but always 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.090
 considering this that the property 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.670
 you are not going to mortgage you will not go to 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.560
 a bank because the contract 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.140
 directly with this developer that 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.200
 You need to boost sales and it's going to 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.810
 finance the property for 10 years 120 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.969
 quotas adjusted to cash remember that 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.770
 more or less increases at the rate of 30 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.539
 percent per year but good is a 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.149
 alternative for those who want to buy 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.709
 a property has pesos wants no 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.910
 has the alternative to access a 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.310
 bank credit 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.440
 makes a kind of contract with the 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.360
 developer but eye back to the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.950
 small print because you can have 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.270
 Property availability you can 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.030
 Do what you want with the property 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:28.130
 just when you finish paying the three 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.130
 fourth parts of that contract
