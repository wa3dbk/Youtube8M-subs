how's<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.670> holding<00:01:32.820> up<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> 81<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:34.049> far<00:01:34.290> so

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
how's it holding up on the 81 so far so

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.990 
how's it holding up on the 81 so far so
good<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.950> said<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.280> haven't<00:01:35.430> dropped<00:01:35.759> this

used to them I'm used to them because

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.620 
used to them I'm used to them because
you<00:02:22.800> have<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:22.920> 5.2<00:02:23.550> inch<00:02:23.700> display<00:02:24.120> here<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:24.420> out

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
you have a 5.2 inch display here so out

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.540 
you have a 5.2 inch display here so out
of<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.840> gate<00:02:25.050> this<00:02:25.260> display<00:02:25.650> is<00:02:25.680> big<00:02:26.040> anyway

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
of the gate this display is big anyway

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.160 
of the gate this display is big anyway
and<00:02:26.850> with<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.330> buttons<00:02:27.600> on<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.810> side<00:02:27.990> even

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
and with the buttons on the side even

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.360 
and with the buttons on the side even
that's<00:02:28.319> taking<00:02:28.590> up<00:02:28.650> some<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.040> display

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
that's taking up some of the display

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.850 
that's taking up some of the display
space<00:02:29.670> it's<00:02:30.270> not<00:02:30.480> bad<00:02:30.780> it's<00:02:31.080> just<00:02:31.590> something

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
space it's not bad it's just something

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.930 
space it's not bad it's just something
that<00:02:31.890> takes<00:02:32.069> up<00:02:32.250> space<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.459> obviously<00:02:32.819> when

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
that takes up space and obviously when

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.190 
that takes up space and obviously when
you<00:02:33.000> have<00:02:33.090> youtube<00:02:33.480> running<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:33.930> things<00:02:34.080> like

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
you have youtube running and things like

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.690 
you have youtube running and things like
that<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.500> buttons<00:02:34.770> do<00:02:35.010> go<00:02:35.220> away<00:02:35.459> or<00:02:35.610> the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
that the buttons do go away or the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.270 
that the buttons do go away or the
on-screen<00:02:36.030> navigation<00:02:36.840> buttons<00:02:37.620> do<00:02:37.830> go<00:02:38.010> away

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
on-screen navigation buttons do go away

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.340 
on-screen navigation buttons do go away
so<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.880> can<00:02:39.000> get<00:02:39.120> rid<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.360> those<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.810> things

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
so you can get rid of those and things

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.660 
so you can get rid of those and things
that<00:02:40.470> are<00:02:40.530> important<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:40.950> maximize<00:02:41.489> the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.490 
that are important to maximize the
screen<00:02:41.819> viewability<00:02:42.420> like<00:02:42.840> obviously<00:02:43.410> a

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
screen viewability like obviously a

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.500 
screen viewability like obviously a
YouTube<00:02:43.830> video<00:02:43.980> or<00:02:44.370> something<00:02:45.030> like<00:02:45.450> that

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
YouTube video or something like that
