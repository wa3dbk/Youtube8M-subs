00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Ideal career for art graduates

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
What is the ideal career for art graduates?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
According to the 2010 statistics on art graduates,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
only 16% wished to become an artist while  
40% wished to work for private corporations.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Their top destinations were advertisement 
agencies and media production companies.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Q. Why did you become an artist soon after graduation?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Actually, I didn ft become an artist 
soon after, or should I say I couldn ft.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Most graduates were very 
skilled in art even as students,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
so uni was all about cultivating one fs own style.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But in my case, I was no where near that stage
so I never thought I could become an artist.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Wanting to work in the field of art, I got a curator fs 
qualification with the hope of working in museums. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It wasn ft utill I made my graduation project
that I had finally developed my own style of art.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
That became the starting point for me in art, 
but I never thought I could become an artist.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
After graduation, I worked part time until a year
later when I found an art related fulltime job.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:38.000
After graduation, I worked part time until a year
later when I found an art related fulltime job.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Even as I worked full time, 
I continue with my art activities. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Q. Have you ever been satisfied with your art works?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
No, I fve never been.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It fs always a struggle against myself.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Once you are satisfied, that fs the end of it.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.200
So I fll continue my art activities
but I don ft think I fll ever be satisfied.
