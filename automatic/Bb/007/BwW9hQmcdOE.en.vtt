type<00:00:58.570> pokemon<00:01:00.449> now<00:01:01.449> i<00:01:01.510> think<00:01:01.689> if<00:01:02.140> you<00:01:02.229> want<00:01:02.409> to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
type pokemon now i think if you want to

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.539 
type pokemon now i think if you want to
get<00:01:02.649> the<00:01:02.859> highest<00:01:03.820> points<00:01:04.509> possible<00:01:05.549> they're

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
get the highest points possible they're

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.730 
get the highest points possible they're
not<00:01:06.909> going<00:01:07.539> to<00:01:07.630> be<00:01:07.780> able<00:01:07.810> to<00:01:08.049> weaken<00:01:08.440> it<00:01:08.590> you

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
not going to be able to weaken it you

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.620 
not going to be able to weaken it you
can't<00:01:08.979> put<00:01:09.159> status<00:01:09.729> ambulance<00:01:10.149> on<00:01:10.270> it<00:01:10.420> which

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
can't put status ambulance on it which

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.840 
can't put status ambulance on it which
basically<00:01:11.259> turns<00:01:11.649> us<00:01:11.830> into<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.190> safari<00:01:12.700> zone

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
basically turns us into the safari zone

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.980 
basically turns us into the safari zone
which<00:01:13.240> I<00:01:13.539> really<00:01:14.020> key<00:01:14.380> because<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:16.420> all<00:01:16.600> luck

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
which I really key because it's all luck

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.090 
which I really key because it's all luck
at<00:01:17.170> that<00:01:17.350> point<00:01:21.149> and<00:01:22.319> the<00:01:23.319> sport<00:01:23.679> balls<00:01:23.890> aren't

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
at that point and the sport balls aren't

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.039 
at that point and the sport balls aren't
even<00:01:24.369> up<00:01:24.459> strong<00:01:24.909> in<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.149> first<00:01:25.420> days<00:01:25.690> I<00:01:25.869> don't

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
even up strong in the first days I don't

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.930 
even up strong in the first days I don't
think<00:01:26.289> there<00:01:26.920> any<00:01:27.100> better<00:01:27.399> than<00:01:27.610> maybe

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
think there any better than maybe

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:37.660 
think there any better than maybe
straight<00:01:28.479> doesn't<00:01:28.780> know<00:01:32.039> if<00:01:33.039> even<00:01:33.850> that

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.850 

now<00:01:38.670> you'll<00:01:39.180> notice<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.480> the<00:01:39.870> levels<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.770> a

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
to get those types of scores you can

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.500 
to get those types of scores you can
tweak<00:04:07.130> in<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.400> pokemon<00:04:07.880> and<00:04:08.060> you<00:04:08.210> can't<00:04:08.450> even

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
tweak in the pokemon and you can't even

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.110 
tweak in the pokemon and you can't even
like<00:04:08.780> paralyzed<00:04:09.320> it<00:04:09.760> because<00:04:10.760> that<00:04:10.970> actually

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
like paralyzed it because that actually

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.620 
like paralyzed it because that actually
hurt<00:04:11.450> you<00:04:11.600> score<00:04:11.930> a<00:04:11.960> why<00:04:15.310> but<00:04:16.310> that<00:04:16.459> was<00:04:16.580> a<00:04:16.670> good

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
hurt you score a why but that was a good

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.020 
hurt you score a why but that was a good
easy<00:04:17.840> catch<00:04:18.200> actually<00:04:18.650> cutting<00:04:18.890> one<00:04:19.400> try<00:04:19.730> you

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
easy catch actually cutting one try you

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.090 
easy catch actually cutting one try you
later<00:04:20.209> tufik<00:04:20.840> door<00:04:21.020> like<00:04:21.170> half<00:04:21.440> of<00:04:21.560> my<00:04:21.680> sport

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
later tufik door like half of my sport

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.100 
later tufik door like half of my sport
balls<00:04:22.340> or<00:04:22.490> try<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.670> catch<00:04:22.910> that<00:04:23.120> plane<00:04:25.660> and<00:04:26.660> you

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
balls or try to catch that plane and you

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.940 
balls or try to catch that plane and you
cook<00:04:27.290> up<00:04:27.410> a<00:04:27.530> random<00:04:28.130> stone<00:04:29.290> get<00:04:30.290> a<00:04:30.320> fire<00:04:30.590> stone

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
cook up a random stone get a fire stone

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.790 
cook up a random stone get a fire stone
here<00:04:31.750> here<00:04:32.750> I<00:04:32.780> think<00:04:33.170> we<00:04:33.230> can<00:04:33.380> actually<00:04:33.500> pick

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
here here I think we can actually pick

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.970 
here here I think we can actually pick
up<00:04:33.950> like<00:04:34.220> shiny<00:04:34.610> stones<00:04:35.000> dawn<00:04:35.420> stones<00:04:35.980> the

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
up like shiny stones dawn stones the

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:43.620 
up like shiny stones dawn stones the
stones<00:04:37.040> I<00:04:37.790> think<00:04:39.400> but<00:04:40.400> those<00:04:40.550> are<00:04:40.700> random<00:04:41.120> so<00:04:41.480> I

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
stones I think but those are random so I

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.060 
stones I think but those are random so I
don't<00:04:44.630> think<00:04:44.780> I<00:04:44.840> would<00:04:44.990> rely<00:04:45.320> on<00:04:45.620> this<00:04:45.770> place

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
don't think I would rely on this place

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.030 
don't think I would rely on this place
for<00:04:46.490> catching<00:04:47.210> or<00:04:47.560> forgetting<00:04:48.560> those<00:04:48.740> types

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
for catching or forgetting those types

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:58.670 
for catching or forgetting those types
of<00:04:49.160> stones<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:53.180> easiest<00:04:53.600> ways<00:04:53.780> just<00:04:54.110> to

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:32.550 

does<00:04:59.680> it<00:04:59.830> train<00:05:00.160> it<00:05:00.310> over

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.770 

so<00:05:33.560> I<00:05:33.590> guess<00:05:33.980> I'll<00:05:34.460> just<00:05:36.490> fly<00:05:37.490> over<00:05:37.850> the<00:05:38.330> null

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
so I guess I'll just fly over the null

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:45.730 
so I guess I'll just fly over the null
Silver<00:05:39.110> here

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.490 

and<00:05:46.190> it's<00:05:46.819> all<00:05:47.090> call<00:05:47.660> me<00:05:47.690> think<00:05:48.050> about<00:05:48.169> whether

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:48.500 
and it's all call me think about whether

00:05:48.500 --> 00:06:00.159 
and it's all call me think about whether
i<00:05:48.620> should<00:05:48.740> go<00:05:48.889> into<00:05:49.310> the<00:05:49.810> cave<00:05:50.810> or<00:05:51.080> not<00:05:59.169> there

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
i should go into the cave or not there

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.939 
i should go into the cave or not there
is<00:06:00.199> a<00:06:00.319> mole<00:06:00.860> prison<00:06:01.340> there<00:06:01.580> so<00:06:02.620> the<00:06:03.620> point<00:06:03.770> is

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:03.949 
is a mole prison there so the point is

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:07.150 
is a mole prison there so the point is
go<00:06:04.160> consider<00:06:05.289> going<00:06:06.289> to<00:06:06.470> catch<00:06:06.650> that<00:06:06.680> thing

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
go consider going to catch that thing

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.960 
go consider going to catch that thing
first<00:06:09.039> alright<00:06:10.039> well<00:06:10.280> I'll<00:06:10.400> take<00:06:10.610> a<00:06:10.639> break

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
first alright well I'll take a break

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.230 
first alright well I'll take a break
right<00:06:11.180> here<00:06:11.240> or<00:06:11.780> next<00:06:12.349> part<00:06:12.970> try<00:06:13.970> to<00:06:14.030> figure

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
right here or next part try to figure

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.420 
right here or next part try to figure
out<00:06:14.419> what<00:06:14.569> I<00:06:14.599> want<00:06:14.930> to<00:06:15.349> do<00:06:15.560> if<00:06:15.770> i<00:06:15.919> want<00:06:16.280> to<00:06:16.340> get
