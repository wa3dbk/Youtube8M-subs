this<00:00:12.900> tool<00:00:13.230> has<00:00:13.620> been<00:00:14.009> used<00:00:14.570> probably<00:00:15.570> for

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
this tool has been used probably for

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.279 
this tool has been used probably for
more<00:00:16.320> than<00:00:16.529> thirty<00:00:16.800> thousand<00:00:17.369> years<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.289> when

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
more than thirty thousand years and when

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.029 
more than thirty thousand years and when
we<00:00:19.340> twist<00:00:20.340> fibers<00:00:21.060> into<00:00:21.390> yarn<00:00:21.949> we<00:00:22.949> are

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
we twist fibers into yarn we are

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.000 
we twist fibers into yarn we are
actually<00:00:23.250> creating<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.330> spiral<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
actually creating a spiral and the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.890 
actually creating a spiral and the
spiral<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.660> cosmic<00:00:28.500> gesture<00:00:29.010> of<00:00:29.039> creation

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
spiral is a cosmic gesture of creation

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.190 
spiral is a cosmic gesture of creation
when<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:31.050> look<00:00:31.289> at<00:00:31.590> our<00:00:32.160> galaxy<00:00:32.940> from<00:00:33.899> outer

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
when we look at our galaxy from outer

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.790 
when we look at our galaxy from outer
space<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> spiral<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.149> we<00:00:36.930> find<00:00:37.200> spirals

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
space it is a spiral and we find spirals

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.069 
space it is a spiral and we find spirals
in<00:00:38.070> many<00:00:38.399> many<00:00:38.640> places<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> plant<00:00:39.750> world

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
in many many places in the plant world

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.010 
in many many places in the plant world
in<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.910> back<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.210> our<00:00:42.300> head<00:00:42.600> we<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:42.989> a

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
in in on the back of our head we have a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.700 
in in on the back of our head we have a
spiral<00:00:44.059> so<00:00:45.440> this<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.710> an<00:00:46.890> activity<00:00:47.250> that

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
spiral so this is an activity that

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.850 
spiral so this is an activity that
brings<00:00:49.710> us<00:00:50.129> closer<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.809> cosmos<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.649> could

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
brings us closer to the cosmos you could

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.150 
brings us closer to the cosmos you could
say<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.699> at<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.059> same<00:00:54.329> time<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:55.770> create

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
say but at the same time we create

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.119 
say but at the same time we create
something<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.329> useful<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.469> beautiful

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
something that is useful and beautiful

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.000 
something that is useful and beautiful
because<00:01:00.000> with<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.930> yarn<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.410> we<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.680> spun

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
because with the yarn that we have spun

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.679 
because with the yarn that we have spun
we<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:03.120> create<00:01:03.650> sweaters<00:01:04.880> hats<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.450> mittens

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
we can create sweaters hats and mittens

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.690 
we can create sweaters hats and mittens
and<00:01:07.080> scarves<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:09.890> to<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.369> skill

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
and scarves and so on to have the skill

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.140 
and scarves and so on to have the skill
of<00:01:11.970> knitting<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.500> skill<00:01:13.799> of

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
of knitting to have the skill of

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.570 
of knitting to have the skill of
crocheting<00:01:15.150> or<00:01:15.420> felting<00:01:16.159> makes<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.369> possible

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
crocheting or felting makes it possible

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.730 
crocheting or felting makes it possible
for<00:01:17.880> us<00:01:18.090> not<00:01:18.299> only<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.630> make<00:01:18.960> something<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:19.619> it

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
for us not only to make something but it

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.880 
for us not only to make something but it
makes<00:01:19.979> us<00:01:20.250> skilled<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:21.030> general<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:22.259> use<00:01:22.560> of

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
makes us skilled in general the use of

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.120 
makes us skilled in general the use of
the<00:01:23.040> hands<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.820> vital<00:01:24.689> for<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.500> human<00:01:25.920> being

if I make something then I think about

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.240 
if I make something then I think about
room<00:02:08.520> how<00:02:08.789> was<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.179> yarn<00:02:09.509> made<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:11.039> past

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.580 
room how was that yarn made in the past
there<00:02:11.670> were<00:02:11.790> also<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.420> professions<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.349> the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
there were also the professions of the

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.610 
there were also the professions of the
shoemaker<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.629> tailor<00:02:15.629> and<00:02:15.930> so<00:02:16.170> on

shoemaker and the tailor and so on

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.160 
shoemaker and the tailor and so on
and<00:02:16.709> that's<00:02:17.459> also<00:02:17.790> being<00:02:18.120> lost<00:02:18.450> if<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.870> do

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
and that's also being lost if you do

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.740 
and that's also being lost if you do
practical<00:02:19.800> work<00:02:20.180> somewhere<00:02:21.180> on<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> school

the<00:02:24.599> children<00:02:24.989> will<00:02:25.140> all<00:02:25.349> go<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.890> they

that<00:02:33.660> there<00:02:34.019> is<00:02:34.080> less<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.470> less<00:02:34.590> of<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:35.000> in

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
that there is less and less of that in

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.330 
that there is less and less of that in
the<00:02:36.180> home<00:02:36.390> okay<00:02:37.379> you<00:02:37.709> know<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:37.920> can<00:02:38.160> use

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
the home okay you know you can use

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.520 
the home okay you know you can use
already<00:02:38.849> bought<00:02:39.060> vegetables<00:02:39.330> all<00:02:39.959> chopped<00:02:40.319> up

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
already bought vegetables all chopped up

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.190 
already bought vegetables all chopped up
and<00:02:40.799> ready<00:02:41.129> to<00:02:41.519> eat<00:02:41.700> there<00:02:42.569> is<00:02:42.599> very<00:02:42.989> little

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
and ready to eat there is very little

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.440 
and ready to eat there is very little
activity<00:02:43.920> like<00:02:44.160> kneading<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.819> bread<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.299> you

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
activity like kneading the bread and you

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.170 
activity like kneading the bread and you
know<00:02:45.569> children<00:02:46.079> grasp<00:02:46.560> first<00:02:47.160> an<00:02:47.430> item<00:02:47.910> and

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
know children grasp first an item and

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.770 
know children grasp first an item and
then<00:02:49.019> they<00:02:49.170> grasp<00:02:49.500> with<00:02:49.980> their<00:02:50.250> mind<00:02:50.579> so<00:02:51.420> if

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
then they grasp with their mind so if

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.660 
then they grasp with their mind so if
they<00:02:51.959> have<00:02:52.200> very<00:02:52.440> little<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.950> grasp<00:02:53.280> other

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
they have very little to grasp other

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.740 
they have very little to grasp other
than<00:02:53.940> plastic<00:02:54.720> ready-made<00:02:55.500> toys<00:02:55.849> then<00:02:56.849> what

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
than plastic ready-made toys then what

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.119 
than plastic ready-made toys then what
their<00:02:57.959> mind<00:02:58.230> grasps<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:59.280> very<00:02:59.610> little<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.720> toy

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
their mind grasps is very little the toy

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.250 
their mind grasps is very little the toy
automatically<00:03:02.129> moves<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:04.110> know

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
automatically moves and you know

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.410 
automatically moves and you know
children<00:03:04.860> can<00:03:05.129> only<00:03:05.280> be<00:03:05.489> kind<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.849> astonished

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
children can only be kind of astonished

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.900 
children can only be kind of astonished
by<00:03:06.629> that<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.650> there<00:03:07.860> is<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.160> loss<00:03:08.610> of

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
by that so there is this loss of

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.410 
by that so there is this loss of
understanding<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:11.010> value<00:03:11.459> of<00:03:11.519> things<00:03:11.970> of

even spun the yarn even better and that
we<00:03:31.620> have<00:03:31.859> designed<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:33.060> when<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:33.810> do<00:03:33.959> that<00:03:34.139> I

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
we have designed and when I do that I

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.050 
we have designed and when I do that I
feel<00:03:35.430> whole<00:03:36.090> I<00:03:36.480> feel<00:03:37.410> I'm<00:03:37.889> experiencing<00:03:38.790> my

process<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:43.200> have<00:03:43.349> to<00:03:43.560> find<00:03:43.980> your<00:03:44.280> way<00:03:44.310> you

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
process you have to find your way you

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.210 
process you have to find your way you
have<00:03:44.819> to<00:03:45.000> listen<00:03:45.359> with<00:03:45.510> your<00:03:45.660> whole<00:03:45.810> being<00:03:46.220> and

that is a schooling that we all need

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.309 
that is a schooling that we all need
today<00:03:49.849> because<00:03:50.849> we're<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:51.209> eccentric<00:03:51.810> and

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
today because we're so eccentric and

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.729 
today because we're so eccentric and
this<00:03:52.980> makes<00:03:53.250> us<00:03:53.489> think<00:03:54.419> of<00:03:54.720> what<00:03:54.900> is<00:03:55.019> needed<00:03:55.290> by

this makes us think of what is needed by
something<00:03:56.130> else<00:03:56.489> so<00:03:57.329> we<00:03:57.540> are<00:03:57.750> in<00:03:58.079> a<00:03:58.200> way

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
something else so we are in a way
