00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 I do not like to exercise to you that you 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.150
 motivated to do so because obesity and 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.580
 overweight is one of the main 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.980
 health problems in mexico what do you 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.130
 it would seem to go down to 15 kilos in a month 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.789
 without physically spending what you 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.650
 you mean atkins diet is perfect you can 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.189
 consume all lipids and proteins 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.260
 you want but that if you do not even 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.150
 will happen to consume carbohydrates 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.250
 and you think depriving yourself of the main 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.470
 energy source that your body uses 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.570
 and your brain is such a good idea there's no 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.670
 inconvenient because the absence of 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.230
 carbohydrates accelerates the use of fats 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.680
 to get energy 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.030
 also fats and proteins 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.550
 they remain in the stomach for more 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.440
 time to see you are forgetting that 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.500
 our body uses metabolic pathways 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.210
 in order to transform food the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.910
 time of oxidation in the metabolic pathway 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.789
 which leads to the degradation of acids 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.829
 fatty to circus molecules ' enzymes that 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.199
 when they are produced in excess it takes us to 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.220
 the formation of ketone bodies as 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.220
 Latvians 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.680
 and the beta hydroxide pull cough sees it this 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.140
 diet is perfect because precisely the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.960
 beta hydroxybutyric which is acetone 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.390
 that occurs more abundantly under these 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.120
 conditions and appetite center level 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.400
 which leads to a loss of weight 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.500
 but this one produces tea because the 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.480
 Ketone bodies serve as reserves 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.340
 but when only alternative is 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.680
 your body for very long periods of time 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.600
 prolonged is like playing to be 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.570
 diabetic because you yourself are 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.250
 also inducing the circulation of 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.979
 fatty acids and from these bodies 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.440
 Ketones accelerate the degradation of 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.920
 proteins so you're burning 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:46.530
 lean mass not fat the restriction of 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.229
 carbohydrates causes the loss of 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.990
 glycogen and water therefore your being 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.100
 excluded that they will dehydrate you not 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.160
 they are going to lose weight 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.650
 also imagine just consuming lipids and 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.530
 proteins and stop consuming delicious 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.790
 pasta that cookies the truth I 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.520
 I would put 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.340
 that covers the famous bounces because 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.060
 we add the sugars to our 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.720
 body is very against proven that the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.510
 super fat fat skinny with bow is 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.190
 harmful to your body but this diet 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.830
 it is considered to have power 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.490
 antioxidant has even been talked about 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.740
 possible anticancer effects and everything 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.810
 then the diet understands who can 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.010
 take you to experience headache 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.660
 dizziness nausea vomiting fatigue and also 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.510
 you can cause a failure 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.580
 cardiac due to excess acids 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.470
 Fatty consumed one more recommendation 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.770
 sensible for the people we are looking for 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.190
 lose weight is the use of diets that 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:53.450
 have low caloric content and that 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.450
 alternate with exercises
