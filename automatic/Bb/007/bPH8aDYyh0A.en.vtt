00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
reason I don't know is because this is

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.230 
reason I don't know is because this is
completely<00:01:10.650> up<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.070> now<00:01:11.880> here's<00:01:12.119> where

upside<00:01:14.729> down<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> little<00:01:15.090> bit<00:01:15.299> flip<00:01:15.780> your

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
upside down a little bit flip your

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.780 
upside down a little bit flip your
intuition<00:01:16.350> upside<00:01:16.619> down<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.070> consider<00:01:17.400> some

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
intuition upside down and consider some

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.810 
intuition upside down and consider some
things<00:01:18.000> backwards<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.720> two<00:01:18.960> most<00:01:19.830> critical

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
things backwards the two most critical

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.929 
things backwards the two most critical
workout<00:01:21.750> progression<00:01:22.590> killers<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.369> stress

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
workout progression killers is stress

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.990 
workout progression killers is stress
and<00:01:24.350> too<00:01:25.350> much<00:01:25.470> exercise<00:01:25.909> emotional<00:01:26.909> and

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
and too much exercise emotional and

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.219 
and too much exercise emotional and
physical<00:01:27.119> stress<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.780> too<00:01:27.840> much<00:01:27.990> exercise

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
physical stress and too much exercise

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.830 
physical stress and too much exercise
now<00:01:28.890> dieting<00:01:29.520> obviously<00:01:30.030> causes<00:01:30.360> emotional

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
now dieting obviously causes emotional

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.600 
now dieting obviously causes emotional
stress<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.710> big<00:01:31.860> problem<00:01:32.130> you've<00:01:32.430> got

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
stress so it's a big problem you've got

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.700 
stress so it's a big problem you've got
two<00:01:32.820> things<00:01:33.030> clashing<00:01:33.689> head-on<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.500> need

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
two things clashing head-on so you need

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.289 
two things clashing head-on so you need
a<00:01:34.740> diet<00:01:35.100> that's<00:01:35.280> not<00:01:35.610> going<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.820> cause<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.180> too

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
a diet that's not going to cause you too

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.870 
a diet that's not going to cause you too
much<00:01:36.450> stress<00:01:36.689> down<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> solution<00:01:38.070> for<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.220> but

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
much stress down a solution for that but

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.069 
much stress down a solution for that but
the<00:01:39.000> other<00:01:39.150> thing<00:01:39.329> you've<00:01:39.540> got<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.780> stay<00:01:39.900> out

of training that people are were

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.850 
of training that people are were
suggesting<00:02:38.140> that<00:02:38.140> they<00:02:38.380> were<00:02:38.440> they<00:02:38.800> were

doing<00:02:39.070> now<00:02:39.460> the<00:02:39.520> average<00:02:39.940> human<00:02:40.090> couldn't

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
doing now the average human couldn't

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.210 
doing now the average human couldn't
possibly<00:02:41.020> do<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.770> publishers<00:02:42.190> of

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
possibly do that and the publishers of

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.530 
possibly do that and the publishers of
the<00:02:42.340> magazine<00:02:42.730> knew<00:02:42.850> that<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:43.240> they<00:02:43.360> were<00:02:43.420> able

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
the magazine knew that so they were able

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.150 
the magazine knew that so they were able
to<00:02:43.810> create<00:02:44.050> ah<00:02:44.260> well<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.710> reason<00:02:44.890> why<00:02:45.100> you

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
to create ah well the reason why you

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.190 
to create ah well the reason why you
can't<00:02:45.550> do<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:46.000> is<00:02:46.300> because<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:46.900> aren't

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
can't do that is because you aren't

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.230 
can't do that is because you aren't
taking<00:02:47.290> our<00:02:47.590> magical<00:02:48.070> formula<00:02:48.370> for<00:02:48.820> recovery

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
taking our magical formula for recovery

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.330 
taking our magical formula for recovery
here<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.600> is<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.930> know<00:02:50.020> so<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.980> worked<00:02:51.220> very

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
here it is you know so it worked very

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.460 
here it is you know so it worked very
well<00:02:51.610> financially<00:02:52.030> but<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.900> didn't<00:02:53.140> work<00:02:53.170> too

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
well financially but it didn't work too

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.440 
well financially but it didn't work too
well<00:02:53.500> for<00:02:53.680> guys<00:02:54.040> like<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.520> and<00:02:54.550> me<00:02:54.730> or<00:02:54.850> girls

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
well for guys like you and me or girls

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.270 
well for guys like you and me or girls
like<00:02:55.890> no<00:02:56.890> one<00:02:57.040> here<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.550> you<00:02:58.380> then<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.980> doesn't

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
like no one here and you then it doesn't

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.430 
like no one here and you then it doesn't
work<00:03:00.310> that<00:03:00.430> way<00:03:00.760> so<00:03:00.820> they<00:03:01.810> created<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.290> false

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
work that way so they created a false

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.260 
work that way so they created a false
condition<00:03:02.710> and<00:03:03.160> therefore<00:03:03.280> created<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:04.030> false

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
condition and therefore created a false

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.940 
condition and therefore created a false
need<00:03:04.540> for<00:03:04.870> false<00:03:05.230> supplementation<00:03:05.890> now

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950

a<00:04:07.870> variable<00:04:08.230> both<00:04:08.830> of<00:04:09.010> which<00:04:09.130> say<00:04:09.370> now<00:04:09.640> this

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
a variable both of which say now this

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.660 
a variable both of which say now this
time<00:04:10.300> would<00:04:10.540> go<00:04:10.600> down<00:04:10.989> as<00:04:11.410> intensity<00:04:12.310> went<00:04:12.550> up

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
time would go down as intensity went up

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.340 
time would go down as intensity went up
so<00:04:13.090> i<00:04:13.120> asked<00:04:13.360> him<00:04:13.420> about<00:04:13.570> that<00:04:13.900> what<00:04:14.230> about

four days a week how is it possible if
what<00:04:47.380> you're<00:04:47.500> saying<00:04:47.530> is<00:04:47.800> true<00:04:47.860> that<00:04:48.460> there's

yeah probably i go didn't you don't know
how<00:05:25.780> long<00:05:25.990> it<00:05:26.140> will<00:05:26.170> take<00:05:26.260> you<00:05:26.560> because<00:05:26.710> you

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
how long it will take you because you

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.370 
how long it will take you because you
didn't<00:05:27.250> start<00:05:27.460> at<00:05:27.700> the<00:05:27.730> bottom<00:05:28.110> you<00:05:29.110> didn't

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
didn't start at the bottom you didn't

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.470 
didn't start at the bottom you didn't
start<00:05:29.740> at<00:05:29.980> a<00:05:30.040> low<00:05:30.640> enough<00:05:30.880> variable<00:05:31.360> to

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
start at a low enough variable to

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.180 
start at a low enough variable to
determine<00:05:31.930> how<00:05:32.050> long<00:05:32.110> it<00:05:32.320> would<00:05:32.590> really<00:05:33.010> take

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
determine how long it would really take
