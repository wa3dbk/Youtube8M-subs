00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.540
 at the velodrome your memory also a 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.120
 remember that you share regularly 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:19.320
 with acts and a half at the fair in 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.570
 particular same age after matches 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.859
 he remains passionate about the matches of 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.439
 matches are left but the victory 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.199
 against milan wayne in the world this is 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.179
 a whole thing i mean month it wants 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.740
 that is what I remember what I 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.960
 remember it's so unthinkable 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:40.980
 it's not a year no it's not a bad thing 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:42.600
 it's not a story goal and it's in 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.789
 these six years passed by the yardstick you have 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.180
 you have you dominate the championship 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.570
 of France 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.309
 head and shoulders 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.110
 it was difficult to recover each 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.440
 year of questioning themselves and then 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.079
 to set out to conquer a title 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.960
 however this is level 6 from here that 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.550
 lyon this year when i get each 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.350
 year it was the same with two teams 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:11.010
 who were politics and up to 5 6 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.520
 end days the chauvinous city like 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.409
 stable 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:19.890
 yeah shit excuse the difference with 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:22.020
 experience the experience of the big 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.330
 matches and then we had a big 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.720
 team so if you did not have them 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.590
 nobody 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.530
 we knew we could win differently 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.090
 and it is that she is confident in you 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.020
 you did at that moment I'm good 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.990
 well on collective plan you dominate 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.880
 blurred and dark and especially individual you 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.360
 chained five top scorer titles 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.649
 of the championship it was a challenge to 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.689
 every beginning of season like everything 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.030
 it was part of the names 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.750
 it was a result of a result of the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.689
 Marseille season 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.770
 not because the purpose of the club 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.570
 were not unemployed scorers 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.530
 that was why champions after after 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.400
 the teams when the scorer gets the advantage 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.750
 cardboard and that it must turn another 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.660
 scorer goes on and that's what they have 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.150
 does the months for ten years as the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.410
 Milan do it with my stand as the 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.540
 real 2 was making doves in gueugnon 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.850
 means that even in the politics of 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.070
 recruitment of course of course but when 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.660
 do not you when you do not have this scorer 40 a 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.730
 problem today that I'm asking them their 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.890
 today as to malouda who brand 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.570
 goals do what you want 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.180
 in a constant tender concern 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.420
 associate teams in motor homes 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.440
 a problem it was it was 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.010
 heavy to bear this responsibility 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.340
 to have the game so at all to instinct 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.239
 pau and then play are asked questions 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.220
 if you want so sure of me that 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.560
 never able match and the nama rusal and 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.100
 with that I knew how to evoke team and 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.650
 also know 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:55.070
 therefore it is the insurance of the goods of 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.470
 tension served play that quietly 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:02.150
 because at one point he knew that 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.930
 I was going to put in the bottom maybe it's 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.450
 that's finally the difference between 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.820
 pursuers like burgundy paris except 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.310
 that I was going to know the deadlines as 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.700
 monaco paris bordeaux august had when 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.540
 even teams that 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:22.379
 who you are and how tough I was when I called 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:26.190
 monaco had or alban coupe de france 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:29.430
 is that up to 3.4 g of the end they 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.040
 are at our basques tallec in enamels and has 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.670
 like a cape a hotel all around him 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.660
 a team that was left designing a 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:46.410
 level 2 did you have with you clear 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:49.080
 towards the frontal and the world when finally 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.630
 we are talking about moments that if nico was 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.450
 rather happy if amanda lo it's this 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.709
 champions league final this 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.120
 career we're going to have that moments 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:02.160
 happy here I will like moments 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.950
 unhappy yamaha and thankfully for 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.599
 me it's not funny we're this 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.329
 lost final against the red star of 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.819
 belgrade knows it's still a rodez 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.019
 today it's in a match that you 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.829
 guess even if I regretted 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.989
 today what could we 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.220
 switch 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.780
 yes it will be theirs is of course that 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.019
 it remains a regret because we have not 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.800
 played this final we did not play in 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.600
 makes a monstrous journey 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.560
 gather not to do better by 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.060
 compared to patients on behalf of a 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.610
 game of Poznan and looks after 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.060
 won in a draw because behind 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.060
 go out 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.310
 of course regrets 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.360
 he has to raise it is on but good 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.630
 it will not change much 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.120
 this match will not play we stayed 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.080
 quietly they would react the 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.699
 part and then you also produce food 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.660
 mentally no they were giving up on 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:05.750
 to eat it is played in nothing but in the face 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.160
 is a paradox is that you lose 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.310
 this final but behind you on the 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.330
 personal plan you sure important but this 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.259
 is not the fact that in the final 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.020
 it's not like the League of 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:16.610
 champions before this golden ball it's 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.620
 it was difficult it was particular to 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.910
 the time of receiving such a beautiful 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.090
 reward especially individually 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.250
 collectively was beating vote next was 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.240
 rather maybe unhappy was not 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.710
 held that these are champions is 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.080
 it is the team of France and the team of 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.569
 France this year with all the matches 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.139
 playoffs the blue natoire for 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:39.460
 go to sweden 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:40.720
 so it was eight games so we had 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.940
 two matches of his team 2 match 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.169
 against Spain in the magnifying glass 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.160
 relatively difficult to win 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.039
 all matches and brands and 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.370
 practically every time I still had 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:54.520
 been top scorer champion of France 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.580
 final of the league of champions so 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.410
 somewhere that marked the spirits 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:03.370
 first on the result the end it takes 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:06.729
 to find that it is your most beautiful if me 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.990
 I think about the climate the lack and it will do 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.190
 finland the champions in title 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.190
 is for all seasons
