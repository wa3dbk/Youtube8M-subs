00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.310
 how about youtube friends are 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.220
 Welcome once again to your channel 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:18.290
 android tutorials 2.0 and good in this 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.960
 chance let's see how to install 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.240
 Android on the PC using a program 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.220
 it's called bluestacks for me it's one 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.900
 of the best android emulators that 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.810
 currently exist as there are others 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.400
 emulators but for me this is the best 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.460
 because it has better performance 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.070
 greater fluidity compared to the others 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.480
 emulators that there are and good inside 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.210
 this emulator we are going to be able to 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.129
 install applications or games like 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.820
 it is commonly installed inside a 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.290
 android phone and for that we are going to 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.000
 download this program from the link 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.519

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:24.069

 ready already started component program 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.829
 has an interface that already comes by

 default in the program in 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:43.540
 personal I do not like it but as I do not 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.090
 displeased this interface we are going to put 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.840
 an interface like it is in phones 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.879

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.860
 configured because I already had it 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.150
 previously installed and gave me the 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.940
 configuration that I had put it 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.030
 previously now here in the bar 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:23.460
 search we write a launcher in this 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.460

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.580

 and ready automatically the 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.650
 launcher as we normally know it 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.190

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.000
 some applications that are already coming 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.920
 installed but here I see some 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.810
 applications that I had already installed 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.209
 previously, as I told you, there 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.340
 installed this program and I took the 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.500
 configuration that I had previously 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.140
 within this program we can 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.420
