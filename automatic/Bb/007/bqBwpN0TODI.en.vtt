00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
powders and things and the answer is

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.970 
powders and things and the answer is
probably<00:00:20.820> not<00:00:21.390> no<00:00:22.199> that's<00:00:22.439> really<00:00:22.710> not<00:00:22.830> a

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
probably not no that's really not a

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.109 
probably not no that's really not a

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
micronutrients and the thing is as far

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.970 
micronutrients and the thing is as far
as<00:00:26.550> multivitamin<00:00:27.300> supplements<00:00:27.779> go<00:00:27.960> if<00:00:28.320> you

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
and in many cases some experts you know

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.980 
and in many cases some experts you know
they<00:01:08.310> could<00:01:08.460> even<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.760> dangerous<00:01:09.000> or<00:01:09.479> damaging

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
they could even be dangerous or damaging

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.469 
they could even be dangerous or damaging
to<00:01:10.110> your<00:01:10.260> body<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.880> still<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.150> subject

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
to your body so this is still a subject

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.210 
to your body so this is still a subject
of<00:01:12.780> controversy<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.530> has<00:01:13.710> been<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.130> many

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
of controversy and it has been for many

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.070 
of controversy and it has been for many
many<00:01:14.369> years<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.060> trying<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.360> rely<00:01:15.689> upon<00:01:15.810> these

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
many years so trying to rely upon these

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.600 
many years so trying to rely upon these
things<00:01:16.140> or<00:01:16.530> even<00:01:16.740> using<00:01:17.040> them<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> failsafe

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
things or even using them as a failsafe

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.670 
things or even using them as a failsafe
when<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> experts<00:01:18.630> can't<00:01:18.900> even<00:01:19.170> agree<00:01:19.290> if

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
when the experts can't even agree if

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.859 
when the experts can't even agree if
they're<00:01:19.830> dangerous<00:01:20.250> or<00:01:20.430> not<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.850> really<00:01:21.840> a

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
they're dangerous or not is really a

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.320 
they're dangerous or not is really a
silly<00:01:22.170> idea<00:01:22.520> what<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.549> always<00:01:23.729> tell<00:01:23.970> people<00:01:24.150> is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
silly idea what I always tell people is

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.609 
silly idea what I always tell people is
that<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.540> you're<00:01:24.659> missing<00:01:24.960> one<00:01:25.290> or<00:01:25.320> two

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
that if you're missing one or two

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.230 
that if you're missing one or two
vitamins<00:01:26.159> from<00:01:26.340> your<00:01:26.549> diet<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.030> think

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
vitamins from your diet that you think

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.609 
vitamins from your diet that you think
you<00:01:27.330> could<00:01:27.450> benefit<00:01:27.750> from<00:01:27.810> go<00:01:28.110> get<00:01:28.259> those<00:01:28.439> with

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
you could benefit from go get those with

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.350 
you could benefit from go get those with
these<00:01:28.740> broad<00:01:29.070> spectrum<00:01:29.549> multivitamins<00:01:30.180> don't

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
these broad spectrum multivitamins don't

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.760 
these broad spectrum multivitamins don't
work<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.750> we<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:30.960> run<00:01:31.079> into<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.320> same<00:01:31.530> issue

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
work and we can run into the same issue

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.980 
work and we can run into the same issue
with<00:01:32.040> some<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.280> these<00:01:32.340> grain<00:01:32.640> powders<00:01:33.119> they
