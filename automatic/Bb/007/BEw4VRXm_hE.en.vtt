00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:04.659 
going with the Raiders in this game I

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:06.030 
going with the Raiders in this game I
think<00:04:04.989> the<00:04:05.049> Raiders<00:04:05.319> have<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.709> recipe

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
think the Raiders have the recipe

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.170 
think the Raiders have the recipe
they're<00:04:06.430> going<00:04:06.549> to<00:04:06.609> stick<00:04:06.760> with<00:04:06.819> their<00:04:07.030> game

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
they're going to stick with their game

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.210 
they're going to stick with their game
plan<00:04:07.239> their<00:04:07.840> defense<00:04:08.290> is<00:04:08.440> aggressive<00:04:08.980> enough

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
plan their defense is aggressive enough

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.670 
plan their defense is aggressive enough
to<00:04:09.609> play<00:04:10.239> the<00:04:10.359> internet<00:04:10.659> it's<00:04:10.840> close<00:04:10.989> to<00:04:11.019> where

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
to play the internet it's close to where

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.439 
to play the internet it's close to where
to<00:04:11.889> they<00:04:12.340> can<00:04:12.489> get<00:04:12.579> pressure<00:04:12.819> on<00:04:12.940> manning<00:04:13.180> and

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:13.449 
to they can get pressure on manning and

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:14.550 
to they can get pressure on manning and
they're<00:04:13.810> going<00:04:13.930> to<00:04:13.989> play<00:04:14.169> up<00:04:14.349> to<00:04:14.379> the

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
they're going to play up to the

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.780 
they're going to play up to the
competition<00:04:14.829> so<00:04:15.190> look<00:04:15.340> for<00:04:15.430> the<00:04:15.489> reasons<00:04:15.729> to

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
competition so look for the reasons to

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.849 
competition so look for the reasons to
come<00:04:15.940> in<00:04:16.060> planted<00:04:16.659> home<00:04:16.870> to<00:04:17.289> dominate<00:04:17.769> the

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
come in planted home to dominate the

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:18.990 
come in planted home to dominate the
line<00:04:18.010> of<00:04:18.130> scrimmage<00:04:18.220> I<00:04:18.519> think<00:04:18.760> they're<00:04:18.909> going

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
line of scrimmage I think they're going

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.969 
line of scrimmage I think they're going
to<00:04:19.060> get<00:04:19.239> enough<00:04:19.659> pressure<00:04:19.930> on<00:04:20.109> manning<00:04:20.470> to

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
to get enough pressure on manning to

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:23.040 
to get enough pressure on manning to
force<00:04:21.220> that<00:04:21.370> one<00:04:21.699> bad<00:04:21.970> play<00:04:22.300> that<00:04:22.720> they<00:04:22.840> need

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
force that one bad play that they need

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.320 
force that one bad play that they need
to<00:04:23.320> run<00:04:24.099> a<00:04:24.130> clock<00:04:24.370> out<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:24.699> turn<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.090> get<00:04:25.240> the
