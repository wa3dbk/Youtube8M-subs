offer<00:04:05.060> for<00:04:05.329> Rafa<00:04:05.780> Veyron<00:04:06.319> is<00:04:07.209> unacceptable

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
offer for Rafa Veyron is unacceptable

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.170 
offer for Rafa Veyron is unacceptable
and<00:04:08.269> they<00:04:08.540> set<00:04:08.810> a<00:04:08.840> 22.5<00:04:09.829> million<00:04:10.430> price<00:04:11.150> tag

and they set a 22.5 million price tag

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.180 
and they set a 22.5 million price tag
which<00:04:11.720> i<00:04:11.900> think<00:04:11.959> is<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:12.920> much<00:04:13.909> lower<00:04:14.209> than<00:04:15.190> their

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
which i think is a much lower than their

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.819 
which i think is a much lower than their
original<00:04:16.489> asking<00:04:17.150> price<00:04:17.419> of<00:04:17.959> 29<00:04:18.500> and<00:04:18.739> a<00:04:18.799> half

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
original asking price of 29 and a half

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.640 
original asking price of 29 and a half
million<00:04:19.250> so<00:04:20.060> i<00:04:20.120> think<00:04:20.209> i<00:04:20.539> will<00:04:20.600> play<00:04:20.930> paid<00:04:21.440> this

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
million so i think i will play paid this

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.850 
million so i think i will play paid this
twenty<00:04:22.520> two<00:04:22.639> and<00:04:22.669> a<00:04:22.910> half<00:04:23.060> million<00:04:23.360> for<00:04:24.260> veron

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
twenty two and a half million for veron

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.580 
twenty two and a half million for veron
and<00:04:25.360> hopefully<00:04:26.360> he<00:04:26.479> will<00:04:26.600> become<00:04:26.810> an<00:04:27.110> absolute

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
and hopefully he will become an absolute

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.920 
and hopefully he will become an absolute

the<00:04:37.479> quarter-final<00:04:38.479> draw<00:04:38.900> of<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:39.320> copa

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
the quarter-final draw of the copa

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.370 
the quarter-final draw of the copa
america<00:04:40.940> and<00:04:41.180> I'm<00:04:41.330> really<00:04:41.630> really<00:04:41.870> nervous

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
america and I'm really really nervous

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.409 
america and I'm really really nervous
how<00:04:44.169> the<00:04:45.169> draw<00:04:45.650> looks<00:04:46.220> like<00:04:46.520> at<00:04:46.820> the<00:04:47.060> moment

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
how the draw looks like at the moment

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.629 
how the draw looks like at the moment
this<00:04:47.660> is<00:04:47.870> this<00:04:48.139> is<00:04:48.320> how<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.530> group's<00:04:48.979> finished

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
this is this is how the group's finished

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.900 
this is this is how the group's finished
so<00:04:50.240> Columbia<00:04:50.750> finished<00:04:51.110> first<00:04:51.910> rubicon

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
so Columbia finished first rubicon

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.450 
so Columbia finished first rubicon
Mexico<00:04:53.479> third<00:04:53.750> with<00:04:54.080> three<00:04:54.320> points<00:04:54.800> and<00:04:54.919> then

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
Mexico third with three points and then

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.820 
Mexico third with three points and then
we<00:04:55.639> have<00:04:55.760> Chile<00:04:56.060> and<00:04:56.270> Argentina<00:04:56.680> so<00:04:57.680> actually

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
we have Chile and Argentina so actually

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.920 
we have Chile and Argentina so actually
it<00:04:58.220> was<00:04:58.400> a<00:04:58.449> good<00:04:59.449> idea<00:04:59.510> to<00:05:00.260> finish<00:05:01.930> second

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
it was a good idea to finish second

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.089 
it was a good idea to finish second
because<00:05:03.320> then<00:05:03.620> we<00:05:04.130> I<00:05:04.160> think<00:05:04.400> we<00:05:04.729> avoid<00:05:05.240> playing

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
because then we I think we avoid playing

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:10.029 
because then we I think we avoid playing
Argentina<00:05:07.099> and<00:05:07.340> Brazil<00:05:08.770> because<00:05:09.770> we<00:05:09.949> are

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
Argentina and Brazil because we are

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.520 
Argentina and Brazil because we are
playing<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.460> first<00:05:10.669> place<00:05:10.970> team<00:05:11.210> right<00:05:11.530> I'm

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
playing the first place team right I'm

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.080 
playing the first place team right I'm
not<00:05:12.800> eat<00:05:12.979> I'm<00:05:13.130> sure<00:05:13.400> because<00:05:13.760> this<00:05:13.910> is<00:05:14.060> a

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
not eat I'm sure because this is a

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.050 
not eat I'm sure because this is a
strange<00:05:14.449> system<00:05:14.930> there<00:05:15.410> is<00:05:15.500> only<00:05:15.710> three
