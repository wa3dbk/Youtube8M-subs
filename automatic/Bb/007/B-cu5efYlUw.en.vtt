00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
hi this is Jo glt performance and we're

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.620 
hi this is Jo glt performance and we're
modifying<00:00:05.910> our<00:00:06.299> 2011<00:00:07.109> mustang<00:00:07.470> GT<00:00:07.799> 5.0<00:00:07.830> and

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:08.630 
modifying our 2011 mustang GT 5.0 and

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.360 
modifying our 2011 mustang GT 5.0 and
next<00:00:09.630> up<00:00:09.780> is<00:00:09.960> we're<00:00:10.410> doing<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.710> hydrocarbon

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
next up is we're doing a hydrocarbon

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.250 
next up is we're doing a hydrocarbon
centre<00:00:12.059> console<00:00:13.040> as<00:00:14.599> well<00:00:15.599> as<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.929> matching

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
centre console as well as the matching

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.320 
centre console as well as the matching
radio<00:00:16.529> bezel<00:00:16.770> these<00:00:17.279> are<00:00:17.430> all<00:00:17.460> factory<00:00:18.029> parts

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
radio bezel these are all factory parts

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.580 
radio bezel these are all factory parts
that<00:00:18.539> are<00:00:18.630> gone<00:00:18.779> through<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.050> paint<00:00:19.350> process

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
that are gone through a paint process

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.200 
that are gone through a paint process
called<00:00:20.070> hydrocarbon<00:00:21.020> and<00:00:22.400> it<00:00:23.400> easily<00:00:23.939> makes

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
called hydrocarbon and it easily makes

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.330 
called hydrocarbon and it easily makes
them<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.660> look<00:00:24.810> like<00:00:24.990> carbon<00:00:25.289> fiber<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.769> fit

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
them to look like carbon fiber and fit

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.490 
them to look like carbon fiber and fit
perfect<00:00:26.810> so<00:00:27.810> let's<00:00:27.960> show<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.080> how<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.320> do<00:00:28.470> it

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
perfect so let's show you how to do it

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.560 
perfect so let's show you how to do it
ok<00:00:29.250> first<00:00:29.760> thing<00:00:29.939> we're<00:00:30.060> going<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.210> do<00:00:30.420> is

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
ok first thing we're going to do is

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:39.570 
ok first thing we're going to do is
we're<00:00:30.689> going<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.869> unscrew<00:00:31.170> hour<00:00:31.470> shift<00:00:31.740> ball

backsides and lift up lift up lift up
now<00:00:54.739> now<00:00:54.980> we<00:00:55.040> need<00:00:55.250> to<00:00:55.280> start<00:00:55.489> unplugging

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
now now we need to start unplugging

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.920 
now now we need to start unplugging
wires<00:00:56.239> we've<00:00:56.510> got<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:56.840> front<00:00:57.080> harness

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:08.090 

got<00:01:00.930> our<00:01:01.940> harness<00:01:02.940> here

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.929 

this<00:01:08.640> other<00:01:08.880> plug<00:01:09.270> here<00:01:10.340> okay<00:01:11.340> our<00:01:11.490> car<00:01:11.729> had

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
this other plug here okay our car had

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.200 
this other plug here okay our car had
the<00:01:12.060> ambient<00:01:12.450> light<00:01:12.600> on<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.189> interior<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the ambient light on the interior of the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.080 
the ambient light on the interior of the
cup<00:01:15.750> holders<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.490> part<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.670> came<00:01:17.880> did

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
cup holders and the part that came did

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.539 
cup holders and the part that came did
not<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.170> simply<00:01:19.500> took<00:01:19.650> out<00:01:19.830> four<00:01:20.400> screws

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
not so we simply took out four screws

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.950 
not so we simply took out four screws
hold<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.610> cup<00:01:23.759> holder<00:01:23.880> out<00:01:26.750> swapped<00:01:27.750> out<00:01:27.899> the

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
hold a cup holder out swapped out the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.499 
hold a cup holder out swapped out the
top<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.340> got<00:01:29.490> rid<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.820> black<00:01:30.060> texture

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
top so we got rid of this black texture

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.300 
top so we got rid of this black texture
top<00:01:32.690> got<00:01:33.690> this<00:01:33.869> nice<00:01:34.110> hydrocarbon<00:01:34.890> okay<00:01:35.159> now

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
top got this nice hydrocarbon okay now

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.249 
top got this nice hydrocarbon okay now
we<00:01:35.369> got<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.640> remove<00:01:35.850> our<00:01:36.060> radio<00:01:36.330> bezel<00:01:36.539> there's

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
we got to remove our radio bezel there's

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.740 
we got to remove our radio bezel there's
two<00:01:37.560> seven<00:01:37.979> millimeter<00:01:38.340> bolts<00:01:38.640> one<00:01:39.270> here<00:01:39.600> and

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
two seven millimeter bolts one here and

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.410 
two seven millimeter bolts one here and
one<00:01:40.080> here<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:43.710> holds<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.429> then<00:01:45.210> this

just one plug pull that out okay so
we've<00:02:00.790> got<00:02:01.060> our<00:02:01.230> original<00:02:02.230> factory<00:02:02.410> unit<00:02:02.770> here

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
we've got our original factory unit here

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.060 
we've got our original factory unit here
the<00:02:03.700> new<00:02:03.850> hydrocarbon<00:02:04.450> unit<00:02:04.750> here<00:02:05.050> we<00:02:05.770> had<00:02:05.950> to

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
the new hydrocarbon unit here we had to

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.280 
the new hydrocarbon unit here we had to
take<00:02:06.280> out<00:02:06.490> all<00:02:06.700> these<00:02:06.880> little<00:02:07.120> t10<00:02:07.840> Torx

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290
