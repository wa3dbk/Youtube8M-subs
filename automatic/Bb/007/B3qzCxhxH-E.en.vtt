thought it'd be fun and it would

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:45.759 
thought it'd be fun and it would
probably<00:00:44.479> flop<00:00:44.839> in<00:00:45.049> a<00:00:45.139> year<00:00:45.319> or<00:00:45.350> two<00:00:45.499> because<00:00:45.649> I

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
probably flop in a year or two because I

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.439 
probably flop in a year or two because I
didn't<00:00:45.979> think<00:00:46.100> he'd<00:00:46.219> really<00:00:46.339> hit<00:00:46.639> but<00:00:46.879> it'd<00:00:47.420> be

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
didn't think he'd really hit but it'd be

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.569 
didn't think he'd really hit but it'd be
fun<00:00:47.780> and<00:00:47.989> go<00:00:48.319> back<00:00:48.499> and<00:00:48.709> work<00:00:48.769> at<00:00:48.949> Ampex<00:00:49.249> when

with electronic devices but they were
taking<00:01:29.479> a<00:01:29.570> risk<00:01:29.719> with<00:01:29.869> this<00:01:30.079> thing<00:01:30.350> but<00:01:30.530> they

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
taking a risk with this thing but they

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.219

were<00:01:30.740> very<00:01:30.859> very<00:01:31.429> nervous<00:01:31.880> about<00:01:31.999> this<00:01:32.359> and<00:01:32.600> so

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
were very very nervous about this and so

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.169 
were very very nervous about this and so
we<00:01:33.409> had<00:01:33.649> finally<00:01:34.100> had<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.399> prototype<00:01:34.880> that

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
we had finally had the prototype that

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.330 
we had finally had the prototype that
used<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:35.780> real<00:01:36.049> wire<00:01:36.409> wrap<00:01:36.649> emulator<00:01:37.070> of<00:01:37.249> the

in a box with the wooden model of what
the<00:01:42.499> plastics<00:01:42.979> were<00:01:43.070> in<00:01:43.130> look<00:01:43.280> like<00:01:43.399> we<00:01:43.549> didn't

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
the plastics were in look like we didn't

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.760 
the plastics were in look like we didn't
have<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.030> plastics<00:01:44.509> yet<00:01:44.749> but<00:01:45.409> that's<00:01:45.499> what's

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
have the plastics yet but that's what's

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.529 
have the plastics yet but that's what's
the<00:01:45.859> plan<00:01:46.100> to<00:01:46.369> have<00:01:46.579> them<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.210> we<00:01:47.240> didn't<00:01:47.450> have

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
the plan to have them and we didn't have

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:48.940 
the plan to have them and we didn't have
a<00:01:47.600> chip<00:01:47.840> yet<00:01:48.049> we<00:01:48.140> were<00:01:48.229> going<00:01:48.409> to<00:01:48.499> have<00:01:48.619> a<00:01:48.649> chip

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
a chip yet we were going to have a chip

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.609 
a chip yet we were going to have a chip
so<00:01:49.249> it<00:01:49.460> was<00:01:49.579> all<00:01:49.729> in<00:01:49.850> his<00:01:49.999> one<00:01:50.179> box<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:50.869> that

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
so it was all in his one box and that

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.969 
so it was all in his one box and that
box<00:01:52.569> would<00:01:53.569> work<00:01:53.749> on<00:01:53.899> channel<00:01:54.289> three<00:01:54.560> on<00:01:54.679> a<00:01:54.710> TV

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
box would work on channel three on a TV

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.789 
box would work on channel three on a TV
set<00:01:55.340> and<00:01:55.399> he<00:01:55.549> could<00:01:55.670> play<00:01:55.759> pong<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:56.390> so<00:01:57.259> I<00:01:57.590> was

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
set and he could play pong and so I was

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.440 
set and he could play pong and so I was
in<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.039> 37th<00:01:58.609> floor<00:01:58.700> of<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:58.969> sears<00:01:59.240> tower

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
in the 37th floor of the sears tower

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.719 
in the 37th floor of the sears tower
with<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.810> exec<00:02:00.229> staff<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.009> head<00:02:01.490> of<00:02:01.609> the

with the exec staff and the head of the
whole<00:02:01.880> department<00:02:02.420> doing<00:02:02.600> this<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.049> they

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:03.109 
whole department doing this and they

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:04.629 
whole department doing this and they
were<00:02:03.170> making<00:02:03.499> a<00:02:03.560> decision<00:02:03.889> to<00:02:04.219> go<00:02:04.369> with<00:02:04.399> this

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:04.639 
were making a decision to go with this

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:06.879 
were making a decision to go with this
product<00:02:04.880> or<00:02:05.119> not<00:02:05.299> and<00:02:05.630> I<00:02:06.200> tried<00:02:06.499> to<00:02:06.619> get<00:02:06.770> it

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:06.889 
product or not and I tried to get it

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:08.590 
product or not and I tried to get it
working<00:02:07.039> and<00:02:07.369> it<00:02:07.520> wouldn't<00:02:07.789> work<00:02:07.909> for<00:02:08.179> some

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
working and it wouldn't work for some

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.210 
working and it wouldn't work for some
reason<00:02:08.989> and<00:02:09.110> it<00:02:09.229> was<00:02:09.349> interference<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.129> I

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
reason and it was interference and I

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.860 
reason and it was interference and I
realized<00:02:10.640> that<00:02:10.909> they<00:02:11.030> were<00:02:11.090> broadcasting

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
realized that they were broadcasting

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.400 
realized that they were broadcasting
from<00:02:11.989> channel<00:02:12.349> 3<00:02:12.620> on<00:02:12.769> top<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.159> this

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
from channel 3 on top of this

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.370 
from channel 3 on top of this
Tower<00:02:13.710> so<00:02:14.640> i<00:02:14.670> had<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.120> retune<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:16.230> i<00:02:16.290> opened

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
Tower so i had to retune it so i opened

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.050 
Tower so i had to retune it so i opened
the<00:02:16.560> bottom<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.100> box<00:02:17.310> up<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.820> they<00:02:17.880> could

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
the bottom of the box up and they could

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.420 
the bottom of the box up and they could
see<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.690> wire<00:02:19.020> wrap<00:02:19.290> panel<00:02:19.710> it<00:02:19.770> had<00:02:19.920> 200<00:02:20.370> i

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
see the wire wrap panel it had 200 i

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.120 
see the wire wrap panel it had 200 i
sees<00:02:20.700> in<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.210> all<00:02:22.050> these<00:02:22.260> red<00:02:22.530> wires<00:02:22.770> in

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
sees in it and all these red wires in

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.210 
sees in it and all these red wires in
there<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:24.140> got<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.200> retuned<00:02:25.620> got<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:25.920> working

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
there and got it retuned got it working

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.610 
there and got it retuned got it working
put<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.490> bottom<00:02:26.760> on<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.690> got<00:02:27.930> didn't<00:02:28.290> did<00:02:28.470> my

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
going to put all that rat's nest of wire

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.750 
going to put all that rat's nest of wire
in<00:02:45.660> there<00:02:45.840> on<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.110> little<00:02:46.710> piece<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.220> silicon

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
in there on a little piece of silicon

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.480 
in there on a little piece of silicon
the<00:02:48.330> size<00:02:48.570> of<00:02:48.840> your<00:02:48.870> little<00:02:49.170> finger<00:02:49.530> I<00:02:49.740> go<00:02:49.920> yeah

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
the size of your little finger I go yeah

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.580 
the size of your little finger I go yeah
yeah<00:02:50.910> how<00:02:51.780> are<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:51.990> going<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.260> solder<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
yeah how are you going to solder the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.570 
yeah how are you going to solder the
wires<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.430> yeah<00:02:54.420> there<00:02:55.410> was<00:02:55.590> no<00:02:56.070> connection

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
wires to it yeah there was no connection

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.610 
wires to it yeah there was no connection
I<00:02:56.820> realized<00:02:57.180> I'm<00:02:57.420> dealing<00:02:57.900> with<00:02:58.020> this<00:02:58.290> is<00:02:58.470> not

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
I realized I'm dealing with this is not

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.740 
I realized I'm dealing with this is not
Silicon<00:02:59.190> Valley<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.670> know<00:02:59.820> where<00:03:00.060> am<00:03:00.210> I<00:03:00.360> total

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
Silicon Valley you know where am I total

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.200 
Silicon Valley you know where am I total
on<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.900> 37th<00:03:01.500> floor<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.710> this<00:03:01.770> building<00:03:01.830> so<00:03:02.400> we

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
on the 37th floor of this building so we

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.230 
on the 37th floor of this building so we
got<00:03:03.390> past<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:03.870> hurdle<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.560> in<00:03:05.430> fact<00:03:06.030> we<00:03:06.150> even

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
got past that hurdle and in fact we even

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.330 
got past that hurdle and in fact we even
took<00:03:06.540> Carl<00:03:06.840> to<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.080> semiconductor<00:03:07.800> factory<00:03:08.190> so

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
took Carl to a semiconductor factory so

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.500 
took Carl to a semiconductor factory so
we<00:03:08.430> could<00:03:08.580> show<00:03:08.760> him<00:03:08.880> how<00:03:09.000> we<00:03:09.030> started<00:03:09.420> the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
we could show him how we started the

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.990 
we could show him how we started the
wires<00:03:09.690> do<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.080> and<00:03:10.290> he<00:03:10.770> never<00:03:11.040> picked<00:03:11.460> it<00:03:11.610> up<00:03:11.730> it

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
wires do it and he never picked it up it

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.370 
wires do it and he never picked it up it
was<00:03:12.180> over<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.110> top<00:03:13.140> now<00:03:14.390> at<00:03:15.390> what<00:03:15.660> point<00:03:15.870> did

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
was over the top now at what point did

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.690 
was over the top now at what point did
you<00:03:16.440> realize<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:18.020> Atari<00:03:19.040> just<00:03:20.040> took<00:03:20.280> off<00:03:20.490> and

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
you realize I Atari just took off and
