I've got got back from the garage

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.520 
I've got got back from the garage
because<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.520> asked<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.879> have<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.300> field<00:00:39.899> took

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
because I asked to have the field took

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.220 
because I asked to have the field took
back<00:00:41.149> give<00:00:42.149> them<00:00:42.270> back<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.570> me<00:00:42.600> just<00:00:42.870> saw<00:00:43.020> how

quick love a lot so nothing about the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.100 
quick love a lot so nothing about the
ordinary<00:00:47.160> here<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:49.160> fresh<00:00:50.160> plate<00:00:50.520> which<00:00:50.850> is

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
ordinary here just fresh plate which is

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.299 
ordinary here just fresh plate which is
sorry<00:00:52.579> clutch<00:00:53.579> flight<00:00:53.879> rather<00:00:54.949> which<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.100> not

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
sorry clutch flight rather which is not

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.270 
sorry clutch flight rather which is not
old<00:00:57.149> selling<00:00:57.629> one<00:00:57.840> out<00:00:57.989> but<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.980> definitely

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
old selling one out but it definitely

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.220 
old selling one out but it definitely
could<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.969> replacing<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.809> that's<00:01:00.989> got<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
could be replacing so that's got the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.960 
could be replacing so that's got the
closing<00:01:01.789> same<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.940> pressure<00:01:03.180> plate<00:01:04.970> quickly

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
closing same the pressure plate quickly

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.580 
closing same the pressure plate quickly
normal<00:01:06.299> looking<00:01:06.450> pressure<00:01:06.689> plate<00:01:06.990> as<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.409> can

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
normal looking pressure plate as I can

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.980 
normal looking pressure plate as I can
see<00:01:08.030> it's<00:01:09.030> got<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.180> little<00:01:09.330> bit<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.630> heat

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
see it's got a little bit of heat

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.800 
see it's got a little bit of heat
marking<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.530> there<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.770> don't<00:01:10.860> imagine

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
marking on there I don't imagine

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.490 
marking on there I don't imagine
obviously<00:01:12.810> that's<00:01:12.930> got<00:01:13.049> replaced<00:01:13.260> as<00:01:13.470> well

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
obviously that's got replaced as well

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.109 
obviously that's got replaced as well
along<00:01:13.920> with<00:01:13.979> them<00:01:14.540> release<00:01:15.540> bearing<00:01:17.119> anyway

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
along with them release bearing anyway

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.550 
along with them release bearing anyway
what<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:18.570> dressage<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.080> here<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:21.439> you<00:01:22.439> do

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
what we dressage in here is you do

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.429 
what we dressage in here is you do
almost<00:01:22.680> flywheel<00:01:24.110> and<00:01:26.810> I'm<00:01:27.810> no<00:01:27.990> expert<00:01:28.140> on

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
almost flywheel and I'm no expert on

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.230 
almost flywheel and I'm no expert on
this<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:28.979> if<00:01:29.070> I've<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.400> stand<00:01:29.640> there<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
this but if I've and stand there just to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.270 
this but if I've and stand there just to
flywheels<00:01:30.750> which<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.439> George<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.920> center

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
flywheels which is George in the center

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.010 
flywheels which is George in the center
so<00:01:33.090> you've<00:01:33.240> got<00:01:33.329> two<00:01:33.630> masses<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.770> rotate

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
so you've got two masses that can rotate

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.200 
so you've got two masses that can rotate
slightly<00:01:38.420> which<00:01:39.420> Springs<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.930> center

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
slightly which Springs in the center

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.719 
slightly which Springs in the center
this<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> bit<00:01:43.340> reasonable<00:01:44.340> camera

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
this is what a bit reasonable camera

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.410 
this is what a bit reasonable camera
angle<00:01:45.950> so<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.130> see<00:01:47.250> exactly<00:01:47.729> how<00:01:48.180> much

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
angle so you can see exactly how much

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:56.290 
angle so you can see exactly how much
this<00:01:49.369> moves<00:01:50.990> it's<00:01:51.990> got<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> little<00:01:52.470> bit<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.799> them

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.940 

walking<00:01:57.300> that<00:01:57.420> way<00:01:59.930> you<00:02:00.930> saw<00:02:01.110> guess<00:02:01.380> that's<00:02:01.620> a

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
walking that way you saw guess that's a

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.190 
walking that way you saw guess that's a
bit<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.550> way<00:02:02.700> imagine<00:02:03.390> they<00:02:03.450> do<00:02:03.510> move<00:02:03.780> slightly

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
bit of way imagine they do move slightly

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.770 
bit of way imagine they do move slightly
from<00:02:04.620> new<00:02:04.830> as<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.850> understand<00:02:06.330> their<00:02:06.480> bronze

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
from new as I understand their bronze

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.950 
from new as I understand their bronze
bush<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.350> what<00:02:07.440> wonders<00:02:07.740> then<00:02:07.890> sure<00:02:08.100> yet<00:02:08.960> and

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
bush and what wonders then sure yet and

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.390 
bush and what wonders then sure yet and
then<00:02:10.470> just<00:02:10.800> decide<00:02:11.070> ways<00:02:11.370> which<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:13.400> say

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
then just decide ways which is say

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.100 
then just decide ways which is say
that's<00:02:14.610> where<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:14.910> begins<00:02:15.180> that's<00:02:15.600> pushed<00:02:15.990> up

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
that's where it begins that's pushed up

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.410 
that's where it begins that's pushed up
against<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.500> spring<00:02:16.680> nail<00:02:16.950> on<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.640> direction

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
against the spring nail on the direction

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.440 
against the spring nail on the direction
and<00:02:19.020> if<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.290> move<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.880> this<00:02:20.880> way<00:02:23.150> that's<00:02:24.150> pushed

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
and if I move it this way that's pushed

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.760 
and if I move it this way that's pushed
up<00:02:24.510> against<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.780> other<00:02:24.900> side<00:02:25.140> spring<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:25.650> it's

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
up against the other side spring so it's

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.540 
up against the other side spring so it's
quite<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.930> quite<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.959> vast<00:02:28.380> amount<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.830> movement

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.470 

if<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.730> imagine<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:35.209> battling<00:02:36.209> back<00:02:36.450> and

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
if you imagine that battling back and

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.530 
if you imagine that battling back and
forth<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.890> startup<00:02:38.700> which<00:02:38.910> what<00:02:39.120> mom<00:02:39.330> was

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
forth on startup which what mom was

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.080 
forth on startup which what mom was
doing<00:02:39.890> it<00:02:40.890> was<00:02:41.040> making<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.520> right<00:02:41.790> olam

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
doing it was making a right olam

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.740 
doing it was making a right olam
metallicky<00:02:45.090> noise<00:02:46.250> which<00:02:47.250> sounded<00:02:47.750> rather

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
metallicky noise which sounded rather

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.990 
metallicky noise which sounded rather
awful<00:02:49.320> personal<00:02:49.950> but<00:02:50.160> my<00:02:50.280> stomach<00:02:50.490> would<00:02:50.820> not

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
awful personal but my stomach would not

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.810 
awful personal but my stomach would not

see exactly how it works in to see
what's<00:03:35.760> worn<00:03:36.120> on<00:03:36.330> it<00:03:36.500> because<00:03:37.500> it<00:03:37.650> just<00:03:38.220> on

it reading a little bit further it's

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.550 
it reading a little bit further it's
actually<00:03:45.000> hit<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.540> spring<00:03:45.840> once<00:03:46.110> any<00:03:46.320> other

actually hit the spring once any other
way

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
way

let's<00:03:48.660> hit<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.989> spring<00:03:50.060> it's<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.120> lot<00:03:51.299> move<00:03:51.540> it

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
let's hit the spring it's a lot move it

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.160 
let's hit the spring it's a lot move it
there<00:03:51.870> with<00:03:53.390> obviously<00:03:54.390> the<00:03:54.480> downside<00:03:54.750> if

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
there with obviously the downside if

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.810 
there with obviously the downside if
you're<00:03:55.410> multiplying<00:03:55.530> well<00:03:56.010> they<00:03:56.370> say<00:03:56.549> this<00:03:56.670> is

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
you're multiplying well they say this is

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.500 
you're multiplying well they say this is
a<00:03:56.850> 90<00:03:57.299> thousand<00:03:57.780> mile<00:03:58.310> flywheel<00:03:59.310> which<00:04:00.120> I'm

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
a 90 thousand mile flywheel which I'm

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.780 
a 90 thousand mile flywheel which I'm
told<00:04:00.840> it<00:04:01.110> that's<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:02.010> sort<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.280> mods<00:04:02.489> they're

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
told it that's the sort of mods they're

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.090 
told it that's the sort of mods they're
going<00:04:02.910> to<00:04:03.000> go<00:04:03.120> if<00:04:03.269> they're<00:04:03.450> going<00:04:03.540> to<00:04:03.600> go<00:04:04.100> and

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
going to go if they're going to go and

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.630 
going to go if they're going to go and
obviously<00:04:05.220> more<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:05.760> did

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
obviously more and did

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.160 
obviously more and did
they'll<00:04:07.180> probably<00:04:07.330> put<00:04:07.600> a<00:04:07.630> carry<00:04:07.870> on<00:04:07.990> driving

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
they'll probably put a carry on driving

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.530 
they'll probably put a carry on driving
it<00:04:08.350> for<00:04:08.500> probably<00:04:08.740> other<00:04:08.890> know<00:04:09.330> couple<00:04:10.330> years

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
it for probably other know couple years

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.000 
it for probably other know couple years
maybe<00:04:10.780> I<00:04:11.110> don't<00:04:11.680> know<00:04:11.740> whether<00:04:11.890> these

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
maybe I don't know whether these

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.130 
maybe I don't know whether these
actually<00:04:12.400> do<00:04:13.060> here<00:04:13.300> they<00:04:13.420> actually<00:04:13.690> fade<00:04:13.960> in

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
actually do here they actually fade in

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.960 
actually do here they actually fade in
the<00:04:14.170> center<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:14.830> the<00:04:15.070> Cintas<00:04:15.460> breakout<00:04:15.940> I

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
the center and the Cintas breakout I

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.860 
the center and the Cintas breakout I
think<00:04:18.000> anyway<00:04:19.230> I'll<00:04:20.230> do<00:04:20.470> another<00:04:20.650> video<00:04:20.859> of

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
think anyway I'll do another video of

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.300 
think anyway I'll do another video of
the<00:04:22.870> insides<00:04:23.230> of<00:04:23.380> this<00:04:23.500> if<00:04:23.650> I<00:04:23.740> managed<00:04:23.980> to<00:04:24.040> soak

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
the insides of this if I managed to soak

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.040 
the insides of this if I managed to soak
the<00:04:24.430> yellow<00:04:24.670> group<00:04:24.880> I<00:04:25.030> bring<00:04:25.240> that<00:04:25.330> up<00:04:25.390> myself

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
the yellow group I bring that up myself

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.220 
the yellow group I bring that up myself
