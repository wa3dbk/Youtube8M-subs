00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
on the upper part of the crease first

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.789 
on the upper part of the crease first
and<00:01:11.520> then<00:01:11.729> work<00:01:11.939> my<00:01:11.970> way<00:01:12.270> down<00:01:12.420> any<00:01:13.350> once<00:01:13.530> just

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
and then work my way down any once just

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.350 
and then work my way down any once just
want<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.010> keep<00:01:14.130> blending<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.760> blending<00:01:14.850> until

want to keep blending and blending until
it's<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> desired<00:01:17.119> effect<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.420> like

it's to the desired effect that you like

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.530 
it's to the desired effect that you like
and<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.650> think<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.580> two<00:01:20.909> one<00:01:21.119> seven<00:01:21.299> is

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
and I think that the two one seven is

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.480 
and I think that the two one seven is
probably<00:01:21.840> an<00:01:22.080> excellent<00:01:22.560> brush<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.189> blend

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
probably an excellent brush to blend

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.789 
probably an excellent brush to blend
with<00:01:23.700> but<00:01:24.030> any<00:01:24.270> blending<00:01:25.049> brush<00:01:25.290> that's<00:01:25.500> soft

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
with but any blending brush that's soft

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.640 
with but any blending brush that's soft
and<00:01:26.189> loose<00:01:26.549> bristles<00:01:27.060> will<00:01:27.240> also<00:01:27.780> work<00:01:27.960> and

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
and loose bristles will also work and

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.050 
and loose bristles will also work and
make<00:01:28.799> sure<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.040> do<00:01:29.189> concentrate<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060
