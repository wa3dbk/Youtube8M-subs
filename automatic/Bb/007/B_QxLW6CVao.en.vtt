 head hello everyone on air shared

 Dentist therapist with 20 years of experience 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.340
 Natalia Alexandrovna hello talitsa 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.010
 good afternoon sergey please tell me 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.020
 what is xenon and how do you apply 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.970
 in medicine, dentistry in particular 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.400
 xenon is an inert gas which 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.920
 is in the air at the minimum 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.440
 concentration numerous studies 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.420
 showed it some amazing 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.180
 properties including the fact that he 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.040
 it has anesthetic effect 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.879
 with this action in the world already 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.159
 a lot of complicated operations 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.170
 thundered for the whole world including 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.659
 leading dental clinics in the world 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.990
 xenon is used today as a means 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.960
 for safe anesthesia i.e. xenon 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.939
 today is 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.180
 highly effective anesthetic of the 21st century 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.760
 natal prices but is xenon really 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.700
 so harmless unlike others 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.979
 anesthetics are not just harmless xenon 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.970
 This is a unique gas due to the fact that it 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.189
 inert 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.800
 it does not bind in the body and 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.030
 what chemical compounds 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.850
 therefore not toxic 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.000
 and can not cause light xenon 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.460
 used in the treatment of depressive 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.130
 anti-stress states there is evidence that 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.480
 its constant use may reduce 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.980
 blood sugar 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:55.260
 as well as lower blood pressure 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.480
 let's say athletes are very often prescribed 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.510
 such xenon inhalation for relieving 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.060
 stress and accumulated in pieces before 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.800
 responsible by any 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.960
 competitions 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.260
 xenon helps the patient in this case 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.010
 helps to relax more calmly 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.100
 perceive 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.260
 visit to the dentist yes now 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.930
 probably the most interesting question is how 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.690
 pain relief procedure itself 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.390
 xenon this procedure takes place at 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.940
 xenon inhalation aid 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.030
 it is a tripod on which 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.410
 oxygen tanks fixed 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.860
 medically and highly concentrated 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.350
 xenon special gears 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.940
 ductwork everything goes 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.660
 directly to the patient 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.970
 using a gas analyzer sensor and 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.410
 special device doctor may in 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.150
 right proportions 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.950
 give given concentrations of this gas 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.850
 directly mask itself individually 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.340
 for the patient 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.820
 it is a soft body 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.000
 very convenient and special required 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.600
 filter that possesses 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.600
 antibacterial and antiviral 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:10.080
 anesthesia effect is achieved 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.020
 after three 5-minute treatments after 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.280
 this patient is relaxed 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.340
 calm state that allows 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.590
 easy for the doctor to start work 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.720
 regular anesthetic injection if 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.420
 it is required that the patient is practically not 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.150
 feel that the patient is important 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.400
 is conscious most importantly this 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.739
 when carrying out any complicated 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.709
 manipulation of oral surgery 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.650
 let's say tooth extraction or holding 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.380
 implantation due to the fact that you have through 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.540
 35 minutes to completely retire from 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.090
 body's 95 percent 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.209
 pain relief effect will continue 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.470
 from several hours to days 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.720
 respectively the next day 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.590
 the patient will not experience pain 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.900
 sensations 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.900
 well and finally how are you patients 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.739
 recommend xenon inhalation case 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.819
 that many patients are experiencing 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.400
 insurmountable fear of visiting 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.530
 dentist they fear not only 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.360
 kind of dental chair but also 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.120
 the smell of the dental office 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.670
 sound drills for such patients 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.609
 xenon is just a godsend 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.510
 as it allows them further 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:24.169
 overcome your state of panic stress 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.030
 patients are often for this very reason 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.340
 delays the appeal to the doctor when already 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.530
 unfortunately the tooth cannot be restored or 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.200
 his treatment will require enough 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.050
 long time and considerable financial 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.760
 costs therefore 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.740
 appeal to season use 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.039
 xenon inhalation in dentistry 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.300
 help patients relieve stress before 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.690
 a visit to the doctor 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.960
 so it will finally help to do their 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:56.180
 teeth in full and follow up 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.180
 the state of your teeth and smile 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.010
 It would seem so ordinary gas 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.920
 allowed many people to stop being afraid 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.530
 visiting a dentist means saving
