00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.340
 Today we will make the chicken with tomatoes 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.400
 ingredients will be 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.670
 water olive oil rice tomato 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.190
 crushed sugar salt chicken laurel and 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.859
 spices 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.960
 first in a saucepan 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.960
 we will put a little oil 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.119
 a little more 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.739
 then we will open our can of 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.739
 tomato and crushed 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.010
 careful not to cut us 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.490
 and pour it over the pan 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.680
 now we will have to add sugar 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.270
 to compensate the acidity of the tomato 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.790
 we started by throwing three 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.160
 teaspoons of sugar 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.700
 then you have to try it because if 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.700
 you have to add more 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.990
 and also of course a little salt 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.270
 we will let the tomato simmer 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.270
 It will take about 20 minutes 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.000
 Meanwhile 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.910
 let's put the chicken that we already have 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.120
 here clean and chopped with a little bit of 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.120
 oil 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.210
 a little pepper 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.270
 a little garlic 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.600
 nutmeg 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.010
 thyme 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.510
 and finally a little salt 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:34.720
 we move everything well and we leave it 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.850
 macerate while making the tomato 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.220
 where it's been a while now, we're going to 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.270
 proceed to fry the chicken in a pan 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.270
 hot with oil 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.840
 we're not going to do much to make it 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.840
 stay a little juicier 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.690
 we take it away from the fire 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.690
 because the tomato still has a little left 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.790
 once the tomato has reduced 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.400
 let's introduce the chicken inside the 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.250
 tomato 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:29.040
 so that it takes the flavor go 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.040
 soaking up some tomato sauce 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.000
 and to accompany this dish we are going to 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.830
 make white rice 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.830
 we throw two bay leaves 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.920
 and the rice 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.340
 about two handfuls per person 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.970
 let's make the rice in it 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.490
 pan that we made the chicken so that 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:07.520
 have more now 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.520
 add a little garlic powder 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.000
 and onion powder 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.620
 we let it sautÃ© 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.620
 a few minutes 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.460
 and later 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.460
 we add the water 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:39.780
 and we put it to cook over a very strong fire 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.780
 will try to do about 15 minutes 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.639
 add a little salt 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.500
 After this time we have our 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.750
 rice ready 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.070
 and the chicken with tomato so we just 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.070
 It remains to be plated 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:04.889
 and this is the result chicken with tomato 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:09.030
 accompanied by white rice 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.030
 delicious and very easy to make
