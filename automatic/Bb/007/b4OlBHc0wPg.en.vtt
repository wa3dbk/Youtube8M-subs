inside padding after that I was paint I
mean<00:01:50.659> I<00:01:50.689> would<00:01:51.200> cover<00:01:51.469> all<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.860> holes<00:01:51.890> with

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
mean I would cover all the holes with

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.399 
mean I would cover all the holes with
painters<00:01:52.489> tape<00:01:52.700> so<00:01:53.450> none<00:01:53.750> of<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.989> paint<00:01:54.200> was

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409

sink<00:01:54.679> through<00:01:56.200> after<00:01:57.200> that<00:01:57.319> I<00:01:58.569> used<00:01:59.569> some

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
sink through after that I used some

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.910 
sink through after that I used some
krylon<00:02:00.610> camouflage<00:02:01.610> paint<00:02:01.909> I<00:02:02.209> use<00:02:02.599> the<00:02:02.920> tan

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
krylon camouflage paint I use the tan

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.039 
krylon camouflage paint I use the tan
and<00:02:04.189> I<00:02:05.060> did<00:02:05.299> three<00:02:05.539> coats<00:02:05.750> I<00:02:07.569> dust<00:02:08.569> painted<00:02:08.929> it

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
and I did three coats I dust painted it

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.369 
and I did three coats I dust painted it
so<00:02:09.590> it<00:02:09.860> wouldn't<00:02:10.129> smear<00:02:10.610> at<00:02:10.789> all<00:02:10.970> or<00:02:11.239> have<00:02:11.379> trip

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
so it wouldn't smear at all or have trip

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.270 
so it wouldn't smear at all or have trip
like<00:02:13.370> drips<00:02:13.639> on<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.850> side<00:02:14.030> or<00:02:14.060> something<00:02:14.480> so

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
like drips on the side or something so

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.530 
like drips on the side or something so
after<00:02:16.280> that<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:17.980> would<00:02:18.980> get<00:02:19.130> some<00:02:19.430> mesh<00:02:19.790> lying
