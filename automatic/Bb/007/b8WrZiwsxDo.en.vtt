00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
all right this is my video on how to

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.780 
all right this is my video on how to
make<00:00:28.540> the<00:00:29.350> world's<00:00:29.740> best<00:00:30.070> marks<00:00:30.460> one<00:00:30.610> gun

make the world's best marks one gun

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:38.880 
make the world's best marks one gun
first<00:00:31.510> off<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:33.730> need<00:00:33.970> a<00:00:35.940> long<00:00:36.940> PVC<00:00:37.720> pipe<00:00:37.930> that

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
first off you need a long PVC pipe that

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:50.729 
first off you need a long PVC pipe that
is<00:00:39.160> about<00:00:44.730> now<00:00:46.680> 25<00:00:48.090> inches<00:00:49.090> long<00:00:49.739> doesn't

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
is about now 25 inches long doesn't

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.140 
is about now 25 inches long doesn't
really<00:00:50.890> matter<00:00:51.160> the<00:00:51.940> longer<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:54.190> barrel<00:00:54.460> the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
really matter the longer the barrel the

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.730 
really matter the longer the barrel the
more<00:00:55.300> power<00:00:55.540> it<00:00:55.780> is<00:00:56.040> usually<00:00:57.059> sometimes

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:58.740 
more power it is usually sometimes

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.620 
more power it is usually sometimes
there's<00:00:59.740> it<00:01:00.490> can<00:01:00.760> make<00:01:00.910> a<00:01:00.940> difference<00:01:01.390> I<00:01:01.540> have

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
there's it can make a difference I have

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.770 
there's it can make a difference I have
one<00:01:01.810> that's<00:01:01.960> way<00:01:02.890> shorter<00:01:03.460> than<00:01:03.700> that<00:01:04.360> one<00:01:04.600> but

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
one that's way shorter than that one but

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.590 
one that's way shorter than that one but
it's<00:01:04.930> still<00:01:05.050> more<00:01:05.290> powerful<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.970> generally

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
it's still more powerful but generally

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.380 
it's still more powerful but generally
longer<00:01:08.050> is<00:01:08.500> better<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.850> you<00:01:09.970> need<00:01:10.119> one<00:01:10.300> it's

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
longer is better so you need one it's

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.890 
longer is better so you need one it's
about<00:01:10.450> 25<00:01:11.020> inches<00:01:11.259> long<00:01:12.060> you'll<00:01:13.060> need<00:01:13.300> another

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900

some of them went but you can also have
just<00:02:08.350> regular<00:02:10.200> V<00:02:11.200> connectors<00:02:12.240> alright<00:02:13.410> so

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
just regular V connectors alright so

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.600 
just regular V connectors alright so
first<00:02:15.300> take<00:02:16.300> your<00:02:16.480> 10<00:02:16.780> inch<00:02:17.200> long<00:02:17.610> one-line

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
first take your 10 inch long one-line

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.980 
first take your 10 inch long one-line
forties<00:02:19.680> put<00:02:20.680> them<00:02:20.770> together<00:02:20.860> so<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.840> looks

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
flip it over put the nickel in put

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.550 
flip it over put the nickel in put
another<00:03:11.800> four<00:03:12.660> inch<00:03:13.660> long<00:03:14.350> piece<00:03:15.100> on<00:03:15.310> there<00:03:16.560> it

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
another four inch long piece on there it

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.949 
another four inch long piece on there it
looks<00:03:17.740> like<00:03:17.800> this<00:03:19.530> then<00:03:20.530> finally<00:03:21.780> take<00:03:22.780> your

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
you do is load the bullet in right here

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.729 
you do is load the bullet in right here
put<00:03:37.510> your<00:03:37.540> mouth<00:03:37.810> right<00:03:38.110> where<00:03:38.260> your<00:03:38.380> bullet

shot<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:41.230> shoot<00:03:41.800> not<00:03:42.700> that<00:03:42.850> hard<00:03:45.060> also<00:03:46.060> if<00:03:46.209> you

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
shot and shoot not that hard also if you

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
take off one of these t-connectors and

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:16.890 
take off one of these t-connectors and
that's<00:04:06.130> in<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.340> back<00:04:07.200> put<00:04:08.200> on<00:04:08.290> this

can do is you can take a short probably
see<00:04:24.520> here<00:04:26.910> about<00:04:28.139> two<00:04:29.139> inch<00:04:29.940> maybe<00:04:30.940> a<00:04:31.030> little

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
see here about two inch maybe a little

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.790 
see here about two inch maybe a little
bit<00:04:31.389> little<00:04:31.810> bit<00:04:31.990> over<00:04:32.370> about<00:04:33.370> two<00:04:33.699> inch<00:04:33.940> piece

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
bit little bit over about two inch piece

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.490 
bit little bit over about two inch piece
stick<00:04:35.800> it<00:04:35.979> right<00:04:36.570> on<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.660> top<00:04:40.020> then<00:04:41.020> if<00:04:41.169> I<00:04:41.259> had

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
stick it right on the top then if I had

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.029 
stick it right on the top then if I had
one<00:04:41.740> I'd<00:04:41.889> show<00:04:42.100> you<00:04:42.130> it<00:04:42.430> and<00:04:42.610> just<00:04:43.210> take<00:04:44.039> the

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
one I'd show you it and just take the

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.159 
one I'd show you it and just take the
little<00:04:45.850> V<00:04:46.120> connector<00:04:46.570> that<00:04:46.660> just<00:04:46.840> goes<00:04:47.020> like

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
little V connector that just goes like

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.010 
little V connector that just goes like
this<00:04:47.380> doesn't<00:04:47.800> have<00:04:48.039> this<00:04:48.190> part<00:04:48.460> over<00:04:48.639> here<00:04:49.020> on

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
this doesn't have this part over here on

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.370 
this doesn't have this part over here on
it<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:52.060> get<00:04:52.150> another<00:04:52.360> sorter<00:04:52.870> part<00:04:53.110> which<00:04:53.260> I

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
it to get another sorter part which I

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.070 
it to get another sorter part which I
also<00:04:53.500> lost<00:04:55.380> to<00:04:56.380> get<00:04:56.560> on<00:04:56.650> like<00:04:56.860> this<00:04:57.070> so<00:04:58.080> really

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
also lost to get on like this so really

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.580 
also lost to get on like this so really
look<00:04:59.289> more<00:04:59.590> like<00:04:59.710> this<00:05:00.180> and<00:05:01.180> you<00:05:02.050> put<00:05:02.260> the<00:05:02.350> dart

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
look more like this and you put the dart

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.159 
look more like this and you put the dart
still<00:05:03.370> in<00:05:03.520> here<00:05:03.820> the<00:05:04.270> stuff<00:05:04.539> blowing<00:05:04.990> in<00:05:05.110> the

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
still in here the stuff blowing in the

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:11.100 
still in here the stuff blowing in the
dark<00:05:05.380> goes<00:05:05.669> plug<00:05:06.669> here<00:05:07.680> use<00:05:08.680> your<00:05:08.830> palm<00:05:10.110> to

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
dark goes plug here use your palm to

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.240 
dark goes plug here use your palm to
cover<00:05:11.320> it<00:05:11.410> right<00:05:11.500> here<00:05:11.710> so<00:05:11.860> the<00:05:11.949> air<00:05:12.070> doesn't

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
cover it right here so the air doesn't

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.760 
cover it right here so the air doesn't
come<00:05:12.340> out<00:05:12.539> doesn't<00:05:13.539> really<00:05:13.720> increase<00:05:14.229> power<00:05:14.590> I

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
come out doesn't really increase power I

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.310 
come out doesn't really increase power I
think<00:05:14.949> it<00:05:15.280> actually<00:05:15.550> decreases<00:05:15.699> it<00:05:16.180> a<00:05:16.240> bit<00:05:16.449> so

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
think it actually decreases it a bit so

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.710 
think it actually decreases it a bit so
I'm<00:05:17.590> just<00:05:17.860> staying<00:05:18.099> with<00:05:18.250> the<00:05:18.610> air<00:05:19.060> directly

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
I'm just staying with the air directly

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.570 
I'm just staying with the air directly
pushing<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:20.440> bus<00:05:20.620> and<00:05:20.889> having<00:05:21.130> to<00:05:21.190> come<00:05:21.310> down

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
pushing the bus and having to come down

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.360 
pushing the bus and having to come down
and<00:05:21.820> then<00:05:21.910> come<00:05:22.090> out<00:05:22.530> also<00:05:23.530> and<00:05:23.800> know<00:05:24.099> if

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
and then come out also and know if

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.180 
and then come out also and know if
you're<00:05:24.580> painting<00:05:25.470> make<00:05:26.470> sure<00:05:26.680> you<00:05:27.010> either

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
you're painting make sure you either

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.560 
you're painting make sure you either
tape<00:05:27.669> a<00:05:27.940> little<00:05:28.090> bit<00:05:28.270> around<00:05:28.419> the<00:05:28.539> edge<00:05:28.949> or

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
tape a little bit around the edge or

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.860 
tape a little bit around the edge or
have<00:05:31.570> it<00:05:31.720> in<00:05:31.840> there<00:05:32.050> when<00:05:32.349> you're<00:05:32.470> painting<00:05:32.860> it

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
have it in there when you're painting it

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.120 
have it in there when you're painting it
because<00:05:34.870> if<00:05:35.050> you<00:05:35.260> want<00:05:35.440> to<00:05:35.500> keep<00:05:35.680> it<00:05:35.919> so<00:05:36.039> you

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
because if you want to keep it so you

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.820 
because if you want to keep it so you
can<00:05:36.280> take<00:05:36.430> it<00:05:36.490> apart<00:05:36.789> whenever<00:05:37.090> you<00:05:37.240> want<00:05:37.830> then

if you have if the whole thing is
completely<00:05:41.530> painted<00:05:42.099> then<00:05:42.669> you<00:05:43.300> can't<00:05:43.570> push

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
completely painted then you can't push

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.439 
completely painted then you can't push
it<00:05:43.840> in<00:05:44.080> it<00:05:44.470> won't<00:05:44.650> go<00:05:44.800> in<00:05:44.830> now<00:05:45.789> I<00:05:45.820> forgetting<00:05:46.360> to

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.899 
just glue it that way and keep it that
way<00:05:49.199> then<00:05:50.199> just<00:05:50.830> put<00:05:51.400> it<00:05:51.490> together<00:05:51.610> a<00:05:51.820> little

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:51.909 
way then just put it together a little

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:55.260 
way then just put it together a little
how<00:05:52.240> you<00:05:52.300> want<00:05:52.570> in<00:05:52.780> the<00:05:52.930> spray
