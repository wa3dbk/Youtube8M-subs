00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
this tutorial remember you can use the

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.500 
this tutorial remember you can use the
easycap<00:04:00.620> software<00:04:01.069> if<00:04:01.280> you<00:04:01.430> want<00:04:01.609> to<00:04:01.819> but<00:04:02.239> I

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
easycap software if you want to but I

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.680 
easycap software if you want to but I
find<00:04:02.930> it's<00:04:03.109> a<00:04:03.739> bit<00:04:04.640> of<00:04:04.700> a<00:04:04.730> hassle<00:04:04.910> obviously

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
find it's a bit of a hassle obviously

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.780 
find it's a bit of a hassle obviously
because<00:04:05.989> um<00:04:06.260> getting<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:07.280> color<00:04:07.519> on<00:04:07.700> the

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
because um getting the color on the

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.240 
because um getting the color on the
easycap<00:04:08.180> is<00:04:08.329> quite<00:04:08.540> difficult<00:04:08.720> to<00:04:08.959> do<00:04:09.250> you

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
easycap is quite difficult to do you

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.590 
easycap is quite difficult to do you
need<00:04:10.370> to<00:04:10.430> have<00:04:10.519> certain<00:04:10.760> settings<00:04:11.329> which

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
need to have certain settings which

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.500 
need to have certain settings which
allow<00:04:11.780> you<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:11.989> get<00:04:12.109> it<00:04:12.200> in<00:04:12.260> color<00:04:13.150> so<00:04:14.150> it's

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
allow you to get it in color so it's

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.029 
allow you to get it in color so it's
better<00:04:14.660> off<00:04:14.840> with<00:04:14.959> a<00:04:15.049> sort<00:04:15.319> of<00:04:15.350> air<00:04:15.530> quality<00:04:15.709> of

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
better off with a sort of air quality of

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.690 
better off with a sort of air quality of
software<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:17.320> yes<00:04:18.320> so<00:04:18.590> I<00:04:18.620> remember<00:04:19.340> to<00:04:19.459> rate
