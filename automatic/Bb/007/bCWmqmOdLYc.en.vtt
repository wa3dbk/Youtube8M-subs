00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:28.920
 I was suddenly switched to snow. 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:34.649

 Yes , 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:56.909
 I saw the profit margins 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:04.140
 I want to make a room and have a nose 2 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:06.990
 So here, out in the following yoreotge from inside here, between a half-moon shape 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.430
 From the inside out 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.670
 In this way, the outdoor horns are sized here 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.490

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:22.610

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.090
 Can you please draw 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.990
 It's just too much, and if you do it like this , 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.340
 U 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.369
 ì«Œ It's a good idea to make it a little sparse because it can be strange . 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.369
 Ah 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:48.330
 I like a little green paint. 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.330
 Tail tail and leg 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.240
 My feet will do some work. 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:02.630
 Oh, if I had bangs on my bangs, 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.870
 You look like your bangs so banged up here so you can erase it. 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:11.350
 No, it's drawing in print. 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.350

 Sheep just pink in color 5 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.660

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.660
 Room Yellow 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:42.750
 I think it would be nice if the facial part was just a little soft and fleshy. 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.750
 Water gently 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:53.840
