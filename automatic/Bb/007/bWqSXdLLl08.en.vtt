00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
bulbs to plant now let's take a quick

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.330 
bulbs to plant now let's take a quick
look<00:01:27.960> at<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.200> five<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.619> one<00:01:28.650> which<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.220> you

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
look at the five and one which as you

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.190 
look at the five and one which as you
will<00:01:29.430> see<00:01:29.700> solves<00:01:30.270> many<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.600> these<00:01:30.720> problems

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
will see solves many of these problems

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.140 
will see solves many of these problems
that<00:01:31.290> were<00:01:31.380> just<00:01:31.590> touched<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.700> with<00:01:32.970> the
