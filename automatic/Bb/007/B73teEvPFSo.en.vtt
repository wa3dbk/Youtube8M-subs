screw them right into the 700 so you

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.349

the<00:01:21.889> shifter<00:01:22.920> still<00:01:23.759> works<00:01:24.679> same<00:01:25.679> factory

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
the shifter still works same factory

the<00:01:28.740> only<00:01:29.009> thing<00:01:29.249> that<00:01:29.399> he<00:01:29.520> cannot<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.179> is<00:01:30.630> put

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
the only thing that he cannot do is put

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.830 
the only thing that he cannot do is put
it<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.289> manual<00:01:31.590> low<00:01:32.279> but<00:01:33.209> you<00:01:33.329> got<00:01:33.509> Park

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
it in manual low but you got Park

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.550 
it in manual low but you got Park
reverse<00:01:34.109> neutral<00:01:34.789> now<00:01:35.789> he<00:01:35.849> has<00:01:36.090> Drive<00:01:36.599> third

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
reverse neutral now he has Drive third

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.550 
reverse neutral now he has Drive third
and<00:01:37.829> second<00:01:38.609> gear<00:01:38.849> so<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.719> can<00:01:40.049> use<00:01:40.349> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
and second gear so you can use the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.849 
and second gear so you can use the
existing<00:01:41.389> shifter<00:01:42.389> if<00:01:42.569> you<00:01:42.749> choose<00:01:43.049> unless

existing shifter if you choose unless

you<00:01:44.039> like<00:01:44.249> manually<00:01:44.909> shift<00:01:45.179> in<00:01:45.359> it

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
you like manually shift in it

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.929 
you like manually shift in it
so<00:01:47.509> this<00:01:47.749> is<00:01:47.929> the<00:01:48.229> final<00:01:49.039> of<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:49.189> 700r4

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
so this is the final of the 700r4

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.599 
so this is the final of the 700r4
conversion<00:01:50.869> we<00:01:51.439> still<00:01:51.770> use<00:01:52.009> this<00:01:52.280> same

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
conversion we still use this same

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:57.069 
conversion we still use this same
