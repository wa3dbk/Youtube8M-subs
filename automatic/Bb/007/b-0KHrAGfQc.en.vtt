00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.609 
i did draw obviously i use weights on
this<00:01:59.369> side<00:01:59.579> too<00:01:59.850> but<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.420> used<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.810> stick<00:02:01.170> you

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
this side too but I used to stick you

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.920 
this side too but I used to stick you
can<00:02:01.799> see<00:02:02.100> there<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.210> stick<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.719> actually

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
can see there is the stick I actually

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.560 
can see there is the stick I actually
wrapped<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:05.219> rope<00:02:05.460> around<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.000> stick<00:02:06.270> like

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
wrapped the rope around the stick like

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.800 
wrapped the rope around the stick like
you<00:02:06.750> would<00:02:07.759> normally<00:02:08.759> she<00:02:09.390> found<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.690> good

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
you would normally she found a good

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.559 
you would normally she found a good
solid<00:02:10.580> stick<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.730> was<00:02:11.849> long<00:02:12.060> enough<00:02:12.209> and

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
solid stick that was long enough and

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.170 
solid stick that was long enough and
then

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
then

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.160 
then
rocks<00:02:14.140> on<00:02:14.349> top<00:02:14.579> and<00:02:15.579> there's<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.599> ridgelines

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
rocks on top and there's the ridgelines

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.440 
rocks on top and there's the ridgelines
I<00:02:17.500> tied<00:02:17.799> them<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.069> that<00:02:18.250> tree<00:02:18.609> when<00:02:19.150> you're<00:02:19.359> not

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
I tied them to that tree when you're not

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.360 
I tied them to that tree when you're not
treat<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.109> then<00:02:21.569> on<00:02:22.569> this<00:02:23.170> side<00:02:23.230> sometimes<00:02:24.099> if

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
treat and then on this side sometimes if

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.130 
treat and then on this side sometimes if
you<00:02:24.459> could<00:02:24.640> find<00:02:24.790> like<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.090> bush<00:02:25.540> or<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.900> tree<00:02:25.930> or

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
you could find like a bush or a tree or

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.920 
you could find like a bush or a tree or
something<00:02:26.349> to<00:02:27.280> tie<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.519> other<00:02:27.849> corners<00:02:28.689> to

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
something to tie the other corners to

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.349 
something to tie the other corners to
that<00:02:29.230> would<00:02:29.500> be<00:02:29.590> easier<00:02:29.879> so<00:02:30.879> I<00:02:30.939> did<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.120> on

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
that would be easier so I did that on

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.039 
that would be easier so I did that on
both<00:02:31.510> of<00:02:31.569> those<00:02:31.900> ends<00:02:32.469> too<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:34.120> i<00:02:34.689> will<00:02:34.870> show

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
both of those ends too and i will show

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.160 
both of those ends too and i will show
you<00:02:35.109> the<00:02:35.439> inside<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.920> tent<00:02:36.569> this<00:02:37.569> is<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.810> lot

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
you the inside the tent this is a lot

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.490 
you the inside the tent this is a lot
like<00:02:38.439> is<00:02:38.739> actually<00:02:39.159> i<00:02:39.519> have<00:02:40.269> a<00:02:40.299> bigger<00:02:40.780> tent

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
like is actually i have a bigger tent

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.319 
like is actually i have a bigger tent
ended<00:02:42.340> up<00:02:42.430> being<00:02:42.639> like<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.819> little<00:02:43.090> bit<00:02:43.209> more

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
ended up being like a little bit more

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.479 
ended up being like a little bit more
slope<00:02:43.629> that<00:02:43.659> way<00:02:44.049> a<00:02:44.290> lot<00:02:44.709> of<00:02:44.739> times<00:02:45.069> they<00:02:45.280> be

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
slope that way a lot of times they be

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.490 
slope that way a lot of times they be
much<00:02:45.790> smaller<00:02:46.090> sometimes<00:02:46.689> I'd<00:02:47.019> be<00:02:47.049> like<00:02:47.319> well

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
much smaller sometimes I'd be like well

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.110 
much smaller sometimes I'd be like well
this<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:47.829> the<00:02:47.859> crappiest<00:02:48.189> an<00:02:48.609> I've<00:02:48.730> ever<00:02:48.879> made

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.210 
this is the crappiest an I've ever made
this<00:02:49.359> is<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:50.470> know<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.620> could<00:02:50.769> never<00:02:50.859> get<00:02:51.129> him

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
to look that crisp and great but it was

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.619 
to look that crisp and great but it was
fine<00:02:53.709> it<00:02:53.889> works<00:02:54.099> and<00:02:54.370> that<00:02:54.400> right<00:02:55.299> there's<00:02:55.540> my
