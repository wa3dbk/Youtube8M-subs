00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.060 
so now I'm going to hit enter and this
process<00:04:02.430> will<00:04:02.940> take<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.420> little<00:04:03.690> longer

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
process will take a little longer

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.130 
process will take a little longer
depending<00:04:05.070> on<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.250> file<00:04:05.490> size<00:04:05.760> it'll<00:04:06.600> be

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
depending on the file size it'll be

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.010 
depending on the file size it'll be
stuck<00:04:07.440> on<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.680> screen<00:04:07.980> until<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:09.690> file<00:04:09.870> is

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
stuck on the screen until the file is

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.850 
stuck on the screen until the file is
actually<00:04:10.380> installed<00:04:11.090> so<00:04:12.230> because<00:04:13.230> this<00:04:13.560> file

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
actually installed so because this file

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.890 
actually installed so because this file
is<00:04:14.130> just<00:04:14.430> under<00:04:14.670> two<00:04:14.940> megabytes<00:04:15.420> it<00:04:15.690> didn't

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
is just under two megabytes it didn't

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.780 
is just under two megabytes it didn't
take<00:04:16.049> that<00:04:16.230> long<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.470> install<00:04:17.010> but<00:04:17.520> if<00:04:17.640> you're

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
take that long to install but if you're

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.620 
take that long to install but if you're
installing<00:04:18.209> something<00:04:18.780> like<00:04:19.140> XBMC<00:04:20.209> that's<00:04:21.209> a

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
installing something like XBMC that's a

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.950 
installing something like XBMC that's a
50<00:04:22.380> megabyte<00:04:22.830> file<00:04:23.490> so<00:04:23.910> that<00:04:24.360> actually<00:04:24.690> takes

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
50 megabyte file so that actually takes

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.730 
50 megabyte file so that actually takes
about<00:04:25.110> five<00:04:25.560> minutes<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:26.100> install<00:04:27.140> um<00:04:28.140> you

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
about five minutes to install um you

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.910 
about five minutes to install um you
