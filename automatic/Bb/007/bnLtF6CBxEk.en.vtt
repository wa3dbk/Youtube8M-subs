00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 in today's video we will talk about how 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.120
 we can raise parakeets, so first thing 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.190
 what we will need will be a couple 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.900
 the couple may already be in shape 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.450
 although no selection has yet been made 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.990
 for example these 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.990
 that female 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.010
 and that macho 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.710
 but put yourself in this cage 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.250
 or in any other, even if it is big 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.590
 quite large of 600 centimeters 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:37.040
 long its propellers so that they fly 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.829
 although they are raising they are very playful 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.019
 the water a drinker of these serve 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.730
 if it's a little green but from a few 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:49.670
 drops for example that are vitamins 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.579
 there we have a very large feeder for 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.920
 that lasts a few days so has a 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.000
 little bit more but well this is because it 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:04.300
 put on top of the nest in this sense 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.300
 now they come in and have a stick 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.300
 we can put those little children 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.320
 we have the option of putting your nest more 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.320
 great as this 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.440
 I have a security system 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.440
 those who escape 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.610
 here we have 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:27.299
 these things and woods that was made to 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.299
 make nest 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.610
 in the oral nest and incoming 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.110
 to hang them in the area of ​​how is your 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.110
 little boy 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.689
 this 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.689
 or but these photos 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:56.380
 and that's how it affected trias 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:59.920
 if more or less can take some 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.610
 couples take weeks in popular other 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.350
 months and may even take years yo 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.200
 I had a couple that took me a year to 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.319
 raise 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.170
 because the couple was not formed and 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.390
 final was formed and they were the 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.690
 best couple that I have until the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.690
 today 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.820
 and when after copulating about two 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.310
 weeks later the female will start 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.310
 lay their eggs inside the nest 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.140
 inside the nest inside there may be 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.450
 female 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.730
 I incubate them from the first egg that 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.390
 puts or if not to the days of having and still 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.510
 for the eggs 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.300
 and well then 18 days after 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:49.420
 put the first egg will be born a chick 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.510
 It may take longer but it's bad 18 days 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.670
 and are not the chicks that are little things 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.190
 roses at this time I do not have the 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.220
 chickens since those who had genes already 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.160
 they have grown although they are very fast 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.030
 and they are very tiny roses the size of 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.420
 the games are things like that small can 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.300
 put about four eggs and 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.910
 they put seven because they are well taken care of and 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.060
 they always take out many chickens 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.520
 here too 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.910
 then after those 18 days the chickens 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.400
 it takes a month to go out in the sar adults 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.450
 that for example this project here 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.230
 has a month 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.569
 and a week or so 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.390
 recently I have it in the grandmother of the 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.159
 great to learn to eat and that in a 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.650
 neighbor is from a friend of mine who 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:43.650
 exchange for an order for another 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.170
 parakeet had to cool not 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.810
 we can tempt brothers so change 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:56.360
 to the other chicken that I had for this female 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:59.240
 that I 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.450
 the color only to use the tongue 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.340
 any serves except putting together 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.340
 little yellow piece and a yellow white 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.710
 of white or yellow and spears because 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:14.930
 it would be deadly for chickens not 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:17.739
 they would say or they would leave with malformations 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.660
 that he does from experience and also 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.620
 because I assure you do not do it 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.830
 because if it can not have consequences 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:30.759
 like getting time to do anything 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.759
 they will not learn to eat 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.830
 they will not learn and they will end up dying 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.259
 well after that month of life 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.110
 to start raising those chickens that 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:44.979
 we have for example this chick 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.979
 yellow that we have 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:52.380
 and this female that does not seem to create 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.150
 Now together with another couple 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.040
 was born in January of this year of 2014 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.890
 and this fact now remains for us 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.870
 September since it has already nine months 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:05.690
 it is recommended as of the six already 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.520
 could but it is advisable to wait for a 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.289
 little more than six to swallow in more 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.529
 interesting forces 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:16.139
 if you can see in the legs of my 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:18.960
 budgies have rings that's what I'm 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.149
 a professional breeder I will see if I 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.669
 all you have ring is up to 

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:25.860
 rings and that means that I am a 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.129
 registered professional creator and that I'm going 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.679
 to do 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:32.199
 and well that's how we can raise 

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:33.800
 we can have parakeets in our 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.840
 yard 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.720
 or inside house inside house is not 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.129
 advisable but good yes I hope that you
