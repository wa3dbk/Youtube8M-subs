00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.160
 let's move a moment early in 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.260
 the 70s 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.880
 the powerful space invaders that until the 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.460
 moment was the master and lord of the 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.350
 recreational roads would yield its place to 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.350
 a very particular and fun game 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.920
 pacman was launched on May 21 , 1980 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.649
 becoming a success almost of 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.170
 immediate success that took him to all 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.800
 corners of the world one of those places 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.260
 it was us where it would also be a whole 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.399
 success although it's from here where 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.399
 an interesting detail would happen 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.949
 and 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.260
 although the original game was the one that everything 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:01.510
 the world requested there was also a 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.510
 alternative version called crazy vote 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.180
 it grew everything was created by the company 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.790
 called general computer corporation the 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.640
 which basically took games and created 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.939
 improved hacks by throwing them under others 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.890
 names in the case that concerns us grace and 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.140
 another represented an evolution with 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.119
 regarding batman the character instead 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.670
 of having only the movement of the mouth 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.700
 he also moved his feet so obviously 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.530
 is not more visually fun besides 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.659
 presented different game screens 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.330
 instead of just one as did the 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.640
 original version all these changes 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.740
 they made obviously the unofficial clone 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.659
 of batman was much more fun than 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.970
 the batman himself for what he brought 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.920
 economic losses to the company midway 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.170
 who was in charge of taking the game 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.479
 to America 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.880
 the solution to the conflict would come with a 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.830
 agreement between the two parties modifying 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.409
 the characters so that if you could 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.930
 play with pacman's girlfriend and changing 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.530
 the title we all know my 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.530
 batman 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.530
 despite the success now with the company 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.570
 creator of the original pacman did not see with 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.790
 good eyes to the new protagonist of 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.740
 his franchise presea so he started 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.920
 a legal contest between the company 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.990
 Japanese and the North American only 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.460
 means that months bachman despite 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.290
 of his curious story has a great 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.240
 merit since she is the first 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.160
 female protagonist of video game 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.010
 some for what this story was 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.870
 necessary to do that that's all for now 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.260
 Greetings to all and see you for the 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.260
 production
