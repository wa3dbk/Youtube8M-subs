ways to do it you know what I used to do

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.080 
ways to do it you know what I used to do
is<00:00:19.439> take<00:00:19.619> these<00:00:19.770> smaller<00:00:20.189> they're<00:00:20.939> almost

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
is take these smaller they're almost

like a 370 sides playing a box except
they're<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> little<00:00:23.820> bit<00:00:23.970> deeper<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.570> said<00:00:25.050> just

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
they're a little bit deeper I said just

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.220 
they're a little bit deeper I said just
lay<00:00:26.400> all<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.760> soft<00:00:27.000> plastics<00:00:27.510> on<00:00:27.660> top<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.140> each

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.189 
lay all the soft plastics on top of each
other<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.519> got<00:00:29.849> up<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.240> six<00:00:30.960> or<00:00:31.170> seven

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199

other and I got up to like six or seven
boxes<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.160> then<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.399> figured<00:00:32.730> out<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.030> I

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
boxes and then I figured out that I

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.240 
boxes and then I figured out that I
needed<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.480> find<00:00:34.110> out<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.350> different<00:00:34.559> way<00:00:34.860> and
