what is the sweet spot for how many

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.490 
what is the sweet spot for how many
people<00:00:56.309> should<00:00:56.910> be<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.510> field<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.020> a

people should be on the field and a
given<00:00:58.829> time<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.730> has<00:01:00.000> been<00:01:00.030> reported<00:01:00.420> that

given time so it has been reported that

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.280 
given time so it has been reported that
battlefield<00:01:01.920> 4<00:01:02.309> will<00:01:02.460> have<00:01:02.699> 64<00:01:03.239> players<00:01:03.539> but

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
battlefield 4 will have 64 players but

battlefield 4 will have 64 players but
there<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.979> possibility<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:06.150> looks<00:01:06.420> like

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
there is a possibility it looks like

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
according to this post that that number

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.170 
according to this post that that number
could<00:01:10.110> increase<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:11.220> other<00:01:11.460> bit<00:01:12.060> of

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
support for Kinect now they did say that

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.550 
support for Kinect now they did say that
or<00:01:23.580> they<00:01:23.850> talked<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.900> wouldn't<00:01:25.409> be

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
or they talked like it wouldn't be

or they talked like it wouldn't be
motion<00:01:26.159> controls<00:01:26.640> they<00:01:27.299> said<00:01:27.509> they<00:01:27.659> weren't

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
motion controls they said they weren't

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.600 
motion controls they said they weren't
going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.229> get<00:01:28.320> into<00:01:28.590> gimmicks<00:01:28.979> they<00:01:29.159> said<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
going to get into gimmicks they said the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.210 
going to get into gimmicks they said the
way<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.060> game<00:01:30.450> works<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.140> plays<00:01:31.170> out<00:01:31.710> you

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
way the game works and plays out you

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.310 
way the game works and plays out you
need<00:01:32.400> very<00:01:32.729> precise<00:01:33.270> controls<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.049> they<00:01:34.110> said

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
need very precise controls and they said

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.920 
need very precise controls and they said
so<00:01:34.590> motion<00:01:35.280> controls<00:01:35.670> don't<00:01:36.000> really<00:01:36.390> fit<00:01:36.689> into

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
so motion controls don't really fit into

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.870 
so motion controls don't really fit into
that<00:01:37.079> play<00:01:37.439> style<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.340> they<00:01:38.490> said<00:01:38.700> they're

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
that play style but they said they're

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.330 
that play style but they said they're
looking<00:01:38.909> at<00:01:39.360> other<00:01:39.630> areas<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.770> do<00:01:41.070> make

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
looking at other areas that do make

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.880 
looking at other areas that do make
sense<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:42.090> using<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.630> Kinect<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.649> course

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
sense for using the Kinect so of course

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.510 
sense for using the Kinect so of course
the<00:01:44.340> obvious<00:01:45.110> big<00:01:46.110> one<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.530> comes<00:01:47.070> out<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.399> my

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the obvious big one that comes out in my

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.910 
the obvious big one that comes out in my
mind<00:01:47.729> would<00:01:47.939> be<00:01:48.000> using<00:01:48.509> voice<00:01:48.720> commands<00:01:49.259> being

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
mind would be using voice commands being

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.859 
mind would be using voice commands being
able<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.310> give<00:01:50.460> commands<00:01:50.939> maybe<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.630> your

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
able to give commands maybe to your

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.499 
able to give commands maybe to your
single<00:01:52.530> player<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.280> know<00:01:53.399> counterparts<00:01:54.329> or

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
single player you know counterparts or

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.810 
single player you know counterparts or
even<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.470> know<00:01:55.590> calling<00:01:55.860> out<00:01:56.070> stuff<00:01:56.369> like<00:01:56.640> in

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
even you know calling out stuff like in

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.760 
even you know calling out stuff like in
commander<00:01:57.210> mode<00:01:57.420> or<00:01:57.630> calling<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.649> know

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
commander mode or calling in you know

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.770 
commander mode or calling in you know
different<00:01:59.009> things<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.700> don't<00:01:59.909> know<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.479> anyway

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
different things I don't know but anyway

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.420 
different things I don't know but anyway
I'm<00:02:00.899> sure<00:02:00.960> they<00:02:01.200> could<00:02:01.259> easily<00:02:01.500> incorporate

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
I'm sure they could easily incorporate

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.700 
I'm sure they could easily incorporate
voice<00:02:02.700> controls<00:02:03.689> but<00:02:04.200> then<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.530> question

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
voice controls but then the question

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.249 
voice controls but then the question
that<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.729> if<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.719> can<00:02:06.869> do<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.079> with

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
that I have is if you can do it with

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.960

battlefield 4 in order to do something
the<00:02:32.510> only<00:02:32.810> other<00:02:32.840> thing<00:02:33.050> that<00:02:33.319> I<00:02:33.500> could<00:02:33.770> think

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
the only other thing that I could think

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.949 
the only other thing that I could think
of<00:02:34.130> is<00:02:34.400> maybe<00:02:34.430> if<00:02:34.880> you<00:02:35.150> know<00:02:35.270> since<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.690> reads

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
of is maybe if you know since it reads

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:37.330 
of is maybe if you know since it reads
heartbeats<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.680> know<00:02:36.800> maybe<00:02:36.980> if<00:02:37.160> you're<00:02:37.310> a

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
heartbeats you know maybe if you're a

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.440 
heartbeats you know maybe if you're a
sniper<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.770> breadth<00:02:40.130> of<00:02:40.489> how<00:02:41.030> fast

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
sniper it the the breadth of how fast

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.890 
sniper it the the breadth of how fast
your<00:02:41.840> gun<00:02:42.170> is<00:02:42.410> going<00:02:42.680> up<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:42.980> down<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.489> sway

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
your gun is going up and down the sway

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.900 
your gun is going up and down the sway
maybe<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:45.290> could<00:02:45.500> be<00:02:45.709> controlled<00:02:46.190> by<00:02:46.459> your<00:02:46.760> own

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
maybe it could be controlled by your own

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.550 
maybe it could be controlled by your own
heartbeat<00:02:47.420> so<00:02:47.720> maybe<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.110> have<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.380> lower

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
heartbeat so maybe you have to lower

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.750 
heartbeat so maybe you have to lower
your<00:02:48.769> own<00:02:48.950> heartbeat<00:02:49.370> or<00:02:49.459> something<00:02:49.730> I

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
your own heartbeat or something I

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.920 
your own heartbeat or something I
thought<00:02:49.910> that<00:02:50.180> might<00:02:50.330> be<00:02:50.390> something<00:02:50.630> pretty

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
thought that might be something pretty

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.140 
thought that might be something pretty
cool<00:02:51.080> but<00:02:51.380> that's<00:02:51.950> just<00:02:52.190> totally<00:02:52.760> pulled<00:02:53.000> out

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
cool but that's just totally pulled out

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.300 
cool but that's just totally pulled out
of<00:02:53.269> my<00:02:53.360> butt<00:02:53.600> like<00:02:53.959> I<00:02:54.290> haven't<00:02:54.709> read<00:02:55.040> anything

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
about that I was just sitting there

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.660 
about that I was just sitting there
