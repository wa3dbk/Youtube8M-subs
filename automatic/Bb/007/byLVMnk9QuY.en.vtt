00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.050 

now<00:00:01.290> let's<00:00:01.530> talk<00:00:01.770> about<00:00:01.829> independent<00:00:02.730> samples

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
now let's talk about independent samples

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.090 
now let's talk about independent samples
versus<00:00:03.419> paired<00:00:03.750> samples<00:00:04.230> because<00:00:04.410> from<00:00:04.890> here

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
versus paired samples because from here

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.590 
versus paired samples because from here
on<00:00:05.220> out<00:00:05.339> we're<00:00:05.580> totally<00:00:06.000> going<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.299> be<00:00:06.390> dealing

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
on out we're totally going to be dealing

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.270 
on out we're totally going to be dealing
with<00:00:06.810> paired<00:00:07.170> samples<00:00:07.589> it<00:00:07.890> would<00:00:08.069> help<00:00:08.189> to

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
with paired samples it would help to

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.100 
with paired samples it would help to
know<00:00:08.400> what<00:00:08.730> what<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.269> heck<00:00:09.389> those<00:00:09.570> are<00:00:09.809> right

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
know what what the heck those are right

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.980 
know what what the heck those are right
so<00:00:10.889> independent<00:00:11.610> samples<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.300> scores<00:00:12.750> are

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
so independent samples the scores are

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.350 
so independent samples the scores are
derived<00:00:13.740> separately<00:00:14.340> from<00:00:14.519> each<00:00:14.670> other<00:00:15.000> for

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
derived separately from each other for

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.330 
derived separately from each other for
instance<00:00:15.809> they<00:00:16.139> came<00:00:16.379> from<00:00:16.529> separate<00:00:16.949> people

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
instance they came from separate people

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.990 
instance they came from separate people
separate<00:00:17.910> schools<00:00:18.410> separate<00:00:19.410> uhm<00:00:20.000> separate

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
separate schools separate uhm separate

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.480 
separate schools separate uhm separate
petri<00:00:21.390> dishes<00:00:21.600> right<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.830> samples<00:00:23.340> are

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
petri dishes right so the samples are

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.730 
petri dishes right so the samples are
independent<00:00:23.789> from<00:00:24.330> each<00:00:24.359> other<00:00:24.750> my<00:00:25.019> my

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
independent from each other my my

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.800 
independent from each other my my
getting<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.400> sample<00:00:26.849> had<00:00:27.090> nothing<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.630> do

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
getting of this sample had nothing to do

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.519 
getting of this sample had nothing to do
with<00:00:27.960> my<00:00:28.140> getting<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.740> other<00:00:28.980> sample

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
with my getting of this other sample

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.260 
with my getting of this other sample
independent<00:00:31.529> another<00:00:32.009> word<00:00:32.219> prepared<00:00:32.850> right

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
independent another word prepared right

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.380 
independent another word prepared right
independent<00:00:34.260> or<00:00:34.380> paired<00:00:34.770> samples<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.940> scores

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
independent or paired samples the scores

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.549 
independent or paired samples the scores
are<00:00:36.600> linked<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.410> some<00:00:37.469> way<00:00:37.829> for<00:00:38.700> instance

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
are linked in some way for instance

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.530 
are linked in some way for instance
they're<00:00:40.559> linked<00:00:41.040> by<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.309> same<00:00:41.640> person<00:00:41.969> right

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
they're linked by the same person right

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.680 
they're linked by the same person right
so<00:00:42.950> my<00:00:43.950> score<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.640> math<00:00:44.850> test<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.480> my

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
so my score on the math test and my

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.990 
so my score on the math test and my
score<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.410> English<00:00:46.800> test<00:00:47.129> right<00:00:47.489> they're

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
score on the English test right they're

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.080 
score on the English test right they're
linked<00:00:48.450> because<00:00:49.020> they<00:00:49.200> both<00:00:49.350> come<00:00:49.620> from<00:00:49.649> me

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
linked because they both come from me

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.360 
linked because they both come from me
may<00:00:51.090> be<00:00:51.149> married<00:00:51.690> couple<00:00:52.140> may<00:00:52.559> be<00:00:52.620> asked<00:00:52.980> one

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
may be married couple may be asked one

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.540 
may be married couple may be asked one
married<00:00:53.760> couple<00:00:54.710> how<00:00:55.710> many<00:00:55.890> children<00:00:56.219> would

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
married couple how many children would

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.510 
married couple how many children would
you<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:57.020> you<00:00:58.020> ask<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.530> one<00:00:58.710> spouse<00:00:59.039> how<00:00:59.340> many

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you like you ask the one spouse how many

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.490 
you like you ask the one spouse how many
children<00:00:59.789> would<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.090> like<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.570> have<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.020> you

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
children would you like to have and you

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.900 
children would you like to have and you
ask<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.890> other<00:01:02.010> spouse<00:01:02.280> how<00:01:02.489> many<00:01:02.640> children

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
ask the other spouse how many children

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.329 
ask the other spouse how many children
would<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:03.930> right<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.890> that

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
would you like to have right so in that

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.890 
would you like to have right so in that
way<00:01:05.580> although<00:01:05.909> they<00:01:06.330> come<00:01:06.540> from<00:01:06.689> different

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
way although they come from different

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.350 
way although they come from different
people<00:01:07.290> there's<00:01:07.890> these<00:01:08.280> scores<00:01:08.670> are<00:01:08.850> linked

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
people there's these scores are linked

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.510 
people there's these scores are linked
because<00:01:09.900> they<00:01:10.020> come<00:01:10.290> from<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.950> same<00:01:11.159> married

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
because they come from the same married

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.230 
because they come from the same married
couple<00:01:11.970> or<00:01:13.040> another<00:01:14.040> thing<00:01:14.280> might<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.760> pre

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
couple or another thing might be a pre

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.640 
couple or another thing might be a pre
and<00:01:15.689> post-tests

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
and post-tests

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.280 
and post-tests
of<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:17.159> class<00:01:17.430> right<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.119> maybe<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.689> statistics

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
of a class right so maybe a statistics

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.340 
of a class right so maybe a statistics
class<00:01:19.560> might<00:01:19.830> do<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.009> pre<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.549> post-tests<00:01:21.350> so

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
class might do a pre and post-tests so

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.830 
class might do a pre and post-tests so
maybe<00:01:22.590> ten<00:01:23.250> different<00:01:23.700> statistics<00:01:24.299> classes

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
maybe ten different statistics classes

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.770 
maybe ten different statistics classes
from<00:01:25.229> all<00:01:25.560> over<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.070> United<00:01:26.460> States<00:01:26.780> get

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
from all over the United States get

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.210 
from all over the United States get
picked<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.200> do<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.470> pre<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:28.979> post-test<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.140> and

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
picked to do a pre and post-test and and

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.789 
picked to do a pre and post-test and and
those<00:01:32.220> tests<00:01:32.909> are<00:01:33.000> linked<00:01:33.689> because<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.439> same

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
those tests are linked because the same

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.219 
those tests are linked because the same
class<00:01:35.220> did<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.820> first<00:01:36.060> test<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.840> second

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
class did the first test and the second

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.249 
class did the first test and the second
test<00:01:37.439> right<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.090> ten<00:01:39.090> different<00:01:39.479> classes<00:01:39.869> did

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
test right and ten different classes did

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:40.999 
test right and ten different classes did
the<00:01:40.470> pair's

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
the pair's

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.910 
the pair's
right<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:42.030> way<00:01:42.119> they're<00:01:42.299> paired<00:01:42.920> samples

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
right so that way they're paired samples

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.280 
right so that way they're paired samples
right<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:44.790> not<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.329> hodgepodge<00:01:45.840> of

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
right so it's not just a hodgepodge of

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.620 
right so it's not just a hodgepodge of
pretest<00:01:47.130> scores<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.000> hodgepodge<00:01:48.270> of

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
pretest scores in a hodgepodge of

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.289 
pretest scores in a hodgepodge of
post-test<00:01:49.560> scores<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.100> more<00:01:50.610> like<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:51.030> neat

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
post-test scores it's more like a neat

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.080 
post-test scores it's more like a neat
line<00:01:51.750> where<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.860> pretest<00:01:53.430> scores<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:53.939> this

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090

okay<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.880> now<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.120> you<00:02:06.300> know<00:02:06.330> those<00:02:06.630> sort<00:02:06.840> of

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
okay so now that you know those sort of

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.720 
okay so now that you know those sort of
technical<00:02:07.350> definitions<00:02:07.920> let's<00:02:08.280> see<00:02:08.460> if<00:02:08.580> we

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:08.730 
technical definitions let's see if we

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.730 
technical definitions let's see if we
could<00:02:08.880> pick<00:02:09.060> them<00:02:09.240> out<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.960> which<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.200> these<00:02:10.500> is

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
could pick them out so which of these is

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.550 
could pick them out so which of these is
which<00:02:10.980> so<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.970> test<00:02:12.270> scores<00:02:12.630> from<00:02:12.990> Professor

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
which so the test scores from Professor

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.680 
which so the test scores from Professor

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
who are not autistic right and so here

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.790 
who are not autistic right and so here
we<00:04:02.489> have<00:04:02.520> autistic<00:04:03.030> individuals<00:04:03.870> lined<00:04:04.530> up

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
we have autistic individuals lined up

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.590 
we have autistic individuals lined up
with<00:04:05.010> somebody<00:04:05.220> who's<00:04:05.550> their<00:04:05.760> same<00:04:06.090> age<00:04:06.330> is

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
with somebody who's their same age is

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.510 
with somebody who's their same age is
not<00:04:06.780> autistic<00:04:07.050> right<00:04:07.680> so<00:04:08.010> there<00:04:08.220> are<00:04:08.370> these

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
not autistic right so there are these

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.260 
not autistic right so there are these
nice<00:04:09.060> even<00:04:09.660> pairs<00:04:10.050> and<00:04:10.410> each<00:04:10.890> pair<00:04:11.340> has<00:04:11.640> AI

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
nice even pairs and each pair has AI

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.210 
nice even pairs and each pair has AI
gaze<00:04:12.900> I<00:04:13.260> gay<00:04:13.650> scores<00:04:14.280> right<00:04:14.820> and<00:04:15.620> so<00:04:16.620> I<00:04:16.920> would

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
gaze I gay scores right and so I would

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.360 
gaze I gay scores right and so I would
say<00:04:17.430> these<00:04:17.700> are

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
say these are

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.090 
say these are
paired-samples<00:04:19.470> so<00:04:20.470> hopefully<00:04:20.919> that<00:04:21.070> gives

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
paired-samples so hopefully that gives

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.550 
paired-samples so hopefully that gives
you<00:04:21.340> a<00:04:21.400> better<00:04:21.609> idea<00:04:21.699> of<00:04:22.090> some<00:04:22.810> examples<00:04:23.350> of

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
you a better idea of some examples of

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.010 
you a better idea of some examples of
paired-samples
