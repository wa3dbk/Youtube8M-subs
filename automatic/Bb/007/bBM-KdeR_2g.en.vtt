00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
the goal but it looks like that goal is

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.210 
are probably having second thoughts
right<00:03:12.969> now<00:03:13.500> that<00:03:14.500> is<00:03:14.680> freaking<00:03:15.269> suicide<00:03:16.269> for

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
right now that is freaking suicide for

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.809 
right now that is freaking suicide for
Microsoft<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:18.489> Sony<00:03:18.699> to<00:03:19.120> allow<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:20.560> wii<00:03:20.829> u<00:03:21.129> to

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
Microsoft and Sony to allow the wii u to

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.179 
Microsoft and Sony to allow the wii u to
be<00:03:21.849> on<00:03:22.299> the<00:03:22.419> market<00:03:22.659> for<00:03:22.900> itself<00:03:23.560> with<00:03:23.859> no

00:03:24.179 --> 00:03:24.189 
be on the market for itself with no

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.179 
be on the market for itself with no
competition<00:03:25.060> for<00:03:25.090> two<00:03:25.540> years<00:03:25.959> that's<00:03:26.859> suicide

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:27.189 
competition for two years that's suicide

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.839 
competition for two years that's suicide
so<00:03:27.819> either<00:03:28.079> they're<00:03:29.079> going<00:03:29.439> to<00:03:29.680> take<00:03:30.549> that

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
so either they're going to take that

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.599 
so either they're going to take that
gamble<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.689> hope<00:03:31.959> that<00:03:32.319> the<00:03:32.769> wii<00:03:32.949> u<00:03:33.009> doesn't

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
gamble and hope that the wii u doesn't

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.649 
gamble and hope that the wii u doesn't
have<00:03:33.729> this<00:03:33.909> huge<00:03:34.389> user<00:03:34.870> base<00:03:35.159> by<00:03:36.159> the<00:03:36.220> end<00:03:36.489> of

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
have this huge user base by the end of

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.119 
have this huge user base by the end of
2014<00:03:37.659> which<00:03:37.900> is<00:03:38.049> pretty<00:03:38.259> much<00:03:38.530> guarantee<00:03:39.099> that

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
2014 which is pretty much guarantee that

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.479 
2014 which is pretty much guarantee that
it<00:03:39.519> will<00:03:39.759> or<00:03:40.500> they'll<00:03:41.500> try<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:41.799> rush<00:03:42.250> the
