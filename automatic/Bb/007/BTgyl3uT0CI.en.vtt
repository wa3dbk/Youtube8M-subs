data I think that might be pushed I mean

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.750 
data I think that might be pushed I mean
it's<00:06:19.870> hard<00:06:20.020> to<00:06:20.170> say<00:06:20.350> if<00:06:20.500> they<00:06:21.130> actually<00:06:21.550> had

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
it's hard to say if they actually had

it's hard to say if they actually had
the<00:06:22.290> was<00:06:23.290> a<00:06:23.320> three<00:06:23.680> and<00:06:23.800> a<00:06:23.890> quarter<00:06:24.070> because<00:06:25.060> I

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
the was a three and a quarter because I

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.570 
the was a three and a quarter because I
know<00:06:25.570> there<00:06:25.720> was<00:06:25.750> like<00:06:25.900> a<00:06:26.410> four<00:06:26.890> inch<00:06:27.100> then<00:06:27.430> it

know there was like a four inch then it

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.210 
know there was like a four inch then it
became<00:06:27.790> three<00:06:28.030> and<00:06:28.210> a<00:06:28.270> quarter<00:06:28.450> and<00:06:29.190> after<00:06:30.190> a

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
became three and a quarter and after a

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.260 
became three and a quarter and after a
point<00:06:30.520> the<00:06:31.000> disk<00:06:31.240> just<00:06:31.510> not<00:06:31.690> being<00:06:31.870> sloppy<00:06:33.270> but
