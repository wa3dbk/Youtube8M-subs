floor in that we use is an engineered
flooring<00:00:55.000> we<00:00:55.840> use<00:00:55.960> although<00:00:56.230> boc<00:00:56.980> paints<00:00:57.660> and

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710

again<00:00:59.710> as<00:00:59.829> I<00:00:59.950> said<00:01:00.180> something<00:01:01.180> that<00:01:01.210> really

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
again as I said something that really

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.300 
again as I said something that really
make<00:01:01.900> a<00:01:01.930> special<00:01:02.350> we<00:01:02.560> have<00:01:02.590> a<00:01:02.770> go<00:01:02.920> up<00:01:03.040> in<00:01:03.190> the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
make a special we have a go up in the

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.000 
make a special we have a go up in the
attic<00:01:03.340> you<00:01:03.760> like<00:01:03.910> to<00:01:04.030> do<00:01:04.149> that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.560 

as<00:01:09.010> soon<00:01:09.220> as<00:01:09.340> I<00:01:09.490> walk<00:01:09.670> into<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.119> attic<00:01:10.420> I

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
as soon as I walk into the attic I

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.750 
as soon as I walk into the attic I
noticed<00:01:10.960> how<00:01:11.080> cool<00:01:11.409> it<00:01:11.650> isn't<00:01:11.979> here<00:01:12.190> yes

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
noticed how cool it isn't here yes

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.100 
noticed how cool it isn't here yes
that's<00:01:12.970> because<00:01:13.330> of<00:01:13.450> their<00:01:13.540> product<00:01:13.900> that<00:01:13.990> we

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
that's because of their product that we

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.210 
that's because of their product that we
use<00:01:14.320> on<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:15.070> ceiling<00:01:16.440> sheathing<00:01:17.440> on<00:01:17.650> the<00:01:18.040> roof

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
use on the ceiling sheathing on the roof

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.789 
use on the ceiling sheathing on the roof
has<00:01:18.580> aluminum<00:01:19.180> foil<00:01:19.509> line<00:01:19.750> that<00:01:20.080> reflects<00:01:20.650> the

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
has aluminum foil line that reflects the

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.190 
has aluminum foil line that reflects the
heat<00:01:20.830> out<00:01:21.159> of<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.490> Attic<00:01:21.909> which<00:01:22.630> prevents<00:01:23.080> the

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
heat out of the Attic which prevents the

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.930 
heat out of the Attic which prevents the
build-up<00:01:23.409> of<00:01:23.770> really<00:01:24.159> high<00:01:24.310> temperatures

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
build-up of really high temperatures

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.180 
build-up of really high temperatures
because<00:01:25.570> of<00:01:25.720> that<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:26.020> HVAC<00:01:26.470> system<00:01:26.890> doesn't

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
because of that the HVAC system doesn't

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.070 
because of that the HVAC system doesn't
have<00:01:27.310> to<00:01:27.460> work<00:01:27.610> as<00:01:27.759> hard<00:01:27.820> when<00:01:28.420> when<00:01:28.810> it's<00:01:28.960> in

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
have to work as hard when when it's in

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.410 
have to work as hard when when it's in
the<00:01:29.140> cooling<00:01:29.470> mode<00:01:29.820> well<00:01:30.820> what<00:01:31.030> else<00:01:31.180> can<00:01:31.360> you

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
the cooling mode well what else can you

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.180 
the cooling mode well what else can you
show<00:01:31.630> us<00:01:31.659> that<00:01:31.899> makes<00:01:32.110> this<00:01:32.229> house<00:01:32.409> green<00:01:32.740> well
