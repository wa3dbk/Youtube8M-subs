00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello very good day youtubers or julie 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.540
 kander 4001 and I bring you now the part 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.210
 3 of the tutorial of making a char for the 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.370
 woman in the previous video I taught them 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.170
 something about animations good a 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.059
 requirement to continue with this 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.619
 tutorial is that they have already prepared 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.710
 some images that are of your char 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.140
 throwing a few punches whatever it is serves 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.359
 be stand light punch or stand medium 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.060
 kick and so on and that's about three already 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.769
 lists also need to have lists 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.439
 the animations of your char being 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.700
 hit I know they are many but I need 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.710
 that have them 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.450
 remember to save these images with 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.910
 groups corresponding to the animation 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.739
 as I explained in my previous video if 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.180
 you have not seen it I would tell you what better 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.600
 you saw because it contains information 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.879
 essential to continue something I want 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.590
 inform them is that I already install all 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.899
 the images and finish all my 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.969
 animations better said I finished my 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.670
 chat but I'll make a copy and edit it 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.520
 all again good let's go back to the tutorial 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.469
 in this part I will teach you to do that 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.719
 the animation of actually hitting a blow 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.240
 hurt the opponent since the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.250
 animation alone does not hurt alone 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.680
 to let loose a punch but without 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.530
 any effect what we need are 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.659
 only two things and are the following the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.909
 animations of his char giving a few blows 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.189
 it has to be fist and kick either 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.950
 standing or crouched but not those of 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.140
 jumping when you have finished the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.299
 animation as they want it selected 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.340
 the button of the red box with the sign of 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.530
 more and a red box will appear in the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.330
 animation accommodate it in the part of the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.720
 char where is the fist to give the 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.720
 knock 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.020
 files mail 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.630
 I informed them that the light stand is already 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.610
 prepared to give the blow but 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.710
 they will notice that in the others it throws the blow 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.510
 but it does not cause harm that's because 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.230
 these other animations are not 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.230
 coded 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.230
 to codify you have to do what 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.200
 next check the bei number and 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.420
 nation which in this case is number 210 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.060
 for the medium punch stand animation 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.459
 they go to the constants button on the side 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.950
 left select the button estates and 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.440
 they look for the number of the animation since 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.690
 find it they select everything they go 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.370
 to the button where it says intro they select 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.370
 and they look for the option that says punch 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.190
 a lot of attention here in this amber terna 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.580
 put the number corresponding to the 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.680
 animation which in this case is 210 in 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.870
 animation number put the number of the 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.220
 fist animation that also in this 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.220
 case is 210 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.230
 to get the digit for the option 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.270
 of hit animation number we return to 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.550
 the animations and we see in what number of 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.100
 esprit is was the blow in this case is 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.870
 the 3 we return to the constants and 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.690
 they put the number of the animation in that 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.300
 the blow is given in this case 3 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.630
 in ladies they put a number whatever 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.520
 between 25 and 45 can put whatever 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.220
 but if it's bigger your char could be 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.590
 too strong in type we select 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.690
 are since this animation is when 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.970
 our char is stopped but it is 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.310
 Crouching select the crouch option 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:55.010
 and if it is in air select the option 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.590
 it was last, make sure you have everything 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.630
 the estate left 210 selected and you 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.430
 put in insert and ready 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.880
 they have programmed that movement so that 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.880
 give the blow 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.890
 an extra if they want their char to 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.110
 give two hits in the same animation 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.560
 they add another red box in another part of 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.560
 the animation 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:43.199
 they go to the estate 210 1 under trigger 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.199
 1 they put the following 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:53.389
 stringer 2 equals level in equals the 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:57.069
 hit number and now such area will give 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.069
 two strokes in a single animation 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.160
 already when they code each and every one of 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.860
 the movements will have finished suchar 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.720
 one thing that I want to mention I will do 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.030
 some extra videos on how to make a 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.770
 super motion new commands and do that 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.620
 listen when I hit the air 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.750
 Stop advancing and go to the ground 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.970
 instantly something else do not forget 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.910
 to put the images of groups 5000 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.540
 since these are essential one last 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.970
 thing 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.920
 the draw command is to hold your enemy 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.960
 and launching it is very complicated for 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.440
 explain them for the moment so 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.850
 then I'll upload another video explaining it 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.740
 thanks for watching the how-to tutorial 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.560
 make a char for women with fighter 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.200
 factory if they liked it and it was useful for them 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.720
 please like and subscribe if you 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.470
 I would appreciate very much see you until my
