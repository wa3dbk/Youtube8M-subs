pops off and screws on
right<00:02:13.530> so<00:02:14.190> fill<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.550> half<00:02:14.790> with<00:02:15.030> almond<00:02:15.390> milk

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
right so fill it half with almond milk

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.840 
right so fill it half with almond milk
then<00:02:16.980> i<00:02:18.260> put<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.560> half<00:02:19.770> of<00:02:19.980> frozen<00:02:20.280> bananas

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
then i put in a half of frozen bananas

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.190 
then i put in a half of frozen bananas
these<00:02:21.030> are<00:02:21.180> fresh<00:02:21.420> bananas<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.050> i<00:02:22.140> just

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
these are fresh bananas that i just

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.680 
these are fresh bananas that i just
throw<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.130> freezer<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.540> don't

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
throw in the freezer so that you don't

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.540 
throw in the freezer so that you don't
have<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.840> use<00:02:24.990> ice<00:02:25.200> cubes<00:02:25.590> so<00:02:26.010> they're<00:02:26.250> still

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
have to use ice cubes so they're still

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.250 
have to use ice cubes so they're still
kind<00:02:27.030> of<00:02:27.090> pretty<00:02:27.330> much<00:02:27.420> fresh<00:02:27.990> because

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
kind of pretty much fresh because

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.200 
kind of pretty much fresh because
they're<00:02:28.350> really<00:02:28.710> just<00:02:28.740> from<00:02:29.160> this<00:02:29.310> week<00:02:29.610> but

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
they're really just from this week but

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.730 
they're really just from this week but
they're<00:02:30.480> frozen<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.260> we<00:02:31.320> don't<00:02:31.410> have<00:02:31.530> to

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
they're frozen so that we don't have to

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.470 
they're frozen so that we don't have to
use<00:02:31.860> any<00:02:31.890> ice<00:02:32.190> cubes<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:32.970> way<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.180> can

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
use any ice cubes in that way you can

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.690 
use any ice cubes in that way you can
just<00:02:33.510> use<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.380> frozen<00:02:34.980> banana<00:02:35.400> gives<00:02:35.640> a

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
just use this frozen banana gives a

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.190 
just use this frozen banana gives a
little<00:02:35.880> bit<00:02:35.970> of<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.120> sweeter<00:02:36.420> texture<00:02:36.960> it<00:02:37.050> is<00:02:37.170> a

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
little bit of a sweeter texture it is a

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.500 
little bit of a sweeter texture it is a
little<00:02:37.410> bit<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.590> sugar<00:02:37.800> but<00:02:38.490> you<00:02:39.000> know<00:02:39.090> natural

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
little bit of sugar but you know natural

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.400 
little bit of sugar but you know natural
sugar<00:02:40.070> then<00:02:41.070> we<00:02:41.580> use<00:02:41.790> hemp<00:02:42.300> seeds<00:02:42.750> which<00:02:43.230> are

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
sugar then we use hemp seeds which are

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.950 
sugar then we use hemp seeds which are
from<00:02:43.710> nutiva<00:02:44.310> we<00:02:44.790> like<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.210> brand<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.690> most

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
from nutiva we like that brand the most

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.110 
from nutiva we like that brand the most
they're<00:02:46.260> organic<00:02:46.740> and<00:02:47.190> it's<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.490> good<00:02:47.700> company

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
they're organic and it's a good company

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.540 
they're organic and it's a good company
can<00:02:48.660> do<00:02:48.810> about<00:02:49.050> a<00:02:49.110> maybe<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:49.950> half<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.400> tablespoon

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
can do about a maybe a half a tablespoon

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.870 
can do about a maybe a half a tablespoon
of<00:02:51.000> mcd's<00:02:51.510> are<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.720> great<00:02:51.960> source<00:02:52.170> of<00:02:52.410> protein

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
of mcd's are a great source of protein

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.910 
of mcd's are a great source of protein
but<00:02:53.880> also<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.180> good<00:02:54.570> flavor<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.440> gives<00:02:55.620> kind<00:02:55.860> of

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
but also a good flavor it gives kind of

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.410 
but also a good flavor it gives kind of
a<00:02:56.010> nutty<00:02:56.580> rich<00:02:56.970> flavor<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.790> protein

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
a nutty rich flavor to it the protein

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.390 
a nutty rich flavor to it the protein
that<00:03:00.630> i<00:03:00.840> use<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.170> i<00:03:01.470> have<00:03:01.560> tested<00:03:01.800> a<00:03:02.040> lot<00:03:02.070> of

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
that i use and i have tested a lot of

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.280 
that i use and i have tested a lot of
different<00:03:02.700> proteins<00:03:03.090> is<00:03:03.360> this<00:03:03.540> lifetime

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
different proteins is this lifetime

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.130 
different proteins is this lifetime
life's<00:03:04.770> basic<00:03:05.370> plant<00:03:05.850> protein<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.750> the

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
life's basic plant protein and the

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.720 
life's basic plant protein and the
reason<00:03:07.380> i<00:03:07.440> use<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.620> plant<00:03:08.010> protein<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.550> because

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
reason i use a plant protein is because

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.210 
reason i use a plant protein is because
i<00:03:08.850> know<00:03:08.910> it's<00:03:09.180> easy<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.510> digest<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.410> it<00:03:11.040> also

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
i know it's easy to digest and it also

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.950 
i know it's easy to digest and it also
doesn't<00:03:11.670> have<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:11.820> really<00:03:12.210> weird<00:03:12.480> gritty

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
doesn't have a really weird gritty

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.900 
doesn't have a really weird gritty
flavor<00:03:13.380> like<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.710> lot<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.130> rice<00:03:14.340> proteins

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
flavor like a lot of the rice proteins

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.200 
flavor like a lot of the rice proteins
but<00:03:15.480> also<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:16.470> very<00:03:17.010> easy<00:03:17.340> for<00:03:17.670> your<00:03:17.790> body<00:03:17.940> to

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
but also is very easy for your body to

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.350 
but also is very easy for your body to
absorb<00:03:18.330> so<00:03:18.960> do<00:03:19.710> a<00:03:19.770> good<00:03:20.040> full<00:03:20.400> scoop<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:21.090> this

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
absorb so do a good full scoop of this

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.650 
absorb so do a good full scoop of this
plant<00:03:21.750> protein<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:22.740> of<00:03:23.120> course<00:03:24.120> since<00:03:24.420> it's<00:03:24.600> a

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
plant protein and of course since it's a

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.050 
plant protein and of course since it's a
green<00:03:24.960> drink<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.530> helps<00:03:25.860> that<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.160> actually<00:03:26.400> is

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
green drink it helps that it actually is

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.650 
green drink it helps that it actually is
green<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:28.700> then<00:03:29.700> we<00:03:29.790> move<00:03:29.970> into<00:03:30.180> some<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.600> the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
green and then we move into some of the

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.420 
green and then we move into some of the
more<00:03:30.840> specialty<00:03:31.440> ingredients<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:32.100> this<00:03:32.220> is<00:03:32.400> a

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430

and live foods blended together so I

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.730 
and live foods blended together so I
think<00:03:44.100> there's<00:03:44.310> like<00:03:44.400> spirulina<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.740> kelp

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
think there's like spirulina and kelp

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.480 
think there's like spirulina and kelp
and<00:03:47.210> chlorella<00:03:48.210> and<00:03:48.890> gosh<00:03:49.890> there's<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:50.220> much

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
and chlorella and gosh there's so much

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.400 
and chlorella and gosh there's so much
stuff<00:03:50.670> in<00:03:50.970> this<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.360> this<00:03:51.780> is<00:03:51.840> probably<00:03:52.230> the
