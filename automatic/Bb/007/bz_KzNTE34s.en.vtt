everything<00:00:38.760> nice<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:38.969> easy<00:00:39.620> this<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.920> a

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
everything nice and easy this is a

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.889 
everything nice and easy this is a
miniature<00:00:42.420> version<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:44.460> big<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:44.899> it's

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
miniature version of the big one it's

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.500 
miniature version of the big one it's
pretty<00:00:46.469> much<00:00:46.649> exactly<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.610> same<00:00:47.910> except<00:00:48.360> a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
pretty much exactly the same except a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.869 
pretty much exactly the same except a
few<00:00:49.200> extra<00:00:50.780> redstone<00:00:51.780> repeaters<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:53.399> extend

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
few extra redstone repeaters to extend

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.290 
few extra redstone repeaters to extend
the<00:00:54.090> circuits<00:00:57.770> way<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.859> works<00:00:59.090> other<00:01:00.090> mammal

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
the circuits way it works other mammal

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.599 
the circuits way it works other mammal
as<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.600> see<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.840> lights<00:01:01.050> off<00:01:01.609> that's

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
as you can see the lights off that's

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.600 
as you can see the lights off that's
done<00:01:03.180> by<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> simple<00:01:03.870> inverter<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:05.489> you've

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
done by a simple inverter that you've

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.170 
done by a simple inverter that you've
got<00:01:05.790> set<00:01:06.030> up<00:01:06.060> there<00:01:06.530> when<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.650> pay<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.970> money

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
got set up there when you pay the money

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.960 
got set up there when you pay the money
goes<00:01:09.390> through<00:01:10.100> falls<00:01:11.100> into<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.460> little<00:01:11.670> item

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
goes through falls into the little item

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.450 
goes through falls into the little item
under<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.780> activates<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.439> circuit<00:01:13.979> which

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
under it it activates this circuit which

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.090 
under it it activates this circuit which
pushes<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:15.119> block<00:01:15.450> off<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.500> little

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
pushes that block off of a little

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.070 
pushes that block off of a little
redstone<00:01:17.520> torch<00:01:17.820> which<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.869> what's

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
redstone torch which is what's

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.210 
redstone torch which is what's
activating<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.159> circuit<00:01:20.700> which<00:01:21.479> keeps<00:01:22.220> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
activating the circuit which keeps the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.820 
activating the circuit which keeps the
redstone<00:01:23.670> repeaters<00:01:24.150> under<00:01:24.420> there<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:25.049> and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
redstone repeaters under there on and

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.160 
redstone repeaters under there on and
that<00:01:25.950> turns<00:01:26.250> these<00:01:26.670> laptop<00:01:27.210> which<00:01:27.450> stops<00:01:27.840> any

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
that turns these laptop which stops any

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.300 
that turns these laptop which stops any
of<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> buttons<00:01:28.560> are<00:01:28.829> actually<00:01:29.130> doing

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
of the buttons are actually doing

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.160 
of the buttons are actually doing
anything<00:01:29.689> you<00:01:30.689> click<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:30.960> da<00:01:31.829> connections

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
anything you click on da connections

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.580 
anything you click on da connections
seriously<00:01:34.170> just<00:01:34.820> nothing<00:01:36.140> but<00:01:37.140> when<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.380> pay

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
seriously just nothing but when you pay

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.700 
seriously just nothing but when you pay
that<00:01:37.829> moves<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.369> off<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.759> they<00:01:38.939> light<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.710> so

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
that moves it off and they light up so

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.520 
that moves it off and they light up so
that<00:01:40.920> they're<00:01:41.100> ready<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.759> be<00:01:41.850> used<00:01:42.439> the<00:01:43.439> other

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
that they're ready to be used the other

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.039 
that they're ready to be used the other
circuit<00:01:44.040> also<00:01:44.250> starts<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.659> one<00:01:45.869> over

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
circuit also starts is this one over

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.340 
circuit also starts is this one over
here<00:01:46.340> which<00:01:47.340> pushes<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.939> block<00:01:48.240> onto<00:01:48.570> that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
here which pushes that block onto that

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.050 
here which pushes that block onto that
one<00:01:49.850> which<00:01:50.850> turns<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:52.020> little<00:01:52.229> light<00:01:52.320> on

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
one which turns this little light on

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.649 
one which turns this little light on
I'll<00:01:54.060> show<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.479> now

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
I'll show you that now

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.980 
I'll show you that now
they<00:01:57.259> both<00:01:57.469> move<00:01:57.740> light<00:01:58.310> comes<00:01:58.579> on<00:01:58.990> and

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
they both move light comes on and

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.260 
they both move light comes on and
they're<00:02:00.109> all<00:02:00.229> ready<00:02:00.259> to<00:02:00.469> be<00:02:00.590> good<00:02:00.770> used<00:02:01.270> when

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
they're all ready to be good used when

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.539 
they're all ready to be good used when
you<00:02:02.359> push<00:02:02.600> one<00:02:02.780> of<00:02:02.869> these<00:02:03.069> the<00:02:04.069> block<00:02:04.310> gets

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
you push one of these the block gets

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.700 
you push one of these the block gets
pushed<00:02:04.819> onto<00:02:05.119> one<00:02:05.960> of<00:02:06.049> these<00:02:06.170> redstone
