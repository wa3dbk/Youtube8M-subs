 brkic l3 from we are going to do a diy 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.630
 because we are going my longboard 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.609
 from this to pimping this 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.520
 we don't do this around then she has to 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.480
 by copying and we now get more 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.029
 views and so on 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.170
 then we must start this board 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.019
 pimp 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.579
 to we are of course super through my 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.059
 know have no inspiration 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.739
 yes so on instagram we ask how 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.329
 otherwise it is best to pimp 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.129
 admit 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.989
 this can no longer be the way we have 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.700
 so made this photo and now we have to 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.940
 just a nice description we put 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.590
 it happened guys we have the photo 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.070
 posted and we are going now to you 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.739
 youtube to yes this is by the way that 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.329
 we shit our stuff on a plate 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.329
 to get some kind of good no matter what 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.390
 we went to your voice to the 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.970
 to go skate shop and where did we end up 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.860
 in the or you with the cheese sandwich and me 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.240
 I have business closer to us 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.979
 such a sound then say a sled because they 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.190
 so from the the one had to buy from the 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.380
 but we continue to buy this work and 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.250
 may sat all things in the paper again 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.630
 basket 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.330
 about half of one that is true 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.549
 stickers so we go to the plate can the 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.070
 paste and above that as we 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.750
 of the box is now just something again 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.149
 moored 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.729
 I'm going to buy this I've had I had 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.770
 found the vehicle and even more 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.060
 vehicles and dolphins 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.060
 you gotta go 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.340
 ok it is next because yesterday 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.930
 allowing the hatch to go even further 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.940
 the first thing to do now is the 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.070
 tricks loosens then there is oil and 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.450
 screwdriver then we go first 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.360
 loosen a screw that speak 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.990
 about ourselves and then we get a grip on it 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.690
 get it 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.250
 the still we are going to sand and this sanding and 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.800
 then the stickers come from bass and then 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.640
 push ok so what is that key of 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.540
 pans 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:24.240
 no a bio-rad two weeks and then press 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:27.780
 does it also prevent you from giving him a minute 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:32.250
 your answer is fucking they are 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.400
 been working on this board for 5 years with 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.400
 really a specific order up we have 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:43.800
 three options and also a piece of tape 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:48.440
 do that with a drill the household effects 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.440
 you further one can at six or seven or 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.160

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.030
 they are busy searching for the solution 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.030
 I have the real solution for you 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:11.050

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:13.239
 carry the luck then yes it is successful 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.220
 finally we go now in the glue that 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.730
 under the round is forest makes it so right 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.300

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.300
 double pull 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.319

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:48.190

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:49.690
 finally the sanding is done i'm there 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.370
 actually quite happy with this moment 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.360

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.770
 their best 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.120
 what we are going to do now is that we have to go here 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.680
 make you orange so we can 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.860
 clearly know when you should have 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.860
 with it 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:15.050
 after themselves so people now get per day 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.900
 you are now you do not know what its purpose 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.670
 I already had a layer of varnish 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.019
 done the distance and I now the second 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.650
 do it low but turn it incredibly hot 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.030
 weather 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.730
 you can actually just get one that 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.330
 keeps going and how does it get by itself 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.330
 thicker 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.670
 the 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.770

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.820
 just do the turkish round after one 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.380
 near-accident 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.430
