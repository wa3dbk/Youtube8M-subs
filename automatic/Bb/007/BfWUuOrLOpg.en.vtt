 production company spring 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.189
 represents polystyrene concrete products from 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.450
 him 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.690
 polystyrene concrete is effective 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.440
 building insulation material 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.060
 which refers to particularly lightweight concrete 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.199
 polystyrene concrete is known in our market 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.550
 not less than 25 years she is western more than 60 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.519
 years old 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.099
 invention made by both companies since 1951 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.679
 year polystyrene concrete 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.140
 material that combines great 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.809
 construction properties and properties 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.579
 insulation based on polystyrene concrete 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.910
 polystyrene foam lies 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.110
 which will provide high performance 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.739
 keeping warm and not afraid of water and steam 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.890
 polystyrene concrete steam and 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.550
 air permeability and chen and possess 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.210
 lowered 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.890
 sorption humidity polystyrene concrete 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.949
 fireproof has a hand of combustibility 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.539
 we eat almost no orici stuff not 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.030
 keeps burning 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.129
 no smoke formation drops 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.619
 due to high rates of 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.350
 frost resistance permeability 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.030
 chemical biological resistance he on 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.820
 order head whose others 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.140
 thermal insulation materials 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.799
 polystyrene concrete is very technological 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.200
 Excellent sawn driver piece rabitz having 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.939
 low volumetric weight is sufficient 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.100
 strength compared to other 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.659
 of the material 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.030
 polystyrene concrete is not nutritious 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.030
 medium for microorganisms and fungi 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.869
 it is not subject to decay ecologically 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.360
 is safe 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.520
 the main qualities of polystyrene concrete 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.540
 is its low thermal conductivity and 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.940
 high frost resistance more than 100 cycles 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.490
 making it almost indispensable 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.650
 material for both cottage and 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.420
 monolithic construction with more 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.520
 wide range of applications and 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.500
 much better characteristics 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.910
 polystyrene concrete became serious 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.940
 alternative to foam concrete and aerated concrete 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.950
 manufacturing firm spring based 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.500
 patented manufacturing method 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.179
 environmentally friendly polystyrene concrete 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.850
 developed a building construction system 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.460
 using polystyrene concrete fixed 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.620
 block formwork this product is intended 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.080
 be permanent formwork 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.720
 to form a supporting structure 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.120
 buildings and at the same time be 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.400
 insulation fixed block formwork 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.680
 is a polystyrene concrete 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.340

 This unit has horizontal and 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.080
 vertical samples internal under 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.840
 pouring concrete to form bearing 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.580
 building construction and exterior backfill 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.370
 in the process of building a wall 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.060
 insulation further 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.760
 polystyrene concrete not removable block 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.820
 formwork will be called block formwork 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.600
 the size of the tent block is selected based on 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.549
 the following parameters the first weight is 18-20 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.360
 kilogram second calculated value 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:07.640
 heat transfer resistance 382 at 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.580
 standard 2 and 8 3 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.280
 optimum size molded by concrete 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.650
 supporting building structure allowing 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.110
 when applying various grades of concrete and 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.170
 fittings have a raised floor and 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.530
 fourth combination with floor slabs 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.530
