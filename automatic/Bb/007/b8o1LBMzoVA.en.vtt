 little over a cellar and liquor 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.200
 wood that belonged to an old tool I 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:20.729

 oak favor with this product it is 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.590
 that there is no need for reims and the 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.359
 piece that were treated enough 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.780
 only to wipe it off a cloth 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:15.540
 clean 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.160

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.820
 woods that come from the same round so 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:13.810
