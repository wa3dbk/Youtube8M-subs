00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.940
 great guys at the zuber microphone and 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.020
 today express review 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.340
 talking about prototype bmpt terminator 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.860
 located cars on the sixth camp in 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.560
 class bbm and available to owners 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.619
 People's dam is a hybrid 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.420
 between experience and bbm kai from experience with us 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.970
 cast-iron impenetrable brow body 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:41.170
 it almost does not take sevens and eights and 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:43.750
 tank side thickness about 270 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.400
 millimeters given ki and 5 6 lvl 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.430
 very bad there punches even under 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.250
 right angles turret g is given q 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.019
 only about 120 millimeters so she 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.300
 no problem breaks into the seed 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.269
 with automatic guns but with half 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.129
 damage since the module is uninhabited any 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.360
 autoguns are extremely bad almost not 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.449
 punch this turret 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.210
 so careful scare to review too 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.010
 about the standard for bb 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.350
 425 meters plus 40 meters from the battle 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.280
 module that is, it turns on then when 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.390
 you stand still 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.760
 stealth in 20 100 is quite suitable 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.730
 mobility is mediocre for bbm 5.7 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.250
 seconds before the cutoff is not enough 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.810
 to twist experiences on the other hand 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.150
 just great maneuverability and 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.830
 body rotation speed also with 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.580
 moving on the map of problems you have not 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.980
 will arise 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.680
 the car will be quite 40 50 and sometimes even 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.420
 60 kilometers per hour 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.950
 armament is very flexible rapid-fire 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.800
 thirty breakdown 120 millimeters 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.890
 punishing any classes other than experience and 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.530
 vfm 5 + punches a btv board and feed 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.850
 due to high rate of fire and capacity 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.490
 40 round cassettes 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.730
 thirty prototype fine nastraivaet 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.150
 in the forehead vt mine bombs also our protei 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.670
 there is a cassette of ptuur 4 things in between 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.340
 2 seconds launches four missiles 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.370
 we throw as much as 1700 1800 damage 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.110
 but there is one nuance missile launch tubes 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.959
 rigidly fixed and look strictly 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.110
 forward don't lose the rocket and behind the terrain 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:16.060
 and I also want to draw your attention to 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.550
 that the prototype has an automatic loader 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.170
 you canâ€™t reduce recharge 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.560
 perks or consumables 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.550
 and let's get down to tactics too nightmarish prototype 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.760
 sleep any bmt 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.930
 tank destroyer or light tank 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.540
 high body armor and 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.000
 50 percent damage on the turret allows 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.319
 dominate data classes bbm 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.850
 almost nothing can 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.950
 counter portable 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.880
 trying them enough for sure 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.310
 bmpt lesions only in feed and tlt 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.739
 excellent punch against turret but damage 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.650
 then half and in return they get 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.170
 2000 damage damage cassette 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.440
 eight seconds and here are the dogs at the prototype 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.870
 problems in the forehead he does not punch about this 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.850
 bourget most punches but with frequent 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.890
 not spaces so you can 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.830
 use land mines because 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.739
 Soon beautiful arrows and damage fss 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.080
 cassette deals put about 600 800 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:15.069
 damage when shooting away places 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:19.090
 roof turret com turret side sights 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:21.519
 or karma and ptuers are pretty specific and 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.860
 situational fit for shooting 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.769
 because of the cover on the enemy in the open 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.130
 terrain with duels one on one or 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:31.600
 when firing at an abstract enemy 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.970
 getting to the top just fine yourself 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.579
 it feels a lot who does not break it 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.040
 tenacious he himself can easily push 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:42.120
 all but a b d and lo , you have to be 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.900
 more careful than a land mine not or ptu rime and 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.120
 seventh eighth leveled 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.130
 with them a prototype support machine in 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.920
 mostly hiding in the shelter in behind 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.829
 comrades and fugue sing touring however 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.980
 against and tlt and pvn it is quite possible 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.080
 to wrestle with 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.940
 this is all a quick review for you 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.040
 prepared zuber thank you for your attention and 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.519
 come be sure to come again 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.519
 interesting
