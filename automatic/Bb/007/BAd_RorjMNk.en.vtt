00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
against something which is the pin and

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.590 
against something which is the pin and
then<00:02:11.220> give<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.610> little<00:02:11.700> tug<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.239> hear<00:02:12.510> it

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
then give it a little tug you hear it

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
snap a little bit

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.440 
snap a little bit
slide<00:02:14.819> it<00:02:14.940> back<00:02:16.040> find<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.190> next<00:02:17.370> pin<00:02:17.670> give<00:02:18.360> it

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
slide it back find the next pin give it

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.260 
slide it back find the next pin give it
a<00:02:18.510> tug<00:02:18.750> find<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.440> next<00:02:19.650> pin

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
a tug find the next pin

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.070 
a tug find the next pin
give<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.720> tug<00:02:22.760> okay<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.060> see<00:02:24.270> this<00:02:24.600> act<00:02:24.870> is

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
give it a tug okay and see this act is

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.510 
give it a tug okay and see this act is
actually<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.470> first<00:02:25.620> time<00:02:25.830> this<00:02:26.040> panel<00:02:26.370> never

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
actually the first time this panel never

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.700 
actually the first time this panel never
been<00:02:26.640> off<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.060> does<00:02:27.210> take<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.140> little<00:02:28.380> bit<00:02:28.500> of

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
been off so it does take a little bit of

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.070 
been off so it does take a little bit of
work

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
work

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.780 
work
the<00:02:31.200> force

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
the force

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.699 
the force
slide<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.830> knife<00:02:34.830> for<00:02:35.129> tool<00:02:35.700> up<00:02:35.849> again

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
slide the knife for tool up again

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.170 
slide the knife for tool up again
against<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:37.769> pin<00:02:38.780> good<00:02:39.780> tug<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.670> eventually

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
against the pin good tug and eventually

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.220 
against the pin good tug and eventually
you<00:02:42.299> can<00:02:42.450> kind<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.780> work<00:02:42.930> your<00:02:43.079> fingers

the inside of the door handle and the
other<00:04:38.740> hand<00:04:39.210> obviously<00:04:40.210> kind<00:04:40.420> of<00:04:40.570> pulling<00:04:40.870> it

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
other hand obviously kind of pulling it

other hand obviously kind of pulling it
out<00:04:41.140> and<00:04:41.470> then<00:04:41.980> it<00:04:42.070> should<00:04:42.250> just<00:04:42.370> pull<00:04:42.640> right

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670

up and out okay and for the new handle
obviously<00:04:47.170> this<00:04:47.290> card<00:04:47.470> doesn't<00:04:47.650> need<00:04:47.890> a<00:04:47.920> new

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
obviously this card doesn't need a new

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.070 
obviously this card doesn't need a new
handle<00:04:48.460> but<00:04:48.610> you<00:04:48.700> would<00:04:48.820> just<00:04:49.000> swap<00:04:49.480> this<00:04:49.720> lock

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
handle but you would just swap this lock

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.980 
handle but you would just swap this lock
rod<00:04:50.380> onto<00:04:50.940> your<00:04:51.940> new<00:04:52.360> handle<00:04:54.750> make<00:04:55.750> sure<00:04:55.900> it

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
rod onto your new handle make sure it

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.080 
rod onto your new handle make sure it
has<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.110> locking<00:04:56.560> clip<00:04:56.820> handles<00:04:57.820> from<00:04:57.880> 1a

has the locking clip handles from 1a
auto<00:04:58.270> will<00:04:58.600> be<00:04:58.720> black<00:04:59.020> you<00:04:59.680> can<00:04:59.830> paint<00:05:00.130> them<00:05:00.280> to

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
auto will be black you can paint them to

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.700 
auto will be black you can paint them to
match<00:05:00.700> but<00:05:01.150> yourself

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
match but yourself

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.050 
match but yourself
best<00:05:03.160> way<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.340> do<00:05:03.430> that<00:05:03.550> is<00:05:03.670> to<00:05:03.760> go<00:05:03.850> to<00:05:03.910> an

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
best way to do that is to go to an

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.520 
best way to do that is to go to an
automotive<00:05:04.300> paint<00:05:04.630> store<00:05:04.900> and<00:05:05.110> they<00:05:05.380> can

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
automotive paint store and they can

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.980 
automotive paint store and they can
probably<00:05:05.680> match<00:05:05.980> with<00:05:06.670> your<00:05:06.820> paint<00:05:07.030> code<00:05:07.210> put

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
probably match with your paint code put

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.020 
probably match with your paint code put
it<00:05:08.080> back<00:05:08.230> in<00:05:08.520> install<00:05:09.520> it<00:05:09.610> into<00:05:09.730> the<00:05:09.820> door<00:05:10.000> and

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
it back in install it into the door and

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.440 
it back in install it into the door and
push<00:05:10.950> okay<00:05:11.950> I<00:05:11.980> find<00:05:12.370> it<00:05:12.460> easiest<00:05:12.760> to<00:05:12.970> take<00:05:13.240> the

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
push okay I find it easiest to take the

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.990 
push okay I find it easiest to take the
first<00:05:13.720> the<00:05:14.620> one<00:05:14.740> that's<00:05:14.920> closest<00:05:15.370> to<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.790> big

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
first the one that's closest to the big

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.160 
first the one that's closest to the big
hole<00:05:16.210> where<00:05:16.330> you<00:05:16.390> can<00:05:16.480> hit<00:05:16.600> here<00:05:16.720> fit<00:05:17.050> your

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
hole where you can hit here fit your

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.680 
hole where you can hit here fit your
hand<00:05:17.470> and<00:05:17.710> just<00:05:18.520> start<00:05:18.730> that<00:05:18.940> one<00:05:19.060> by<00:05:19.210> hand

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.260 

okay<00:05:22.690> so<00:05:22.750> after<00:05:23.050> starting<00:05:23.440> that<00:05:23.590> one<00:05:24.270> then

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
the door panel has two locating pins the

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.270 
the door panel has two locating pins the
green<00:06:08.660> pins<00:06:08.990> they're<00:06:09.470> longer<00:06:09.860> than<00:06:10.100> the<00:06:10.160> other

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 
green pins they're longer than the other

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.720 
green pins they're longer than the other
ones

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:10.730 
ones

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.120 
ones
so<00:06:11.330> you<00:06:11.450> just<00:06:11.750> locate<00:06:12.020> them<00:06:12.440> get<00:06:12.680> them<00:06:12.800> into

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
so you just locate them get them into

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.260 
so you just locate them get them into
the<00:06:13.250> correct<00:06:13.610> hole<00:06:14.230> first<00:06:15.850> see<00:06:16.850> there<00:06:16.970> I<00:06:17.000> do<00:06:17.120> in

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
the correct hole first see there I do in

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.450 
the correct hole first see there I do in
that<00:06:17.390> in<00:06:17.480> the<00:06:17.540> front<00:06:17.870> and<00:06:18.050> then<00:06:18.590> the<00:06:18.740> rear<00:06:18.980> same
