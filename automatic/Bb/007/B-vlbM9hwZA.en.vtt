00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
elders on a random round so basically

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.150 
elders on a random round so basically
this<00:00:39.239> thing<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.809> rocket<00:00:40.590> launcher<00:00:40.950> so<00:00:41.100> to

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
this thing is a rocket launcher so to

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.250 
this thing is a rocket launcher so to
say<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.700> around<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.239> 10<00:00:42.480> or<00:00:42.690> 12<00:00:42.719> shots

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
and each shot is basically equivalent to

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.010 
and each shot is basically equivalent to
like<00:00:46.050> 20<00:00:46.320> gallons<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.460> one<00:00:48.000> hits<00:00:48.270> most<00:00:48.660> stuff
