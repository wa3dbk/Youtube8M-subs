00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349

squat<00:02:19.120> recently<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.209> kind<00:02:20.420> of<00:02:20.450> figured<00:02:20.720> out

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
squat recently I kind of figured out

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.890 
squat recently I kind of figured out
that<00:02:20.840> having<00:02:21.349> it<00:02:21.440> weren't<00:02:21.800> close<00:02:22.160> so<00:02:22.489> a<00:02:22.520> closer

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
that having it weren't close so a closer

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.170 
that having it weren't close so a closer
foot<00:02:23.900> position<00:02:24.230> is<00:02:24.410> helping<00:02:24.680> me<00:02:24.800> keep<00:02:25.010> my<00:02:25.280> not

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
foot position is helping me keep my not

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.580 
foot position is helping me keep my not
hips<00:02:26.420> aligning<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:26.900> my<00:02:26.959> hips<00:02:27.140> are<00:02:27.290> on<00:02:27.349> the<00:02:27.440> line

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
hips aligning so my hips are on the line

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.869 
hips aligning so my hips are on the line
right<00:02:27.620> now<00:02:27.800> am<00:02:28.069> i<00:02:28.160> right<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.520> was<00:02:28.670> about<00:02:28.819> an

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
right now am i right it was about an

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.010 
right now am i right it was about an
inch<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.209> half<00:02:29.270> higher<00:02:29.569> than<00:02:29.720> my<00:02:29.810> left

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
inch and a half higher than my left

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.330 
inch and a half higher than my left
which<00:02:30.260> is<00:02:30.379> there<00:02:30.530> for<00:02:30.739> my<00:02:30.860> right<00:02:31.010> foot<00:02:31.250> it's

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
which is there for my right foot it's

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.369 
which is there for my right foot it's
always<00:02:31.580> forward<00:02:31.819> but<00:02:32.390> it's<00:02:32.629> helping<00:02:32.989> me<00:02:33.110> stay

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
always forward but it's helping me stay

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.110 
always forward but it's helping me stay
more<00:02:33.620> balanced<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.340> I'm<00:02:34.760> really<00:02:34.970> enjoying

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
more balanced and I'm really enjoying

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.729 
more balanced and I'm really enjoying
the<00:02:35.510> more<00:02:35.660> narrow<00:02:35.870> stance<00:02:36.260> as<00:02:36.440> opposed<00:02:36.680> to

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
the more narrow stance as opposed to

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.430 
the more narrow stance as opposed to
wider<00:02:37.040> so<00:02:38.000> it's<00:02:38.300> still<00:02:38.510> adjusting<00:02:38.870> there<00:02:39.080> but

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
wider so it's still adjusting there but

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.650 
wider so it's still adjusting there but
there<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.459> can<00:02:40.580> see<00:02:40.760> getting<00:02:41.060> proper<00:02:41.480> depth

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
there you can see getting proper depth

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.839 
there you can see getting proper depth
and<00:02:41.840> everything<00:02:42.140> just<00:02:42.530> trying<00:02:42.770> to<00:02:42.830> focus<00:02:43.220> next

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
and everything just trying to focus next

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.100 
and everything just trying to focus next
time<00:02:44.060> now<00:02:44.209> that<00:02:44.360> I'm<00:02:44.420> seeing<00:02:44.629> this<00:02:44.690> but<00:02:44.870> I<00:02:44.900> just

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
time now that I'm seeing this but I just

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.839 
time now that I'm seeing this but I just
keep<00:02:45.290> my<00:02:45.500> elbows<00:02:45.770> tucked<00:02:46.010> in<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:46.640> they're<00:02:46.760> not

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
keep my elbows tucked in so they're not

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.420 
keep my elbows tucked in so they're not
flaring<00:02:47.180> out<00:02:47.420> but<00:02:47.959> like<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.620> said<00:02:48.800> three<00:02:48.980> total

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
flaring out but like I said three total

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.490 
flaring out but like I said three total
working<00:02:49.700> sets<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.239> I<00:02:50.690> got<00:02:50.870> three<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.290> four

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
working sets and I got three to four

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.259 
working sets and I got three to four
reps<00:02:51.709> on<00:02:51.950> every<00:02:52.310> set<00:02:52.520> so<00:02:52.670> I'm<00:02:52.760> very<00:02:52.849> happy<00:02:53.060> with

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
reps on every set so I'm very happy with

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.000 
reps on every set so I'm very happy with
that<00:02:53.450> I<00:02:53.480> haven't<00:02:53.810> put<00:02:53.989> 315<00:02:54.470> on<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.680> bar<00:02:54.860> in<00:02:54.950> a

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
that I haven't put 315 on the bar in a

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.309 
that I haven't put 315 on the bar in a
very<00:02:55.160> long<00:02:55.310> time<00:02:55.550> I've<00:02:56.209> been<00:02:56.330> working<00:02:56.629> on<00:02:56.690> 5x5

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
very long time I've been working on 5x5

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.410 
very long time I've been working on 5x5
and<00:02:57.620> I've<00:02:57.769> kind<00:02:57.980> of<00:02:58.069> been<00:02:58.190> stuck<00:02:58.430> around<00:02:58.580> to<00:02:58.879> 92

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
and I've kind of been stuck around to 92

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.619 
and I've kind of been stuck around to 92
to<00:02:59.569> 95<00:02:59.989> on<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.129> 5x5<00:03:01.310> with<00:03:01.849> really<00:03:02.150> clean<00:03:02.360> form

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
to 95 on the 5x5 with really clean form

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.690 
to 95 on the 5x5 with really clean form
obviously<00:03:02.840> not<00:03:03.319> you<00:03:03.500> know<00:03:03.620> rounding<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.550> back

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
obviously not you know rounding the back

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.610 
obviously not you know rounding the back
and<00:03:05.000> grinding<00:03:05.420> them<00:03:05.540> up<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:05.930> leaning<00:03:06.470> forward

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
and grinding them up and leaning forward

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.230 
and grinding them up and leaning forward
so<00:03:07.040> try<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.280> perfect<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:07.670> form<00:03:07.910> before<00:03:08.060> I

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
so try and perfect the form before I

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.050 
so try and perfect the form before I
move<00:03:08.420> up<00:03:08.570> in<00:03:08.690> weight

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
move up in weight

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.610 
move up in weight

and I've kind of been stuck around that

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.520 
and I've kind of been stuck around that

up<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.080> diet<00:03:22.349> dropping<00:03:22.890> some<00:03:23.069> water<00:03:23.280> weight

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
up the diet dropping some water weight

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.870 
up the diet dropping some water weight
so<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:23.790> went<00:03:24.000> from<00:03:24.090> about<00:03:24.209> 177<00:03:25.020> to<00:03:25.349> about<00:03:26.190> 172

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
so I went from about 177 to about 172

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.729 
so I went from about 177 to about 172
which<00:03:27.810> is<00:03:27.930> where<00:03:28.080> I'm<00:03:28.200> at<00:03:28.349> right<00:03:28.380> now<00:03:28.560> so

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
which is where I'm at right now so

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.410 
which is where I'm at right now so
fluctuating<00:03:29.730> between<00:03:30.110> 171<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.140> 173<00:03:32.069> 174

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
fluctuating between 171 to 173 174
