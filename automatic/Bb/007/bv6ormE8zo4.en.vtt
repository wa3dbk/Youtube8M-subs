00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 and well hi friends is that the most 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.160
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.839
 new video on was 14 well 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.760
 obviously guys so I always 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.260
 not recovered my pc unfortunately for 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.280
 those who might ask if you 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.139
 need credit go guys 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.269
 in the description on the site fifa 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.520
 credit used copy code for at 5% 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.140
 reduction is 100% reliable and it's 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.189
 deliver very quickly so the lega in 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.270
 bottom you are going to have a little point 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.439
 chips nîmes that I made with the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.670
 25 credit packs 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.990
 So I thought 'why poor 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.150
 Easter since there are players 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.699
 transferred the players the price of 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.869
 basic players according ronaldo hip hop that 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.399
 greatly increased I had made a 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.989
 special video on so that's it 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.550
 why not try to pick up heavy 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.739
 even though we know we are not 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.780
 very used at the moment has stalled the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.920
 very very heavy we will try in 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.750
 anyway I know the outcome of this 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.640
 pack opening maybe who will have heavy 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.809
 we do not know we have to stay until the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.129
 end not very long 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.780
 so here are the guys i'm just going to do 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.870
 this video to announce that my 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.760
 pc will be back soon and I wanted 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.829
 place an ad there are a lot of 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.690
 people who ask me if I have to 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.920
 if I can make a wager with such 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.600
 and such with such or such 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.370
 so I do not answer necessarily 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.820
 simply because in fact wager them in 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.589
 does a 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.580
 when I feel like it, ie 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.320
 that I will post an ad on 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.619
 twitter by munger and those who want 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.080
 to play 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.909
 they play directly on thanks to this 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.140
 little advance thanks to this tweet 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.310
 and for those who do not have guardian who 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.920
 are going to ask the question are you creating a 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.540
 account it's free it's 100% fast 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.299
 it's free there's no problem 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.960
 make a little twitter account here and 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.220
 for all that is fake young in carnac 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.840
 so I do not jarnac you know I 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.890
 I'm not a jester like that I want 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.500
 something else to do 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.450
 but there are some who arrive at 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.180
 to get fake two months so at na na 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.490
 I do not know 12:50 on the closed nokia psn 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.000
 peebles with a capital i instead 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.220
 of the iliac lopy boys wager ya club 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.990
 boys so be careful there's no messy 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.250
 beware all this is subscribers 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.810
 who send me pictures of messages 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.040
 so I warn I'm trying to 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.530
 prevent as many people as possible 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.240
 that the least people will be 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.649
 have to have because the guy has already 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.299
 pocketed more than 5 million credits 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.250
 the one called coopi boys with the 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.690
 little pitch is she so the 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.550
 i uppercase in place of the little one she 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.260
 so frankly so much better for 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.090
 him he found an idea me I criticize 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.500
 not he is full of credit so much better 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.700
 for him he found the idea but that's it 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.990
 I think it's a bit of theft and that 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.790
 is not done vis-à-vis subscribers because 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.780
 that there I respect you guys and 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.520
 I think everyone can get 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.050
 respect and here we are obliged to create 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.970
 this kind of community and do 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.250
 be careful because there is actually no 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.740
 has not or the Thai effect fake punchs x 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.360
 effect fake a friend of mine certainly hd he 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.970
 made a name that will be made 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.800
 builds a cafe a faye of him beware 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.140
 you guys youtuber them in general 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.340
 do not have people except that's it's 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.750
 certain but that's it if you come on 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.030
 youtube to rip people off it's used to 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.020
 nothing finally that's what I 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.370
 just think 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.770
 after I think you think the same 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.480
 thing otherwise it's too bad but that's it 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.250
 I think that must be done very 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.739
 watch out guys if I do not post a 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.360
 announcement on twitter and a 10 years or 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.890
 Elsewhere, it's not the 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.350
 worth giving credit to a guy on 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.890
 the psn i never ask for credit on 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.050
 the psn everything happens on twitter in the 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.739
 private messaging on twitter and null 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.060
 go elsewhere 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.010
 there is only me who can you 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.900
 contact there is no scam there 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.010
 do not jarnac people once 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.299
 that they came the credits and the 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.280
 delete page not like that I always 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.420
 played the matches even though I lost I 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.860
 accepted defeat etc 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.180
 we are here to play the guys we are 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.350
 not there to take the lead it's 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.610
 a pity that there is something going on 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.900
 because there is one there we have 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.400
 asked for 2 million he gave him two 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.110
 million never of life I you 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.180
 would ask 2 million on the ps n ya 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.489
 no written record the guys and these 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.500
 times one must be naïve 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.030
 like that guys vis-à-vis others 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.769

 you insult no I respect you the 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.260
 guys but frankly there are limits 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.920
 still need to think before 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.560
 give credits 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.610
 there it is going to give 4 million 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.110
 like that by snapping fingers at 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.549
 welcomed there is and galley to have 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.140
 credits and they are stolen 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.459
 unfortunately so there are some who 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.560
 come to complain at home I get 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.940
 a lot of complaint messages from 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.739
 insult even there are some who come 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.970
 to insult me ​​imeem deals here I go 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.890
 not give an example but really 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.750
 insults on the psn but on twitter 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.549
 also and even in my videos 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.799
 Ooyonnax the day ago, he harassed me 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.360
 for sixty thousand credit saying 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.950
 I had taken the team to 60,000 credit 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.140
 I had never given it back but then not 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.370
 at all I do not need to have 60000 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.019
 additional credits I already have 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.370
 enough credits I have 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.319
 far enough I'm not going to steal you 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.760
 guys I'm not like that otherwise it 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.150
 would have been a long time since I saw you on 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.950
 youtube otherwise there 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.390
 to be useless pay attention guys 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.439
 beware factually it 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.120
 it was a great message that I wanted 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.410
 pass and a second small 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.579
 message that I wanted to pass on 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.570
 also there are a lot of people 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.520
 who ask me why you talked 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.630
 aps case why did you talk xbox one 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.160
 it's when you buy a new 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.690
 console because there we are tired of 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.639
 the interface of nexes what's called 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.600
 hudgens 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:36.320
 finally the old favorite consoles 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.900
 xbox 3 6 and ps3 so here I have like 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.820
 expect to buy the xbox one it's going 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.530
 to arrive very soon 15 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.910
 in my opinion in any case I will hold you 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.310
 aware in the videos I you 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.080
 would keep abreast of the coming of my 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.430
 pc I hope it will be repaired very quickly 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.930
 in any case I hope that this little 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.669
 video will have pleased you with some 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.990
 skeptical explanations think about sleuthing 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.610
 and it's always a pleasure 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.199
 guys do not have us by the 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.030
 fake me I say very soon a century 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:01.150
 then take care of yourself by all the 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.150
 world
