00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
I'm going to demonstrate two words that

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.080 
I'm going to demonstrate two words that
we<00:00:07.259> use<00:00:07.500> quite<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:08.010> lot<00:00:08.340> in<00:00:08.639> our<00:00:08.760> everyday

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
we use quite a lot in our everyday

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.640 
we use quite a lot in our everyday
language<00:00:09.950> the<00:00:10.950> first<00:00:11.190> word<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:13.130> continuous

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
language the first word is continuous

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:25.779 
language the first word is continuous
continuous<00:00:18.800> the<00:00:19.800> second<00:00:20.310> word<00:00:21.260> is<00:00:22.910> continual

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
continuous the second word is continual

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:34.670 
continuous the second word is continual
continual<00:00:29.179> so<00:00:30.230> if<00:00:31.230> we<00:00:31.769> turn<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.700> tap<00:00:33.680> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
continual so if we turn on a tap the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.200 
continual so if we turn on a tap the
water<00:00:35.010> will<00:00:35.969> flow<00:00:36.440> in<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.700> continuous<00:00:38.700> stream

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
water will flow in a continuous stream

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.020 
water will flow in a continuous stream
continuous<00:00:42.500> it<00:00:43.500> will<00:00:44.100> not<00:00:44.309> stop<00:00:46.370> if<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.430> turn

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
continuous it will not stop if we turn

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.540 
continuous it will not stop if we turn
off<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.960> tap<00:00:49.579> the<00:00:50.579> water<00:00:50.850> will<00:00:51.239> stop<00:00:52.309> but<00:00:53.309> it

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
off the tap the water will stop but it

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.689 
off the tap the water will stop but it
me<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.670> stop<00:00:56.809> and<00:00:57.809> drip

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
me to it and stop and drip

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.820 
me to it and stop and drip
and<00:01:00.000> stop<00:01:01.100> now<00:01:02.100> that's<00:01:02.609> what<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.179> call

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
and stop now that's what we call

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.630 
and stop now that's what we call
continual<00:01:06.259> so<00:01:07.259> an<00:01:07.560> example<00:01:08.630> might<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.659> that

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
continual so an example might be that

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.859 
continual so an example might be that
you<00:01:11.640> say<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.880> me<00:01:12.119> evil
