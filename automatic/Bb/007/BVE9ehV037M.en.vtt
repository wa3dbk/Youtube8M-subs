00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:06.759
 also this video is to explain them 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.190
 very good for 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.250
 to let them know that the entire course 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.760
 of we can already several several people 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.760
 have bought 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.419
 this is already available 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.179
 well either for people who have 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:29.859
 an accordion of sun or peace or of me 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.859
 because then I the first videos 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:36.559
 I do not have another cord for once the 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.980
 only I have now but I did 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.699
 some arrangements and it may sound like a 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.350
 like a fake accordion here they are 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:49.370
 now he also says the videos equal but 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:53.409
 he tells them like for a column and now 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.409
 I can and make it sound like one of fa 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.840
 real 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.670
 like a sun accordion 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.630
 the videos of which it changes tone 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.540
 because the truth is a lot of battle 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.330
 but in the most important because they are more 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.700
 scales if I explained everything as it is 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.880
 for each chord to the others of the 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.340
 chords is the same I left it with my support 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.310
 from me 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.259
 this but before each decade video 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.630
 comes the explanation of what is coming 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.630
 being on a good fa accordion not for 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.170
 where they are for the seven great themselves 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.170
 it's going to be the same 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.730
 and some time then I'm going to upload the 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.160
 videos already for each chord but because 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.790
 now here if a lot can for me just 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.140
 I have an accordion and is fine ie 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.440
 I remind you that it has the name of 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.590
 buttons major chords minor chords 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.959
 seventh which are the preparations of 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.020
 the scales in other simple third 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.390
 and sixth in the theory of how to deduce the 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.030
 the one of all the agreements also comes 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.650
 how to deduce chords as deducted 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.290
 first second intentions of each 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.980
 tone with its preparation comes scale 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.530
 chromatic and therefore 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.810
 there are also tips to transport 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.170
 songs from one tone to another impossible 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.740
 to encourage themselves, it costs 250 pesos 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.740
