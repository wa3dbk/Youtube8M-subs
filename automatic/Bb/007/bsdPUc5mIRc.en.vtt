00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
gradually go right to left you can

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.090 
gradually go right to left you can
either<00:00:35.940> use<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.210> flathead<00:00:36.660> screwdriver<00:00:37.230> for

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
either use a flathead screwdriver for

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.950 
either use a flathead screwdriver for
this<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> really<00:00:38.520> small<00:00:38.730> one<00:00:38.940> or<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.450> prefer<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
this a really small one or I prefer to

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.500 
this a really small one or I prefer to
use<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.230> thin<00:00:40.559> plastic<00:00:40.860> tool<00:00:41.370> just<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.239> avoid

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
use a thin plastic tool just to avoid

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.660 
use a thin plastic tool just to avoid
any<00:00:43.050> scratches<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> laptop<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.489> stuff

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
like that so I'm going to start off with

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.500 
like that so I'm going to start off with
this<00:00:46.649> one<00:00:46.829> like<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.160> said<00:00:47.190> because<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.149> find<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.480> a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
this one like I said because I find it a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.330 
this one like I said because I find it a
lot<00:00:48.660> easier<00:00:48.719> that's<00:00:49.559> all<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.800> want<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:49.980> do<00:00:50.160> is

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
lot easier that's all you want to do is

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.069 
lot easier that's all you want to do is

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
you want to get your tool and insert

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.959 
you want to get your tool and insert
into<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.440> first<00:00:52.680> cutout<00:00:53.100> for<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.370> tab<00:00:53.699> right

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
into the first cutout for the tab right

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:54.350 
into the first cutout for the tab right
here

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
here

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.810 
here
we're<00:00:54.960> insert<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.440> tool<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.860> push<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.760> away

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
we're insert the tool and push it away

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.790 
we're insert the tool and push it away
from<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.300> keyboards<00:00:57.750> off<00:00:57.870> into<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> laptop

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
from the keyboards off into the laptop

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.849 
from the keyboards off into the laptop
and<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.399> will<00:00:59.550> push<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.000> tab<00:01:00.649> unclipping

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
and this will push the tab unclipping

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.529 
and this will push the tab unclipping
the<00:01:02.250> keyboard<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.969> might<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.210> seen<00:01:03.329> that

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the keyboard you might have seen that

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.090 
the keyboard you might have seen that
the<00:01:03.629> key<00:01:03.780> would<00:01:03.930> just<00:01:04.140> slightly<00:01:04.439> lift<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.979> up

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the key would just slightly lift it up

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.240 
the key would just slightly lift it up
on<00:01:05.309> one<00:01:06.180> side<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.799> that<00:01:07.799> will<00:01:07.890> make<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.189> lot

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
on one side and that will make it a lot

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.950 
on one side and that will make it a lot
easier<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.729> do<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> rest<00:01:09.180> now<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.659> we<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.869> go

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
easier to do the rest now so we can go

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.020 
easier to do the rest now so we can go
to<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.170> second<00:01:10.530> clip<00:01:10.680> right<00:01:10.890> here<00:01:10.950> do<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
to the second clip right here do the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.080 
to the second clip right here do the
same<00:01:12.240> thing<00:01:12.510> put<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.350> tool<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.979> push<00:01:14.939> away

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
same thing put the tool in and push away

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.270 
same thing put the tool in and push away
and<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:16.200> will<00:01:16.350> unclip<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.830> again<00:01:17.100> it's

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
and this will unclip it again it's

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.760 
and this will unclip it again it's
slightly<00:01:17.700> lifted<00:01:18.240> now<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.689> then<00:01:19.439> we<00:01:19.530> could<00:01:19.680> do

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
slightly lifted now and then we could do

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.039 
slightly lifted now and then we could do
that<00:01:19.950> with<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.159> rest<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.640> them<00:01:20.820> right<00:01:21.689> there

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
that with the rest of them right there

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.030 
that with the rest of them right there
you<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.880> easy<00:01:24.119> as<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.420> go<00:01:24.570> along<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:25.080> more

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
you get easy as you go along the more

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.039 
you get easy as you go along the more
your<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.310> tip<00:01:26.580> now<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.390> third<00:01:27.630> ones<00:01:27.900> be

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
your on tip now that the third ones be

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.810 
your on tip now that the third ones be
released<00:01:28.380> we<00:01:28.530> can<00:01:28.560> just<00:01:28.860> pretty<00:01:29.369> much<00:01:29.460> just

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
released we can just pretty much just

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.230 
released we can just pretty much just
pull<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.270> keyboard<00:01:30.689> out<00:01:31.280> from<00:01:32.280> one<00:01:32.670> side<00:01:32.970> and

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
pull the keyboard out from one side and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.140 
pull the keyboard out from one side and
then<00:01:34.070> easily<00:01:35.299> remove<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.479> last<00:01:36.720> clip<00:01:37.790> like<00:01:38.790> so

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
then easily remove the last clip like so

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.050 
then easily remove the last clip like so
and<00:01:39.479> now<00:01:39.810> we<00:01:39.869> can<00:01:40.110> lift<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.470> keyboard<00:01:40.820> up<00:01:41.820> like

and now we can lift the keyboard up like

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.749 
and now we can lift the keyboard up like
that<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:43.189> make<00:01:44.189> sure<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.369> don't<00:01:44.460> pull<00:01:44.729> it

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
straight out because we do want to

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.200 
straight out because we do want to
actually<00:01:46.170> flip<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.710> over<00:01:47.000> avoiding<00:01:48.000> any
