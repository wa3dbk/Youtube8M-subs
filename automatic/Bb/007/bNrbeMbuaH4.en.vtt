00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.450 

I<00:00:01.240> think<00:00:02.240> grandma<00:00:02.540> models<00:00:03.500> sound<00:00:03.800> by

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:04.460 
I think grandma models sound by

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.640 
I think grandma models sound by
recording<00:00:04.940> a<00:00:05.029> car's<00:00:05.299> exhaust<00:00:05.810> and<00:00:06.200> a<00:00:06.350> steady

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:06.650 
recording a car's exhaust and a steady

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.149 
recording a car's exhaust and a steady
rpm<00:00:07.220> and<00:00:07.629> then<00:00:08.629> speeding<00:00:09.169> up<00:00:09.289> or<00:00:09.499> slowing<00:00:09.559> down

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:10.159 
rpm and then speeding up or slowing down

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:13.649 
rpm and then speeding up or slowing down
that<00:00:10.490> clip<00:00:10.849> to<00:00:11.119> match<00:00:11.839> the<00:00:12.019> car's<00:00:12.230> in-game<00:00:12.679> rpm

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:13.659 
that clip to match the car's in-game rpm

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:16.750 
that clip to match the car's in-game rpm
the<00:00:14.659> Mazda<00:00:15.079> seven<00:00:15.499> eight<00:00:15.619> seven<00:00:16.070> scenes<00:00:16.550> to

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
the Mazda seven eight seven scenes to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.750 
the Mazda seven eight seven scenes to
have<00:00:16.970> three<00:00:17.660> different<00:00:18.050> samples<00:00:18.460> one<00:00:19.460> for

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
have three different samples one for

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.300 
have three different samples one for
idle<00:00:20.120> one<00:00:20.600> for<00:00:20.900> mid-range<00:00:21.080> and<00:00:21.680> one<00:00:21.860> for<00:00:22.100> high

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
idle one for mid-range and one for high

00:00:22.310 --> 00:01:07.420 
idle one for mid-range and one for high
rpm

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.420 

so<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.760> 787<00:01:09.660> ends<00:01:10.200> up<00:01:10.320> sounding<00:01:10.770> relatively

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
so the 787 ends up sounding relatively

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.720 
so the 787 ends up sounding relatively
nice<00:01:11.930> but<00:01:12.930> some<00:01:13.680> cars<00:01:13.920> don't<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.250> as<00:01:14.610> many

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
nice but some cars don't have as many

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.990 
nice but some cars don't have as many
samples<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.830> they<00:01:16.830> sound<00:01:17.160> more<00:01:17.490> distorted

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
samples and they sound more distorted

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.810 
samples and they sound more distorted
and<00:01:18.300> fake<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:19.020> more<00:01:19.440> the<00:01:19.590> sample<00:01:19.980> is<00:01:20.130> sped<00:01:20.670> up

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
and fake the more the sample is sped up

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.530 
and fake the more the sample is sped up
or<00:01:21.000> slowed<00:01:21.270> down<00:01:21.480> and<00:01:22.130> I<00:01:23.130> think<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.700> Mustang

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
or slowed down and I think the Mustang

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.990 
or slowed down and I think the Mustang
trans<00:01:24.900> camera<00:01:25.380> is<00:01:25.980> a<00:01:26.040> good<00:01:26.280> example<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.790> this

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
trans camera is a good example of this

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.210 
trans camera is a good example of this
because<00:01:28.850> it<00:01:29.850> sounds<00:01:30.510> like<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:31.410> might<00:01:31.830> only

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
because it sounds like it might only

00:01:32.220 --> 00:02:07.790 
because it sounds like it might only
have<00:01:32.490> one<00:01:32.760> sample

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.559 

listen<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.920> these<00:02:09.069> other<00:02:09.369> cars<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:10.090> see<00:02:10.509> if

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
listen to these other cars and see if

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.050 
listen to these other cars and see if
you<00:02:10.720> can<00:02:10.869> tell<00:02:11.110> which<00:02:11.290> rpm<00:02:11.950> was<00:02:12.489> used<00:02:12.730> for<00:02:12.940> the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
you can tell which rpm was used for the

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.150 
you can tell which rpm was used for the
sample<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.660> how<00:02:14.349> much<00:02:14.620> they<00:02:14.830> become

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
sample and how much they become

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.110 
sample and how much they become
distorted<00:02:15.580> above<00:02:16.540> or<00:02:16.810> below<00:02:16.959> that
