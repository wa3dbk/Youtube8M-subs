first of all I will pop all the cubes

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:40.430 
first of all I will pop all the cubes
out<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.140> clean<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.289> whole<00:00:31.439> cube

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:49.360 

you

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.990 

okay<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:50.030> megamix<00:00:50.629> is<00:00:50.809> disassembled<00:00:51.500> now<00:00:51.649> and

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
okay the megamix is disassembled now and

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:06.230 
okay the megamix is disassembled now and
now<00:00:53.000> I<00:00:53.030> will<00:00:53.320> clean<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:54.469> call<00:00:54.710> first

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
okay so the car itself is clean now then

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:38.550 
okay so the car itself is clean now then
the<00:01:28.689> center<00:01:29.380> of<00:01:29.409> the<00:01:29.680> center<00:01:30.070> caps<00:01:30.369> have<00:01:30.700> to<00:01:30.880> be

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.600 

as<00:01:38.890> you<00:01:39.399> can<00:01:39.610> see<00:01:40.020> there<00:01:41.020> is<00:01:41.049> a<00:01:41.380> screw<00:01:42.040> in<00:01:42.340> there

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
as you can see there is a screw in there

00:01:42.610 --> 00:02:02.160 
as you can see there is a screw in there
you<00:01:43.270> have<00:01:43.509> to<00:01:43.829> tighten<00:01:44.829> it<00:01:45.220> all<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.640> way

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.609 

okay<00:02:02.860> so<00:02:03.460> now<00:02:04.150> take<00:02:04.600> off<00:02:04.840> you<00:02:05.020> send<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.380> caps

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
okay so now take off you send the caps

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:16.690 
okay so now take off you send the caps
off

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.780

ok now
here<00:02:18.879> comes<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.269> tricky<00:02:19.930> part<00:02:20.549> you<00:02:21.549> have<00:02:21.760> to

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
here comes the tricky part you have to

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.039 
here comes the tricky part you have to
use<00:02:22.629> a<00:02:22.659> screwdriver<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:24.180> then<00:02:25.180> pull<00:02:25.719> on<00:02:25.930> the

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
use a screwdriver and then pull on the

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:45.170 
use a screwdriver and then pull on the
center<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:28.049> they<00:02:29.049> have<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.769> be<00:02:36.269> exactly

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.380 

this<00:02:45.750> one<00:02:45.930> is<00:02:46.049> all<00:02:46.890> point<00:02:47.340> four<00:02:47.819> million<00:02:48.120> is

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
this one is all point four million is

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.470 
this one is all point four million is
four<00:02:49.379> millimeters<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.730> stretches<00:02:51.180> four

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
four millimeters it stretches four

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.580 
four millimeters it stretches four
millimeters<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.579> it<00:02:53.579> should<00:02:54.299> stretch<00:02:54.719> two<00:02:55.349> to

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
millimeters and it should stretch two to

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.929 
millimeters and it should stretch two to
three<00:02:55.859> millimeters<00:02:57.319> now<00:02:58.319> tighten<00:02:59.219> every

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
three millimeters now tighten every

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.220 
three millimeters now tighten every
screw<00:03:00.750> until<00:03:01.500> it's<00:03:02.159> all<00:03:02.719> until<00:03:03.719> it's<00:03:03.870> just

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
screw until it's all until it's just

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.289 
screw until it's all until it's just
possible<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:07.370> stretch<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.549> out<00:03:08.639> to<00:03:08.879> three

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
possible to stretch it out to three

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:20.330 
possible to stretch it out to three
millimeters

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:37.000 

you

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.830 

okay<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:38.070> now<00:03:38.430> all<00:03:38.460> the<00:03:38.970> screws<00:03:39.330> are<00:03:39.570> tightened

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
okay so now all the screws are tightened

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.920 
okay so now all the screws are tightened
and<00:03:40.280> you<00:03:41.280> can<00:03:41.490> attach<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.330> standard<00:03:42.720> cuts

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
and you can attach the standard cuts

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:50.630 
and you can attach the standard cuts
again

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.790 

so

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
so

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.610 
so
the<00:03:52.890> car<00:03:53.130> is<00:03:53.280> completely<00:03:53.460> done<00:03:54.200> then<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.350> can

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
the car is completely done then you can

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.000 
the car is completely done then you can
sort<00:03:56.190> out<00:03:56.400> all<00:03:56.700> of<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:57.090> corners<00:03:57.540> because<00:03:58.530> they

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
sort out all of the corners because they

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:08.800 
sort out all of the corners because they
don't<00:03:59.280> need<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.580> be<00:03:59.610> modeled

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.040 

okay<00:04:09.810> so<00:04:10.650> now<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.460> should<00:04:11.820> have<00:04:11.850> 30<00:04:12.690> edge

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
okay so now you should have 30 edge

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.509 
okay so now you should have 30 edge
pieces<00:04:13.790> that<00:04:14.790> need<00:04:14.820> to<00:04:15.210> be<00:04:15.240> modeled<00:04:15.739> as<00:04:16.739> you

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
pieces that need to be modeled as you

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.630 
pieces that need to be modeled as you
can<00:04:17.760> see<00:04:18.030> from<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.570> casting<00:04:19.079> process<00:04:19.640> there

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
can see from the casting process there

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:31.830 
can see from the casting process there
are<00:04:20.880> two<00:04:21.239> halves<00:04:21.570> of<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:22.710> piece

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.770 

I<00:04:31.930> hope<00:04:32.560> you<00:04:32.710> concede<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:35.610> there<00:04:36.610> may<00:04:37.210> be<00:04:37.240> some

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
I hope you concede and there may be some

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.159 
I hope you concede and there may be some
excess<00:04:38.230> material<00:04:38.440> and<00:04:39.150> you<00:04:40.150> have<00:04:40.479> to<00:04:40.720> scrape

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
excess material and you have to scrape

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:56.980 
excess material and you have to scrape
it<00:04:41.350> off<00:04:41.470> completely<00:04:42.360> like<00:04:43.360> I<00:04:43.540> do<00:04:43.600> it<00:04:43.870> now

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.210 

okay<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:58.250> edge<00:04:58.700> has<00:04:59.360> two<00:05:00.020> sides<00:05:00.440> welders

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
okay the edge has two sides welders

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:11.620 
okay the edge has two sides welders
needs<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:01.970> be<00:05:02.120> done

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.650 

and

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
and

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:23.390 
and
this<00:05:14.260> is

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:34.010 

this<00:05:24.400> is<00:05:24.550> how<00:05:24.700> the<00:05:24.760> modern<00:05:25.390> edge<00:05:25.630> looks<00:05:26.080> like

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:41.529 

ok<00:05:34.800> now<00:05:35.009> you<00:05:35.039> can<00:05:35.160> set<00:05:35.580> it<00:05:35.610> into<00:05:35.940> the<00:05:36.180> core<00:05:36.479> and

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:46.850 

now<00:05:42.539> do<00:05:42.599> this<00:05:43.080> to<00:05:43.379> all<00:05:43.620> of<00:05:44.629> the<00:05:45.629> 29<00:05:46.349> remaining

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
now do this to all of the 29 remaining

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.420 
now do this to all of the 29 remaining
edge<00:05:47.009> pieces<00:05:47.280> I<00:05:49.520> am<00:05:50.520> done<00:05:50.940> with<00:05:51.240> modding<00:05:51.690> now<00:05:51.840> I

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
edge pieces I am done with modding now I

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.850 
edge pieces I am done with modding now I
assemble<00:05:53.430> the<00:05:53.580> megamix<00:05:54.409> this<00:05:55.409> is<00:05:55.560> how<00:05:55.710> it

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
assemble the megamix this is how it

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:05.779 
assemble the megamix this is how it
turns<00:05:56.099> I<00:06:00.979> will<00:06:01.979> lubricate<00:06:02.340> it<00:06:02.759> a<00:06:02.970> bit<00:06:04.789> with

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
turns I will lubricate it a bit with

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:36.170 
turns I will lubricate it a bit with
silicon<00:06:06.630> spray<00:06:06.949> just<00:06:07.949> tiny<00:06:08.310> bit<00:06:34.940> ok<00:06:35.940> it<00:06:36.150> comes

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
silicon spray just tiny bit ok it comes

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.640 
silicon spray just tiny bit ok it comes
really<00:06:36.780> great<00:06:37.110> now<00:06:38.030> and<00:06:39.030> I<00:06:39.419> want<00:06:39.719> to<00:06:39.840> resolve

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
really great now and I want to resolve

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.480 
really great now and I want to resolve
to<00:06:40.889> show<00:06:41.099> it<00:06:41.250> to<00:06:41.280> you<00:06:42.440> the<00:06:43.440> first<00:06:43.830> time<00:06:44.069> I<00:06:44.099> solve

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
to show it to you the first time I solve

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.589 
to show it to you the first time I solve
this<00:06:44.669> one<00:06:44.909> I<00:06:46.099> got<00:06:47.099> two<00:06:47.550> minutes<00:06:47.849> and<00:06:48.150> 18

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:48.599 
this one I got two minutes and 18

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:53.420 
this one I got two minutes and 18
seconds<00:06:49.460> probably<00:06:50.460> because<00:06:51.330> of<00:06:51.360> the<00:06:52.430> color

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
seconds probably because of the color

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:58.580 
seconds probably because of the color
scheme<00:06:53.639> I<00:06:54.060> was<00:06:54.479> not<00:06:54.659> used<00:06:54.930> to<00:06:56.029> so<00:06:57.229> don't<00:06:58.229> expect

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
scheme I was not used to so don't expect

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:10.100 
scheme I was not used to so don't expect
to<00:06:59.250> good<00:06:59.520> times

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.110 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:36.790 

you

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.970 

ok<00:07:38.240> Dallas<00:07:39.240> up<00:07:39.419> to

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:41.980 

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.300 

but<00:07:42.610> I<00:07:43.240> think<00:07:43.870> that's<00:07:44.380> because<00:07:44.530> of<00:07:44.830> the<00:07:45.070> color

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:45.310 
but I think that's because of the color

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:52.230 
but I think that's because of the color
scheme<00:07:46.410> and<00:07:47.550> it<00:07:48.550> turns<00:07:50.370> just<00:07:51.370> like<00:07:51.580> my<00:07:51.790> megamix

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 
scheme and it turns just like my megamix

00:07:52.240 --> 00:08:03.870 
scheme and it turns just like my megamix
does<00:07:57.900> they<00:07:58.900> just<00:07:59.170> under<00:07:59.470> same<00:07:59.710> so<00:08:02.880> this

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:03.880 
does they just under same so this

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.810 
does they just under same so this
