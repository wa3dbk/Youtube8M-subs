and in this video I will show you a

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.490 
and in this video I will show you a
front<00:00:20.110> view<00:00:20.470> of<00:00:20.500> how<00:00:21.419> to<00:00:22.419> improve<00:00:22.660> your

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
front view of how to improve your

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.069 
front view of how to improve your
footwork<00:00:23.880> efficiency<00:00:24.880> this<00:00:25.570> is<00:00:25.750> basically

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:26.079 
footwork efficiency this is basically

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.940 
footwork efficiency this is basically
taken<00:00:26.500> from<00:00:26.739> one<00:00:27.099> of<00:00:27.220> my<00:00:28.140> program<00:00:29.140> called<00:00:29.500> the

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
taken from one of my program called the

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.690 
taken from one of my program called the
ultimate<00:00:30.460> footwork<00:00:30.910> system<00:00:31.689> so<00:00:32.590> that<00:00:33.190> is<00:00:33.430> a

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
ultimate footwork system so that is a

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.060 
ultimate footwork system so that is a
part<00:00:34.059> that<00:00:34.149> I<00:00:34.300> have<00:00:34.660> presently<00:00:35.170> but<00:00:35.410> however

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
part that I have presently but however

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.220 
part that I have presently but however
in<00:00:36.430> this<00:00:36.579> tutorial<00:00:36.760> we<00:00:37.450> will<00:00:37.480> learn<00:00:37.840> three

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
in this tutorial we will learn three

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.770 
in this tutorial we will learn three
fundamental<00:00:39.219> concepts<00:00:39.760> that<00:00:40.149> you<00:00:40.329> can<00:00:40.510> use

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
fundamental concepts that you can use

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.200 
fundamental concepts that you can use
within<00:00:41.079> your<00:00:41.170> next<00:00:41.590> game<00:00:41.800> to<00:00:42.250> improve<00:00:42.399> your

present footwork skills now you will see

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.850 
present footwork skills now you will see
many<00:00:46.210> players<00:00:46.510> do<00:00:46.810> foot<00:00:47.020> works<00:00:47.200> like<00:00:47.440> this<00:00:47.590> and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
many players do foot works like this and

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.310 
many players do foot works like this and
it's<00:00:48.579> perfectly<00:00:48.940> okay<00:00:49.390> but<00:00:50.079> in<00:00:50.200> the

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
it's perfectly okay but in the

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.110 
it's perfectly okay but in the

auto docks position you notice you can
see<00:01:30.429> my<00:01:30.609> entire<00:01:31.029> legs<00:01:31.450> my<00:01:32.079> legs<00:01:32.109> are<00:01:32.409> too<00:01:32.560> far

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:32.859 
see my entire legs my legs are too far

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:35.219 
see my entire legs my legs are too far
from<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.279> bar<00:01:33.459> sometimes<00:01:34.359> this<00:01:34.719> close<00:01:35.020> is

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
from the bar sometimes this close is

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.179 
from the bar sometimes this close is
very<00:01:35.469> good<00:01:35.770> so<00:01:36.249> in<00:01:36.340> case<00:01:36.520> you<00:01:36.670> have<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:37.029> turn

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
very good so in case you have to turn

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.730 
very good so in case you have to turn
you<00:01:39.189> hold<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.700> ball<00:01:39.880> with<00:01:40.749> the<00:01:40.869> inner<00:01:41.109> part<00:01:41.560> of

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
your foot and you turn so sometimes

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.739 
your foot and you turn so sometimes
that's<00:01:45.999> very<00:01:46.119> effective<00:01:46.979> touch<00:01:47.979> it<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.279> turn
