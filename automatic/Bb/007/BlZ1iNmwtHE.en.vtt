00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.360

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.049
 Subscribe if you're upset that was 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.199
 the intro and works now friends 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.449
 get really school today 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.490
 my mum and without beard 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.109
 Last week I also make up 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.029
 studios reported and now there is 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.949
 actually with a message the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.140
 German concerns make up flat 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.429
 namely to come to Germany the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.199
 are now being considered for the network 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.000
 can berlin or munich da that 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.460
 simply the three largest media cities 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.690
 in germany are smaller santander 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.730
 most youtube networks 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.290
 Incidentally, this is in berlin 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.760
 Printing is not just one of the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.800
 most successful youtube and let's play 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.809
 germany no he is only the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.510
 first of a billion videos 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.120
 cracked has to make at least thought 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.910
 the music label concord is not a youtuber 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.350
 namely, this mate by 2.1 billion 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.170
 the most clicks on youtube 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.989
 By the way , by the way, with their video 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.149
 channel and that is quite 4.9 billion 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.739
 views of a dice more than sick and 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.140
 for you, rich of a billion news 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.670
 here on youtube.com of course 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.650
 the week 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.869
 that was again something minecraft project 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.549
 started and this calls itself again 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.900
 with it are the usual suspects 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.970
 as under but plays let's play 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.060
 Meanwhile I get tips on 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.460
 zack diego is basically a huge one 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.439
 round hunger games together and small ones 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.000
 team from the club 2 you wanted 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.250
 then that was due to the match 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.229
 really special is that in the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.150
 This is played hardcore mode 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.310
 means if someone dies he is 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.170
 automatically outside and I find straight 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.090
 That makes this project so interesting 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.070
 because you can see four 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.960
 different from youtuber 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.180
 For example , you can really play 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.670
 quite a bit a bit I have the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.399
 all the time to disturb strained yes 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.840
 it normally wraps much goes 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.159
 and he already decided in the first one 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.299
 died because he was not right 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.299
 paid attention 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:07.130
 I am shocked from behind 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.840
 and that's exactly what makes this the attraction 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.540
 series because of that fall minecraft 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.090
 friends a very clear article lng to 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.250
 and in the video description and that 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.530
 of course to all participants no matter if 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.540
 you are already dead now or not then 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.580
 It will be serious for youtube yahoo 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.350
 announced that their own web video 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.700
 want to put online with this site 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.250
 of course, not only wanted one 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.020
 be the side in the shadow of youtube 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.810
 swims no yahoo has 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.940
 made youtube thrust from the throne 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.709
 and the goal has become yahoo 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.209
 teamed up with vivo 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.850
 Timo is a union of the largest 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.860
 music labels of the world who have become 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.420
 task makes music spread and 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.640
 that's what makes them so successful and successful 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.280
 So it was youtube to collapse 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.019
 bring yes that sounds pretty stupid 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.600
 we are always honest one finds 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.310
 everything on youtube is just looking for 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.320
 it is a bit harder for us than 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.610
 shit but have in other countries 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.920
 it is not a problem at all 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.230
 Moreover , where are you only selected 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.480
 user videos are allowed to upload and exactly 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.940
 that's actually the attraction at 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.430
 youtube everyone can upload videos and 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.530
 everyone can succeed with his videos 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.079
 be and we as spectators can us 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.000
 identify with other youtubers and 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:18.769
 that everything that youtube succeeds 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.900
 The yahoo page is also made 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.370
 Just missing and that's why I have to 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.579
 to say honestly I see there right now 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.950
 no competition for youtube in 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.170
 but this page looks like it 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.010
 write your opinion down in 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.660
 the comments 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.970
 the idea is getting closer and now 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.459
 Every youtuber can be from 15,000 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.049
 Subscribers directly register for this 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.760
 again this year in two days 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.709
 takes place so easy for one 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.299
 much better clarity I think 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.799
 In fact, a good solution for yourself 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.190
 to register will find the link to it 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.840
 down in the 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.960
 video description and now we come 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.410
 again to the channel of the week 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:59.970
 long in leather look at 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:02.780
 I I old to 17 years I will 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.780
 four cats 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:18.209
 I am also so friends with that 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.430
 an edition of me all the 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.740
 turned on incredibly but true if it 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.000
 you only liked one ear 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.720
 but never the channel and nothing more 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.150
 miss 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.920
 this is the last good issue 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.450
 here last monday edition based 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.410
 and we will see our Wednesday again 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.780

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.340
 has a great time on youtube and 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.690
 does not hurt to use until then 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.690
 pinks no
