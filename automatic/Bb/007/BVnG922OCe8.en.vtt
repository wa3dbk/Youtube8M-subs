00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
app the whole design will be it'll be

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.100 
app the whole design will be it'll be
somewhat<00:01:59.460> the<00:02:00.000> same<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.390> guess<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:00.840> already

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
somewhat the same I guess it's already

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.030 
somewhat the same I guess it's already
been<00:02:01.380> shown<00:02:01.680> but<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:03.530> really<00:02:04.530> can't<00:02:04.649> wait<00:02:04.770> for

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
been shown but I really can't wait for

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.889 
been shown but I really can't wait for
this<00:02:05.189> I'll<00:02:05.340> definitely<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:05.939> pre-ordering<00:02:06.630> it

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
this I'll definitely be pre-ordering it

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.869 
this I'll definitely be pre-ordering it
now<00:02:07.110> also<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.560> believe<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.220> original<00:02:08.700> Kindle

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
now also I believe the original Kindle

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.570 
now also I believe the original Kindle
Fire<00:02:09.239> like<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.750> says<00:02:09.899> here<00:02:10.140> it's<00:02:10.890> dropped<00:02:11.370> to

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
Fire like it says here it's dropped to

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.339 
Fire like it says here it's dropped to
159

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
159

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.580 
159
or<00:02:13.620> oh<00:02:14.249> it's<00:02:15.030> that's<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.749> seven-inch<00:02:16.349> that's

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
or oh it's that's the seven-inch that's

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.709 
or oh it's that's the seven-inch that's
just<00:02:16.799> the<00:02:16.920> upgraded<00:02:17.430> version<00:02:17.459> as<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.569> was

just the upgraded version as I was

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.050 
just the upgraded version as I was
talking<00:02:18.900> about<00:02:19.049> earlier<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:20.310> it's<00:02:20.519> still<00:02:20.760> the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
talking about earlier so it's still the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.000 
talking about earlier so it's still the
regular<00:02:21.629> Kindle<00:02:22.019> Fire<00:02:22.230> basically<00:02:22.889> the
