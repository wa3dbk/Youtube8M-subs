00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.560
 special because as it is already announcing 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.450
 the previous days I asked you to 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.920
 please can you make me recommendations 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.570
 of books that you would have liked and that 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.830
 you wanted me to read I want to say that 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.750
 I have received a lot of 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.760
 recommendations I'm very grateful for 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.320
 it was pointing all the titles 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.700
 who has visited saying in a notebook 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.560
 and I'm going to try to read all of them 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.570
 I have decided to start this month of 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.100
 June this new summer with three of 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.900
 your proposals that you chose from that 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.489
 list the first book of this tibial del 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.739
 June is recommended by 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.989
 storyteller and is the fake 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.890
 prince of jennifer nor the being wants 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.540
 begin that this book takes 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.770
 practically since they published it in 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.390
 my wish list what had animated 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.800
 still to read it even though I would 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.450
 had recommended in a large amount 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.100
 of occasions and especially when 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.110
 publish the second part was like that 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.910
 I was compelled to read them but I do not know why 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.200
 what did not encourage me to read them and that changes 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.300
 the stories of princes and 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.799
 I like matches very much like that 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.750
 that now I have the perfect excuse to 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.190
 start with this first book the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.130
 the proposals are recommended by 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.960
 carolina and p and is lisa starters price 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.430
 this is another one of the books that also 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.530
 It takes me a long time to wish and I'm going to 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.750
 confess that the main reason that 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.729
 I have not read it is laporta I want it 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.500
 say I do not know why but this cover of 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.940
 Here, I am a little afraid of the fact 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.440
 that it's so white and that it shines so much 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.880
 the face of the protagonist or the girl 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.729
 that is on the cover the truth is that 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.619
 I do not know why but it gave me a bit of 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.060
 repelÃºs or something like that and I had not been encouraged 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.340
 to read it even though I read very good 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.750
 critiques of this book so good 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.970
 now carolina has given me the excuse 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.830
 perfect to read it the third book that 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.930
 I'm going to show you on this June trip 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.460
 comes recommended by isa a friend of 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.430
 youth literature club in my city 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.070
 and it's the first mega-volume game of 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.660
 thrones of george rr martin and I'm going to 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.660
 be as sincere as possible and is that 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.190
 I am very afraid to read these books on 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.680
 main reason is because they are super 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.390
 fat and I feel like enormous laziness 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.610
 start reading them because they are super 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.229
 fat and I do not know I think I'm going to get bored 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.539
 of them although they have told me that as no 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.039
 to die people and it's a lot of action and 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.929
 they are changing the characters they are 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.819
 super fast with the television series 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.170
 the truth is that I do not follow it I started to see 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.760
 the first season and I stayed in the 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.590
 third chapter because he had a small 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.299
 problem when it comes to seeing it in 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.069
 television and I missed several chapters 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.019
 so I have not returned to the series 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.519
 television but good everyone 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.959
 is talking about the game of thrones all 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.120
 the world talks about game of thrones and I 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.069
 I have not read them so it's good 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.049
 mega books that I will surely have to 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.670
 dose them and intercalate other readings 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.069
 to make me a little bit more fun 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.569
 and finally I can comment on the game of 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.609
 thrones with my friends from the club 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.319
 reading and with all the people you want 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.489
 comment on the game of thrones another of the 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.930
 books that I intend to read during this 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.730
 June is recommended by me 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.260

 labyrinth I want to start this book 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.040

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.510

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:57.299
 I could not attend that month's meeting 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:59.159
 so I did not have time to read it and what 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.569
 I'm going to read now to see the 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.030
 movie that I do not remember right now 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.709
 when it's released, I'll leave it here 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.000
 when I found out I'm going to read it now 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.620
 because everyone was talking about the 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.449
 labyrinth runner my friend willy 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.370
 wants to go see her at the movies and I also 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:11.710
 I wanted to see her at the cinema because 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.330
 viewed 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.890
 I did not have to have seen the trailer 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.200
 until he had read the novel already 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.970
 I know but I do not know I could not resist well 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.920
 the trailer I like very much is a 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.480

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.340

 It's very exciting and you can already 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.960

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.090

 scoundrel we have already read the previous 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:57.539
 trilogy of maquillan room we loved 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.639

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.620

 somewhat special edition because I have not 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.710
