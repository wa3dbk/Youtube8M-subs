00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
all right hopefully you can see the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.540 
all right hopefully you can see the
damage<00:02:32.680> that<00:02:32.890> was<00:02:33.040> done<00:02:33.250> there<00:02:35.310> now<00:02:36.310> we'll<00:02:36.460> do

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
damage that was done there now we'll do

00:02:36.550 --> 00:03:07.949 
damage that was done there now we'll do
the<00:02:36.580> same<00:02:36.730> thing<00:02:37.120> with<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.450> kukri<00:03:06.750> kukri<00:03:07.750> did

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
the same thing with the kukri kukri did

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.740 
the same thing with the kukri kukri did
quite<00:03:08.170> a<00:03:08.230> bit<00:03:08.350> of<00:03:08.560> damage<00:03:09.450> roughly<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.540> same

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
quite a bit of damage roughly the same

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.870 
quite a bit of damage roughly the same
depending<00:03:11.350> on<00:03:11.530> how<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:11.890> look<00:03:12.130> at<00:03:12.340> it<00:03:12.400> actually

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
depending on how you look at it actually

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.420 
depending on how you look at it actually
went<00:03:13.330> a<00:03:13.360> little<00:03:13.480> deeper<00:03:13.600> with<00:03:14.050> kukri<00:03:14.530> but

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
went a little deeper with kukri but

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.890 
went a little deeper with kukri but
here's<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.820> big<00:03:16.000> difference<00:03:18.570> because<00:03:19.570> of<00:03:19.810> the

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
here's the big difference because of the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.390 
here's the big difference because of the
way<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:21.280> this<00:03:21.519> has<00:03:21.700> been<00:03:21.880> sharpened<00:03:23.400> with

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
way that this has been sharpened with

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.020 
way that this has been sharpened with
this<00:03:24.610> edge<00:03:24.820> right<00:03:24.850> here<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:26.680> kukri<00:03:27.070> also

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
this edge right here the kukri also

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.699 
this edge right here the kukri also
works

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.630 

and<00:03:34.709> it's<00:03:34.860> drawing<00:03:35.190> on<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:36.810> if<00:03:36.989> you're<00:03:37.640> trying

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
and it's drawing on so if you're trying

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.369 
and it's drawing on so if you're trying
to<00:03:38.700> make<00:03:38.910> a<00:03:38.940> bow<00:03:39.300> or<00:03:40.459> whatever<00:03:41.900> your<00:03:42.900> project

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
to make a bow or whatever your project

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.880 
to make a bow or whatever your project
may<00:03:43.560> be<00:03:46.099> you've<00:03:47.099> got<00:03:47.129> a<00:03:47.340> perfect<00:03:47.879> draw<00:03:48.090> knife

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
may be you've got a perfect draw knife

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.130 
may be you've got a perfect draw knife
I've<00:03:49.890> also<00:03:50.400> carved<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.480> back<00:03:51.690> side<00:03:51.959> of<00:03:51.989> the

tool to take in my pack especially in
the<00:04:18.359> survival<00:04:18.690> situations<00:04:19.489> it's<00:04:20.489> lighter

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
the survival situations it's lighter

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.110 
the survival situations it's lighter
weight<00:04:20.970> it's<00:04:21.690> more<00:04:21.959> versatile<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:25.850> it's<00:04:26.850> just

going to depend on your situation but I
think<00:04:30.120> it's<00:04:30.539> definitely<00:04:30.720> a<00:04:31.080> tool<00:04:31.380> worth

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
think it's definitely a tool worth

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.570 
think it's definitely a tool worth
considering

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
considering

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.180
