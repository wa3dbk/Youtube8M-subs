00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.629

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.789
 you have to pass the kids here 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.220

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:20.340

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.110

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.000
 timao a thousand times with the damned 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.950
 true business we always have 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.779
 made an exchange and encouraged you because 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.269
 is that he is a good con man if you want 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.519
 fuck the good ones you do not see it because it's the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.100
 machine but to earn a profit 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:36.720
 for that badly done deal you can do what 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.110
 that I come to present here is a bug 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.820
 to which you can earn more of that object and 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.590
 that does not have you, let's see what is 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.110
 we started with what we have to 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.660
 to do is very simple you can put a 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.760
 emerald to put 64 if it does not work 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.430
 valentine to put a full stack 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.910
 hit shift and waited early 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.030
 expect to wait you give it that way and until 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.039
 I say do not take your finger off the shift 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.920
 what we have to give them now click 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.070
 right and the shift maintained is worth a 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.220
 once done this with the shift kept it 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.400
 we give a is the little button on the corner of 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.350
 up on the left we give and we 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.800
 will jump the emeralds, as you see 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.410
 do not 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.620
 257 emeralds and they have given us as 1 2 3 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.990
 4 or 5 stacks of chicken whether you think it is 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.979
 free if you want free food 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.320
 Very simple 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.990

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.690
