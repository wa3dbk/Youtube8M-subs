checks for the appearance but otherwise

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
checks for the appearance but otherwise
it's<00:01:14.490> fine<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.790> guess<00:01:15.680> shiny<00:01:16.680> um<00:01:17.240> there's

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
it's fine I guess shiny um there's

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.480 
it's fine I guess shiny um there's
little<00:01:18.509> clips<00:01:18.780> here<00:01:19.110> which<00:01:19.500> are<00:01:19.740> kind<00:01:20.100> knowing

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
little clips here which are kind knowing

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.850 
little clips here which are kind knowing
but<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.850> just<00:01:21.030> pry<00:01:21.420> them<00:01:21.600> off<00:01:21.810> right<00:01:22.619> gonna

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
but you just pry them off right gonna

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.710 
but you just pry them off right gonna
bother<00:01:23.009> right<00:01:23.310> now<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.180> pry<00:01:24.420> them<00:01:24.570> off

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
bother right now but you pry them off

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.810 
bother right now but you pry them off
and<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.140> take<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> little<00:01:25.650> or<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.310> cover<00:01:26.520> off

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
and you take a little or the cover off

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.660 
and you take a little or the cover off
and<00:01:27.090> um<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:28.350> works<00:01:28.560> well<00:01:28.799> but<00:01:29.070> eventually<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
and um it works well but eventually the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.420 
and um it works well but eventually the
clip<00:01:29.909> start<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.360> bend<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.259> snap<00:01:32.220> off

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
clip start to bend and like snap off

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.319 
clip start to bend and like snap off
break<00:01:33.360> off<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:34.049> eventually<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.430> start<00:01:36.210> using

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
break off so eventually you start using

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.210 
break off so eventually you start using
tape<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.990> get<00:01:37.439> all<00:01:37.530> messy<00:01:37.950> him<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.159> don't

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
tape and get all messy him you don't

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.460 
tape and get all messy him you don't
want<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.520> see<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.700> um<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:42.479> Micra<00:01:42.960> see<00:01:43.170> right

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
want to see that um the Micra see right

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.260 
want to see that um the Micra see right
here<00:01:43.710> if<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.220> haven't<00:01:44.610> seen<00:01:44.880> one<00:01:45.060> they're
