00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.620
 Well, let's start with the 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:15.010
 information that is interesting 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.920
 gerardo because Mexican football gives 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.750
 stumbling brings us very strange things and 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.420
 something that we did not think would happen 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.640
 it happened fell defeated the selection 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.760
 Mexican in the Aztec stadium against 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.550
 honduras them with yes because it is scratched in 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.169
 the case where josÃ© command of the tower 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.300
 leaves the technical direction of the 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.250
 Mexican team we are going to make a 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.379
 chronology of course what happened 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.899
 a little bit later before then the 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.480
 images of the game very early in the 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.700
 5 minute on a team off-hook 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.250
 Mexican would arrive at Giovani dos Santos 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.880
 to serve this wonderful center and 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.730
 so that peralta oribe score the goal of 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.640
 this Mexican team at minute 5 is a 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.649
 off-hook based on a good series of 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.510
 touches where the error center is 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.969
 loses errors in the exit of Honduras 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.850
 of course if it is lost and well then 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.310
 this annotation falls and everyone 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.740
 I thought that would come the best for 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.330
 for the Mexican team there would be 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.340
 unfortunate play 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.890
 in the complementary part where Carlos 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.600
 salcido does not make a good clearance and 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.510
 it would come then also this bad cut 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.630
 of the goalkeeper please jesus crown and 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.100
 jerry bengston at 63 would give in one for 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.390
 one of the party crown error in a 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.980
 good shot first the error of 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.720
 salcido to be made backwards and after 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.660
 the crown error with so much experience 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.030
 not to reject the ball to one side is 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.670
 He wants to be with the ball but he 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.260
 it remains there at the feet of the opposite 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.970
 write down the one by one 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.130
 this would come to do to provoke 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.680
 many mistakes and a lot of distrust and in 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.090
 a game in a bad recovery or 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.130
 rather in a bad exit the team 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.960
 mexican retrieves a long ball the 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.090
 honduras team is badly stopped 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.070
 diego kings the center who now plays 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.950
 for the port and you win in the race 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.869
 instead of looking for the opposite 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.740
 there we can see old kings 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.750
 failure at the exit 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:11.420
 carlo costly who knows him then very 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:14.060
 well to this Honduran team two for 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.800
 one then this result is given and we said 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.800
 the cessation of the chepo of the tower
