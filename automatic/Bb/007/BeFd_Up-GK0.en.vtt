polycarbonate shell that's do t rated

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.640 
polycarbonate shell that's do t rated
the<00:00:30.090> nice<00:00:30.269> thing<00:00:30.300> about<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:30.960> system<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.560> that

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the nice thing about this system is that

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.190 
the nice thing about this system is that
it<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.189> modular<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:33.059> steel<00:00:33.840> hardware

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
it is modular you have steel hardware

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.350 
it is modular you have steel hardware
pins<00:00:34.590> underneath<00:00:34.950> for<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> more<00:00:35.760> secure<00:00:36.090> fit

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
pins underneath for a more secure fit

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.959 
pins underneath for a more secure fit
and<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.200> single<00:00:37.559> throw<00:00:37.739> design<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.460> it

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
and it's a single throw design so it

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.700 
and it's a single throw design so it
takes<00:00:39.180> one<00:00:39.510> hand<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:40.079> use<00:00:40.170> your<00:00:40.260> thumb<00:00:40.530> or

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
takes one hand you can use your thumb or

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.280 
takes one hand you can use your thumb or
a<00:00:40.739> forefinger<00:00:41.160> whatever<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:42.329> switch<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
a forefinger whatever this switch on the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.080 
a forefinger whatever this switch on the
front<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.710> really<00:00:44.040> easy<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.399> actuate<00:00:44.789> whether

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
front is really easy to actuate whether

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.400 
front is really easy to actuate whether
you're<00:00:45.270> doing<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.629> gloves<00:00:45.930> or<00:00:46.140> without

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
you're doing it with gloves or without

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.860 
you're doing it with gloves or without
and<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.399> comes<00:00:47.610> up<00:00:47.730> into<00:00:47.969> place<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.539> doesn't

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
and it comes up into place it doesn't

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.630 
and it comes up into place it doesn't
lock<00:00:49.110> up<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:49.680> there<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> small<00:00:50.219> amount<00:00:50.579> of

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
lock up but there is a small amount of

lock up but there is a small amount of
retention<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.870> make<00:00:52.020> sure<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
retention so to make sure is that the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.350 
retention so to make sure is that the
