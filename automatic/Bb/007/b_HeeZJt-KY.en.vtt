00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.510
 or not and no more this is not a matter of 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.010
 fight between dog breeds and having 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.840
 obtained a visit for this video and 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.420
 leaving aside the morbidity and the 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.790
 sick people looking for fight videos 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.070
 of dogs then the next 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.350
 theme how to choose the name of your 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.000
 puppy the right choice of 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.920
 puppy's name is a lesson 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.869
 important which will be used to 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.550
 identify the dog during all its 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.830
 life you have to take some time 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.199
 considerable to choose the name and in 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.149
 family is very important that all 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.309
 agree and call it the same 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.950
 way to keep in mind the following 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.989
 suggestions avoid the names that you 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.250
 look like the training orders 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.770
 as sit down I came here come etcetera 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.500
 this will favor good communication 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.899
 between the tutor and the animal will prevent 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.970
 get confused all that will facilitate the 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.220
 animal human relationship 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.080
 avoid similar or very similar names of 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.690
 other animals other members of the 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.910
 neighbors house and so on only 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.160
 would cause confusion in the dog the 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.230
 name should not be too long for 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.910
 that the animal interprets it well if 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.670
 want to choose a long name as per 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.380
 example aristÃ³teles maybe it would be 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.180
 convenient for group members 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.110
 family will call it by the diminutive 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.580
 but choose your name for others 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.590
 people outside the house would be 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.260
 Aristotle and do not deprive yourself of having a 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.150
 So important name to choose a name 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.770
 that suits when it's big by 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.619
 example if it is the name as pitu print 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.540
 to a Great Dane puppy when it's 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.940
 adult will not be a proper name for 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.630
 its size but good as the saying goes 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.670
 about tastes there is nothing written but if 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.410

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.320

 come to fill the owner with pride 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.880
 when I named him in public for example 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.830
 rommel for a cunning and obedient dog 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.650
 is the one chosen in honor of the great marshal 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.900
 German who without being a Nazi was a great 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.020
