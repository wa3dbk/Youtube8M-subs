00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.119 

my<00:02:30.209> tip<00:02:30.569> when<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:30.959> comes<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.469> swim<00:02:31.709> where<00:02:31.920> is

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
my tip when it comes to swim where is

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.509 
my tip when it comes to swim where is
fountain<00:02:33.019> bikini<00:02:34.019> that<00:02:34.499> suits<00:02:34.950> your<00:02:35.159> shape

you<00:02:35.999> know<00:02:36.180> I've<00:02:36.689> always<00:02:37.249> gone<00:02:38.249> for<00:02:38.549> bikinis

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
you know I've always gone for bikinis

that are quite thick at the sides

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:42.709

because<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.549> string<00:02:41.790> bikinis<00:02:42.299> don't<00:02:42.510> always

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
because the string bikinis don't always

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.229 
because the string bikinis don't always
tend<00:02:43.109> to<00:02:43.170> flatter<00:02:43.439> my<00:02:43.680> figure<00:02:43.709> I'm<00:02:44.280> also<00:02:44.969> a
