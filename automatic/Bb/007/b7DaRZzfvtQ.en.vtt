00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.559
 hello I'm juande and manager are 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.510
 trail runners and we compete from 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.190
 five years ago and today we're going to give 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.190
 tips to start them in the trailer 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.130
 one of the things to take into account in the 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.720
 world of the trail is to be accompanied separately 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.720
 to be much more fun with safety 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.430
 in the second place I advise you to take a 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.620
 small capacity backpack like this 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.489
 in which we can have a bag of 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.489
 water and some food 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.739
 In the mountains , time can be very 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.059
 variable therefore I advise you to take a 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.059
 light piece as an open cut 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.360
 as last advice I would give you always 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.430
 use a trail shoe as 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.930
 this one that has its tacos ready for 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.910
 run on all the grounds so much 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.370
 irregular with rains with mud 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.550
 It can also protect you against 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.550
 stones 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.050
 unlike we missed the trail is made 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.790
 natural goalkeeper that's why it's important 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.710
 that you always look straight ahead and 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.810
 in front of you so we can avoid 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.130
 falls and injuries and we'll know when 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.130
 locate exactly our support 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.960
 when he answered in his life with a lot 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.460
 pending one thing that can help you 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.229
 is to place your hands on the 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.430
 quadriceps now yes gain momentum and 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.430
 avoid loading the lower back 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.390
 for your life is with less slope 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:41.369
 where it is possible to run I advise you 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.439
 take a shorter stride supporting 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.539
 only the tips to adapt 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.289
 better to the terrain and thus be able to do more 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.289
 smooth the rises 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.730
 in the descents is where we are going to 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.740
 find more complications so you 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.230
 I advise to make shorter cases and 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.520
 fast to control the progress and 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.520
 anticipate much more to the ground 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.930

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.490
