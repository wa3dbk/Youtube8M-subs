00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:29.360

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.570

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.379
 So basic settings experienced here 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.879

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.210
 that you can use would need animal 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.280

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.940
 Here's what's quite beneficial 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.330

 Wanted to do some orders here 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.050
 It would not be too loud because of me 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.050

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.880

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.450
 pictured as you can for example now 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.520
 here on music that does not work then 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.580
 Of course the video can see it 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.230

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.870

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.650

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.010
 in some songs still in the picture 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:30.990
 displayed then run a few 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:35.490
 Although information about the neat has no 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:40.500
 text is not an artist but her album is 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:43.220
 It looks good running a bit 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.220

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.480

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.480
 there you all see 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.900
 I 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:27.160
 but lisa you are looking for your old ones 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:32.480
 folder I mean here now left 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:34.910
 the price for the radio was 29 90 euro 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.150
 or euro even i have lowered 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.070
 got at media market 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.780
 as I said clearly it is her 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.190
 can therefore also the attitude 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.990
 I already mentioned here about change 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.580
 phone 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.210
 yes that's good if you are not here 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.210
 connected is 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.170
 access allow blablabla 

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:19.709
 but just a little louder for so long 

00:05:04.799 --> 00:05:21.659
 music down here you can see the mobile phone 

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:25.139
 composite with battery indicator and 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:25.739
 net reception of the cool in detail 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.039
 went 

00:05:25.739 --> 00:05:30.749
 if the phone goes on then phone 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:44.249
 up the button directly the number 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:46.649
 entry 0 2 3 15 24 15 9 o'clock music goes 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:49.289
 then briefly we have the microphone 

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:51.059
 By the way, what I'm shitting totally shit 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:06:00.449
 the number is even fast 

00:05:51.059 --> 00:06:05.610
 hang up but because blabla phone book is 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:09.029
 do not take the number so over that 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:13.379
 setup you can still front back 

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:16.800
 Adjust the volume on the bass 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:17.909
 Subwoofer you can still front back 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.949
 So there are many 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:24.059
 Adjustments like the display 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:25.439
 is would be a standard background that 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:29.939
 now sees it looks like that 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:31.289
 can only display from a to z 

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:35.399
 adjust almost everything yourself 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:37.999
 configure my radio configure 

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:41.219
 We think we can do that here 

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:44.579
 quali blablabla of the different 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:47.149
 possibilities everything at will 

00:06:44.579 --> 00:06:51.649
 adjust 

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:51.649
 the moment of the beatles 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.979
 I first made it here 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.199
 no idea if I helped you 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:04.639
 have 

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:06.410
 to advise against or guess so my 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:09.410
 recommendation is just price 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.030
 performance is priced at this radio 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.000
 Performance ratio is very good to me 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:17.840
 I do not like complaining 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.780
 two years warranty so everything comes 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:23.530
 churches I hope you liked it 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.530
 what good christ
