for<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.520> third<00:00:42.000> trailer<00:00:42.600> from<00:00:42.870> Grand<00:00:43.140> Theft

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
for a third trailer from Grand Theft

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.369 
for a third trailer from Grand Theft
Auto<00:00:43.410> 5<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.160> yes<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.660> actually<00:00:46.020> think<00:00:46.260> that

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
Auto 5 and yes we actually think that

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.520 
Auto 5 and yes we actually think that
there<00:00:46.739> will<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.129> third<00:00:47.579> trailer<00:00:48.090> sometime

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
there will be a third trailer sometime

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.439 
there will be a third trailer sometime
but<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.890> will<00:00:50.129> most<00:00:50.340> likely<00:00:50.610> be<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.000> launch

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
but it will most likely be the launch

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.290 
but it will most likely be the launch
trailer<00:00:51.899> off<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.199> game<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.820> they<00:00:53.820> usually

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
trailer off the game and they usually

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.119 
trailer off the game and they usually
get<00:00:54.480> released<00:00:54.870> about<00:00:55.110> one<00:00:55.469> week<00:00:55.620> before<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
get released about one week before the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.430 
get released about one week before the
game<00:00:56.340> gets<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> stores<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.199> should

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
game gets in the stores so that should

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.470 
game gets in the stores so that should
be<00:00:58.590> about<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:59.430> tenth<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.940> september's

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
be about a tenth of september's

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.360 
be about a tenth of september's
something<00:01:00.840> like<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.829> launch<00:01:02.010> trailer

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
something like that the launch trailer

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.160 
something like that the launch trailer
is<00:01:02.489> usually<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> trailer<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.750> see<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
is usually a trailer that you see in the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.260 
is usually a trailer that you see in the
commercial<00:01:04.739> breaks<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.519> television<00:01:05.939> and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
commercial breaks on a television and

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.750 
commercial breaks on a television and
stuff<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.720> it's<00:01:07.530> nothing<00:01:07.950> really<00:01:07.979> big<00:01:08.400> it

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
stuff so it's nothing really big it

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.750 
stuff so it's nothing really big it
should<00:01:08.970> be<00:01:09.000> about<00:01:09.150> 30<00:01:09.570> seconds<00:01:10.369> but<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:11.580> don't

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
should be about 30 seconds but we don't

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.670 
should be about 30 seconds but we don't
think<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> third<00:01:12.810> trailer<00:01:13.080> will<00:01:13.350> show<00:01:13.530> up

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
think that a third trailer will show up

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.310 
think that a third trailer will show up
in<00:01:13.799> may<00:01:14.220> or<00:01:14.250> june<00:01:14.520> or<00:01:15.000> something<00:01:15.390> cuz<00:01:15.600> rockster

make<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.360> quick<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.869> think<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.650> they<00:01:31.920> are

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
make it that quick I think that they are

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.370 
make it that quick I think that they are
just<00:01:33.210> going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.450> release<00:01:33.689> more<00:01:33.990> screenshots

maybe some more news about characters or
the<00:01:38.340> storyline<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.450> think<00:01:39.750> that's<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.140> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409

think that just will bleed a launch
