00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
hunger bar and just like the hunger bar

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.310 
hunger bar and just like the hunger bar
it<00:00:12.000> is<00:00:12.179> your<00:00:12.300> goal<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.599> keep<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.870> thirst<00:00:13.080> bar

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
from reaching zero and to do this you

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.300 
from reaching zero and to do this you
have<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.049> drink<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.740> probably<00:00:16.980> guess

upon<00:00:28.380> collecting<00:00:28.680> water<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:30.150> boil<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.900> in

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990

upon collecting water is to boil it in
the<00:00:31.050> furnace<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:32.149> this<00:00:33.149> creates<00:00:33.570> one<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.809> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
the furnace and this creates one of the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.799 
the furnace and this creates one of the
new<00:00:34.110> items<00:00:34.500> introduced<00:00:34.950> by<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.340> mod<00:00:35.809> which

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
rain collector will collect fresh water

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.020 
rain collector will collect fresh water
or<00:01:45.390> rain<00:01:45.899> water<00:01:45.929> whenever<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.770> rains<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.369> will

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
or rain water whenever it rains it will

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.940 
or rain water whenever it rains it will
hold<00:01:48.360> ten<00:01:49.340> bottles<00:01:50.340> internally<00:01:51.649> but<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.799> can

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
hold ten bottles internally but you can

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.490 
hold ten bottles internally but you can
also<00:01:53.069> place<00:01:53.399> more<00:01:53.640> bottles<00:01:53.970> inside<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.380> when

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
also place more bottles inside so when

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.469 
also place more bottles inside so when
it<00:01:55.619> rains<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.280> rain<00:01:56.399> water<00:01:56.640> will<00:01:56.850> fill<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.330> it

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
it rains the rain water will fill and it

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.969 
it rains the rain water will fill and it
for<00:01:57.630> every<00:01:57.899> single<00:01:58.229> bottle<00:01:58.470> you<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:58.740> here

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
for every single bottle you have here

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.529 
for every single bottle you have here
and<00:01:59.159> will<00:02:00.000> also<00:02:00.330> fill<00:02:00.569> this<00:02:00.810> little<00:02:01.140> raindrop

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
and will also fill this little raindrop

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.690 
and will also fill this little raindrop
which<00:02:03.539> represents<00:02:04.289> the<00:02:04.500> ten<00:02:04.979> internal

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
which represents the ten internal

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.509 
which represents the ten internal
bottles<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.929> rain<00:02:07.229> collector<00:02:08.039> can<00:02:08.250> hold

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
bottles that the rain collector can hold

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.130 
bottles that the rain collector can hold
so<00:02:08.759> let's<00:02:08.880> go<00:02:09.000> ahead<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.209> turn<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.720> rain<00:02:09.899> on

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
so let's go ahead and turn the rain on

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.420 
so let's go ahead and turn the rain on
and<00:02:11.930> you'll<00:02:12.930> see<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.650> bottles<00:02:13.980> now<00:02:14.160> are

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
and you'll see the bottles now are

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:20.400 
and you'll see the bottles now are
starting<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:14.970> fill

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.580 

there<00:02:20.890> we<00:02:20.980> go<00:02:21.340> we<00:02:21.670> take<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.000> bottle<00:02:22.300> out<00:02:22.590> this

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
there we go we take the bottle out this

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.680 
there we go we take the bottle out this
droplet<00:02:24.010> right<00:02:24.400> here<00:02:24.700> will<00:02:25.090> start<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.480> fill

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
droplet right here will start to fill

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.930 
droplet right here will start to fill
instead<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.710> as<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.010> stated<00:02:27.280> before<00:02:27.520> that<00:02:27.820> is

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
instead and as I stated before that is

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.050 
instead and as I stated before that is
the<00:02:28.060> internal<00:02:30.060> storage<00:02:31.060> space<00:02:31.510> for<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.350> water

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
the internal storage space for the water

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.690 
the internal storage space for the water
now<00:02:34.060> keep<00:02:34.600> in<00:02:34.750> mind<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:35.650> thirst<00:02:36.010> bar<00:02:36.280> depletes

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
now keep in mind the thirst bar depletes

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.500 
now keep in mind the thirst bar depletes
twice<00:02:37.180> as<00:02:37.450> fast<00:02:37.840> as<00:02:38.080> your<00:02:38.230> hunger<00:02:38.650> bar<00:02:39.510> so

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
twice as fast as your hunger bar so

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.080 
twice as fast as your hunger bar so
thirst<00:02:40.960> is<00:02:41.260> definitely<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.280> priority<00:02:42.820> you<00:02:42.850> want

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
thirst is definitely a priority you want

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.199 
thirst is definitely a priority you want
to<00:02:43.150> make<00:02:43.270> sure<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.540> get<00:02:43.660> water

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.030 

now<00:02:47.689> if<00:02:47.750> we<00:02:47.870> put<00:02:48.019> these<00:02:48.170> glass<00:02:48.439> bottles<00:02:48.680> in

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
now if we put these glass bottles in

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.160 
now if we put these glass bottles in
it'll<00:02:49.909> start<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.269> fill<00:02:50.420> those<00:02:50.569> but<00:02:50.810> if<00:02:50.900> we<00:02:50.989> turn

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
it'll start to fill those but if we turn

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.470 
it'll start to fill those but if we turn
the<00:02:51.290> rain<00:02:51.439> off<00:02:51.709> it'll<00:02:52.670> actually<00:02:52.879> start<00:02:53.299> to<00:02:53.390> use

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
the rain off it'll actually start to use

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.660 
the rain off it'll actually start to use
the<00:02:53.719> water<00:02:53.959> that's<00:02:54.319> stored<00:02:54.650> inside<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.519> rain

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
the water that's stored inside the rain

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.809 
the water that's stored inside the rain
collector<00:02:56.150> see<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.840> rain<00:02:57.019> is<00:02:57.200> off<00:02:57.670> but<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:58.790> is

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
collector see the rain is off but it is

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.670 
collector see the rain is off but it is
now<00:02:59.120> filling<00:02:59.420> these<00:02:59.629> bottles<00:02:59.989> using<00:03:00.469> the

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
now filling these bottles using the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.559 
now filling these bottles using the
water<00:03:00.859> that<00:03:01.069> it's<00:03:01.219> already<00:03:01.519> stored<00:03:01.790> it's

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
water that it's already stored it's

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.220 
water that it's already stored it's
pretty<00:03:02.750> cool<00:03:03.069> so<00:03:04.069> it's<00:03:04.459> a<00:03:04.489> great<00:03:04.670> mod

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230
