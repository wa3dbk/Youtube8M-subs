00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
and it's looking more and more likely

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.840 
and it's looking more and more likely
that<00:00:22.140> we<00:00:22.380> will<00:00:22.529> go<00:00:22.710> down<00:00:23.039> now<00:00:23.100> but<00:00:23.609> anyway

conceded a lot of goals from my area I

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.250 
conceded a lot of goals from my area I
can<00:00:35.969> remember<00:00:36.120> very<00:00:36.300> early<00:00:36.630> on<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.230> first

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
can remember very early on in the first

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.049 
can remember very early on in the first
game<00:00:37.680> actually<00:00:37.950> we<00:00:38.219> concede<00:00:38.579> one<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.940> your

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
game actually we concede one to your

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.750 
game actually we concede one to your
rivals<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.860> was<00:00:40.950> Ross<00:00:41.129> Barkley<00:00:41.640> who

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
rivals and it was Ross Barkley who

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.209 
rivals and it was Ross Barkley who
struck<00:00:42.090> one<00:00:42.270> from<00:00:42.450> about<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.809> same<00:00:43.050> area<00:00:43.379> and

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
struck one from about the same area and

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.549 
struck one from about the same area and
we<00:00:44.340> don't<00:00:44.640> seem<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.120> get<00:00:45.329> into<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.960> into<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
we don't seem to get into the into the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.830 
we don't seem to get into the into the
opposition<00:00:47.039> players<00:00:47.280> quick<00:00:47.610> enough<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.059> that

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
opposition players quick enough and that

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.779 
opposition players quick enough and that
seems<00:00:49.200> our<00:00:49.440> problem<00:00:49.860> for<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> first<00:00:50.399> 20

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
seems our problem for the first 20

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.000 
seems our problem for the first 20
minutes<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.180> then<00:00:51.329> Suarez<00:00:51.780> added<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.289> goal<00:00:52.829> it

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
minutes and then Suarez added a goal it

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.619 
minutes and then Suarez added a goal it
had<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.340> happen<00:00:53.520> he<00:00:53.730> had<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.969> get<00:00:54.120> one<00:00:54.149> against

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
had to happen he had to get one against

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.350 
had to happen he had to get one against
us<00:00:54.780> didn't<00:00:55.110> he<00:00:55.140> Suarez<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.829> nice<00:00:56.699> little<00:00:56.940> finish

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
us didn't he Suarez a nice little finish

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.130 
us didn't he Suarez a nice little finish
and<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.930> nice<00:00:58.079> assist<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:58.710> well<00:00:59.239> but<00:01:00.239> again<00:01:00.359> we

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
and a nice assist as well but again we

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.349 
and a nice assist as well but again we
just<00:01:01.350> weren't<00:01:01.559> getting<00:01:01.920> into<00:01:02.579> into<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.149> guys

enough<00:01:03.809> we<00:01:04.290> were<00:01:04.409> standing<00:01:04.619> off<00:01:04.920> too<00:01:05.159> much<00:01:05.720> two

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
enough we were standing off too much two

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.690 
enough we were standing off too much two
yards<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.409> know<00:01:07.530> sort<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.159> between<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
yards you know sort of in between the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.840 
yards you know sort of in between the
bus<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.180> us<00:01:09.360> anew<00:01:09.799> and<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.979> didn't<00:01:11.549> really

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
bus and us anew and it didn't really

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.609 
bus and us anew and it didn't really
seem<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.330> we<00:01:12.600> were<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.080> game<00:01:13.290> it

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
seem like we were up for the game it

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.050 
seem like we were up for the game it
seemed<00:01:13.950> like<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.189> were<00:01:14.340> taking<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.820> while<00:01:15.030> to

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
seemed like we were taking a while to

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.390 
seemed like we were taking a while to
bed<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.869> that's<00:01:16.200> actually<00:01:16.439> something<00:01:17.100> we

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
bed in and that's actually something we

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.490 
bed in and that's actually something we
we<00:01:18.090> haven't<00:01:18.330> been<00:01:18.420> used<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> Cairo<00:01:19.229> we

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
we haven't been used to a Cairo we

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.050 
we haven't been used to a Cairo we
normally<00:01:19.920> really<00:01:20.340> hit<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.610> ground<00:01:20.640> running

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
normally really hit the ground running

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.240 
normally really hit the ground running
and<00:01:21.360> then<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.720> then<00:01:22.229> sort<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.500> lose<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.070> from

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
and then and then sort of lose it from

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.710 
and then and then sort of lose it from
there<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.580> but<00:01:23.759> today<00:01:24.000> we<00:01:24.180> started<00:01:24.600> very

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
there on but today we started very

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.270 
there on but today we started very
poorly<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.439> sort<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.680> killed<00:01:25.920> us<00:01:26.100> off

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
poorly and it sort of killed us off

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.700 
poorly and it sort of killed us off
being<00:01:26.880> tunnel<00:01:27.330> down<00:01:27.509> within<00:01:27.780> 11<00:01:28.259> minutes<00:01:28.290> but

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
being tunnel down within 11 minutes but

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.100 
being tunnel down within 11 minutes but
after<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.159> we<00:01:29.729> started<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.240> get<00:01:30.390> more<00:01:30.659> onto

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
after that we started to get more onto

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.870 
after that we started to get more onto
the<00:01:31.200> ball<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.409> thought<00:01:31.710> snodgrass<00:01:32.220> &amp;<00:01:32.250> Johnson

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the ball I thought snodgrass &amp; Johnson

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.539 
the ball I thought snodgrass &amp; Johnson
led<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.299> very<00:01:33.659> well<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> middle<00:01:35.460> of

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
led that very well and in the middle of

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.969 
led that very well and in the middle of
the<00:01:35.670> park<00:01:35.909> Lucas<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.110> Jared<00:01:37.500> they<00:01:37.650> looked<00:01:37.860> a

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
the park Lucas and Jared they looked a

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.280 
the park Lucas and Jared they looked a

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
few decent chances Hooper wasn't really

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.460 
few decent chances Hooper wasn't really
