difference in this but so you can see in

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.690 
difference in this but so you can see in
the<00:03:04.180> beginning<00:03:04.980> there's<00:03:05.980> a<00:03:06.070> little<00:03:06.280> bit<00:03:06.459> more

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
the beginning there's a little bit more

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.449 
the beginning there's a little bit more
gaps<00:03:07.030> between<00:03:07.870> my<00:03:08.260> single<00:03:08.650> crochets<00:03:09.100> that<00:03:09.430> I

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
gaps between my single crochets that I

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:10.680 
gaps between my single crochets that I
did<00:03:09.700> in<00:03:09.730> the<00:03:09.910> beginning<00:03:10.030> with<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.450> half

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
did in the beginning with the half

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.710 
did in the beginning with the half
doubles<00:03:11.050> and<00:03:11.470> then<00:03:11.650> in<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.459> end<00:03:12.489> it's<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.360> lot

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
doubles and then in the end it's a lot

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.810 
doubles and then in the end it's a lot
more<00:03:13.750> solid<00:03:14.560> with<00:03:14.770> just<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.160> half<00:03:15.310> doubles

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
more solid with just the half doubles

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.350 
more solid with just the half doubles
also<00:03:16.660> um<00:03:17.310> there's<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.370> little<00:03:18.610> bit<00:03:18.820> of<00:03:18.880> an<00:03:19.150> up

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
also um there's a little bit of an up

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.960 
also um there's a little bit of an up
slant<00:03:19.810> on<00:03:20.050> this<00:03:20.650> piece<00:03:20.920> because<00:03:21.130> you've

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
slant on this piece because you've

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.400 
slant on this piece because you've
gained<00:03:22.300> a<00:03:22.330> little<00:03:22.630> bit<00:03:22.780> of<00:03:22.870> height<00:03:23.110> with<00:03:23.290> the

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
gained a little bit of height with the

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.760 
gained a little bit of height with the
half<00:03:23.560> doubles<00:03:23.950> but<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:24.310> don't<00:03:24.489> gain<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:24.700> lot<00:03:25.030> um

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
half doubles but you don't gain a lot um

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.720 
half doubles but you don't gain a lot um
so<00:03:26.770> if<00:03:27.489> I<00:03:28.450> wouldn't<00:03:29.080> really<00:03:29.260> worry<00:03:29.620> if<00:03:30.550> you're

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
so if I wouldn't really worry if you're

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.490 
so if I wouldn't really worry if you're
doing<00:03:30.940> singles<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.600> half<00:03:31.840> doubles<00:03:32.230> in<00:03:32.380> the

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
doing singles and half doubles in the

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.590 
doing singles and half doubles in the
same<00:03:32.770> row<00:03:33.370> as<00:03:33.400> long<00:03:33.820> as<00:03:33.970> you<00:03:34.060> don't<00:03:34.239> do<00:03:34.420> it<00:03:34.570> for

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
same row as long as you don't do it for

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.840 
same row as long as you don't do it for
multiple<00:03:35.170> rows<00:03:35.380> you<00:03:36.070> should<00:03:36.310> be<00:03:36.459> fine<00:03:36.670> without

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
multiple rows you should be fine without

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.780 
multiple rows you should be fine without
making<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:37.630> you<00:03:38.290> know<00:03:38.380> what<00:03:38.500> crooked<00:03:39.220> or<00:03:39.519> a

making it you know what crooked or a

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.960 
making it you know what crooked or a
slanted<00:03:40.630> piece<00:03:40.840> of<00:03:41.049> work<00:03:41.640> so<00:03:42.640> that's<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:42.850> half

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
slanted piece of work so that's a half

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.710 
slanted piece of work so that's a half
double<00:03:43.530> now<00:03:44.530> let's<00:03:44.739> do<00:03:44.950> the<00:03:45.100> double<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:46.660> I'm

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720

going to turn chain one actually let's
do<00:03:50.470> a<00:03:50.500> double<00:03:50.950> let's<00:03:51.190> do<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.400> half<00:03:51.880> double<00:03:52.299> into

double<00:04:09.940> you<00:04:10.480> want<00:04:10.600> to<00:04:10.660> put<00:04:10.810> yarn<00:04:11.140> on<00:04:11.380> the<00:04:11.739> hook

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
double you want to put yarn on the hook

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.320 
double you want to put yarn on the hook
just<00:04:11.920> like<00:04:12.340> you<00:04:12.430> did<00:04:12.549> with<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:12.790> half<00:04:12.970> double

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
just like you did with the half double

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.729 
just like you did with the half double
then<00:04:14.049> you're<00:04:14.140> going<00:04:14.230> to<00:04:14.290> put<00:04:14.500> through<00:04:14.650> the

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
then you're going to put through the

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.420 
then you're going to put through the
stitch<00:04:15.570> pull<00:04:16.570> through<00:04:16.870> so<00:04:17.830> you<00:04:17.890> have<00:04:17.979> three<00:04:18.280> on

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
stitch pull through so you have three on

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.240 
stitch pull through so you have three on
your<00:04:18.700> yarn<00:04:19.570> over<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.080> pull<00:04:20.440> through<00:04:20.919> this

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
your yarn over and pull through this

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
your yarn over and pull through this
time<00:04:21.459> you're<00:04:21.609> only<00:04:21.700> going<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:21.940> pull<00:04:22.090> through

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
time you're only going to pull through

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.070 
time you're only going to pull through
two<00:04:22.630> of<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:22.870> stitches<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.360> loops<00:04:25.810> on<00:04:26.050> your

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
two of the stitches to the loops on your

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.610 
two of the stitches to the loops on your
hook<00:04:26.350> and<00:04:26.790> then<00:04:27.790> so<00:04:27.970> then<00:04:28.120> you<00:04:28.210> have<00:04:28.360> two<00:04:28.690> loops

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
hook and then so then you have two loops

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.980 
hook and then so then you have two loops
yarn<00:04:29.950> over<00:04:30.640> pull<00:04:31.180> through<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.479> last<00:04:31.690> two

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
yarn over pull through the last two

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.560 
yarn over pull through the last two
that's<00:04:32.919> a<00:04:33.070> half<00:04:33.250> double<00:04:33.610> it's<00:04:34.300> going<00:04:34.450> to<00:04:34.510> do

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
that's a half double it's going to do

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.959 
that's a half double it's going to do
that<00:04:34.720> again

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:36.969 
that again

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:39.449 
that again
do<00:04:37.899> that<00:04:38.049> again<00:04:38.229> really<00:04:38.739> quick<00:04:38.919> yarn<00:04:39.369> over

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:39.459 
do that again really quick yarn over

Afghans in the double because I don't
really<00:05:33.370> have<00:05:33.490> the<00:05:33.580> patience<00:05:34.150> to<00:05:34.210> do<00:05:34.449> a<00:05:34.479> full

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
really have the patience to do a full

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.589 
really have the patience to do a full
afghan<00:05:35.050> with<00:05:35.860> just<00:05:36.189> single<00:05:36.840> or<00:05:37.840> half<00:05:38.139> doubles

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
afghan with just single or half doubles

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:44.399 
afghan with just single or half doubles
but<00:05:40.599> the<00:05:40.719> double<00:05:41.199> is<00:05:41.819> nice<00:05:42.819> it<00:05:43.509> puts<00:05:44.139> a<00:05:44.229> little

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.409 
but the double is nice it puts a little

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:47.850 
but the double is nice it puts a little
bit<00:05:44.590> more<00:05:44.770> gaps<00:05:45.189> in<00:05:45.639> your<00:05:45.840> work<00:05:46.840> but<00:05:47.529> I<00:05:47.590> think

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
bit more gaps in your work but I think

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.719 
bit more gaps in your work but I think
been<00:05:48.039> manageable<00:05:50.039> nothing<00:05:51.039> has<00:05:51.189> exchanges

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729 
been manageable nothing has exchanges

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:54.089 
been manageable nothing has exchanges
the<00:05:51.879> triple<00:05:52.270> which<00:05:52.900> I'll<00:05:53.409> go<00:05:53.620> over<00:05:53.650> in<00:05:53.979> the

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
the triple which I'll go over in the

00:05:54.099 --> 00:06:01.589 
the triple which I'll go over in the
next<00:05:54.250> video<00:05:56.789> oops<00:05:59.789> last<00:06:00.789> stitch<00:06:01.120> is<00:06:01.270> always<00:06:01.569> a

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
next video oops last stitch is always a

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:07.709 
next video oops last stitch is always a
little<00:06:01.719> tricky<00:06:03.900> there<00:06:04.900> we<00:06:05.050> go<00:06:05.430> alright<00:06:06.719> let's

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:07.719 
little tricky there we go alright let's

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:09.480 
little tricky there we go alright let's
see<00:06:07.990> so<00:06:08.620> as<00:06:08.680> you<00:06:08.800> can<00:06:08.919> see<00:06:09.129> in<00:06:09.250> the<00:06:09.339> beginning

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
see so as you can see in the beginning

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.670 
see so as you can see in the beginning
we<00:06:09.849> did<00:06:10.029> that<00:06:10.180> half<00:06:10.419> double<00:06:10.839> and<00:06:11.139> then<00:06:11.379> we<00:06:11.500> did

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
we did that half double and then we did

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.439 
we did that half double and then we did
another<00:06:11.949> would<00:06:12.339> then<00:06:12.520> we<00:06:12.639> did<00:06:12.789> a<00:06:12.819> double<00:06:13.210> and

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:13.449 
another would then we did a double and

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:15.930 
another would then we did a double and
we<00:06:13.750> kind<00:06:13.960> of<00:06:14.020> has<00:06:14.169> a<00:06:14.199> slant<00:06:14.680> up<00:06:14.919> no<00:06:15.789> more

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
we kind of has a slant up no more

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.119 
we kind of has a slant up no more
consistent<00:06:16.569> the<00:06:17.050> height<00:06:17.259> of<00:06:17.289> the<00:06:17.680> devil<00:06:17.979> is

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:18.129 
consistent the height of the devil is

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:20.760 
consistent the height of the devil is
about<00:06:18.400> that<00:06:18.699> the<00:06:19.690> height<00:06:19.900> of<00:06:19.930> a<00:06:20.139> half<00:06:20.349> double

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
about that the height of a half double

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.740 
about that the height of a half double
is<00:06:20.889> about<00:06:21.159> there<00:06:21.460> and<00:06:21.729> the<00:06:22.300> height<00:06:22.479> of<00:06:22.509> the

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
is about there and the height of the

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.909 
is about there and the height of the
single<00:06:23.169> is<00:06:23.759> about<00:06:25.110> there<00:06:26.110> so<00:06:26.740> there's

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
single is about there so there's

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.909 
single is about there so there's
definitely<00:06:27.159> an<00:06:27.699> increase<00:06:28.240> in<00:06:28.560> height<00:06:29.560> of<00:06:29.770> this

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:29.919 
definitely an increase in height of this

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:33.059 
definitely an increase in height of this
stitch<00:06:30.960> when<00:06:31.960> you<00:06:32.080> work<00:06:32.259> in<00:06:32.409> double<00:06:32.740> but<00:06:32.949> as

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:33.069 
stitch when you work in double but as

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:35.550 
stitch when you work in double but as
you<00:06:33.250> can<00:06:33.370> see<00:06:33.729> if<00:06:34.719> you<00:06:34.810> kind<00:06:34.990> of<00:06:35.139> stretch<00:06:35.409> out

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
you can see if you kind of stretch out

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.800 
you can see if you kind of stretch out
the<00:06:35.680> work<00:06:35.860> a<00:06:35.979> little<00:06:36.099> bit<00:06:36.310> the<00:06:37.120> holes<00:06:37.449> are<00:06:37.750> a

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
the work a little bit the holes are a

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:41.100 
the work a little bit the holes are a
lot<00:06:38.259> bigger<00:06:38.860> with<00:06:39.789> doubles<00:06:40.270> than<00:06:40.779> they<00:06:40.930> are

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
lot bigger with doubles than they are

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.320 
lot bigger with doubles than they are
with<00:06:41.319> singles<00:06:41.770> so<00:06:42.370> down<00:06:42.520> here<00:06:42.580> this<00:06:43.180> is<00:06:43.300> the

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
with singles so down here this is the

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.149 
with singles so down here this is the
row<00:06:43.629> that<00:06:43.659> we<00:06:43.990> did<00:06:44.759> two<00:06:45.759> videos<00:06:46.150> ago<00:06:47.129> with<00:06:48.129> the

00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:48.159 
row that we did two videos ago with the

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:51.209 
row that we did two videos ago with the
increases<00:06:48.819> and<00:06:49.000> decreases<00:06:49.949> so<00:06:50.949> it's<00:06:51.069> a<00:06:51.099> lot

00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:51.219 
increases and decreases so it's a lot

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:55.790 
increases and decreases so it's a lot
tighter<00:06:51.509> but<00:06:52.509> in<00:06:52.719> general<00:06:53.699> with<00:06:54.699> the<00:06:54.849> singles

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
tighter but in general with the singles

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.230 
tighter but in general with the singles
these<00:06:56.800> are<00:06:56.949> singles<00:06:57.310> down<00:06:57.490> here<00:06:57.699> these<00:06:58.089> are

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 
these are singles down here these are

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.800 
these are singles down here these are
doubles<00:06:58.569> and<00:06:58.839> then<00:06:59.639> if<00:07:00.639> you<00:07:00.759> look<00:07:00.939> here<00:07:01.210> these

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:01.810 
doubles and then if you look here these

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.010 
doubles and then if you look here these
are<00:07:01.870> half<00:07:02.259> doubles<00:07:02.680> these<00:07:03.279> are<00:07:03.460> doubles<00:07:04.020> so

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.020 
are half doubles these are doubles so

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.050 
are half doubles these are doubles so
