00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.070
 Hello, good afternoon, how are you? 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.500
 welcome here to your space with your 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.980
 friend the teacher jump 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.070
 now even if it's very simple very 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.960
 simple very handmade to make 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.900
 some videos for all of you that 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.939
 help us find answers 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.130
 to find the best possible 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.779
 solutions or just to 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.470
 reflect on some issues that 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.329
 They can be very interesting 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.260
 this is a video to the best test 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:41.129
 because obviously I'm using this 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.250
 device this camera because before I had 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.989
 the channel has on YouTube 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.460
 fortunately some malicious person 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:55.300
 that he did not like my presence or my 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.449
 videos or because I did not have a 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.829
 positive attitude that I shared 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.230
 advice and messages to other people who 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.350
 they liked these videos that I had 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.930
 already uploaded more than 20 videos with very 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.360
 interesting because he did me the favor of 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.220
 delete them 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.350
 from here I send you a very blessing 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.230
 great to this kind of people so that 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.270
 so for now 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.250
 and the light of the universe illuminates them and 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.880
 find interesting things to do 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.920
 types that if not the laws of karma 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.870
 they are accompanying them today tomorrow and 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.940
 always and mainly talking about 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.970
 karma you have to keep in mind that 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.850
 whenever we do some action already 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.780
 be good or be bad we have 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.790
 find what 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.659
 everything we do has a 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.819
 consequence 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:47.780
 we must remember that there are no coincidences 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:49.490
 in life there are causalities and if 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.320
 we are also going through 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.330
 very difficult moments 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.080
 situations to the best that seem 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.850
 adverse very complicated situations very 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.130
 complex 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.380
 we do not have to ask ourselves why is it 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.860
 why this happening is happening to us 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.670
 such thing we have to ask ourselves better for 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.670
 what what teaching are we 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.460
 receiving through the things that we 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.660
 are happening 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.890
 sadly you have to remember that when 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.610
 someone 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.880
 manufactures a padlock looks for the factory without 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.840
 have a key available to open or 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.209
 close this padlock to himself god not 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.950
 It puts us problems without the 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.810
 solutions for them 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.590
 then everything that divides us in the 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.260
 life because it has a great teaching nothing 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.750
 more than if we should learn to 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.810
 reflect why we are succeeded by 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.360
 things 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.849
 many times we sometimes refuse to 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.390
 understand that what happens to us in life 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:03:01.020
 about everything bad is to learn something 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.200
 but if we start to think 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.390
 assess and evaluate the actions that we 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.209
 led to this situation either of 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.610
 directly or indirectly because this we 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.830
 will serve so that for the next 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.430
 again have similar situations or 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.989
 similar situations in a few words 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.830
 what is important in life is that 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:26.700
 learn not to stumble where on a 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.950
 same stone and when there are stones that 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.350
 we are on the road and asia 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.049
 because they are part of our destiny 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.690
 because that is our karma or because there is 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.420
 negative people who have helped us 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.380
 get behind rocks on the road 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:46.790
 we have two options before these stones 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:50.090
 that the first one we use to create 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.100
 a path over this swamp is only 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.490
 negative about this place so 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.650
 we are going through and we have a way 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:02.519
 firm in solid through which to pass 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.250
 that space this time and the other way 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.689
 to use these stones that sometimes 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.420
 we have on the road thanks to other 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:12.420
 people or our personal karma from 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:16.620
 with them we can build bigger 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:19.350
 fortress walls that protect us from 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.139
 the ravages of fate we are going to have 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.150
