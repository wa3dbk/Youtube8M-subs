00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.500 

hi<00:00:01.290> let's<00:00:02.070> talk<00:00:02.460> about<00:00:02.610> the<00:00:02.909> simulation

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hi let's talk about the simulation

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:18.410 
hi let's talk about the simulation
options<00:00:12.769> so<00:00:15.199> yeah<00:00:16.199> basically<00:00:17.029> you<00:00:18.029> want<00:00:18.330> to

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
options so yeah basically you want to

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.310 
options so yeah basically you want to
simulate<00:00:18.750> this<00:00:19.199> we<00:00:19.949> simulate<00:00:20.779> and<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:22.109> see

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
simulate this we simulate and you see

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.029 
simulate this we simulate and you see
that<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.949> frames<00:00:23.279> are<00:00:23.430> calculated<00:00:24.090> and

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
that the frames are calculated and

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.570 
that the frames are calculated and
square<00:00:27.140> meters<00:00:28.140> particles<00:00:28.769> are<00:00:28.920> interacting

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
square meters particles are interacting

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.740 
square meters particles are interacting
with<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.820> hemisphere<00:00:30.529> so<00:00:32.450> next<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.660> the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
with the hemisphere so next to the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.680 
with the hemisphere so next to the
simulate<00:00:34.170> button<00:00:34.200> there<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.010> an<00:00:35.160> arrow<00:00:35.430> or<00:00:36.000> if

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
simulate button there is an arrow or if

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.470 
simulate button there is an arrow or if
you<00:00:36.870> click<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.649> see<00:00:38.160> three<00:00:38.969> options<00:00:39.000> for

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
you click that you see three options for

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.299 
you click that you see three options for
dynamic<00:00:40.140> subject<00:00:40.500> dynamics<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.160> death

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
dynamic subject dynamics and death

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.799 
dynamic subject dynamics and death
options<00:00:42.140> the<00:00:43.140> fluid<00:00:43.980> dynamics<00:00:44.480> this<00:00:45.480> means

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
options the fluid dynamics this means

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.650 
options the fluid dynamics this means
that<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.289> enabled<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.550> right<00:00:48.300> now<00:00:48.450> that's

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
that it's enabled so right now that's

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.510 
that it's enabled so right now that's
what<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.110> up<00:00:50.360> if<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.809> reset<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.340> you

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
what is up if you reset it and you

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.369 
what is up if you reset it and you
simulate<00:00:53.850> then<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.449> see<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:54.899> loading

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
simulate then you see it just loading

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.590 
simulate then you see it just loading
but<00:00:55.620> after<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.789> not<00:00:57.000> calculating

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
but after that it's not calculating

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.560 
but after that it's not calculating
anything<00:00:58.219> so<00:00:59.219> no<00:00:59.640> fluid<00:00:59.969> dynamics<00:01:00.420> is

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
anything so no fluid dynamics is

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.439 
anything so no fluid dynamics is
calculated<00:01:01.230> if<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.530> turn<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.520> then

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
calculated if you turn that on and then

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.469 
calculated if you turn that on and then
reset<00:01:05.119> then<00:01:06.290> it's<00:01:07.290> gonna<00:01:08.060> it's<00:01:09.060> gonna<00:01:09.180> keep

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
reset then it's gonna it's gonna keep

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.100 
reset then it's gonna it's gonna keep
simulating<00:01:11.060> right<00:01:12.060> now<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.240> object<00:01:12.659> dynamics

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
simulating right now the object dynamics

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.310 
simulating right now the object dynamics
is<00:01:13.260> turned<00:01:13.560> off<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.010> lot<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.430> times<00:01:14.869> you<00:01:15.869> want

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
is turned off so a lot of times you want

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.960 
is turned off so a lot of times you want
to<00:01:16.470> optimize<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:17.070> scene<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.610> don't<00:01:17.790> want

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
to optimize the scene so you don't want

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.999 
to optimize the scene so you don't want
to<00:01:18.119> reload<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.900> think<00:01:19.200> about<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.680> object

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
to reload to think about the object

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.830 
to reload to think about the object
dynamics<00:01:20.520> because<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.850> don't<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.180> any<00:01:21.420> any

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
dynamics because you don't have any any

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.649 
dynamics because you don't have any any
rigid

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
rigid

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.349 
rigid
anything<00:01:23.380> set<00:01:23.649> up<00:01:23.740> in<00:01:23.920> sync<00:01:24.280> so<00:01:24.520> you<00:01:25.060> just<00:01:25.179> want

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
anything set up in sync so you just want

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:27.959 
anything set up in sync so you just want
to<00:01:25.390> turn<00:01:25.569> yourself<00:01:25.990> and<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:27.520> makes<00:01:27.759> the

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:27.969 
to turn yourself and that makes the

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:29.639 
to turn yourself and that makes the
scene<00:01:28.299> a<00:01:28.329> little<00:01:28.600> bit<00:01:28.689> go<00:01:28.869> faster

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
scene a little bit go faster

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.370 
scene a little bit go faster
now<00:01:30.369> to<00:01:30.429> optimize<00:01:30.819> the<00:01:31.240> scene<00:01:31.479> better<00:01:31.750> you<00:01:32.200> go

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
now to optimize the scene better you go

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.580 
now to optimize the scene better you go
to<00:01:32.530> options<00:01:33.009> and<00:01:33.329> here<00:01:34.329> you<00:01:34.479> have<00:01:34.780> options<00:01:35.439> to

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
to options and here you have options to

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.639 
to options and here you have options to
to<00:01:36.490> make<00:01:36.700> your<00:01:36.909> scene<00:01:37.240> go<00:01:37.479> faster<00:01:40.439> first<00:01:41.439> of

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
to make your scene go faster first of

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.569 
to make your scene go faster first of
all<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:43.090> have<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:43.539> general<00:01:44.319> options<00:01:44.579> you

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
all you have the general options you

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.419 
all you have the general options you
have<00:01:45.789> a<00:01:45.959> frame<00:01:46.959> per<00:01:47.140> sec<00:01:47.409> so<00:01:47.709> if<00:01:47.920> you<00:01:48.039> work<00:01:48.250> on

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
have a frame per sec so if you work on

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.219 
have a frame per sec so if you work on
movie<00:01:48.640> then<00:01:48.969> you<00:01:49.060> lose<00:01:49.299> 24<00:01:50.020> paper<00:01:50.289> stack<00:01:50.709> and

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
movie then you lose 24 paper stack and

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.660 
movie then you lose 24 paper stack and
commercials

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
commercials

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.600 
commercials
yes<00:01:55.049> 30<00:01:56.049> frames<00:01:56.349> per<00:01:56.409> second

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
yes 30 frames per second

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.149 
yes 30 frames per second
this<00:01:57.789> is<00:01:57.939> actually<00:01:58.629> pretty<00:01:59.200> useful<00:01:59.349> -<00:01:59.890> if<00:02:00.009> you

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
this is actually pretty useful - if you

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.979 
this is actually pretty useful - if you
wanna<00:02:00.310> have<00:02:00.399> speed<00:02:00.759> up<00:02:00.909> or<00:02:01.239> slow<00:02:01.299> down<00:02:02.819> water

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:03.989 
wanna have speed up or slow down water

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:09.509 
wanna have speed up or slow down water
fluids<00:02:05.099> it<00:02:06.099> depends<00:02:06.520> on<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:06.670> shot<00:02:06.909> and<00:02:08.519> when

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
fluids it depends on the shot and when

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.330 
fluids it depends on the shot and when
you<00:02:09.729> calculate<00:02:10.299> the<00:02:10.840> fluids<00:02:11.290> even<00:02:11.860> though<00:02:12.040> you

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
you calculate the fluids even though you

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.369 
you calculate the fluids even though you
speed<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.849> up<00:02:12.970> with<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.510> frame<00:02:13.750> per<00:02:13.930> second

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
speed it up with the frame per second

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.650 
speed it up with the frame per second
slow<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.709> down<00:02:14.739> with<00:02:15.129> this<00:02:15.310> frame<00:02:15.640> per<00:02:15.790> sec<00:02:16.090> it

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
slow it down with this frame per sec it

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.569 
slow it down with this frame per sec it
creates<00:02:17.079> frames<00:02:17.470> so<00:02:17.799> when<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.069> load<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.370> back

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
creates frames so when you load it back

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.630 
creates frames so when you load it back
to<00:02:18.790> your<00:02:18.910> preferred<00:02:19.780> 3d<00:02:20.170> application<00:02:20.890> then<00:02:21.519> it

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
to your preferred 3d application then it

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.589 
to your preferred 3d application then it
goes<00:02:21.849> every<00:02:22.209> frame<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.980> load<00:02:24.220> their<00:02:25.180> secret

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
goes every frame it load their secret

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:32.309 
goes every frame it load their secret
particle<00:02:26.379> sequence<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:30.480> so<00:02:31.480> your<00:02:31.840> fluid<00:02:32.230> is

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
particle sequence so so your fluid is

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.949 
particle sequence so so your fluid is
going<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.560> be<00:02:32.739> faster<00:02:35.250> but<00:02:36.250> it<00:02:37.000> behaves<00:02:37.269> like

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
going to be faster but it behaves like

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:45.150 
going to be faster but it behaves like
it<00:02:38.709> behaves<00:02:39.669> a<00:02:39.790> little<00:02:40.000> bit<00:02:40.090> out<00:02:40.269> of<00:02:40.480> world<00:02:44.160> not

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
it behaves a little bit out of world not

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.759 
it behaves a little bit out of world not
realistic<00:02:45.940> but<00:02:46.419> it's<00:02:47.230> our<00:02:47.650> direct<00:02:48.040> able

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
realistic but it's our direct able

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.559 
realistic but it's our direct able
because<00:02:50.769> if<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:51.579> can't<00:02:51.819> of<00:02:52.030> course<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.329> can't

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
because if you can't of course you can't

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.830 
because if you can't of course you can't
animate<00:02:52.870> this<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:54.730> can<00:02:54.940> just<00:02:55.150> set<00:02:55.419> it<00:02:55.569> but<00:02:55.750> you

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
animate this you can just set it but you

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.280 
animate this you can just set it but you
can<00:02:56.049> stop<00:02:56.319> at<00:02:56.500> any<00:02:56.590> time<00:02:56.739> so<00:02:57.160> I'm<00:02:57.370> sure<00:02:57.639> you<00:02:58.290> so

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
can stop at any time so I'm sure you so

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.620 
can stop at any time so I'm sure you so
right<00:02:59.530> now<00:02:59.620> you<00:02:59.709> have<00:02:59.739> 20<00:03:00.220> frame<00:03:00.489> per<00:03:00.669> this<00:03:00.910> 24

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
right now you have 20 frame per this 24

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.150 
right now you have 20 frame per this 24
frame<00:03:01.870> per<00:03:01.900> second<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.590> say<00:03:02.889> 12<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:04.720> means

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
frame per second you say 12 that means

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.930 
frame per second you say 12 that means
if<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.340> seen<00:03:06.639> it<00:03:06.819> the<00:03:07.720> particles<00:03:08.349> will<00:03:08.650> go

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
if you seen it the particles will go

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.059 
if you seen it the particles will go
faster<00:03:09.940> in<00:03:10.810> one<00:03:11.109> frame<00:03:11.440> they<00:03:11.709> called<00:03:11.980> the

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
faster in one frame they called the

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.569 
faster in one frame they called the
double<00:03:12.400> distance<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:14.620> it<00:03:15.069> was<00:03:15.280> going<00:03:15.549> like

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
double distance so it was going like

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.120 
double distance so it was going like
this<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.359> then<00:03:16.540> they<00:03:17.139> stopped<00:03:17.440> they<00:03:17.650> sped<00:03:17.980> up

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
this and then they stopped they sped up

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.420 
this and then they stopped they sped up
so<00:03:18.340> you<00:03:18.489> can<00:03:18.669> see<00:03:18.879> there's<00:03:19.030> a<00:03:19.060> big<00:03:19.239> job<00:03:19.510> I

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
so you can see there's a big job I

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.759 
so you can see there's a big job I
played<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:22.359> then<00:03:22.629> you<00:03:22.780> start<00:03:23.049> going<00:03:23.169> faster

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
played and then you start going faster

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.170 
played and then you start going faster
they<00:03:24.250> go

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
they go

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.729 
they go
you<00:03:25.750> can<00:03:25.959> do<00:03:26.080> these<00:03:26.260> little<00:03:26.500> tricks<00:03:26.860> that<00:03:27.129> you

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
you can do these little tricks that you

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.229 
you can do these little tricks that you
like<00:03:29.739> you<00:03:30.129> stop<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.489> same<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:31.030> then<00:03:31.150> you

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
like you stop the same and then you

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.759 
like you stop the same and then you
change<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.660> frame<00:03:31.840> per<00:03:32.019> second<00:03:32.500> then<00:03:32.620> you

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
change the frame per second then you

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.150 
change the frame per second then you
slowly<00:03:33.280> speed<00:03:33.879> it<00:03:33.970> up<00:03:34.680> there<00:03:35.680> is<00:03:35.769> no<00:03:35.800> other

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
slowly speed it up there is no other

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.119 
slowly speed it up there is no other
good<00:03:37.120> way<00:03:37.330> I<00:03:37.599> can't<00:03:38.110> really<00:03:38.319> plug<00:03:38.620> in<00:03:38.769> a<00:03:38.830> curve

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
good way I can't really plug in a curve

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.680 
good way I can't really plug in a curve
but<00:03:40.590> yeah<00:03:41.590> you<00:03:42.250> saw<00:03:42.489> that<00:03:42.640> you<00:03:42.849> just<00:03:43.360> speed<00:03:43.599> up

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
but yeah you saw that you just speed up

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.920 
but yeah you saw that you just speed up
or<00:03:44.349> slow<00:03:44.440> it<00:03:44.709> down<00:03:44.830> if<00:03:45.160> you<00:03:45.310> put<00:03:45.549> it<00:03:45.670> higher

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
or slow it down if you put it higher

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.500 
or slow it down if you put it higher
remember<00:03:47.069> now<00:03:48.069> thread<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:48.670> means<00:03:48.910> right<00:03:49.390> now

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
remember now thread that means right now

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.690 
remember now thread that means right now
I<00:03:49.540> have<00:03:49.660> only<00:03:49.690> one<00:03:49.959> thread<00:03:50.290> so<00:03:50.709> in<00:03:51.549> this

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
I have only one thread so in this

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.170 
I have only one thread so in this

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
means accepted input and this is how

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.860 
means accepted input and this is how
many<00:04:00.190> processors<00:04:00.700> you<00:04:00.880> want<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.180> use<00:04:01.360> you<00:04:01.840> can

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
many processors you want to use you can

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.720 
many processors you want to use you can
limit<00:04:02.319> the<00:04:02.470> processors<00:04:03.040> if<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.340> want<00:04:03.489> to<00:04:03.579> run

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
limit the processors if you want to run

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.650 
limit the processors if you want to run
to<00:04:03.940> your<00:04:04.720> flows<00:04:06.000> well<00:04:07.000> you<00:04:07.090> don't<00:04:07.209> have<00:04:07.360> like

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
to your flows well you don't have like

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:17.969 
to your flows well you don't have like
basically<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:15.700> then<00:04:15.910> integration<00:04:16.810> so<00:04:17.410> for

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
basically and then integration so for

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.039 
basically and then integration so for
the<00:04:18.130> fluid<00:04:18.519> simulations<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:19.570> particle

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
the fluid simulations the particle

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.050 
the fluid simulations the particle
simulations<00:04:20.229> and<00:04:20.979> the<00:04:21.130> grid<00:04:21.340> simulation<00:04:21.880> she

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
simulations and the grid simulation she

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.610 
simulations and the grid simulation she
is<00:04:22.240> adaptive<00:04:23.940> the<00:04:24.940> fixed<00:04:25.660> is<00:04:25.840> for<00:04:26.139> real<00:04:26.350> wave

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
is adaptive the fixed is for real wave

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.230 
is adaptive the fixed is for real wave
but<00:04:27.990> it's<00:04:28.990> fixed<00:04:29.470> now<00:04:29.530> so<00:04:30.070> adaptive<00:04:30.850> will<00:04:31.030> work

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
but it's fixed now so adaptive will work

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.770 
but it's fixed now so adaptive will work

course<00:05:18.460> you<00:05:18.580> have<00:05:18.700> to<00:05:18.940> increase<00:05:20.760> so<00:05:21.760> he<00:05:21.940> just

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.350 

goes<00:05:25.660> through<00:05:25.950> occasionally<00:05:26.950> like<00:05:27.250> a<00:05:27.520> flu

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
goes through occasionally like a flu

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.150 
goes through occasionally like a flu
fire<00:05:28.630> doesn't<00:05:29.169> do<00:05:29.260> this<00:05:29.349> anymore<00:05:29.680> but<00:05:29.979> left

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
fire doesn't do this anymore but left

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.670 
fire doesn't do this anymore but left
before<00:05:30.370> it<00:05:30.729> is<00:05:30.849> problem<00:05:31.270> that<00:05:31.479> if<00:05:31.960> it<00:05:32.169> reaches

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
before it is problem that if it reaches

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.790 
before it is problem that if it reaches
the

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.689 

I'm<00:05:38.800> not<00:05:38.979> sure<00:05:39.160> exactly

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
I'm not sure exactly

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:45.420 
I'm not sure exactly
I<00:05:40.060> think<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:44.050> sub<00:05:44.380> steps<00:05:44.710> are<00:05:44.949> not<00:05:45.099> enough

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
I think the sub steps are not enough

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.350 
I think the sub steps are not enough
then<00:05:45.729> it's<00:05:45.880> crashed<00:05:46.380> but<00:05:47.729> at<00:05:48.729> that<00:05:48.880> point<00:05:49.150> you

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
then it's crashed but at that point you

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.390 
then it's crashed but at that point you
can<00:05:49.539> just<00:05:49.750> back<00:05:49.870> up<00:05:50.080> couple<00:05:50.440> frames<00:05:50.710> and<00:05:51.069> then

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
can just back up couple frames and then

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.300 
can just back up couple frames and then
set<00:05:51.729> up<00:05:51.759> your<00:05:51.880> sub<00:05:52.300> steps<00:05:52.599> to<00:05:52.810> like<00:05:52.990> 40<00:05:53.800> and<00:05:54.160> it

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
set up your sub steps to like 40 and it

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.760 
set up your sub steps to like 40 and it
continues<00:05:54.940> simulation<00:05:55.569> will<00:05:56.080> keep<00:05:56.319> it<00:05:56.470> as<00:05:56.650> low

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
continues simulation will keep it as low

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.980 
continues simulation will keep it as low
as<00:05:56.919> possible<00:05:57.240> because<00:05:59.789> if<00:06:00.789> if<00:06:01.330> you<00:06:01.509> set<00:06:01.780> it<00:06:01.900> up

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
as possible because if if you set it up

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.040 
as possible because if if you set it up
high<00:06:02.410> usually<00:06:02.949> then<00:06:03.580> your<00:06:04.060> scene<00:06:04.330> is<00:06:04.449> really

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
high usually then your scene is really

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.909 
high usually then your scene is really
slow<00:06:05.500> okay<00:06:05.880> and<00:06:07.050> the<00:06:08.050> last<00:06:08.229> one<00:06:08.440> is<00:06:08.740> the

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
slow okay and the last one is the

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.950 
slow okay and the last one is the
rigidbody<00:06:09.370> slower<00:06:09.849> here<00:06:10.330> you<00:06:10.419> can<00:06:10.659> change

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
rigidbody slower here you can change

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.550 
rigidbody slower here you can change
what<00:06:13.050> quality<00:06:15.180> stimulation<00:06:16.180> you<00:06:16.210> want<00:06:16.659> with

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
what quality stimulation you want with

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.430 
what quality stimulation you want with
the<00:06:17.680> rigid<00:06:17.830> bodies<00:06:18.280> so<00:06:19.060> you<00:06:19.090> if<00:06:19.659> you<00:06:19.690> want<00:06:20.349> to

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
the rigid bodies so you if you want to

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.770 
the rigid bodies so you if you want to
do<00:06:20.590> just<00:06:20.620> a<00:06:21.009> test<00:06:21.280> with<00:06:21.610> a<00:06:21.639> little<00:06:22.060> mini<00:06:22.300> and

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
do just a test with a little mini and

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.050 
do just a test with a little mini and
then<00:06:22.960> and<00:06:23.349> then<00:06:23.680> you<00:06:23.889> want<00:06:24.069> to<00:06:24.190> refine<00:06:24.550> it<00:06:24.610> and

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
then and then you want to refine it and

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.839 
then and then you want to refine it and
and<00:06:25.360> the<00:06:26.050> final<00:06:26.470> simulation<00:06:27.009> you<00:06:27.490> want<00:06:27.729> to

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:27.849 
and the final simulation you want to

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:34.290 
and the final simulation you want to
high<00:06:28.060> high<00:06:30.720> collision<00:06:31.720> quality<00:06:32.550> so<00:06:33.550> basically

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
high high collision quality so basically

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.999 
high high collision quality so basically
this<00:06:34.539> is<00:06:34.720> it<00:06:36.599> here<00:06:37.599> you<00:06:38.229> should<00:06:38.409> keep<00:06:38.590> in<00:06:38.800> mind

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:39.009 
this is it here you should keep in mind

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:41.670 
this is it here you should keep in mind
well<00:06:39.550> you<00:06:40.330> want<00:06:40.479> to<00:06:40.509> make<00:06:40.599> sure<00:06:40.900> that<00:06:41.169> this<00:06:41.409> one

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
well you want to make sure that this one

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.700 
well you want to make sure that this one
is<00:06:43.889> let's<00:06:44.889> say<00:06:45.039> the<00:06:45.310> same<00:06:45.610> as<00:06:45.849> your<00:06:46.710> 3d

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
is let's say the same as your 3d

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.950 
is let's say the same as your 3d
application<00:06:49.440> frame<00:06:50.440> per<00:06:50.590> sec<00:06:51.659> so<00:06:52.659> you<00:06:52.719> don't

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 
application frame per sec so you don't

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.060 
application frame per sec so you don't
have<00:06:53.050> a<00:06:53.169> confusion<00:06:54.159> with<00:06:55.590> the<00:06:56.590> other<00:06:56.710> 3d

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.070 
have a confusion with the other 3d

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.180 
have a confusion with the other 3d
artists<00:06:57.610> and<00:06:58.349> you<00:06:59.349> don't<00:06:59.530> have<00:06:59.620> to<00:06:59.800> resume

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190 
artists and you don't have to resume

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.670 
artists and you don't have to resume
that<00:07:00.430> happens<00:07:00.820> a<00:07:00.880> lot<00:07:00.909> that<00:07:01.090> I<00:07:01.539> even<00:07:02.199> I<00:07:02.380> forgot

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 
that happens a lot that I even I forgot

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.890 
that happens a lot that I even I forgot
to<00:07:02.919> change<00:07:03.699> this<00:07:03.940> and<00:07:04.240> the<00:07:04.330> project<00:07:04.750> history

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:04.900 
to change this and the project history

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.320 
to change this and the project history
in<00:07:05.380> per<00:07:05.530> second<00:07:05.919> I<00:07:06.039> use<00:07:06.159> 24<00:07:06.729> and<00:07:06.969> then<00:07:07.090> we<00:07:07.210> have

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.330 
in per second I use 24 and then we have

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.589 
in per second I use 24 and then we have
to<00:07:07.479> race<00:07:07.659> in<00:07:07.870> it<00:07:08.020> and<00:07:08.849> try<00:07:09.849> to<00:07:09.969> keep<00:07:10.270> this<00:07:10.389> as

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599 
to race in it and try to keep this as

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:12.930 
to race in it and try to keep this as
low<00:07:10.750> as<00:07:10.900> possible<00:07:10.930> start<00:07:11.830> around<00:07:12.069> 30<00:07:12.430> and<00:07:12.789> they

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:12.940 
low as possible start around 30 and they

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:18.360 
low as possible start around 30 and they
go<00:07:13.180> up<00:07:13.360> higher<00:07:13.690> and<00:07:13.930> higher<00:07:14.110> I<00:07:16.919> usually<00:07:17.919> don't

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:18.370 
go up higher and higher I usually don't

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.570 
go up higher and higher I usually don't
even<00:07:18.520> go<00:07:18.789> about<00:07:19.090> 200

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:21.580
