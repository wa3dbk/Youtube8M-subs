now<00:00:25.650> these<00:00:26.519> price<00:00:26.849> we<00:00:27.449> obviously<00:00:27.630> line<00:00:27.990> them

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
now these price we obviously line them

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.839 
now these price we obviously line them
with<00:00:28.289> plastic<00:00:28.470> but<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.340> leave<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> bottom

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
with plastic but we leave the bottom

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.790 
with plastic but we leave the bottom
open<00:00:29.939> for<00:00:30.359> drainage<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:31.320> that<00:00:31.439> way<00:00:31.590> it

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
open for drainage so that way it

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
laying the nosy garden is using a bale

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.200 
laying the nosy garden is using a bale
of<00:00:37.320> grass<00:00:37.559> hay<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.730> get<00:00:38.879> from<00:00:39.030> any

the<00:00:42.120> idea<00:00:42.540> with<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.780> grass<00:00:42.960> hay<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.590> create

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the idea with the grass hay is to create

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.180 
the idea with the grass hay is to create
a<00:00:44.760> filter<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.510> all<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.320> water<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.860> all<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
a filter for all the water and all the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.650 
a filter for all the water and all the
soil<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.700> doesn't<00:00:47.879> spill<00:00:48.210> out<00:00:48.239> at<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.480> bottom

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
soil so doesn't spill out at the bottom

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.690 
soil so doesn't spill out at the bottom
as<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.410> breaks<00:00:49.620> down<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.950> also<00:00:50.100> feeds<00:00:50.489> with

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
as it breaks down it also feeds with

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.590 
as it breaks down it also feeds with
nutrients<00:00:52.430> the<00:00:53.430> next<00:00:53.699> layer<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.449> mushroom
