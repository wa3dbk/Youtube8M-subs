00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
today I'd like to talk about the simple

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.849 
today I'd like to talk about the simple
oil<00:00:02.490> change<00:00:02.870> well<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:03.990> oil<00:00:04.200> change<00:00:04.500> itself

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
oil change well the oil change itself

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.369 
oil change well the oil change itself
may<00:00:05.250> be<00:00:05.310> simple<00:00:05.759> Dave<00:00:05.970> but<00:00:06.779> there's<00:00:07.200> some

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
may be simple Dave but there's some

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.720 
may be simple Dave but there's some
pretty<00:00:07.680> important<00:00:08.160> things<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.550> know<00:00:08.700> about

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
pretty important things to know about

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.690 
pretty important things to know about
preventing<00:00:09.389> oil<00:00:09.599> sludge<00:00:10.170> okay<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:11.190> don't<00:00:11.550> want

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
preventing oil sludge okay I don't want

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.940 
preventing oil sludge okay I don't want
to<00:00:11.759> disrespect<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.480> oil<00:00:12.660> change<00:00:13.019> so<00:00:13.620> tell<00:00:13.920> us

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
to disrespect the oil change so tell us

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.400 
to disrespect the oil change so tell us
more<00:00:14.280> about<00:00:14.340> oil<00:00:14.820> sludge<00:00:15.150> well<00:00:15.839> oil

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
more about oil sludge well oil

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.170 
more about oil sludge well oil
eventually<00:00:17.100> turns<00:00:17.340> into<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.699> jelly-like

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
eventually turns into a jelly-like

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.320 
eventually turns into a jelly-like
sludge<00:00:18.869> now<00:00:19.590> sludge<00:00:19.980> clogs<00:00:20.400> up<00:00:20.609> oil<00:00:20.820> passages

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
sludge now sludge clogs up oil passages

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.269 
sludge now sludge clogs up oil passages
and<00:00:21.539> keeps<00:00:21.779> oil<00:00:21.990> from<00:00:22.230> getting<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.710> some<00:00:22.920> areas

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
and keeps oil from getting to some areas

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.279 
and keeps oil from getting to some areas
of<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.430> engine<00:00:23.850> causing<00:00:24.359> parts<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.960> wear<00:00:25.140> out

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
of the engine causing parts to wear out

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.529 
of the engine causing parts to wear out
prematurely<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.789> means<00:00:27.119> expensive

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
prematurely and that means expensive

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.050 
prematurely and that means expensive
engine<00:00:28.019> repairs<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:29.130> that's<00:00:29.400> why<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.730> need<00:00:30.029> to

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
engine repairs so that's why you need to

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.880 
engine repairs so that's why you need to
change<00:00:30.480> your<00:00:30.570> oil<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.140> oil<00:00:31.230> filter<00:00:31.410> on

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
change your oil and oil filter on

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.130 
change your oil and oil filter on
schedule<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.550> get<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.910> old<00:00:33.180> oil<00:00:33.420> out<00:00:33.719> before

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
schedule to get the old oil out before

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.440 
schedule to get the old oil out before
it<00:00:34.230> turns<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.649> sludge<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.460> got<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.910> your

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
it turns to sludge you got it your

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.549 
it turns to sludge you got it your
manufacturer<00:00:37.170> should<00:00:37.410> have<00:00:37.500> a

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
manufacturer should have a

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.110 
manufacturer should have a
recommendation<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:38.399> how<00:00:38.579> many<00:00:38.640> miles<00:00:38.969> you

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
recommendation for how many miles you

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.569 
recommendation for how many miles you
can<00:00:39.210> go<00:00:39.450> between<00:00:39.660> oil<00:00:39.960> changes<00:00:40.140> they<00:00:41.129> usually

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
can go between oil changes they usually

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.889 
can go between oil changes they usually
have<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:42.030> number<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.390> months<00:00:42.750> between

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
have a number of months between

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.200 
have a number of months between
recommended<00:00:43.620> oil<00:00:43.829> changes<00:00:44.309> that's<00:00:44.850> because

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
recommended oil changes that's because

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.910 
recommended oil changes that's because
detergents<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:45.989> other<00:00:46.140> additives<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
detergents and other additives in the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.610 
detergents and other additives in the
oil<00:00:47.100> break<00:00:47.760> down<00:00:48.000> over<00:00:48.030> time<00:00:48.300> many<00:00:49.230> automakers

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
oil break down over time many automakers

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.770 
oil break down over time many automakers
are<00:00:50.039> extending<00:00:50.640> their<00:00:50.789> oil<00:00:50.969> change<00:00:51.329> intervals

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
are extending their oil change intervals

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.720 
are extending their oil change intervals
that<00:00:52.260> makes<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.559> all<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.010> more<00:00:53.039> important<00:00:53.640> to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
that makes it all the more important to

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.090 
that makes it all the more important to
use<00:00:53.850> quality<00:00:54.539> oil<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.050> oil<00:00:55.170> filters<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.920> your

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
use quality oil and oil filters in your

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.639 
use quality oil and oil filters in your
vehicle<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:57.120> give<00:00:57.629> us<00:00:57.750> more<00:00:57.930> detail<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
vehicle so give us more detail on the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.160 
vehicle so give us more detail on the
recommended<00:00:59.309> oil<00:00:59.550> change<00:00:59.879> intervals<00:01:00.270> well<00:01:00.809> it

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
recommended oil change intervals well it

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.779 
recommended oil change intervals well it
can<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.440> complicated<00:01:01.800> your<00:01:02.489> owners<00:01:02.760> manual

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
can be complicated your owners manual

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.149 
can be complicated your owners manual
will<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> recommendation<00:01:03.930> for<00:01:04.559> time<00:01:04.920> and

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
will have a recommendation for time and

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.859 
will have a recommendation for time and
mileage<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.180> need<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.450> remember<00:01:06.540> that

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
mileage but you need to remember that

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.960 
mileage but you need to remember that
it's<00:01:07.020> based<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.560> using<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.460> recommended

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
it's based on using the recommended

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.210 
it's based on using the recommended
weight<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.540> oil<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.049> if<00:01:10.560> your<00:01:10.680> vehicle<00:01:10.860> came

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
weight of oil and if your vehicle came

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.370 
weight of oil and if your vehicle came
from<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> factory<00:01:11.820> with<00:01:12.060> synthetic<00:01:12.659> oil<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
from the factory with synthetic oil the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.140 
from the factory with synthetic oil the
recommended<00:01:13.920> intervals<00:01:14.189> assume<00:01:14.790> your

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
recommended intervals assume your

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.210 
recommended intervals assume your
continued<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.720> use<00:01:15.840> synthetic<00:01:16.130> what<00:01:17.130> about

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
continued to use synthetic what about

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.609 
continued to use synthetic what about
how<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.729> drive<00:01:18.240> does<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.960> affect<00:01:19.290> your<00:01:19.470> oil

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
how you drive does that affect your oil

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.830 
how you drive does that affect your oil
change<00:01:19.920> interval<00:01:20.310> yeah<00:01:20.759> how<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.210> drive<00:01:21.509> can

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
change interval yeah how you drive can

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.350 
change interval yeah how you drive can
have<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> big<00:01:22.409> effect<00:01:22.520> many<00:01:23.520> owners<00:01:23.759> manuals

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
have a big effect many owners manuals

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.060 
have a big effect many owners manuals
will<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> list<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.229> driving<00:01:25.619> conditions

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
will have a list of driving conditions

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.830 
will have a list of driving conditions
that<00:01:26.250> are<00:01:26.280> harder<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.790> your<00:01:26.909> vehicle<00:01:27.360> things

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
that are harder on your vehicle things

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.260 
that are harder on your vehicle things
like<00:01:28.110> stop<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.860> go<00:01:28.950> driving<00:01:29.430> shorter<00:01:30.000> trips

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
like stop and go driving shorter trips

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.749 
like stop and go driving shorter trips
driving<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.259> very<00:01:31.409> hot<00:01:31.710> or<00:01:31.979> very<00:01:32.009> cold<00:01:32.460> weather

heavy<00:01:33.450> loads<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.079> towing<00:01:34.530> if<00:01:34.680> some<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.490> your

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
heavy loads and towing if some of your

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.130 
heavy loads and towing if some of your
driving<00:01:35.790> fits<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.600> may<00:01:36.840> need<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.110> change

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
driving fits this you may need to change

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.960 
driving fits this you may need to change
your<00:01:37.500> oil<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.159> other<00:01:38.280> maintenance<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.909> a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
your oil and do other maintenance on a

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.390 
your oil and do other maintenance on a
shorter<00:01:39.479> schedule<00:01:39.900> okay<00:01:40.500> now<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:41.189> is

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
shorter schedule okay now that is

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.580 
shorter schedule okay now that is
starting<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.240> sound<00:01:42.450> more<00:01:42.630> complicated<00:01:43.350> it

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
starting to sound more complicated it
