00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.779
 we are immersed in the digital era and more and more young talents 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.660
 using the internet as a tool to publicize their work and reach 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.780
 so better your target audience this is the case of the British rock pop group 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.369
 they are young Valencians and in the broken gate in the music market thanks 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.860
 to his latest work entitled the imminent city a few weeks ago they saw 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.099
 a concert in madrid and we do not know I think the best thing is that 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.390
 let's listen to their music and let's see what they told us in the next story 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.360
 I call it more inward which is something that we are in that 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.479
 such is the second massacre of the two Rs are subjects a little friends do not I 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.280
 we touched on the concrete issue as seen 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.430
 that which takes us into account that we know that yes something must be done is 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.360
 puskar fabrics 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.740
 that alliance on the internet is that you have to do 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.729
 This year's semester date everything you can do to meet people 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:49.440
 best 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.680
 we just that pt before the chaos last villages and concerts or 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.570
 or that there are more delays 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.570
 - maestre are facebook are in tuenti be 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.770
 in bulls neza was missing 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.190
 javi warrior 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.680
 you can reverse a professional behind they were truncated in everything 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.549
 us so they will still be us but 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:09.710
 hopefully temporary 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.090
 now I enjoy aliens a cable orders from seeing things 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.849
 that state then all first album but you do not have a record 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:04.849
 behind no 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:05.700
 flowers 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.420
 the truth is that that is what I expect because it is a lot of money what we have 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.209
 invested because it is for the other students and such having no one behind 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.090
 that can not finance or ipc off of ces that this issue is to renew equipment is 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.850
 always improving and especially poking but it is for the subjects that is much 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:22.549
 money 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.979
 and then we made the effort and it seems that in the end bush 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:29.239
 it paid off which is what we were looking for a bit 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.739
 the project 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.390
 future or it's too early this Saturday promotion with this record 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.729
 powers the true 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:39.899
 In the short term we have the idea of ​​trying to sign for 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:41.799
 some record company 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.279
 I do not know maybe chin, no, there's nothing clear 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:45.899
 hold or maras mind 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:49.069
 so that the least help to find confident in a robbery 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.909
 and from there comes repeating a lot of delay in his honor well what 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.229
 first he founded his opponent but 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:58.459
 the in a serious disk and if you have to invest x invest 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.599
 or especially of a 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.219
 a quality disk 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:04.169
 we believe that until we have them 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.409
 simply that 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:06.689
 what we want to do 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:10.249
 in wait the best possible fight arises and we assume 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:14.059
 We want time and pipes in the end because if we have people behind us 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:15.889
 page to be all of that 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.340
 a cable massa after dinner all of us 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.009
 trotted that's why I think we're very young people hurt 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.009
 There is not enough money to face yourself on the banners 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.880
 then again to a disc that is indirect in asuán others will welcome nothing 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.580
 so 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.650
 fighting to sound for a good day and little by little go from the two almost 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.500
 full as it was is not the first time he faces this Saturday the great 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.309
 public 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:03.270
 - is that they can not say all 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.249
 It was 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:06.330
 Pancho is spectacular not 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.620
 it was in a cigar room so much of grinding people so that most 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.809
 friends but good and that was for us is to say 

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:16.930
 three hundred people in a room confirms the entity was spectacular 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.840
 I personally came out with quite a bit of respect and a bit of fear in mid 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.460
 and last boico moto2 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.180
 you get used to until manzanare happen they come already to touch of end what 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.949
 that says 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:30.150
 my dreams 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.150
 who dream of having a great stadium 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.479
 the first one added to see which world seedling 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.499
 in Spain 

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:42.249
 power hours to the brutal 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:45.989
 know that dreams depends on all we know touched a week ago a 

00:05:45.989 --> 00:05:48.699
 concert and that for us the fable such layoffs 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:52.690
 it depends on where or to go to your city there are moments that it is a dream and we have 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:56.939
 come out boschi we keep germany big headed i'm fulfilling we put on a dream 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:01.699
 of the uam and that is very long friesen now very difficult to opt in 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:03.189
 impossible since I get it but 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:06.819
 we set goals little by little and return return valero 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:10.340
 but at the moment Spain is a less-touched territory 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.229
 he was chased by the sipsa 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:13.349
 but 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:16.349
 little by little calmly good manners 

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:24.879
 now more than the calls of ap 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:31.440
 France
