00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.880 
time spent thinning seedlings later on I
love<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.420> concept<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:25.080> seed<00:00:25.289> tapes<00:00:25.560> but<00:00:25.859> I

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
love the concept of seed tapes but I

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.980 
love the concept of seed tapes but I
have<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> ton<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.699> seeds<00:00:27.300> at<00:00:27.510> my<00:00:27.630> own<00:00:27.750> house<00:00:27.960> that

going to make a bunch of my own seed
tapes<00:00:31.320> they<00:00:31.980> are<00:00:32.160> incredibly<00:00:32.850> easy<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.180> make

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
tapes they are incredibly easy to make

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.120 
tapes they are incredibly easy to make
and<00:00:33.660> with<00:00:33.840> supplies<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.380> already<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:35.010> at

and with supplies you already have at

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.950 
and with supplies you already have at
home<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.790> can<00:00:35.969> use<00:00:36.000> toilet<00:00:36.510> paper<00:00:36.660> or<00:00:36.930> paper

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960

towels

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.590 
towels
I<00:00:37.770> prefer<00:00:38.489> paper<00:00:38.670> towels<00:00:39.000> because<00:00:39.270> they're<00:00:39.570> a

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
I prefer paper towels because they're a

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.650 
I prefer paper towels because they're a
little<00:00:39.840> stiffer<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.969> don't<00:00:41.969> tear<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.300> easy

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
little stiffer and don't tear is easy

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.340

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
he except for at the perforation then a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.160 
he except for at the perforation then a
pair<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.620> scissors<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.489> pen<00:00:48.059> glue<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.870> seeds

pair of scissors a pen glue and seeds
the<00:00:49.860> first<00:00:50.100> thing<00:00:50.219> you'll<00:00:50.340> do<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.550> cut<00:00:50.760> strips

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the first thing you'll do is cut strips

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.670 
the first thing you'll do is cut strips
of<00:00:51.120> paper<00:00:51.239> towels<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:51.989> can<00:00:52.170> make<00:00:52.320> them<00:00:52.500> as

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
of paper towels and you can make them as

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.500 
of paper towels and you can make them as
long<00:00:52.739> as<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.219> want<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.699> don't<00:00:54.000> like<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.420> have

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
long as you want I don't like to have

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.420 
long as you want I don't like to have
the<00:00:54.719> perforation<00:00:55.170> anywhere<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.829> my<00:00:55.949> seed<00:00:56.190> tape

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
the perforation anywhere in my seed tape

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.670 
the perforation anywhere in my seed tape
because<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.910> can<00:00:57.090> make<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.420> easier<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.840> tear<00:00:58.109> so

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
because it can make it easier to tear so

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.770 
because it can make it easier to tear so
I<00:00:58.710> cut<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.219> way<00:00:59.430> instead<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.000> way<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
I cut this way instead of this way the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.360 
I cut this way instead of this way the
shorter<00:01:01.109> pieces<00:01:01.289> are<00:01:01.559> easier<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.920> store<00:01:02.219> as

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
shorter pieces are easier to store as

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.429 
shorter pieces are easier to store as
well<00:01:02.520> then<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.390> labeled<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.840> strip<00:01:04.110> with<00:01:04.260> what

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
well then I labeled a strip with what

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.649 
well then I labeled a strip with what
kind<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.680> seed<00:01:04.890> I'm<00:01:05.010> using<00:01:05.189> then<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.270> consult

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
kind of seed I'm using then I consult

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.330 
kind of seed I'm using then I consult
the<00:01:06.780> back<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.260> seed<00:01:07.470> packet<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.979> see<00:01:08.189> how

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the back of the seed packet to see how

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.010 
the back of the seed packet to see how
far<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.700> seeds<00:01:08.909> need<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.119> be<00:01:09.299> spaced<00:01:09.630> after

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
far the seeds need to be spaced after

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.929 
far the seeds need to be spaced after
they're<00:01:10.140> sinned<00:01:10.409> then<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.130> measure<00:01:11.460> or<00:01:11.729> just

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
they're sinned then I measure or just

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.820 
they're sinned then I measure or just
eyeball<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.600> make<00:01:12.960> marks<00:01:13.320> along<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
eyeball it and make marks along the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.010 
eyeball it and make marks along the
strips<00:01:14.130> where<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.520> seeds<00:01:14.729> need<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.060> then<00:01:15.930> I

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
strips where the seeds need to be then I

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.450 
strips where the seeds need to be then I
put<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> little<00:01:16.350> dot<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.740> glue<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:17.040> each<00:01:17.159> mark

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
put a little dot of glue on each mark

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.480 
put a little dot of glue on each mark
then<00:01:17.850> place<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> seat<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:19.070> now<00:01:20.070> you'll<00:01:20.430> want

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
then place a seat on it now you'll want

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.460 
then place a seat on it now you'll want
to<00:01:20.670> let<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.850> dry<00:01:20.939> completely<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.990> overnight

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
to let it dry completely like overnight

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.800 
to let it dry completely like overnight
then<00:01:23.009> store<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.310> in<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.549> box<00:01:23.790> or<00:01:24.030> ziploc<00:01:24.360> bag<00:01:24.600> in

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
then store it in a box or ziploc bag in

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.240 
then store it in a box or ziploc bag in
a<00:01:24.900> cool<00:01:25.140> dark<00:01:25.350> place<00:01:25.590> until<00:01:25.619> you're<00:01:26.040> ready<00:01:26.159> to

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
a cool dark place until you're ready to

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.340 
a cool dark place until you're ready to
plant<00:01:26.490> if<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.119> decide<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.479> make<00:01:27.689> long<00:01:27.990> seed

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
plant if you decide to make long seed

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.350 
plant if you decide to make long seed
tapes<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.770> can<00:01:29.040> use<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> empty<00:01:29.640> cardboard<00:01:30.150> to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
tapes you can use the empty cardboard to
