pretty<00:00:29.460> inaccurate<00:00:29.730> from<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.240> movie<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:30.539> I

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
pretty inaccurate from the movie so I

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.870 
pretty inaccurate from the movie so I
really<00:00:30.900> don't<00:00:31.050> care<00:00:31.189> anyway<00:00:32.189> there<00:00:32.520> are<00:00:32.610> three

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
really don't care anyway there are three

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.720 
really don't care anyway there are three
rooms<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.390> area<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.739> where<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
rooms in this area that where the

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.280 
rooms in this area that where the
enemies<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.239> there<00:00:36.420> if<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.870> make<00:00:37.050> too<00:00:37.260> much

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
enemies in there if you make too much

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.830 
enemies in there if you make too much
noise<00:00:37.410> they<00:00:38.190> will<00:00:38.340> actually<00:00:38.550> send<00:00:39.030> clones<00:00:39.570> of

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
noise they will actually send clones of

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.100 
noise they will actually send clones of
themselves<00:00:39.989> somehow<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.600> send<00:00:42.600> them<00:00:42.750> towards

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
themselves somehow and send them towards

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.319 
themselves somehow and send them towards
wherever<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> noise<00:00:43.680> comes<00:00:44.010> from<00:00:44.180> and<00:00:45.180> that

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
wherever the noise comes from and that

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.970 
wherever the noise comes from and that
gets<00:00:45.480> really<00:00:45.660> annoying<00:00:46.020> because<00:00:46.260> until<00:00:46.739> all

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
gets really annoying because until all

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.979 
gets really annoying because until all
the<00:00:47.280> enemies<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.879> room<00:00:48.030> are<00:00:48.180> dead<00:00:48.390> they

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
the enemies in that room are dead they

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.330 
the enemies in that room are dead they
can<00:00:49.170> keep<00:00:49.320> doing<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.980> there<00:00:50.100> was<00:00:50.219> this

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
can keep doing that and there was this

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.360 
can keep doing that and there was this
as<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> result<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.270> such<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:52.020> can't<00:00:52.350> use<00:00:52.649> many

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
as a result of such you can't use many

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.459 
as a result of such you can't use many
of<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.670> weapons<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.809> have<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.170> be<00:00:55.289> very

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
of the weapons so you have to be very

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.779 
of the weapons so you have to be very
careful<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.010> there's<00:00:56.190> actually<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.579> room

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
careful like there's actually a room

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.630 
careful like there's actually a room
that's<00:00:56.940> barely<00:00:57.600> outside<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.440> area<00:00:58.949> where

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
that's barely outside of this area where

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.630 
that's barely outside of this area where
there<00:00:59.850> are<00:01:00.000> enemies<00:01:00.420> who<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.690> regenerate<00:01:01.640> the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
there are enemies who can regenerate the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.910 
there are enemies who can regenerate the

plan<00:01:47.980> now<00:01:48.980> this<00:01:49.220> is<00:01:49.400> stupid<00:01:49.850> this<00:01:50.630> prophetic

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
plan now this is stupid this prophetic

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.780 
plan now this is stupid this prophetic
plan<00:01:51.290> also<00:01:51.500> involves<00:01:52.040> staring<00:01:52.430> at<00:01:52.550> his<00:01:52.640> watch

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
plan also involves staring at his watch

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.420 
plan also involves staring at his watch
for<00:01:53.000> a<00:01:53.030> couple<00:01:53.270> of<00:01:53.300> seconds<00:01:53.740> this<00:01:54.740> I<00:01:55.010> do<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.160> big

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
for a couple of seconds this I do a big

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.540 
for a couple of seconds this I do a big
mistake<00:01:55.610> here<00:01:56.020> I<00:01:57.020> don't<00:01:57.620> really<00:01:57.950> plan<00:01:58.220> it<00:01:58.430> out

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
mistake here I don't really plan it out

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.470 
mistake here I don't really plan it out
as<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:58.940> the<00:01:59.450> timing<00:01:59.840> of<00:02:00.170> my<00:02:00.410> of<00:02:00.680> my<00:02:00.760> as<00:02:01.760> timing

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480 
as to the timing of my of my as timing

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.470 
as to the timing of my of my as timing
of<00:02:02.600> where<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.170> guy<00:02:03.320> is<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:04.160> he's<00:02:04.910> almost<00:02:05.120> all

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
of where the guy is so he's almost all

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.780 
of where the guy is so he's almost all
the<00:02:05.750> way<00:02:05.840> across<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.410> hall<00:02:06.650> but<00:02:07.340> I<00:02:07.400> can<00:02:07.550> still

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
the way across the hall but I can still

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.400 
the way across the hall but I can still
get<00:02:07.940> him<00:02:08.030> with<00:02:08.179> my<00:02:08.330> knife<00:02:08.570> it's<00:02:08.840> just<00:02:09.050> really

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
get him with my knife it's just really

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.710 
get him with my knife it's just really
really<00:02:09.740> tricky<00:02:10.000> you<00:02:11.000> have<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.210> actually<00:02:11.330> aim<00:02:11.690> a

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
really tricky you have to actually aim a

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.720 
really tricky you have to actually aim a
little<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.530> left<00:02:12.800> of<00:02:12.980> him<00:02:13.220> for<00:02:13.550> whatever

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
little to the left of him for whatever

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.570 
little to the left of him for whatever
reason<00:02:14.530> because<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.740> knives<00:02:15.950> don't<00:02:16.220> work

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
reason because the knives don't work

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.790 
reason because the knives don't work
like<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.540> guns<00:02:17.780> do<00:02:18.020> they<00:02:18.170> don't<00:02:18.350> aim<00:02:18.560> dead

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
like the guns do they don't aim dead

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.010 
like the guns do they don't aim dead
center<00:02:19.130> but<00:02:19.250> anyway<00:02:19.550> I<00:02:19.580> did<00:02:19.760> get<00:02:20.090> him<00:02:20.240> he's<00:02:20.840> one

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
center but anyway I did get him he's one

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.330 
center but anyway I did get him he's one
of<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.170> weaker<00:02:21.470> enemies<00:02:21.860> in<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.100> game<00:02:22.310> I

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
of the weaker enemies in the game I

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.680 
of the weaker enemies in the game I
guess<00:02:22.640> they<00:02:22.790> gave<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.540> know

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
guess they gave you that you know

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.490 
guess they gave you that you know
obviously<00:02:24.110> because<00:02:26.110> they<00:02:27.110> gave<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.350> that

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
obviously because they gave you that

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.000 
obviously because they gave you that
anyway<00:02:28.280> um<00:02:28.640> that<00:02:29.390> guy<00:02:29.570> was<00:02:29.870> they<00:02:30.470> saw<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.800> guy

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
anyway um that guy was they saw the guy

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.890 
anyway um that guy was they saw the guy
get<00:02:31.220> killed<00:02:31.459> but<00:02:31.790> they<00:02:32.240> didn't<00:02:32.510> do<00:02:32.660> it<00:02:32.780> because

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
get killed but they didn't do it because

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.250 
get killed but they didn't do it because
of<00:02:33.080> noise<00:02:33.490> so<00:02:34.490> these<00:02:35.000> guys<00:02:35.270> are<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.780> real<00:02:35.990> guys

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
of noise so these guys are the real guys

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.440 
of noise so these guys are the real guys
in<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.590> room<00:02:36.950> these<00:02:37.340> aren't<00:02:37.550> clones

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
in the room these aren't clones

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.780 
in the room these aren't clones
believe<00:02:39.350> me<00:02:39.470> it<00:02:39.620> give<00:02:39.770> me<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:39.890> bitch<00:02:40.280> when<00:02:40.580> there

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
believe me it give me a bitch when there

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.760 
believe me it give me a bitch when there
are<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.660> clones<00:02:42.020> that<00:02:42.200> are<00:02:42.320> after<00:02:42.530> you

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
are the clones that are after you

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.530 
are the clones that are after you
because<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.640> guys<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:43.820> are<00:02:44.090> in<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.390> room

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
because the guys that are in the room

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.259 
because the guys that are in the room
are<00:02:44.810> still<00:02:45.110> in<00:02:45.290> there<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:46.400> now<00:02:46.580> I'm<00:02:46.970> being

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
careful I'm thinking somebody's gonna go

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.920 
careful I'm thinking somebody's gonna go
down<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:48.980> hallway<00:02:49.280> and<00:02:49.459> yeah<00:02:49.730> there<00:02:50.000> was<00:02:50.209> so

down the hallway and yeah there was so

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.030 
down the hallway and yeah there was so
I'm<00:02:50.989> hiding<00:02:51.260> behind<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.590> door<00:02:51.620> that's<00:02:51.980> been

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
I'm hiding behind the door that's been

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.800 
I'm hiding behind the door that's been
doing<00:02:52.250> my<00:02:52.370> standard<00:02:52.670> procedure<00:02:53.000> closing<00:02:53.720> the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
doing my standard procedure closing the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.930 
doing my standard procedure closing the
door<00:02:54.019> while<00:02:54.800> I'm<00:02:55.070> directly<00:02:55.400> behind<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:55.820> so

the knife so now I'm switching over to
the<00:07:07.430> Soviet<00:07:07.789> because<00:07:08.210> it<00:07:08.300> actually<00:07:08.539> zooms<00:07:08.960> in

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:09.139

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000 
a little bit and that's a little hard to

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.540 
a little bit and that's a little hard to
