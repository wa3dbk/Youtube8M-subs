00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.870
 some other ornament that you like wire 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.940

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.950
 little angel on the sheet of foami and 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.340
 we mark with a rule 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.340
 ah 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.390
 we do the same as many times as they are 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.470
 necessary depends on how many placemats 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:41.299
 you want since we mark the contour of 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.340
 our tablecloths we cut them measured 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.649
 our tablecloth to take the measurements of 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.780
 porterías mine measures 30 centimeters 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.280
 High 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.679
 we mark where our 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.720
 goal lines are 14 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.700
 centimeters wide by 10 centimeters 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.920
 High 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.740
 so I'm going to cut out the paper 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.649
 contact a strip of 34 centimeters of 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.649
 long by 2 centimeters wide 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.649
 ah 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.680
 from 34 centimeters strip we take 2 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.170
 of 10 and 1 of 14 and now we paste the 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.960
 I remind you that my tablecloth 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.150
 It is 30 centimeters high so 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.070
 10 centimeters strips place them 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.930
 in centimeters from 6 to 8 and 22 to 24 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.960
 leaving space for the strip of 14 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.260
 centimeters the procedure is repeated 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.350
 At the other end of the tablecloth we take the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.750
 center of the tablecloth we cut a strip of 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.300
 30 centimeters of contact paper 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.950
 height you have to keep this up we 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.950
 will serve to divide the court 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.850
 we paste it in the center 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:03.129
 to decorate it prints the figure of a 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:07.750
 ball and the ball in the goal we doubled 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:20.170
 the napkin in this way and we give it 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:23.709
 with a ribbon we cut a piece of 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.670
 wire we put it to the button and what 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:30.610
 we roll to the bar now we proceed to 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.650
 decorate the table for this I used 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.470
 simple and easy to get things 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.819
 how are these paper napkins to the 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.340
 that I gave them a different touch 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.739
 making some cuts with a scissor 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.840
 peak these are going to serve me to decorate 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.450
 my seedlings and simulate a path of 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.760
 table 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.709
 I also printed little flags that I fixed to 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.040
 toothpicks to put in the 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.040
 cupcakes 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.360
 and that's how the table looks 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.250
 how can you see everything I got in 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.580
 supermarkets as 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.920
 alonsitos de fútbol the bases of the 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.370
 balls in the central adornment are 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.690
 Salseras in very Mexican colors 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.459
 remember that if you are from another country the 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.570
 decoration should go according to the 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.570
 colors of your flag 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.110
 Y 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.790
 and what better occasion than this one to dress 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.790
 the shirt of your team 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.930
 I combined it with some shorts 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.670
 denim the structure that are very 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.200
 Fashion right now and very comfortable and some boots 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.090
 another way to use it is to take it by 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.670
 outside and so you give another place to your 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.860
 outfit
