00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.940
 finally going to drive 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.520
 the train that goes from Amsterdam to Paris 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.959
 runs in 3 hours and 13 minutes 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.580
 Rotterdam station are the 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.590
 expectations high 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.650
 Your heart knows that at 300 kilometers per hour 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.699
 so it's really very hard with a kind 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.050
 roller coaster this exciting yes the journey is 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.630
 very often by train but it is 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.609
 exciting such a first time so exactly on 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.169
 time the train station arrives 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.699
 it is a bit urgent at the entrance but 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.520
 once inside the party is over 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.590
 there is breakfast music and champagne because 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.790
 after months of delay is of course something 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.310
 to celebrate 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.110
 finally we drive then hey that full of them 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.520
 yet another memorable moment 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.170
 reason already on 7 September 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.030
 Amsterdam and Rotterdam but this is 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.650
 the first moment in the Netherlands 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.020
 connect to the high-speed network 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.790
 from europe we are now going with 300 kilometers 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.750
 per hour across the moerdijk bridge 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.790
 I really like that again 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.010
 for the Netherlands are the passengers 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.810
 fairly sober under the high speed 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.000
 the woman on the train now how 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.189
 like it after completely fantastic fun 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.540
 how does that feel at 300 kilometers per hour 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.640
 to drive 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.030
 very fast or very difficult young people 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.850
 but 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.320
 it's very comfortable and you have to 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.460
 Look out there or notice the brand there 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.740
 not much of it 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.110
 to your fullest you do not notice so 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.150
 itself well 200 is already 300 it 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.710
 the train is running during fast time 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.350
 only by our province 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.110
 He does not stop at Gouda Station yet 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.670
 just be patient the moment we the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.229
 Brussels also with the intercity on the 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.210
 high speed drive to succeed we will 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.460
 contributions to close on Antwerp 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.540
 is definitely going to happen when it ends 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.460
 next year we should have it 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.990
 they are actually arranged 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.090
 top 2010 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.590
 yes you know it would be so long for that 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.300
 already talking about that today 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.800
 ride this train and we'll talk about this 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.360
 a line that will be for 200 years 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.860
 approximately is laid out for questions before 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.020
 trains that will run for many years 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.880
 so these are normal ingrown scenarios 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.800
 that belong and that also applies to the 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.850
 train itself comes in two places 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.789
 standing still 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.310
 this passenger has the courage yes can 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.869
 happen what we do 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.670
 there may make a run 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.819
 Problem look maybe we will go again 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.819
 a 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.610
 unfortunately the train stopped after a while 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.660
 more than 25 minutes late, the train arrives 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.660
 in Antwerp
