what I've done is I went spent a day as

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.760 
what I've done is I went spent a day as
a<00:00:35.850> wheelchair<00:00:36.480> user<00:00:36.510> discovering<00:00:37.440> some<00:00:37.649> of

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
a wheelchair user discovering some of

a wheelchair user discovering some of
the<00:00:37.860> difficulties<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.879> person<00:00:39.270> with<00:00:39.719> a

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
the difficulties that a person with a

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:53.470 
the difficulties that a person with a
mobility<00:00:40.079> impairment<00:00:40.290> has<00:00:40.860> getting<00:00:41.309> around

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.299 

my<00:00:54.480> tooth<00:00:54.750> brushes<00:00:55.199> are<00:00:55.350> all<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> way<00:00:56.160> at<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
my tooth brushes are all the way at the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.849 
my tooth brushes are all the way at the
top<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.850> know<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.059> can't<00:00:57.329> reach<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.859> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
top so I know I can't reach that the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.529 
top so I know I can't reach that the
chair<00:00:59.129> itself<00:00:59.219> wouldn't<00:00:59.730> even<00:01:00.000> fit<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
chair itself wouldn't even fit in the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.479 
chair itself wouldn't even fit in the
bathroom<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.590> had<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.890> use<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.039> chair<00:01:02.340> all

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
bathroom if I had to use the chair all

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.969 
bathroom if I had to use the chair all
the<00:01:02.609> time<00:01:03.080> something<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.439> something

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
the time something that like something

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.170 
the time something that like something
would<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.250> change<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.850> would<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.060> to

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
would have to change we would have to

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.480 
would have to change we would have to
expand<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.659> doorway<00:01:07.110> after<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.040> got<00:01:08.220> dressed

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
expand the doorway after I got dressed

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.670 
expand the doorway after I got dressed
and<00:01:08.729> whatnot<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.630> able<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.840> wheel<00:01:10.020> out<00:01:10.140> into

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
and whatnot I was able to wheel out into

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.320 
and whatnot I was able to wheel out into
the<00:01:10.799> hallway<00:01:11.040> there<00:01:11.189> but<00:01:11.700> then<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.880> had<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.299> go

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the hallway there but then I had to go

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.810 
the hallway there but then I had to go
down<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> steps<00:01:13.040> my<00:01:14.040> office<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
down the steps my office is in the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:38.070 
down the steps my office is in the
basement

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.970 

the<00:01:39.080> the<00:01:40.120> right<00:01:41.120> way<00:01:41.360> that<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.780> kids<00:01:42.230> related

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
the the right way that the kids related

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.810 
the the right way that the kids related
to<00:01:43.130> me<00:01:43.310> was<00:01:43.490> different<00:01:43.940> mostly<00:01:44.510> because<00:01:44.720> of

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
to me was different mostly because of

00:01:45.820 --> 00:02:04.200 
to me was different mostly because of
how<00:01:46.820> active<00:01:47.330> we<00:01:47.540> are

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210

town most people drive so for the impact
for<00:02:13.030> me<00:02:13.200> yeah<00:02:14.200> as<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.530> wheelchair<00:02:15.069> user<00:02:15.100> I<00:02:15.430> would

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
for me yeah as a wheelchair user I would

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.610 
for me yeah as a wheelchair user I would
end<00:02:15.850> up<00:02:15.940> well<00:02:16.569> two<00:02:16.780> things<00:02:16.959> 1<00:02:17.260> i'd<00:02:17.440> probably

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
end up well two things 1 i'd probably

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.199 
end up well two things 1 i'd probably
get<00:02:17.920> a<00:02:17.980> different<00:02:18.160> car<00:02:18.459> because<00:02:18.850> I<00:02:18.880> Drive<00:02:19.150> a

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
get a different car because I Drive a

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.150 
get a different car because I Drive a
truck<00:02:19.420> right<00:02:19.720> now<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.410> so<00:02:20.590> getting<00:02:20.800> in<00:02:21.010> and

out<00:02:21.220> of<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.459> truck<00:02:21.670> was<00:02:21.850> difficult<00:02:22.390> but<00:02:22.840> more

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
out of the truck was difficult but more

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.140 
out of the truck was difficult but more
than<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.680> would<00:02:24.130> have<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:24.550> go<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.880> some

hundred and some dollars and then the

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.979 
hundred and some dollars and then the
controls<00:02:46.150> themselves<00:02:46.269> are<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.840> couple

thousand<00:02:47.470> dollars<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.890> get<00:02:47.980> installed<00:02:49.230> we

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
thousand dollars to get installed we

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.020 
thousand dollars to get installed we
decided<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.739> go<00:02:50.860> to<00:02:50.920> Dairy<00:02:51.190> Queen<00:02:51.459> just<00:02:51.940> to

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
decided to go to Dairy Queen just to

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.610 
decided to go to Dairy Queen just to
kind<00:02:52.239> of<00:02:52.300> see<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:52.810> know<00:02:53.080> what<00:02:53.350> it<00:02:53.440> would<00:02:53.560> be

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
kind of see you know what it would be

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.920 
kind of see you know what it would be
like

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.399 

and<00:02:59.230> I<00:02:59.950> don't<00:03:00.099> think<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.430> person<00:03:00.719> inside<00:03:01.719> even

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
and I don't think the person inside even

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:15.869 
and I don't think the person inside even
noticed<00:03:02.709> me<00:03:02.920> at<00:03:03.010> first

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.209 

can<00:03:16.879> you<00:03:17.000> get<00:03:17.150> up<00:03:17.269> there<00:03:17.299> so<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:18.439> think<00:03:18.980> I'll

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:19.219 
can you get up there so I think I'll

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:27.010 
can you get up there so I think I'll
just

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.800 

there<00:03:27.590> wouldn't<00:03:27.830> be<00:03:27.950> very<00:03:28.160> easy

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.839 

yeah<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:35.239> just<00:03:36.239> sit<00:03:36.390> here<00:03:36.569> you<00:03:37.380> know<00:03:37.470> it's<00:03:37.650> not

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
yeah I just sit here you know it's not

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.550 
yeah I just sit here you know it's not
the<00:03:38.849> end<00:03:39.330> of<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:39.630> world<00:03:39.780> by<00:03:39.989> any<00:03:40.080> means<00:03:40.290> those

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
the end of the world by any means those

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.380 
the end of the world by any means those
kinds<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.130> things<00:03:41.370> we<00:03:41.580> over<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.150> over<00:03:42.209> again

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
kinds of things we over and over again

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.460 
kinds of things we over and over again
throughout<00:03:42.660> your<00:03:42.900> day<00:03:43.080> we'd<00:03:43.290> become

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
throughout your day we'd become

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.460 
throughout your day we'd become
extremely<00:03:44.130> frustrating<00:03:45.440> from<00:03:46.440> a

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
extremely frustrating from a

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.550 
extremely frustrating from a
psychological<00:03:47.430> emotional<00:03:48.030> perspective<00:03:49.020> I

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
psychological emotional perspective I

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.270 
psychological emotional perspective I
guess<00:03:49.590> it's<00:03:50.370> just<00:03:50.780> difficult<00:03:51.780> to<00:03:52.349> have<00:03:52.920> people

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
guess it's just difficult to have people

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.479 
guess it's just difficult to have people
looking<00:03:53.519> down<00:03:53.760> at<00:03:54.300> at<00:03:54.810> you<00:03:55.080> all<00:03:55.260> day<00:03:55.500> not<00:03:56.280> that

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
looking down at at you all day not that

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:58.220 
looking down at at you all day not that
people<00:03:56.670> are<00:03:56.910> trying<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.330> be<00:03:57.420> condescending<00:03:58.140> in

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
people are trying to be condescending in

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.800 
people are trying to be condescending in
any<00:03:58.380> way<00:03:58.560> it's<00:03:59.130> just<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.670> reality<00:03:59.819> of<00:04:00.269> it<00:04:00.480> and

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
any way it's just the reality of it and

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.660 
any way it's just the reality of it and
I<00:04:01.650> think<00:04:02.040> that<00:04:02.190> would<00:04:02.280> be<00:04:02.340> something<00:04:02.519> that

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
I think that would be something that

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.280 
I think that would be something that
you'd<00:04:02.880> have<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.120> get<00:04:03.239> used<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.660> and<00:04:03.900> I<00:04:04.019> would

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
you'd have to get used to and I would

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.870 
you'd have to get used to and I would
imagine<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.890> some<00:04:05.160> people<00:04:05.430> get<00:04:05.519> used<00:04:05.790> to

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
imagine that some people get used to

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.850 
imagine that some people get used to
that<00:04:06.000> maybe<00:04:06.540> they<00:04:06.720> don't<00:04:06.900> there's<00:04:07.590> this

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
that maybe they don't there's this

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.580 
that maybe they don't there's this
physical<00:04:08.370> barrier<00:04:08.790> there<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.750> causes<00:04:10.350> other

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
physical barrier there that causes other

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.970 
physical barrier there that causes other
barriers<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.519> other<00:04:11.750> in<00:04:12.750> other<00:04:13.110> ways<00:04:13.380> would

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
barriers and other in other ways would

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.320 
barriers and other in other ways would
cause<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.489> not<00:04:14.640> be<00:04:14.910> able<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.120> interact

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
cause you to not be able to interact

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.710 
cause you to not be able to interact
with<00:04:15.540> other<00:04:15.780> people<00:04:16.139> as<00:04:16.320> easily<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:20.880> huge

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
with other people as easily the huge

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.840 
with other people as easily the huge
impact<00:04:22.169> of<00:04:22.350> course<00:04:22.590> would<00:04:22.770> be<00:04:22.800> just<00:04:23.400> on<00:04:23.580> that

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
impact of course would be just on that

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.080 
impact of course would be just on that
my<00:04:24.300> contribution<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.229> the<00:04:26.040> chores<00:04:26.580> around<00:04:26.880> the

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
my contribution to the chores around the

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.520 
my contribution to the chores around the
house<00:04:27.330> and<00:04:27.660> some<00:04:27.810> of<00:04:27.930> those<00:04:27.990> kinds<00:04:28.320> of<00:04:28.350> things

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
house and some of those kinds of things

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.080 
house and some of those kinds of things
my<00:04:28.770> wife<00:04:29.010> would<00:04:29.250> have<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.550> pick<00:04:29.729> up<00:04:29.910> all<00:04:30.060> of

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
my wife would have to pick up all of

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.480 
my wife would have to pick up all of
that<00:04:30.240> I<00:04:30.660> think<00:04:30.960> we<00:04:31.260> become<00:04:31.590> much<00:04:31.770> more<00:04:31.950> reliant

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
that I think we become much more reliant

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.780 
that I think we become much more reliant
on<00:04:32.610> others<00:04:33.479> which<00:04:34.229> is<00:04:34.440> difficult<00:04:35.250> I<00:04:35.430> think<00:04:35.490> for

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
on others which is difficult I think for

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.620 
on others which is difficult I think for
any<00:04:36.600> man<00:04:36.960> especially<00:04:37.350> maybe<00:04:38.070> to<00:04:38.630> experience

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
any man especially maybe to experience

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:48.490 
any man especially maybe to experience
that<00:04:39.900> I<00:04:44.240> would<00:04:45.240> imagine<00:04:46.610> that<00:04:47.610> some<00:04:48.060> of<00:04:48.180> the

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
that I would imagine that some of the

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.170 
that I would imagine that some of the
playing<00:04:49.500> catch<00:04:49.800> and<00:04:50.039> playing<00:04:50.310> basketball<00:04:51.000> and

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
playing catch and playing basketball and

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.310 
playing catch and playing basketball and
what<00:04:51.330> those<00:04:51.479> kinds<00:04:51.870> of<00:04:51.900> things<00:04:52.110> would

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
what those kinds of things would

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.520 
what those kinds of things would
probably<00:04:52.880> diminish<00:04:53.880> the<00:04:54.450> impact<00:04:54.870> of<00:04:55.080> using

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
probably diminish the impact of using

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.760 
probably diminish the impact of using
the<00:04:55.919> chair<00:04:56.160> to<00:04:56.340> get<00:04:56.490> around<00:04:56.789> was<00:04:57.770> quite

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
the chair to get around was quite

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.320 
the chair to get around was quite
surprising<00:04:59.190> i<00:04:59.370> think<00:04:59.580> even<00:04:59.820> more<00:04:59.970> than<00:05:00.150> what

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
surprising i think even more than what

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.870 
surprising i think even more than what
we<00:05:00.630> would<00:05:00.810> expect<00:05:00.840> obviously<00:05:01.710> expect<00:05:02.610> to<00:05:02.729> have

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
we would expect obviously expect to have

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.540 
we would expect obviously expect to have
some<00:05:03.090> changes<00:05:03.570> but<00:05:03.860> even<00:05:04.860> little<00:05:05.130> things<00:05:05.160> like

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
some changes but even little things like

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.110 
some changes but even little things like
being<00:05:06.270> able<00:05:06.450> to<00:05:06.630> reach<00:05:07.050> the<00:05:07.710> toothbrush<00:05:08.700> you

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
being able to reach the toothbrush you

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.940 
being able to reach the toothbrush you
know<00:05:09.240> in<00:05:09.389> the<00:05:09.419> bathroom<00:05:09.990> or<00:05:10.260> being<00:05:10.560> having<00:05:10.770> to

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
know in the bathroom or being having to

on how technology would be designed and

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.340 
on how technology would be designed and
I<00:05:48.770> think<00:05:49.040> anyone<00:05:49.490> who<00:05:49.850> is<00:05:50.090> thinking<00:05:50.840> about

I think anyone who is thinking about

I think anyone who is thinking about
