plug into the wiimote and then the

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.650 
plug into the wiimote and then the
wiimote<00:03:08.020> is<00:03:08.320> I'm<00:03:08.800> guessing<00:03:09.250> just<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:10.390> sits

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
controller because the classic

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.300 
controller because the classic
controller<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:14.200> doesn't<00:03:14.530> plug<00:03:14.710> into<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:15.010> Wii
