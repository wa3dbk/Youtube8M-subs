00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.219 
like that though that can really eat up
a<00:02:02.070> lot<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.340> system<00:02:02.700> bandwidth<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.810> if<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.079> have

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
a lot of system bandwidth so if you have

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.630 
a lot of system bandwidth so if you have
something<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.649> never<00:02:04.860> use<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.369> can<00:02:05.490> actually

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
something you never use you can actually

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.119 
something you never use you can actually
turn<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.119> off<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.869> just<00:02:07.049> click<00:02:07.979> the

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
turn that off you just click the

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.580 
turn that off you just click the
checkmark<00:02:08.369> here<00:02:09.090> actually

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
checkmark here actually

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.780 
checkmark here actually
to<00:02:10.800> run<00:02:10.979> this<00:02:11.129> program<00:02:11.340> as<00:02:11.670> administrator

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
to run this program as administrator

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.190 
to run this program as administrator
before<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:14.269> turn<00:02:15.269> that<00:02:15.420> off<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:15.989> I'll<00:02:16.080> go

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
before you can turn that off so I'll go

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.040 
before you can turn that off so I'll go
ahead<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:16.440> do<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.560> then<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:18.480> can<00:02:18.510> uncheck

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
ahead and do that then you can uncheck

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.210 
ahead and do that then you can uncheck
programs<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:21.349> next<00:02:22.349> time<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.620> boot<00:02:22.769> up<00:02:22.920> that

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
programs and next time you boot up that

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.770 
programs and next time you boot up that
one<00:02:23.340> will<00:02:23.519> not<00:02:23.640> start<00:02:23.970> up<00:02:24.120> I'm<00:02:24.390> gonna<00:02:24.540> go<00:02:24.690> ahead

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
one will not start up I'm gonna go ahead

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.210 
one will not start up I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:02:24.989> check<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.170> back<00:02:25.500> because<00:02:25.739> I<00:02:25.950> don't<00:02:26.010> want

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
and check that back because I don't want

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.259 
and check that back because I don't want
to<00:02:26.280> turn<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.519> off<00:02:28.640> but<00:02:29.640> there's<00:02:29.879> a<00:02:30.000> lot<00:02:30.180> of

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
to turn it off but there's a lot of

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.539 
to turn it off but there's a lot of
things<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.540> can<00:02:30.690> do<00:02:30.780> with<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:30.989> program<00:02:31.549> if

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
things you can do with this program if

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.400 
things you can do with this program if
you<00:02:32.700> see<00:02:32.910> programs<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.690> here<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.230> never

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
you see programs in here that you never

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.559 
you see programs in here that you never
use<00:02:34.680> they<00:02:35.099> used<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.549> use<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.879> Rhapsody<00:02:36.299> music

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
use they used to use the Rhapsody music

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.030 
use they used to use the Rhapsody music
player<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.810> lot<00:02:37.110> but<00:02:37.349> now<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.530> don't<00:02:37.739> use<00:02:37.890> it

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
player a lot but now you don't use it

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.430 
player a lot but now you don't use it
you<00:02:38.970> can<00:02:39.090> go<00:02:39.209> ahead<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.480> uncheck<00:02:39.599> it<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.080> stop

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
you can go ahead and uncheck it and stop

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.020 
you can go ahead and uncheck it and stop
it<00:02:40.590> from<00:02:40.620> loading<00:02:41.069> that<00:02:41.250> start<00:02:41.549> up<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.849> it'll

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
it from loading that start up and it'll

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.600 
it from loading that start up and it'll
save<00:02:42.209> you<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.360> lot<00:02:42.569> of<00:02:42.720> bandwidth<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:44.400> you'll

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
save you a lot of bandwidth and you'll

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.479 
save you a lot of bandwidth and you'll
boot<00:02:44.790> faster<00:02:45.030> consequently<00:02:46.190> now<00:02:47.190> there's

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
boot faster consequently now there's

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.130 
boot faster consequently now there's
other<00:02:47.640> things<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:48.030> can<00:02:48.209> look<00:02:48.390> at<00:02:48.599> you<00:02:48.959> can

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
other things you can look at you can

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.830 
other things you can look at you can
look<00:02:49.319> at<00:02:49.470> your<00:02:49.790> internet<00:02:50.790> explorer<00:02:51.360> plugins

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
look at your internet explorer plugins

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.380 
look at your internet explorer plugins
and<00:02:52.430> that's<00:02:53.430> everything<00:02:53.819> that<00:02:53.849> loads<00:02:54.090> when

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
and that's everything that loads when

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.690 
and that's everything that loads when
you<00:02:54.480> load<00:02:54.630> in<00:02:54.870> an<00:02:54.959> explorer<00:02:55.500> if<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.430> have<00:02:56.579> any

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
you load in an explorer if you have any

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.809 
you load in an explorer if you have any
weird<00:02:56.940> toolbars<00:02:57.540> or<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.799> know<00:02:58.920> Trojans<00:02:59.640> and

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
weird toolbars or you know Trojans and

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.789 
weird toolbars or you know Trojans and
virus<00:03:00.120> programs<00:03:00.599> they<00:03:00.989> might<00:03:01.170> show<00:03:01.410> up<00:03:01.560> right

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
virus programs they might show up right

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.920 
virus programs they might show up right
here<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.040> that's<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.459> good<00:03:02.579> place<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.790> look<00:03:03.060> and

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
here so that's a good place to look and

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.830 
here so that's a good place to look and
if<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.200> see<00:03:04.379> any<00:03:04.970> unidentified<00:03:05.970> programs

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
if you see any unidentified programs

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.020 
if you see any unidentified programs
over<00:03:07.049> here<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.349> log<00:03:07.530> in<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:08.519> can<00:03:08.670> uncheck

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
over here and log in you can uncheck

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.670 
over here and log in you can uncheck
those<00:03:09.209> as<00:03:09.390> well<00:03:09.540> now<00:03:09.930> they<00:03:10.079> may<00:03:10.200> come<00:03:10.440> back

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
those as well now they may come back

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.210 
those as well now they may come back
depending<00:03:11.459> on<00:03:11.519> how<00:03:11.700> robust<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.209> virus<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:13.220> but

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
depending on how robust the virus is but

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.289 
depending on how robust the virus is but
does<00:03:14.340> at<00:03:14.459> least<00:03:14.489> give<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:14.940> starting

does at least give you a starting

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.520 
does at least give you a starting
important<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:15.690> know<00:03:15.810> that<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:16.079> have<00:03:16.290> some

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
important to know that you have some
