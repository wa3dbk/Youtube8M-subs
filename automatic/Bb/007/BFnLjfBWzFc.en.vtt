00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.790

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.080
 or the good thing about all physical mantis people 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.869
 today I want to show you a new thing that 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.349
 makes our friend ailerons the pen of 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.040
 jean as my friend says check the 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.680
 parsley 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.930
 see what he does we are going to do caixa 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.150
 here with your respective 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:35.420
 caramelitos you have it here where they are 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.730
 the weapons these and now say with leroy 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.120
 I can save myself from riding all the 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.149
 waters because that's what the jorge does 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.140
 three weapons of the five that there is catch 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:50.960
 three and you mount three weapons in a row without 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.880
 have to go to ride it is worth 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.970
 true that in another range in the money 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.790
 doing the pizza thing is true 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:02.660
 He saves you time and puts you three 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.790
 weapons and tea will put the random 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.850
 let him out of the very pinion 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.830
 fixed that he likes it or is not what 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.050
 forget that asks you to put this 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.050
 put the other one because it is not going to put the 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:19.850
 caution why I tell you so stupid 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:22.610
 it is not then people what is said we already have 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.380
 the luck of being able to know that he so 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.840
 less to ride the souls that you do not have 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.850
 to mount the ones that if it's true that 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.190
 earn money with chalk but if you 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.100
 saves time in riding the highs and is 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.020
 One more thing is already known to him 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.479
 eave and leroy and is the clever uncle 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.180
 because the fist of organized is what 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.890
 I usually put less because he knows 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.990
 the colleague that when we had them 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.420
 we're going to give them the whiplash in 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.640
 the ass that is going to fall then says 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:55.310
 I had whippings to the fist and 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:58.640
 organized by I do not put everything 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.840
 randomly everything neither one thing nor another 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.299
 thing lies all equally 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.619
 is that you do it you're going to get 3 and 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.750
 good people at least we will have 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.849
 we have this opportunity to be able to take 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.289
 the most rapid weapons that do not mount them 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.660
 mind in this we are doing three things 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.069
 I hope you like it and you know how to give it 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.269
 like they subscribed and until the next 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.989
