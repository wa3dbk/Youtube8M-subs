00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.250
 that's sherlock holmes meanwhile in 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.570
 frack schiebt big adventure 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.760
 newest part, however, makes a lot 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.500
 unlike his predecessors rather than one 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.359
 big complicated case to crack 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.460
 Holmes only scores in six this time 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.570
 minor matters not 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.939
 linked together 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.650
 Basically you play six in it 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.240
 closed thriller short stories with 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.790
 two to three play hours each 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.260
 and that is at the expense of the tension 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.730
 Although cases are well written and 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.380
 match with your mix of murder 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.540
 cover up mystery 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.760
 book template by the short game time 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.930
 per chapter makes it hard sometimes so 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.260
 right in these stories 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.260
 immerse 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.840
 that's what the game scores with 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.280
 interesting characters the 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.020
 suspects and witnesses are good 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.450
 written and clean in English 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.010
 There is a German voice over there 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.630
 unfortunately not with it 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:28.450
 subtitles come here opaque 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:30.160
 figures well over in a new mini 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.410
 We are allowed to play the characters 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.150
 examine small suspicious details 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.460
 that then switches more talk 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.140
 The option is completely playful 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.270
 Although super simple but implemented 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.270
 after all, looks really chic 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.440
 We use your some of these details 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:08.690
 to uncover dialogues and contradictions 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:10.759
 and lie to expose important 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.920
 findings automatically end up in one 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.840
 new evidence menu here must be like that 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.770
 indices combine nothing with us 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.510
 can do wrong 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.910
 we just try so long through 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.800
 it fits out then such arise 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.300
 send charts in which the game 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.580
 automatically the evidence to 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.660
 Conclusion connects so we can 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.280
 a suspect as a culprit 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.590
 accuse and end the case 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.900
 optionally are distributed with or 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.670
 strictly a purely moral decision 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:42.470
 the playful but zero impact 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:43.880
 has the clou on the system but that is 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.730
 we some facts in two ways 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.560
 Depending on the result, it can be interpreted 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.970
 then new connections from others 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.110
 from murder weapons to completely 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.330
 different tappers 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.830
 that's cool because we like the game 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.780
 never guilty on the silver plate 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.459
 so we have to put on our 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.140
 trust and abdominal feeling 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.980
 In the worst case, we will send it completely 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.980
 innocent in the kittchen 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.409
 the actual detective work falls 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.060
 on the other hand sobering from mostly rattling 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.950
 We only point out the locations 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.110
 without us thinking much about it 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.180
 would have to look click the rest 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.069
 the game itself does the inventory 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.689
 We do not manage ourselves 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.560
 only the old use this is the game 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.420
 just allowed 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.040
 that's why we rarely feel that way 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.170
 to also determine manila chatting 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.909
 Meet the meter also measures the robbens 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.190
 many video games deal with more than 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.480
 really to entertain but at least 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.459
 they are quite varied and 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.290
 much fairer than the tricky predecessor 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.760
 and who on such things at all 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.420
 she has no desire because she can easily 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.420
 skip 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.099
 do not worry about proper action sequences 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.690
 Although we do not often have to 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.250
 but sometimes aim more precisely or one 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.000
 reaction sequence is also the right one 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.040
 Mood 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.870
 All in all, one remains sooner 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.660
 calm adventure and that 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.160
 never really the feeling of tension 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.050
 Instead, we had at 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.190
 some tasks rather the impression that 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.890
 they sell us for stupid 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.360
 instead of crisp detective work right 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.709
 Often it's easy on everything 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.459
 it will already click at the end 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.459
 somehow fit 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.970
 Torfrau 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.970
 that says j 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.620
 hd there is also the faithful doctor 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.390
 watson does not have much more this time 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.280
 do as to date afterwards 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.720
 He comes only once in the entire game 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.460
 for a puzzle to use 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.260
 otherwise its function is limited 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:50.780
 comment out and in the way conversion 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:52.820
 there is simply given away in the potential 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.320
 Contrary to the book template comes to us 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.990
 this sherlock holmes something to 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.910
 smoothed and bravely over from his 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.770
 infectious enthusiasm this 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.480
 obsession borders and ingenious i ity 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.310
 serves as a fictional character made famous 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.290
 Unfortunately you only notice in the game 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.120
 that's a shame, because in some 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.590
 cool see his 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.840
 eccentric characteristics quite 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.610
 but usually it remains only with 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.380
 such good approaches from which the 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.040
 authors simply have a lot more 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.040
 to be able to get out 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.630
 thanks to unreal engine 3 is krems and 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.640
 punishment by far the most beautiful 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.440
 sherlock adventure so far the 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.510
 characters are believably designed and 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.130
 Exploring the environment works 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.690
 rich in detail and the lighting effects 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.490
 can be seen right 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.930
 Unfortunately, the levels are too 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.640
 pretty lifeless 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.380
 End pcs are then rarely 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.930
 look and if they are so 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.210
 mostly only the area rumiger alive 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.930
 sections as in the predecessor 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.670
 Game characters also ran up 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.340
 worries were replaced without replacement 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.570
 annoying is also that 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.400
 we often between the little ones 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.840
 change scenes 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.890
 that makes for longer and longer 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.890
 charging interruption 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:07.010
 the new holmes makes so much but 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.870
 not all right the part is playing 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.820
 good is visually strong and atmospheric 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.590
 but story and gameplay also have theirs 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.300
 weaken the six points 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.190
 short stories with good ideas and 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.600
 interesting characters are nevertheless tension 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.900
 or dramatic we have to go with it 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.260
 as well as a captivating main character 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.300
 playful is the us 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.980
 investigation work to shallow only 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.080
 the original proof guide it stings 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.550
 really out that's a really cool one 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.100
 hopefully that will also be featured in the next one 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.200
 Part again comes to the employment nevertheless 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.330
 walls new holmes in the end only good and 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.220
 not great, we hope 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.750
 but very much that block west anyway 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.750
 busy at the eighth part works
