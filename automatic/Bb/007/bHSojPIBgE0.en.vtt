the ground balance of the the of the
area<00:01:41.170> so<00:01:41.860> we<00:01:42.009> also<00:01:42.160> have<00:01:42.429> our<00:01:42.610> an<00:01:42.789> tell<00:01:43.000> the

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
area so we also have our an tell the

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.680 
area so we also have our an tell the
other<00:01:43.810> team<00:01:44.020> put<00:01:44.229> in<00:01:44.380> there<00:01:44.590> in<00:01:45.039> the<00:01:45.489> on<00:01:46.479> the

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
other team put in there in the on the

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.559 
other team put in there in the on the
soil<00:01:46.929> now<00:01:47.800> it<00:01:48.069> is<00:01:48.250> such<00:01:48.429> a<00:01:48.459> we<00:01:48.700> wait<00:01:48.880> for<00:01:49.119> 15

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
soil now it is such a we wait for 15

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.960 
soil now it is such a we wait for 15
minutes<00:01:49.869> so<00:01:50.380> that<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:51.099> machine<00:01:51.429> knows<00:01:51.640> the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
minutes so that the machine knows the

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.770 
minutes so that the machine knows the
ground<00:01:52.239> what<00:01:53.110> type<00:01:53.319> of<00:01:53.349> girl<00:01:53.770> is<00:01:53.950> it<00:01:54.569> what<00:01:55.569> is

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
ground what type of girl is it what is

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.680 
ground what type of girl is it what is
it<00:01:55.840> clay<00:01:56.289> soil<00:01:56.619> or<00:01:57.009> we<00:01:57.819> want<00:01:58.030> to<00:01:58.119> see<00:01:58.300> which

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
it clay soil or we want to see which

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.160 
it clay soil or we want to see which
type<00:01:58.959> and<00:01:59.229> then<00:01:59.410> we<00:01:59.950> have<00:02:00.160> our<00:02:00.310> antennas<00:02:00.819> here

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
type and then we have our antennas here

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.619 
type and then we have our antennas here
and<00:02:02.170> now<00:02:02.739> we<00:02:02.800> take<00:02:03.069> this<00:02:03.310> one<00:02:03.550> and<00:02:04.209> we<00:02:04.330> assert

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:04.629 
and now we take this one and we assert

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:08.040 
and now we take this one and we assert
here

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.150 

and<00:02:09.520> then<00:02:10.520> what<00:02:11.150> we<00:02:11.270> will<00:02:11.390> do<00:02:11.570> is<00:02:12.160> protect

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
and then what we will do is protect

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.890 
and then what we will do is protect
three<00:02:13.490> steps<00:02:13.820> from<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.300> machine<00:02:16.600> after<00:02:17.600> you

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
three steps from the machine after you

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.170 
three steps from the machine after you
take<00:02:18.140> three<00:02:18.410> steps<00:02:18.980> from<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.340> machine<00:02:19.640> you

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
take three steps from the machine you

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.210 
take three steps from the machine you
take<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:20.570> are<00:02:20.720> antennas<00:02:21.650> like<00:02:21.800> this<00:02:22.070> your

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
take you are antennas like this your

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.980 
take you are antennas like this your
whole<00:02:22.370> like<00:02:22.550> this<00:02:22.760> your<00:02:22.910> antennas<00:02:23.270> then<00:02:23.840> you

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
whole like this your antennas then you

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.070 
whole like this your antennas then you
move<00:02:24.290> around<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.920> machine<00:02:25.720> sack<00:02:26.720> Holloway

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
move around the machine sack Holloway

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:35.400 
move around the machine sack Holloway
founder<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.710> machine

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.810 

this<00:02:36.410> one<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.650> directing<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.250> on<00:02:37.460> this<00:02:37.640> side

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
this one is directing you on this side

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.120 
this one is directing you on this side
so<00:02:38.240> it<00:02:38.450> means<00:02:38.810> that<00:02:38.960> target<00:02:39.470> is<00:02:39.650> on<00:02:39.770> this<00:02:39.920> side

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
so it means that target is on this side

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.800 
so it means that target is on this side
so<00:02:40.670> what<00:02:40.820> you<00:02:40.970> do<00:02:41.120> is<00:02:41.270> you<00:02:41.390> have<00:02:41.510> two<00:02:41.660> options

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
so what you do is you have two options

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.800 
so what you do is you have two options
either<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.890> go<00:02:43.220> straight<00:02:43.490> or<00:02:43.910> you<00:02:44.360> got<00:02:44.600> zig

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
either you go straight or you got zig

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.710 
either you go straight or you got zig
zag<00:02:45.020> you<00:02:45.620> go<00:02:45.800> like<00:02:45.980> this<00:02:46.010> or<00:02:46.880> you<00:02:47.330> can<00:02:47.510> go

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
zag you go like this or you can go

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.280 
zag you go like this or you can go
straight<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.850> where<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:50.240> good

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
straight to where the good

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.950 
straight to where the good
it<00:02:51.590> is<00:02:51.770> directing<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.400> now<00:02:53.300> let<00:02:53.570> us<00:02:53.720> go

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:53.960 
it is directing you now let us go

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.140 
it is directing you now let us go
straight<00:02:54.350> for<00:02:54.710> example<00:02:55.100> you<00:02:55.700> go<00:02:55.910> like<00:02:56.120> this

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
straight for example you go like this

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.410 
straight for example you go like this
and<00:02:56.800> then<00:02:57.800> you<00:02:58.100> go<00:02:58.280> like<00:02:58.430> this<00:02:58.490> and<00:02:58.940> then<00:02:59.270> it<00:02:59.390> is

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
and then you go like this and then it is

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.270 
and then you go like this and then it is
directing<00:03:00.020> us<00:03:00.140> like<00:03:00.320> this<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:00.740> you<00:03:00.800> have<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:01.070> go

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
directing us like this so you have to go

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.560 
directing us like this so you have to go
like<00:03:01.490> this<00:03:01.670> again<00:03:03.010> then<00:03:04.010> like<00:03:04.280> this<00:03:04.520> then<00:03:05.300> it's

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
like this again then like this then it's

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.920 
like this again then like this then it's
a<00:03:05.660> direct<00:03:05.990> view<00:03:06.140> like<00:03:06.380> this<00:03:06.560> you<00:03:07.400> go<00:03:07.610> like<00:03:07.790> this

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.199 

well<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:11.959> find<00:03:12.380> like<00:03:12.950> this<00:03:13.160> it<00:03:13.520> is<00:03:13.580> crossing

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
well you find like this it is crossing

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.520 
well you find like this it is crossing
that<00:03:14.690> means<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:16.220> gold<00:03:16.459> is<00:03:16.640> here<00:03:17.320> this<00:03:18.320> is<00:03:18.440> the

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
that means the gold is here this is the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.500 
that means the gold is here this is the
target<00:03:18.770> where<00:03:19.220> you<00:03:19.340> find<00:03:19.610> then<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:20.209> thing<00:03:20.390> is

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
target where you find then the thing is

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.500 
target where you find then the thing is
crossing<00:03:20.989> this<00:03:21.440> is<00:03:21.590> where<00:03:21.770> the<00:03:22.100> target<00:03:22.489> is<00:03:22.670> so

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
crossing this is where the target is so

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.500 
crossing this is where the target is so
to<00:03:23.989> make<00:03:24.140> sure<00:03:24.320> this<00:03:24.739> target<00:03:25.160> you<00:03:25.910> make<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.270> mark

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
to make sure this target you make a mark

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.010 
to make sure this target you make a mark
on<00:03:27.020> the<00:03:27.170> ground<00:03:27.440> you<00:03:27.650> put<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.040> mark<00:03:28.340> there<00:03:29.020> the

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
on the ground you put a mark there the

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.260 
on the ground you put a mark there the
target<00:03:30.350> what<00:03:30.560> you<00:03:30.709> do<00:03:30.830> is<00:03:31.010> we<00:03:31.250> move<00:03:31.430> nine<00:03:31.760> steps

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
target what you do is we move nine steps

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.870 
target what you do is we move nine steps
1<00:03:32.630> 2<00:03:33.410> 3<00:03:34.100> 4<00:03:35.060> 5<00:03:35.810> let<00:03:36.500> us<00:03:36.530> say<00:03:36.830> for<00:03:37.040> example<00:03:37.070> this<00:03:37.670> is

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
1 2 3 4 5 let us say for example this is

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.500 
1 2 3 4 5 let us say for example this is
where<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.900> target<00:03:39.260> is<00:03:39.550> this<00:03:40.550> is<00:03:40.700> where<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.330> 9

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
where the target is this is where the 9

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.380 
where the target is this is where the 9
steps<00:03:41.900> are<00:03:42.050> centered<00:03:42.380> we<00:03:42.590> tell<00:03:42.860> all<00:03:43.070> our<00:03:43.390> we

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
steps are centered we tell all our we

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.750 
steps are centered we tell all our we
tell<00:03:44.600> all<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:45.019> filter<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:45.650> then<00:03:46.220> we<00:03:46.430> put<00:03:46.640> it

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
tell all the filter and then we put it

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.150 
tell all the filter and then we put it
here<00:03:47.350> go<00:03:48.350> to<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.590> filter<00:03:48.800> area<00:03:49.070> and<00:03:50.230> then<00:03:51.230> we

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
here go to the filter area and then we

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.000 
here go to the filter area and then we
put<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:52.580> filter<00:03:52.880> there<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.269> then<00:03:54.260> we<00:03:54.800> go

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
put to the filter there and then we go

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.410 
put to the filter there and then we go
back<00:03:55.220> to<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:56.690> where<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:57.110> target<00:03:57.470> was<00:03:58.420> let

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
back to the to where the target was let

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.210 
back to the to where the target was let
us<00:03:59.540> say<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.870> target<00:04:00.170> was<00:04:00.350> here<00:04:00.560> now<00:04:00.860> we<00:04:01.040> count

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
us say the target was here now we count

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.150 
us say the target was here now we count
one<00:04:01.940> two

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
one two

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.840 
one two
three<00:04:03.990> line<00:04:04.990> for<00:04:05.290> example<00:04:05.440> here<00:04:05.890> we<00:04:06.490> put<00:04:06.670> it

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
three line for example here we put it

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:16.350 
three line for example here we put it
here<00:04:12.420> and<00:04:13.420> then<00:04:14.070> we<00:04:15.070> remove<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.400> antenna<00:04:15.610> then

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.360 
here and then we remove the antenna then

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.930 
here and then we remove the antenna then
we<00:04:16.660> go<00:04:16.840> back<00:04:17.080> we<00:04:17.920> go<00:04:17.950> back<00:04:18.310> to<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.610> machine

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
we go back we go back to the machine

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.570 
we go back we go back to the machine
with<00:04:19.480> our<00:04:19.660> antennas<00:04:20.200> we'll<00:04:21.040> go<00:04:21.160> back<00:04:21.340> to<00:04:21.459> the

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
with our antennas we'll go back to the

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:27.810 
with our antennas we'll go back to the
machine

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.930 

yeah<00:04:28.420> with<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.810> machine<00:04:29.110> we<00:04:30.040> count<00:04:30.310> three

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
yeah with the machine we count three

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.580 
yeah with the machine we count three
steps<00:04:31.300> from<00:04:31.450> the<00:04:31.660> machines<00:04:31.990> one<00:04:34.020> then<00:04:35.020> we<00:04:35.350> got

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
steps from the machines one then we got

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.150 
steps from the machines one then we got
off<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.890> machine<00:04:36.250> and<00:04:36.400> we<00:04:36.520> check<00:04:36.840> we<00:04:37.840> check

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
off the machine and we check we check

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.710 
off the machine and we check we check
whether<00:04:39.160> the<00:04:39.340> antenna<00:04:39.760> will<00:04:39.970> head<00:04:40.300> us<00:04:40.480> there

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
whether the antenna will head us there

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.790 
whether the antenna will head us there
when<00:04:41.350> we<00:04:41.500> are<00:04:41.530> moving<00:04:41.770> if<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:43.720> antenna<00:04:44.020> direct

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
when we are moving if the antenna direct

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.180 
when we are moving if the antenna direct
us<00:04:44.920> to<00:04:45.160> the<00:04:45.250> filter<00:04:45.640> it<00:04:46.390> means<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:47.140> the<00:04:47.830> target

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
us to the filter it means the the target

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.140 
us to the filter it means the the target
was<00:04:48.430> wrong<00:04:48.700> if<00:04:49.600> it<00:04:50.020> it<00:04:50.800> direct<00:04:51.730> us<00:04:51.880> to<00:04:52.120> the

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
was wrong if it it direct us to the

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.170 
was wrong if it it direct us to the
target<00:04:52.660> so<00:04:53.290> the<00:04:53.470> target<00:04:53.770> is<00:04:53.890> correct<00:04:54.220> so

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
target so the target is correct so

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.690 
target so the target is correct so
that's<00:04:55.510> what<00:04:55.780> we<00:04:56.020> how<00:04:56.350> we<00:04:56.380> know<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:58.210> exactly
