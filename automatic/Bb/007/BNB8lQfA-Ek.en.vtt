about nutrition a lot about GMOs if you

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.380 
about nutrition a lot about GMOs if you
don't<00:00:28.980> know<00:00:29.099> what<00:00:29.250> GMO<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.240> basically

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
don't know what GMO is it's basically

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.520 
don't know what GMO is it's basically
genetically<00:00:31.230> modified<00:00:32.180> it<00:00:33.180> was<00:00:33.510> organisms<00:00:34.380> or

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
genetically modified it was organisms or

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.370 
genetically modified it was organisms or
was<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:35.730> know<00:00:35.790> vegetables<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.690> let<00:00:37.050> things

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
was you know vegetables and let things

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.060 
was you know vegetables and let things
like<00:00:37.590> soybeans<00:00:39.020> Canole<00:00:40.020> canola<00:00:40.440> oil<00:00:40.710> now

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
like soybeans Canole canola oil now

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.880 
like soybeans Canole canola oil now
they're<00:00:41.280> doing<00:00:41.550> wheat<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.500> I<00:00:43.500> think<00:00:43.739> they're

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
they're doing wheat and I think they're

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.610 
they're doing wheat and I think they're
also<00:00:44.450> going<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.510> be<00:00:45.629> doing<00:00:45.750> alfalfa<00:00:46.500> and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
also going to be doing alfalfa and

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.860 
also going to be doing alfalfa and
different<00:00:46.950> things<00:00:46.980> like<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.570> very

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
different things like that it's a very

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.470 
different things like that it's a very
evasive<00:00:49.969> very<00:00:50.969> evasive<00:00:51.300> species<00:00:53.360> what<00:00:54.360> it

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
evasive very evasive species what it

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.099 
evasive very evasive species what it
basically<00:00:54.629> does<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.649> they<00:00:55.860> they<00:00:56.579> modify<00:00:57.180> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
basically does is they they modify the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.680 
basically does is they they modify the
seed<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.210> won't<00:01:00.420> be<00:01:00.539> able

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
seed so that one that it won't be able

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.450 
seed so that one that it won't be able
to<00:01:00.840> reproduce<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.949> have<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.250> buy<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
to reproduce so that you have to buy the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.369 
to reproduce so that you have to buy the
seed<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.359> former's<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.899> buy<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.080> seat

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
seed the former's have to buy the seat

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.649 
seed the former's have to buy the seat
over<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.830> over<00:01:04.890> again<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.489> they<00:01:06.420> actually

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
over and over again and they actually

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.710 
over and over again and they actually
modify<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.409> genes<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.700> they're<00:01:08.880> resistant<00:01:09.510> to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
modify the genes so they're resistant to

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.060 
modify the genes so they're resistant to
all<00:01:09.900> kinds<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.530> pesticides<00:01:12.170> it's<00:01:13.170> just

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
all kinds of pesticides it's just

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.280 
all kinds of pesticides it's just
basically<00:01:14.549> taking<00:01:15.090> what's<00:01:15.299> natural<00:01:15.840> taking

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
basically taking what's natural taking

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.160 
basically taking what's natural taking
what's<00:01:16.470> good<00:01:16.710> taking<00:01:17.189> what's<00:01:17.369> healthy

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
what's good taking what's healthy

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.120 
what's good taking what's healthy
modifying<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.710> that's<00:01:19.920> unhealthy<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
modifying it so that's unhealthy and and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.730 
modifying it so that's unhealthy and and
and<00:01:24.000> dangerous<00:01:24.570> but<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.350> know<00:01:25.470> they<00:01:25.590> don't

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
and dangerous but you know they don't

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.770 
and dangerous but you know they don't
care<00:01:26.009> because<00:01:26.250> they're<00:01:26.850> making<00:01:27.180> money<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.600> it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
care because they're making money on it

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.219 
care because they're making money on it
and<00:01:28.610> his<00:01:29.610> articles<00:01:30.119> really<00:01:30.390> good<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.780> really

and his articles really good I really
like<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.590> point<00:01:31.920> he<00:01:32.040> brings<00:01:32.280> out<00:01:32.430> here<00:01:32.700> about

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
like this point he brings out here about

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.539 
like this point he brings out here about
the<00:01:35.630> about<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.689> Chinese<00:01:37.170> scientists<00:01:38.070> says

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
the about the Chinese scientists says

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.399 
the about the Chinese scientists says
Arya<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> Chinese<00:01:39.420> scientist<00:01:39.930> who<00:01:40.049> carried

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
Arya the Chinese scientist who carried

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.889 
Arya the Chinese scientist who carried
out<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.680> crime<00:01:41.040> against<00:01:41.430> nature<00:01:41.630> by<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.689> way

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
out this crime against nature by the way

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.499 
out this crime against nature by the way
think<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.470> great<00:01:43.649> idea<00:01:43.799> saying<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
think it's a great idea saying the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.440 
think it's a great idea saying the
modified<00:01:46.049> bovine<00:01:46.950> milk<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.610> possible

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
modified bovine milk is a possible

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.190 
modified bovine milk is a possible
substitute<00:01:49.320> for<00:01:49.829> human<00:01:50.490> milk<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.210> fulfilled

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
substitute for human milk it fulfilled

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.850 
substitute for human milk it fulfilled
the<00:01:52.350> conception<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.250> humanizing<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.860> bovine

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the conception of humanizing the bovine

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.170 
the conception of humanizing the bovine
milk<00:01:56.810> are<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.960> kidding<00:01:58.619> me<00:01:58.939> what's<00:01:59.939> wrong

with<00:02:00.540> human<00:02:01.469> milk<00:02:01.710> why<00:02:01.979> do<00:02:02.040> they<00:02:02.280> got<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.610> be

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
with human milk why do they got to be

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.370 
with human milk why do they got to be
making<00:02:03.149> cows<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.960> make<00:02:04.430> human<00:02:05.430> milk<00:02:06.380> article

goes on and talk about how they will
eventually<00:02:08.849> want<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.599> have<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.470> that

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
eventually want to have it so that

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.470 
eventually want to have it so that
