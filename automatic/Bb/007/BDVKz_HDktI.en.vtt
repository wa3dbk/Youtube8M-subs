00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
go that route right away well you know

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.430 
go that route right away well you know
we're<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.060> product<00:02:26.660> company<00:02:27.050> we<00:02:27.200> really

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
we're a product company we really

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.130 
we're a product company we really
believe<00:02:27.769> in<00:02:28.269> basing<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.390> company's<00:02:29.810> culture

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
believe in basing the company's culture

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.680 
believe in basing the company's culture
on<00:02:30.500> building<00:02:31.220> great<00:02:31.370> products<00:02:31.879> and<00:02:32.000> so<00:02:32.420> I

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
on building great products and so I

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.150 
on building great products and so I
think<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.230> best<00:02:33.410> way<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.650> go<00:02:33.860> out<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.099> get

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
think the best way to go out and get

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.460 
think the best way to go out and get
money<00:02:34.370> is<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.790> put<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.450> product<00:02:35.840> ID<00:02:36.140> out<00:02:36.260> there

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
money is to put a product ID out there

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.729 
money is to put a product ID out there
and<00:02:36.680> see<00:02:36.950> whether<00:02:37.190> there's<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.239> real<00:02:38.739> response

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
and see whether there's a real response

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.080 
and see whether there's a real response
to<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.129> and<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:40.459> we<00:02:40.700> put<00:02:40.879> it<00:02:40.970> on<00:02:41.030> the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
to it and so we put it on the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.809 
to it and so we put it on the
Kickstarter<00:02:41.690> we<00:02:41.840> had<00:02:42.530> hoped<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.830> raise<00:02:42.980> 20,000
