00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.180
 we have three and a video camera for sega 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.189
 dreamcast which was released in those years 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.679
 when dreamcast was popular but it 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.650
 first model as we see these kitty 94 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.080
 01 was still 90 402 there such everyones 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.570
 cool toys still painted but by 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.369
 fact inside it is the same and she 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.890
 bridge stuffing software version 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.480
 ensure different who knows him but 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.519
 most likely just released the second 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.080
 model to attract a buyer when 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.689
 Something will not consider such a beautiful 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.730
 boxes it 's great this is something there 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.980
 inside it is necessary to be sure 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.290
 buy but it is clear that the first model 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.079
 occurs now much less often and at all 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.270
 in sight it is that box that external 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.100
 view so it is more expensive well 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.410
 actually that's what it looks like and we 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.980
 see here everything knit subroutine inside 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.500
 is here 5 the sticker was stupid 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.420
 here all the information is written and 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.550
 here we have the characteristics 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.370
 camcorder video she hike removed 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.170
 from church 480 and photographs three 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.140
 different resolutions 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.420
 same as the video below but now 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.659
 let's see what is inside and inside 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.990
 we have this video here 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.270
 actually the camera is saying right here 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.520
 the peephole can be watched to watch everything 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.470
 this business click on the button to 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.600
 take pictures of yourself or run 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.420
 probably the process of filming but it 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.090
 like skype like here skype was 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.840
 dreamcast we see here we have branded 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.840
 make this 9400 go all peripheral 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.439
 devices for dreamcast had their 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.930
 marking points credits and some 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:42.479
 four digit number 0 there are three stages and 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.030
 so on we have it all to 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.610
 connect a microphone and we see that 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.829
 we have a microphone here and sees such 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.390
 headband type can headphones maybe not we 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.759
 can't still know not the camcorder itself 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.439
 so there is an exact microphone here and we 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.070
 it we connect vessels we insert this 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.630
 joystick 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.420
 well that's where we usually 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.189
 a memory card is inserted in it and here 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.320
 written instant put here like here 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.869
 cool such things are drawn by dram 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.970
 and the wands with hearts look at each other 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.260
 friend but this thing is done to 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.239
 to hook just this video camera and 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.430
 data was exchanged with her like this 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.830
 Here we catch and fasten 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.080
 fasten this screw here and it 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.290
 Here we have already screwed, though not very 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.450
 tight so well that's not a thing 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.099
 own designation because she 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.069
 is probably part of this one 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.880
 camcorders are simply written here 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.760
 use dream 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.840
 and made in japan that's cool 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.790
 straight clean 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.890
 Japan and this slot for batteries should 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.709
 there were to be batteries they are used 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.340
 I guess I do not know why a video camera or 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.890
 here's another thing to plug in here 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.340
 also some kind of power adapter or what 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.380
 there I don't know what wire 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.239
 Well, cool, cool can be here 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.329
 you connect 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.370
 and sit gameboy advance look was 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:08.180
 would have fun further we have that 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.700
 further we have here as usual all sorts 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.489
 small instructions don't poke and 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.400
 don't bite her microwave 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.139
 we see the dog box already in the picture 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.139
 that there is no earpiece this thing is just 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:23.299
 keeps us a microphone and that's it 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.940
 here everything is screwed here even 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.609
 drawn it is written what is this slot 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:33.440
 need how to install this whole thing 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:35.660
 and here is a dreamcast video camera inserted 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.319
 so why then this is not clear 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.569
 what she gives I don't know ok let's see here 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:46.250
 actually written as a person sits 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:50.690
 headphones and microphones inserted into 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.670
 joystick into the micro mic itself into this 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.920
 thing a person listens looks at 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.760
 whether the video camera is connected to all 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.310
 connected 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.130
 Already three slots need a keyboard 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.440
 4 slots available free online 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.660
 it is necessary to connect sit on the server 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.350
 for a long time does not really work but 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.910
 you can try with equal 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.280
 the program includes what's on screen 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.890
 shows that the person is doing something 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.210
 so here from big so fat and 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.180
 most importantly color 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:20.160
 here's the program you can see how people are sitting here 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.010
 Cheat I take off a big big instruction 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.260
 very cool wow some squares 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.260
 the bridge, that is, functions like these 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.180
 webcams oh there a little background to do more 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.850
 it is necessary to watch something to check 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.620
 well the program is only in japanese and 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.620
 came out and only in japan 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.340
 so you need to understand the method 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.110
 scientific poke that's great 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.240
 always fun so done all these 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.750
 Instructions nice and comfortable 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:52.950
 the visual park program itself is the number 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.140
 Jovic to go all things that are drawn in here 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.200
 my friends we are all family grandmother grandfather 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.300
 just like when advertised like the whole 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.590
 Family talk will be very fun but 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.200
 here she is like a single player 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.200
 written although it is absolutely not 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.060
 and drum is the wire that connects to 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.640
 us camcorder 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.690
 this thing is all further with us here 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.910
 there is a stand 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.370
 heavy so impressive here and 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:20.280
 fasten and cool it turns out that 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.240
 straight nothing falls well so soft 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.160
 pad 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.370
 just need to get a look at all 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.980
 Awesome she that not slipped well at all 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.040
 cool and comfortable cool bump so here 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.200
 the camera is standing and looking at you there 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.240
 some device from the future 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.100
 Well, just such a microphone is actually 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.470
 you can use any microphone at all 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.290
 because the slot is standard here 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.170
 minijack like he just jack three with 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.480
 half millimeter 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:50.190
 insert it here and enjoy 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.400
 conversations with people 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.330
 Here is such a make-up of the first model 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.660
 first model 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.280
 rarely now everyone knows how he looks in 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:03.110
 principle the same as 2 for 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.110
 collections are cool to have both
