00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:09.760
 because we are on the highway bv 2041 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.700
 linking the cities of GavÃ  and Greek 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.710
 that for the third consecutive year has come out 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.570
 according to the eurorap study as the 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.700
 road that has the most risk for 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.939
 drivers to suffer an accident on 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.369
 eurorap study tries to analyze the 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.619
 risk that drivers have over 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.840
 a certain stretch of suffering a 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.399
 accident taking into consideration the 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.710
 number of vehicles that pass the 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:34.989
 length and the number of accidents that 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.300
 happen so we're going to analyze the 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.090
 road as we can see is a 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.420
 road that has a lane 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.370
 sense of circulation is also worth 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.070
 we have a road where 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.559
 larsen is practically non-existent and in 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.239
 some sites is minimal 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.860
 we also have even in some 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.890
 determined sections and that has some 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.800
 side barriers that we can see that 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.720
 they are metallic and they help us say 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.949
 reduce the accident rate by exit from 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.300
 via 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.040
 here we have for example is a 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.399
 road with an average intensity 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:15.070
 daily of 9,000 vehicles there are three types 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:18.080
 of users by type of vehicle that are 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.710
 motorcyclists trucks or vehicles 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.410
 heavy and vehicles of the rest of 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.289
 typologies as users we have the 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:30.310
 particularity that there are enough 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.929
 cyclists as we could detect 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.119
 a moment ago with which it is a 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:37.940
 user that we have to consider now 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.990
 of the possible accident rate 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.990
 existing on this road 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.220
 as we can see here this road 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.870
 has one is quite complicated in the 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.670
 sense that it has a geometry 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.560
 quite abrupt they are a highway 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.480
 practically where the sharp curves 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.840
 they are always present throughout 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:06.200
 the whole itinerary is a road 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:10.040
 where we can see that with the 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.500
 action that took place in the 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.660
 previous kilometers is not present 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.620
 in this area we have simply a 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.050
 dividing line that is not avoided 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.420
 really the possible frontal accident 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.270
 that I can have either because you have 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.610
 a distraction or because simply 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.310
 you have an excess speed inside the 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.830
 mobile vehicle have 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.390
 tools that allow us and us 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:41.270
 help to work with auditing the 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.850
 roads between them between these 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.890
 equipment we have three cameras 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.560
 high definition that are located in 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.870
 a panoramic shape and they capture image 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.470
 every 10 meters to be evaluated 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.090
 a posteriori under 35 to 50 parameters of 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.160
 road safety 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.650
 and characteristics of life like the 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.080
 asphalt that as we will see in some 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.599
 particular points yes that has been done 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.230
 a resurfacing but in many others 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:13.440
 you can not see it because you see a clear theme and it's 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.420
 that in winter when the sun touches the 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.370
 mountain on the opposite side to that of the 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:22.830
 road this asphalt is moistened and by 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.560
 so much we have been able to detect also of 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.730
 that the grip of the cars of the 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.040
 vehicles and the weather on that road 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.870
 it's not enough to be able 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.209
 maneuver in conditions where appropriate 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.209
 an action by the 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.700
 driver producing what would be a 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.239
 accident and raising the risk that it 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.280
 so produce a cap with another car that 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.780
 come in the opposite direction or go 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.780
 directly towards the mountain
