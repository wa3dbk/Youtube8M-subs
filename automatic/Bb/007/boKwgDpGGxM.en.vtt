00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.460
 this is the lenovo yoga 2 pro 7 it is one 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.290
 13.3 is two liters with a corcoran 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.309
 sorry 7 processor and 8 gigabytes 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.719
 random access memory 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.040
 think that it is extremely suitable for 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.870
 dogs moderate my work from photos and 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.240
 watch videos of all kinds 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.710
 my multimedia full hd higher it 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.210
 playing simple games but also 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.920
 the daily things like for example 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.660
 or are internet 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.189
 first they look at the material 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.740
 theme that you manufacture is from a gray 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.180
 silvery plastic which is very nice 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.769
 evening through your fingers 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.910
 nam location with the same material and 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.920
 that the battery is not replaceable 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.739
 of course it is nice to know 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.579
 it is 1.5 and 50 centimeters thick and 1.39 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.260
 kilos 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.610
 that makes a real ultracompact and what 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.730
 it also effortlessly in any type of bag 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.320
 fit the screen what's on it is one 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.500
 one of the usb of this laptop and 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.820
 means that 360 degree tilt is like 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.200
 we just had it, so it's just too 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.210
 use as full windows 8 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.710
 laptop and we have to use now 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.329
 in a situation that affects you at that time 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.340
 does not come out then you can just do it 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.530
 tilt and so you can for example 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.579
 use this voice as a tablet stand 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.140
 and so you can for example do a tutorial 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.550
 watch the ear boiling or tinkering 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.840
 and you can use the keyboard 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.580
 so that it really is like one 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.720
 presentations tent is used and such 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.729
 for example you can easily skype 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.740
 have conversations to all kinds of people 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.810
 watch multimedia with your friends or 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.520
 acquaintances and you can of course be whole 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.450
 give professional presentations in this 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.770
 mode 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.810
 and knocking all the way through tomorrow and 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.280
 that is of course really very young 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.479
 in that just a full one 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.220
 windows 8 tablet and that is really cool 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.990
 the keyboard is in this configuration 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.400
 on the back of the laptop and 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.439
 within him therefore always always 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.090
 on fixed but becomes nice of this laptop 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.020
 ryan is the key is 180 degrees 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.159
 tilts 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.659
 it turns off automatically so you don't 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.890
 accidentally all keystrokes 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.030
 get in the app store and get you busy 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.710
 are 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.720
 the screen that is in it is also not 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.649
 just any screen that is a glossy qhd 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.880
 plus screen 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.280
 That means you have a resolution that 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.470
 time from two to 100 by 1800 that 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.820
 is of course really kneiter great it is 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.170
 a whole hetty ps touch screen 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.340
 of course works very well together in 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.710
 combination with windows 8 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.360
 help and that glossy eps screens it 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.250
 it really makes a lot of clear 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.930
 produces colors but as a rule it does 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.509
 slightly more affected by the reflections 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.590
 then, for example, an anti-glare screen 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.840
 at the top of the screen and 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.450
 hd-ready webcam great for that skate park 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.209
 just over it 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.440
 the keyboard has no numeric 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.720
 part on the side but that is gone 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.370
 not so very weird on a format you 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.200
 like this it is a flight it becomes 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.670
 so that is of course very nice and 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.930
 it hurt the very nicely processed in it 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.980
 design but if you didn't like that 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.540
 I always find him and me of course 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.040
 are wired or a wireless mouse on the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.630
 connect laptop 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.890
 all the material that has since become and 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.140
 the keyboard a sentence to see one 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.420
 kind of non-slip material it feels like 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.650
 very nice on your wrists and that we 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.970
 that you have to deal with unsolicited 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.200
 of course also down on the keyboard 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.910
 can turn species not go easy 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.470
 and that is very sustainable 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.260
 100 material also ensure that you 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.090
 almost do not suffer from wear and tear 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.380
 the led works on blood and fire pen or something 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.000
 that you care about your smartphone or you 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.680
 tablet can connect wireless internet 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.030
 there is also a cart with three fingers like you 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.349
 the cards from your camera are simply delicious 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.360
 the can plug in without the cables 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.950
 He needs a HDMI port 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.420
 so that you can possibly have an extra monitor 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.069
 to connect to a TV 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.569
 but note that it is not an option 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.910
 giving a twist of course not like that 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.370
 weird is on a format like this 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.920
 heisteeg usb ports once 291 times 3 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.840
 point zero and find to 512 gigabyte ssd 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.069
 and things that start his eyes 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.599
 and also the commonly used ones 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.970
 actually all programs will be very fast 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.620
 in terms of graphics power, there is one 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.940
 share video card and that means that 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.040
 he for the simple games like and 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.600
 happening reconnaissance is fine 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.310
 but not for the graphically heavier ones 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.239
 such as call or duty or this plays 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.950
 4 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.200
 that 8 gigabyte up market overs 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.310
 had a maximum of 16 went 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.290
 for the programs that that 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.579
 probably will need one 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.870
 I will keep track of something for a moment 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:36.760
 so you get an idea of impatience 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.109
 the screen is about and if you don't 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.700
 on the back you see that it holds 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.170
 about the same width as a line 4 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.850
 minutes less high but in combination 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.319
 with the resolution it gives is real 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.269
 nice for space to work 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.859
 would you like to know more about this 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.940
 two and a laptop or are we going you 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.430
