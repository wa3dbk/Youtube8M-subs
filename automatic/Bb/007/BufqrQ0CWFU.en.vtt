whole UNIX people pinhole camera and
this<00:00:19.770> was<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> Christmas<00:00:20.310> present<00:00:20.550> for<00:00:20.820> me

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
this was a Christmas present for me

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.210 
this was a Christmas present for me
where<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.210> had<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.510> make<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.619> camera<00:00:22.890> with

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
where you had to make the camera with

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.519 
where you had to make the camera with
glue<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.119> bits<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.510> cards<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.260> kind

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
glue and the bits of cards that you kind

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.310 
glue and the bits of cards that you kind
of<00:00:25.590> popped<00:00:25.800> out<00:00:25.980> took<00:00:26.609> about<00:00:27.060> 2<00:00:27.390> hours<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:28.019> make

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
of popped out took about 2 hours to make

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.009 
of popped out took about 2 hours to make
this<00:00:28.500> it's<00:00:28.740> got<00:00:28.890> real<00:00:29.189> film<00:00:29.609> 35<00:00:30.019> millimeter

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
this it's got real film 35 millimeter

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.380 
this it's got real film 35 millimeter
film<00:00:31.050> inside<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.070> it's<00:00:32.520> even<00:00:32.730> got<00:00:32.759> Paul<00:00:33.120> where

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
film inside and it's even got Paul where

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.780 
film inside and it's even got Paul where
I<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:33.630> see<00:00:33.930> through<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.250> roughly<00:00:35.520> see

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
I can see through so I can roughly see

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.360 
I can see through so I can roughly see
what<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.149> meant<00:00:36.390> by<00:00:36.690> taking<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> photo<00:00:37.170> of

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
what I meant by taking a photo of

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.209 
what I meant by taking a photo of
however<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:39.780> bit<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.200> rotate<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.980> get

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
however the bit that you rotate to get

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.740 
however the bit that you rotate to get
the<00:00:41.309> film<00:00:41.579> into<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.879> right<00:00:42.030> bit<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.420> doesn't

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
the film into the right bit it doesn't

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.139 
the film into the right bit it doesn't
tell<00:00:43.469> me<00:00:43.620> when<00:00:43.770> it's<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> right<00:00:44.309> bit<00:00:44.850> to

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
tell me when it's in the right bit to

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.569 
tell me when it's in the right bit to
take<00:00:45.300> photo<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:46.289> taking<00:00:47.190> photo<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.550> just

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
take photo and taking photo you just

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.270 
take photo and taking photo you just
move<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.420> bit<00:00:48.960> where<00:00:49.140> goes<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.649> off<00:00:49.770> to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
move the bit where goes on and off to

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.010 
move the bit where goes on and off to
move<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.030> pinhole<00:00:51.510> shot

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
move it so it's the pinhole shot

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.709 
move it so it's the pinhole shot
I<00:00:52.100> think<00:00:53.100> each<00:00:53.280> exposure<00:00:53.820> even<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> sunny

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
I think each exposure even on a sunny

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.209 
I think each exposure even on a sunny
day<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.140> it's<00:00:55.350> gonna<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.770> know<00:00:55.800> excited

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
day like it's gonna be you know excited

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.610 
day like it's gonna be you know excited
today<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.820> gonna<00:00:57.390> still<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.719> around<00:00:58.050> about<00:00:58.320> a

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
today is gonna still be around about a

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.880 
today is gonna still be around about a
30<00:00:59.059> second<00:01:00.059> exposure<00:01:00.680> because<00:01:01.680> there's<00:01:01.800> an

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
30 second exposure because there's an

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.840 
30 second exposure because there's an
iso<00:01:02.309> 100<00:01:03.090> film<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.580> pinhole<00:01:05.580> which

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
iso 100 film and is a pinhole which

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.870 
iso 100 film and is a pinhole which
means<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.270> absolutely<00:01:06.900> tiny<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.280> may<00:01:08.640> end

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
means it's absolutely tiny so I may end

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.940 
means it's absolutely tiny so I may end
up<00:01:09.000> using<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.360> whole<00:01:09.540> roll<00:01:09.780> film<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.380> just

the course of a 500 pound camera but do
you<00:01:58.409> know<00:01:58.469> what<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> think<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.280> think<00:02:00.210> that's

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
you know what I think I think that's

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.749 
you know what I think I think that's
kind<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.840> false<00:02:01.350> information<00:02:02.009> yeah<00:02:02.189> ok<00:02:02.490> using

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
kind of false information yeah ok using

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.749 
kind of false information yeah ok using
film<00:02:03.180> would<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.600> good<00:02:04.200> thing<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:05.130> learn<00:02:05.579> but

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
film would be a good thing to learn but

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.399 
film would be a good thing to learn but

not<00:02:16.490> being<00:02:16.610> able<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:16.819> see<00:02:17.150> your<00:02:17.300> image

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
not being able to see your image

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.380 
not being able to see your image
straightaway<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:18.560> not<00:02:19.490> be<00:02:19.580> able<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.819> adjust

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
straightaway and not be able to adjust

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.290 
straightaway and not be able to adjust
your<00:02:20.569> settings<00:02:21.050> there<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.730> learning<00:02:23.090> curve

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
your settings there the learning curve

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.030 
your settings there the learning curve
is<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:25.060> steep<00:02:26.060> but<00:02:26.510> really<00:02:26.930> slow<00:02:27.380> because<00:02:27.709> and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
is a steep but really slow because and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.890 
is a steep but really slow because and
it's<00:02:28.160> slow<00:02:28.400> because<00:02:28.610> where<00:02:29.060> you<00:02:29.120> can't<00:02:29.390> change

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
it's slow because where you can't change

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.020 
it's slow because where you can't change
anything<00:02:30.230> because<00:02:30.550> you<00:02:31.550> know<00:02:31.670> you've<00:02:31.820> got<00:02:31.940> to

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
anything because you know you've got to

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.550 
anything because you know you've got to
wait<00:02:32.150> until<00:02:32.300> your<00:02:32.540> film<00:02:32.990> gets<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.350> milk

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
wait until your film gets the milk

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.410 
wait until your film gets the milk
you're<00:02:33.740> going<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:33.980> take<00:02:34.070> notes<00:02:34.370> of<00:02:34.610> what<00:02:34.670> Fuji

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
you're going to take notes of what Fuji

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.480 
you're going to take notes of what Fuji
had<00:02:35.690> of<00:02:35.840> what<00:02:35.990> time<00:02:36.290> or<00:02:36.470> an<00:02:36.560> ever<00:02:36.950> obviously

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
had of what time or an ever obviously

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.530 
had of what time or an ever obviously
I'm<00:02:37.550> not<00:02:37.640> really<00:02:37.850> talking<00:02:38.000> about<00:02:38.090> pinhole

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
I'm not really talking about pinhole

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.330 
I'm not really talking about pinhole
camera<00:02:38.870> but<00:02:39.020> actually<00:02:39.260> I<00:02:39.380> do<00:02:39.800> need<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:40.010> pinhole

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
camera but actually I do need a pinhole

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.580 
camera but actually I do need a pinhole
camera<00:02:40.400> to<00:02:40.760> do<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:41.000> because<00:02:41.270> I<00:02:41.510> would<00:02:42.470> need

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
camera to do that because I would need

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.440 
camera to do that because I would need
to<00:02:42.709> be<00:02:42.770> recognizing<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.489> was<00:02:43.580> a<00:02:43.610> 30-second

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
to be recognizing that was a 30-second

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.750 
to be recognizing that was a 30-second
exposure<00:02:44.569> on<00:02:45.080> a<00:02:45.110> sunny<00:02:45.470> day<00:02:45.560> or<00:02:45.950> that<00:02:46.640> was<00:02:46.730> a

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
exposure on a sunny day or that was a

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.110 
exposure on a sunny day or that was a
fifty<00:02:47.330> second<00:02:47.720> or<00:02:47.870> a<00:02:47.900> minute<00:02:48.790> exposure<00:02:49.790> on<00:02:50.090> a

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
fifty second or a minute exposure on a

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.699 
fifty second or a minute exposure on a
sunny<00:02:50.390> day<00:02:50.480> or<00:02:50.630> a<00:02:50.840> cloudy<00:02:50.930> day<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.500> try<00:02:51.680> to

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
sunny day or a cloudy day and try to

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.440 
sunny day or a cloudy day and try to
figure<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.100> out<00:02:52.220> so<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:52.730> would<00:02:53.030> be<00:02:53.150> quite

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
figure it out so that would be quite

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.759 
figure it out so that would be quite
interesting<00:02:53.900> to<00:02:53.959> figure<00:02:54.019> that<00:02:54.260> but<00:02:54.560> however

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
interesting to figure that but however

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.710 
interesting to figure that but however
with<00:02:55.610> me<00:02:55.820> again<00:02:56.750> film<00:02:57.709> is<00:02:57.860> still<00:02:58.010> in<00:02:58.160> here<00:02:58.720> but

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
with me again film is still in here but

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.690 
with me again film is still in here but
has<00:02:59.840> never<00:02:59.989> been<00:03:00.230> developed<00:03:00.950> it's<00:03:01.400> never<00:03:01.550> been

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
has never been developed it's never been

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.979 
has never been developed it's never been
used<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:02.180> I've<00:03:02.269> really<00:03:02.450> done<00:03:02.570> about<00:03:02.780> and

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
used and I've really done about and

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.040 
used and I've really done about and
again<00:03:03.500> but<00:03:03.920> with<00:03:04.220> this<00:03:04.370> I<00:03:04.610> don't<00:03:05.600> know<00:03:05.840> whether

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
again but with this I don't know whether

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.550 
again but with this I don't know whether
is<00:03:06.260> on<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.530> next<00:03:06.800> film<00:03:06.980> or<00:03:07.250> not

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
is on the next film or not

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.259 
is on the next film or not
so<00:03:09.560> my<00:03:09.709> advice<00:03:09.830> here<00:03:10.160> is<00:03:10.370> if<00:03:10.610> you<00:03:10.880> have<00:03:11.030> anybody

so my advice here is if you have anybody
saying<00:03:12.080> oh<00:03:12.290> yeah<00:03:12.530> you're<00:03:12.769> into<00:03:13.070> photography
