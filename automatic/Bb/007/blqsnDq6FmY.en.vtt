00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
one unit type for tile so you'll need to

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.700 
one unit type for tile so you'll need to
pay<00:00:54.059> much<00:00:54.300> closer<00:00:54.600> attention<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.230> how<00:00:55.500> your

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
forces are deployed the same idea goes

for<00:00:58.199> cities<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:59.010> can't<00:00:59.309> stuff<00:00:59.640> an<00:00:59.820> insane

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
for cities you can't stuff an insane

instead<00:01:02.789> cities<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.420> their<00:01:03.570> own<00:01:03.600> attack

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
instead cities have their own attack

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.070 
instead cities have their own attack
value<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:05.189> strike<00:01:05.489> out<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.700> their<00:01:05.880> own

value and can strike out on their own

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.179 
value and can strike out on their own
since<00:01:07.080> your<00:01:07.229> troops<00:01:07.470> will<00:01:07.650> be<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.950> field

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189

since your troops will be in the field
as<00:01:08.340> well<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:09.090> leads<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.510> much<00:01:09.659> more<00:01:09.900> open<00:01:10.140> and

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
as well this leads to much more open and

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.410 
as well this leads to much more open and
interesting<00:01:11.040> combat<00:01:11.490> than<00:01:11.729> just<00:01:11.909> hurling<00:01:12.180> two

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
interesting combat than just hurling two

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.359 
interesting combat than just hurling two
giant<00:01:12.869> stacks<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.350> soldiers<00:01:13.770> at<00:01:14.010> each<00:01:14.159> other

until<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:14.820> finally<00:01:15.390> whittles<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.840> other

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
until one finally whittles the other

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.719 
until one finally whittles the other
down<00:01:16.200> now<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.680> actually<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.310> think<00:01:17.520> more

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
down now you actually have to think more

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.090 
down now you actually have to think more
about<00:01:17.790> formations<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.810> RV<00:01:19.049> composition<00:01:19.680> which

about formations in RV composition which
so<00:01:20.310> far<00:01:20.340> is<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.640> lot<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.939> fun

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
so far is a lot of fun
