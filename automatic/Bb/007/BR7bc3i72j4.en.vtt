00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello everyone with you hans master today 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.349
 we will make an AK-47 based machine gun 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.679
 4 series 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:21.600
 today I will show how to make a basis for 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:29.310
 we need him 404 well here so them 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:38.780
 it is necessary to roll into a tube 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:43.670
 be big wide now glue 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:48.930
 glue can use glue pencil 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:53.820
 You can fix it with scotch tape but with scotch tape and 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:58.250
 still come close we use a pencil 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:03.690
 and you need 4 of these tubes 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:08.510
 but I have already done them now like this 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.510
 here dazzle well of meetings 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:27.049
 grease well glue press down and 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:27.049
 each other like this 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.400
 By the way, you can still use 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:49.060
 Double-sided tape 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:54.100
 we have no such tape fix 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:02:06.570
 total it all so let 's take 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:06.570
 scotch just a few strange detail 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.080
 it is necessary that the ends are exactly 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:03:02.730
 something like this and so wait for 2 episodes 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:09.239
 in the second series we will probably make dollars 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:11.580
