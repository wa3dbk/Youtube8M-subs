hi I'm Karen for expert village okay
then<00:00:03.629> when<00:00:03.840> you<00:00:03.959> have<00:00:04.259> your<00:00:04.560> design<00:00:05.220> cut<00:00:05.670> out

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
then when you have your design cut out

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.080 
then when you have your design cut out
you<00:00:06.899> want<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.730> pinch<00:00:08.730> forward<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:10.820> froggy<00:00:11.820> bit

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
you want to pinch forward the froggy bit

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.270 
you want to pinch forward the froggy bit
and<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.389> outside<00:00:12.960> bit<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.469> second<00:00:14.070> layer

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
and the outside bit and the second layer

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.750 
and the outside bit and the second layer
is<00:00:14.639> going<00:00:14.849> to<00:00:14.910> go<00:00:15.089> back<00:00:15.590> so<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.890> just<00:00:17.250> kind<00:00:17.609> of

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
is going to go back so you just kind of

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.450 
is going to go back so you just kind of
fold<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:19.140> all<00:00:19.470> up<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.770> looks<00:00:19.949> sort<00:00:20.369> of

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
fold that all up it looks sort of

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.090 
fold that all up it looks sort of
strange<00:00:20.970> but<00:00:21.810> when<00:00:22.260> it's<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.650> card<00:00:22.920> it'll

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
strange but when it's in the card it'll

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.529 
strange but when it's in the card it'll
all<00:00:23.310> fit<00:00:23.689> now<00:00:24.689> that's<00:00:25.470> your<00:00:25.740> pop-up<00:00:26.039> bit<00:00:26.550> now

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
all fit now that's your pop-up bit now

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.990 
all fit now that's your pop-up bit now
we're<00:00:27.689> going<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.960> place<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.769> into<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.340> hand

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
we're going to place it into the hand

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.919 
we're going to place it into the hand
card

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
card

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.510 
card
and<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.769> want<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.099> place<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.530> the<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:35.130> design

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
and you want to place the the the design

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.130 
and you want to place the the the design
the<00:00:36.450> fold<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:37.430> the<00:00:38.430> insert<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.420> pop-up<00:00:39.780> insert

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
the fold of the insert the pop-up insert

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.280 
the fold of the insert the pop-up insert
along<00:00:41.070> exactly<00:00:41.879> along<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.570> fold<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
along exactly along the fold of the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.529 
along exactly along the fold of the
hands<00:00:44.539> so<00:00:45.539> if<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.230> want<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:47.329> bend<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
hands so if you want you can bend the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.529 
hands so if you want you can bend the
hands<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:51.530> bend<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.710> pop-up<00:00:53.309> thing<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.360> make

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
hands and bend the pop-up thing to make

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.420 
hands and bend the pop-up thing to make
sure<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:55.410> you're<00:00:55.680> lined<00:00:56.160> up<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:58.250> then<00:00:59.250> we're

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
sure that you're lined up and then we're

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.740 
sure that you're lined up and then we're
going<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.820> fold<00:01:00.780> back<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.010> tab<00:01:02.340> like<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.390> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
going to fold back the tab like that and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.910 
going to fold back the tab like that and
make<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.860> slice<00:01:05.489> right<00:01:06.030> here<00:01:06.930> where<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.439> tab<00:01:07.680> is

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
make a slice right here where the tab is

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.450 
make a slice right here where the tab is
going<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.130> go<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:09.229> slice<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.799> side<00:01:11.130> and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
going to go in slice it on that side and

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.820 
going to go in slice it on that side and
then<00:01:12.090> go<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.810> other<00:01:12.990> side<00:01:13.760> and<00:01:15.500> again<00:01:16.500> make

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
then go to the other side and again make

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.160 
then go to the other side and again make
a<00:01:16.860> slice<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.640> tab<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.090> going<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.299> fit<00:01:18.570> right<00:01:18.869> in

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
a slice the tab is going to fit right in

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.020 
a slice the tab is going to fit right in
there<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.710> want<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.130> be<00:01:20.280> even<00:01:20.790> with

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
there and you want it to be even with

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.940 
there and you want it to be even with
the<00:01:21.090> edge<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.960> heart<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.409> we've<00:01:22.560> flipped

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the edge of the heart so we've flipped

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.130 
the edge of the heart so we've flipped
up<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.310> tab<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:24.119> get<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.360> out<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> way<00:01:24.869> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
up the tab to get it out of the way and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.359 
up the tab to get it out of the way and
then<00:01:25.979> sliced<00:01:26.810> like<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.110> now<00:01:28.619> we'll<00:01:28.829> insert

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
then sliced like that now we'll insert

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.950 
then sliced like that now we'll insert
the<00:01:29.640> tabs<00:01:30.000> into<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:32.130> slip<00:01:32.579> slats<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.689> we

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
the tabs into the slip slats that we

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:42.140 
the tabs into the slip slats that we
just<00:01:34.200> cut<00:01:34.740> one<00:01:35.689> there<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:39.060> one<00:01:39.119> there<00:01:41.119> okay

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
just cut one there and one there okay

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.780 
just cut one there and one there okay
and<00:01:42.420> now<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:45.530> pinch<00:01:46.530> your<00:01:46.649> folds<00:01:47.220> again<00:01:47.340> and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
and now just pinch your folds again and

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.530 
and now just pinch your folds again and
we'll<00:01:47.909> test<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.540> out<00:01:48.659> before<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.290> glue<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.530> down

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
we'll test it out before we glue it down

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.080 
we'll test it out before we glue it down
yeah<00:01:52.220> so<00:01:53.220> that's<00:01:53.399> what<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.729> should<00:01:53.759> look<00:01:53.939> like

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
yeah so that's what it should look like

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.270 
yeah so that's what it should look like
with<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> little<00:01:54.840> bit<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.140> tab<00:01:55.409> sticking<00:01:55.979> out

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
with a little bit of a tab sticking out

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.520 
with a little bit of a tab sticking out
on<00:01:56.460> either<00:01:56.640> end<00:01:56.969> now<00:01:57.540> we're<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.259> going<00:01:58.500> to

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
on either end now we're just going to

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:06.109 
on either end now we're just going to
secure<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.700> tabs<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:01.009> hide<00:02:02.009> them<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:06.060> you

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
secure the tabs and hide them so you

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.980 
secure the tabs and hide them so you
want<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.479> put<00:02:06.719> just<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.590> dab<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:08.190> glue

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.940 

under<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.650> tab<00:02:12.030> like<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.710> it's<00:02:14.710> a<00:02:14.800> little

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
under the tab like that it's a little

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.990 
under the tab like that it's a little
more<00:02:15.130> than<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.490> wanted<00:02:15.880> and<00:02:17.190> I<00:02:18.190> like<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.820> just

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
more than I wanted and I like to just

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.080 
more than I wanted and I like to just
take<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:19.450> same<00:02:19.840> color<00:02:20.500> that<00:02:21.370> I've<00:02:21.520> used<00:02:21.820> to

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
take the same color that I've used to

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.930 
take the same color that I've used to
make<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.450> hands<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.520> cut<00:02:24.520> out<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.700> little

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
make the hands and cut out a little

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.870 
make the hands and cut out a little
heart<00:02:30.390> just<00:02:31.390> cut<00:02:31.600> out<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.780> small<00:02:32.200> heart<00:02:32.530> and

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
heart just cut out a small heart and

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.050 
heart just cut out a small heart and
maybe<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:34.000> little<00:02:34.150> bit<00:02:34.300> more<00:02:34.600> glue<00:02:34.930> there<00:02:35.200> and

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
maybe a little bit more glue there and

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.160 
maybe a little bit more glue there and
glue<00:02:37.060> that<00:02:37.300> over<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:37.990> tab<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:40.600> you<00:02:40.630> don't<00:02:40.900> see

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
glue that over the tab so you don't see

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.720 
glue that over the tab so you don't see
the<00:02:41.350> tab<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:43.560> but<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:44.650> don't<00:02:44.830> really<00:02:45.370> notice

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730
