have 240 herbs I've got a few variances
i'm<00:00:17.220> just<00:00:17.430> going<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.609> mill<00:00:17.940> through<00:00:18.180> these

i'm just going to mill through these
quickly

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.639 

so<00:00:58.239> with<00:00:58.420> that<00:00:58.539> little<00:00:58.780> tedious<00:00:59.079> part<00:00:59.410> out<00:00:59.620> of

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
so with that little tedious part out of

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.920 
so with that little tedious part out of
the<00:00:59.770> way<00:00:59.829> I'm<00:01:00.610> gonna<00:01:00.910> go<00:01:01.149> ahead<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.420> start

the way I'm gonna go ahead and start

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.209 
the way I'm gonna go ahead and start
with<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:02.230> leveling<00:01:02.559> we're<00:01:02.800> going<00:01:02.980> to<00:01:03.039> start

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
with the leveling we're going to start

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.310 
with the leveling we're going to start
with<00:01:03.309> ink<00:01:03.730> of<00:01:03.910> dreams<00:01:04.180> now<00:01:04.629> I<00:01:04.930> was<00:01:05.049> able<00:01:05.199> to

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
with ink of dreams now I was able to

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.890 
with ink of dreams now I was able to
create<00:01:05.590> 59<00:01:06.040> of<00:01:06.159> these<00:01:06.310> so<00:01:07.000> we'll<00:01:07.150> see<00:01:07.450> just<00:01:07.780> how

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
create 59 of these so we'll see just how

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:22.609 
create 59 of these so we'll see just how
far<00:01:08.200> this<00:01:08.380> gets<00:01:08.590> us<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:21.640> recipe<00:01:21.820> goes<00:01:22.149> green

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
far this gets us the recipe goes green

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.289 
far this gets us the recipe goes green
540<00:01:23.619> but<00:01:24.009> we<00:01:24.220> can<00:01:24.369> still<00:01:24.580> make<00:01:24.759> a<00:01:24.790> couple<00:01:25.090> more

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
540 but we can still make a couple more

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.359 
540 but we can still make a couple more
until<00:01:25.720> it<00:01:26.200> goes<00:01:26.350> gray<00:01:26.649> it<00:01:27.070> goes<00:01:27.310> gray<00:01:27.580> up<00:01:27.729> 545

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
until it goes gray it goes gray up 545

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.010 
until it goes gray it goes gray up 545
let's<00:01:30.369> just<00:01:30.700> we'll<00:01:31.119> be<00:01:31.240> making<00:01:31.570> them<00:01:31.690> anyway

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
let's just we'll be making them anyway

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.620 
let's just we'll be making them anyway
because<00:01:32.170> we<00:01:32.380> have<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:32.619> use<00:01:32.800> them<00:01:33.009> so<00:01:33.340> metal<00:01:33.850> try

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
because we have to use them so metal try

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.149 
because we have to use them so metal try
and<00:01:34.810> get<00:01:34.990> what<00:01:35.170> little<00:01:35.470> experience<00:01:35.770> we<00:01:35.979> can

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
and get what little experience we can

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.700 
and get what little experience we can
out<00:01:36.340> of<00:01:36.520> them<00:01:37.259> I'll<00:01:38.259> it's<00:01:38.409> still<00:01:38.590> giving

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
out of them I'll it's still giving

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:47.880 
out of them I'll it's still giving
experience<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.810> also<00:01:46.929> want<00:01:47.170> to<00:01:47.229> make<00:01:47.319> up<00:01:47.649> all

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
experience you also want to make up all

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.660 
experience you also want to make up all
star<00:01:48.369> light<00:01:48.550> ink<00:01:48.789> which<00:01:49.149> you<00:01:49.300> are<00:01:49.420> able<00:01:49.600> to<00:01:50.670> so

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
star light ink which you are able to so

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.399 
star light ink which you are able to so
after<00:01:51.970> we've<00:01:52.179> got<00:01:52.300> all<00:01:52.420> our<00:01:52.450> inks<00:01:52.869> trained

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
after we've got all our inks trained

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.760 
after we've got all our inks trained
everything<00:01:53.770> that's<00:01:53.920> new<00:01:54.100> and<00:01:55.409> we'll<00:01:56.409> make<00:01:56.590> our

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
everything that's new and we'll make our

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.309 
everything that's new and we'll make our
first<00:01:56.979> scroll<00:01:57.490> of<00:01:57.640> wisdom<00:01:58.000> now<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.899> key<00:01:59.050> point

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
first scroll of wisdom now the key point

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.920 
first scroll of wisdom now the key point
of<00:01:59.440> this<00:01:59.560> is<00:01:59.830> that<00:01:59.939> actually<00:02:00.939> learnt<00:02:01.180> you<00:02:01.570> a

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
of this is that actually learnt you a

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.289 
of this is that actually learnt you a
glyph<00:02:02.560> recipe<00:02:03.040> so<00:02:03.310> we<00:02:03.430> got<00:02:03.640> glyph<00:02:03.969> of<00:02:04.149> the

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
glyph recipe so we got glyph of the

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:10.199 
glyph recipe so we got glyph of the
heavens<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.770> go<00:02:06.009> ahead<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.280> find<00:02:06.939> that<00:02:09.209> now

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
heavens so go ahead and find that now

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.870 
heavens so go ahead and find that now
this<00:02:10.450> is<00:02:10.750> going<00:02:11.049> to<00:02:11.140> be<00:02:11.290> your<00:02:11.860> main<00:02:12.220> leveling

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
this is going to be your main leveling

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.170 
this is going to be your main leveling
tool<00:02:13.120> all<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:14.200> way<00:02:14.320> to<00:02:14.380> 600<00:02:15.130> it<00:02:15.700> does<00:02:15.940> go

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
tool all the way to 600 it does go

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.770 
tool all the way to 600 it does go
yellow<00:02:16.600> at<00:02:17.610> 595<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.090> may<00:02:19.209> need<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.510> create

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
yellow at 595 so you may need to create

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.590 
yellow at 595 so you may need to create
a<00:02:20.200> couple<00:02:21.130> shoulder<00:02:21.489> enchants<00:02:21.850> but<00:02:22.329> it

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
a couple shoulder enchants but it

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.600 
a couple shoulder enchants but it
depends<00:02:23.049> on<00:02:23.290> what<00:02:23.769> materials<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:24.340> want<00:02:24.519> to

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
depends on what materials you want to

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.729 
depends on what materials you want to
use<00:02:24.730> for<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.450> fastest<00:02:25.870> leveling<00:02:26.230> just<00:02:26.500> make

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
use for the fastest leveling just make

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.039 
use for the fastest leveling just make
this<00:02:26.980> glyph<00:02:27.310> over<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.120> over<00:02:28.269> and<00:02:28.630> over<00:02:28.750> and

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
this glyph over and over and over and

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.789 
this glyph over and over and over and
over<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.680> over<00:02:30.570> sadly<00:02:31.570> this<00:02:31.780> means<00:02:32.079> that<00:02:32.200> you

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
over and over sadly this means that you

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:33.960 
over and over sadly this means that you
probably<00:02:33.040> won't<00:02:33.310> make<00:02:33.370> a<00:02:33.489> great<00:02:33.760> deal<00:02:33.910> of

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
probably won't make a great deal of

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.780 
probably won't make a great deal of
profit<00:02:34.570> of<00:02:34.709> leveling<00:02:35.709> inscription<00:02:36.280> but<00:02:36.609> once

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
profit of leveling inscription but once

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.640 
profit of leveling inscription but once
it's<00:02:37.000> there<00:02:37.150> you've<00:02:37.390> got<00:02:37.510> access<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:37.959> all<00:02:38.500> the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
it's there you've got access to all the

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.930 
it's there you've got access to all the
shoulder<00:02:38.920> enchants

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
shoulder enchants

00:02:39.940 --> 00:03:04.059 
shoulder enchants
fare<00:02:40.270> cards

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.890 

so<00:03:05.069> because<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.489> have<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:06.060> spare<00:03:06.330> materials

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
so because I have the spare materials

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.470 
so because I have the spare materials
and<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.319> gets<00:03:07.500> me<00:03:07.739> nice<00:03:08.069> and<00:03:08.099> neatly<00:03:08.519> to<00:03:08.849> 600

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
and it gets me nice and neatly to 600

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.360 
and it gets me nice and neatly to 600
I'm<00:03:09.629> going<00:03:09.930> to<00:03:10.019> make<00:03:10.170> two<00:03:10.530> of<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.739> bind<00:03:10.950> on<00:03:11.129> use

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
I'm going to make two of the bind on use

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.789 
I'm going to make two of the bind on use
shoulder<00:03:12.090> enchants<00:03:12.450> also<00:03:13.319> make<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.500> bit<00:03:13.709> of

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
shoulder enchants also make a bit of
