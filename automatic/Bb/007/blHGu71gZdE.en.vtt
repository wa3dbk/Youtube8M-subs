00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.730
 today we prepare a goose with apples 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.940
 stuffed with apples 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.130
 Before that, we naturally have 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.070
 gutted 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.760
 washed cleaned robbed it from jumping 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.760
 we have clean 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.779
 salt we do not use spices inside 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:30.099
 no usually salt salt pepper it so 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:38.490
 tasty and a lot and so we grease inside 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:38.490
 pepper is not covered in salt 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:53.530
 pepper then 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.930
 inside our duck is possible in this case 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.629
 we put apples for stuffing 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.769
 use winter varieties of apples with us 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.769
 In this case, Sibirenko 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:13.890
 we stack how many apples fit 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.890
 can sew up can be chipped 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.000
 regular toothpicks 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.650
 So 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.670
 way of life 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:45.970
 our goose shape can be up your sleeve 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.640
 we will need to grill and gusyatnitsy 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.660
 some vegetable oil 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.180
 so it does not burn 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.180
 before he let his own juice 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:14.170
 more man on fat will not flood 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.920
 will enter all we will cover him 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.920
 look after 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:36.230
 put in the oven so the temperature is here 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:41.189
 180 degrees supply time until 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:44.099
 two hours will look after if needed 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:47.299
 will later we add time or 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:51.810
 on the contrary we will decrease but two hours is a minimum 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:57.419
 so our duck stayed in the oven I 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:01.439
 it was fried it 3:20 we look at it 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:03.659
 ready and all the little meat has moved away from 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.819
 bones a little bit it cools down 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.310
 we will cut portions 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.299
 and serve our guests on the table 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.299
