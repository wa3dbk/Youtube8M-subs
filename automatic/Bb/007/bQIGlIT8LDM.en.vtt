know<00:03:33.690> anything<00:03:33.989> about<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.470> but<00:03:34.950> they<00:03:35.100> took<00:03:35.340> the

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
know anything about it but they took the

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.190 
know anything about it but they took the
leap<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.880> they<00:03:36.000> did<00:03:36.209> it<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:36.450> they<00:03:36.540> committed

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
leap and they did it and they committed

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.440 
leap and they did it and they committed
to<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.769> really<00:03:38.370> all<00:03:38.580> they<00:03:38.760> had<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:38.970> do<00:03:39.239> was

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
to it and really all they had to do was

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.570 
to it and really all they had to do was
believe<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:39.840> it<00:03:40.050> would<00:03:40.290> work<00:03:40.320> out<00:03:40.650> but<00:03:41.459> you

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
believe that it would work out but you

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.110 
believe that it would work out but you
have<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:42.180> believe<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.600> entire<00:03:43.500> time<00:03:44.190> that's

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
have to believe the entire time that's

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.300 
have to believe the entire time that's
the<00:03:45.480> problem<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:46.019> lot<00:03:46.350> of<00:03:46.380> people<00:03:46.500> panic<00:03:47.160> in<00:03:47.280> the

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
the problem a lot of people panic in the

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.520 
the problem a lot of people panic in the
middle<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:47.940> then<00:03:48.420> they<00:03:48.600> freak<00:03:48.870> out<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.290> then

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
middle and then they freak out and then

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.710 
middle and then they freak out and then
they<00:03:49.680> have<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.130> worst<00:03:50.459> accidents<00:03:51.269> of<00:03:51.450> their

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
they have the worst accidents of their

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.290 
they have the worst accidents of their
lives<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:52.530> have<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:52.980> stay<00:03:53.340> committed<00:03:53.880> the

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
lives you have to stay committed the

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.600 
lives you have to stay committed the
entire<00:03:54.870> time<00:03:55.230> you're<00:03:55.440> doing<00:03:55.590> something<00:03:56.070> how

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
entire time you're doing something how

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.330 
entire time you're doing something how
do<00:03:56.670> you<00:03:56.820> do<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.180> you<00:03:57.540> relax<00:03:58.050> damn<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:59.190> know

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
do you do it you relax damn it you know

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.759 
do you do it you relax damn it you know
when<00:03:59.519> you<00:03:59.670> tell<00:03:59.910> people<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.390> relax<00:04:00.900> that's<00:04:01.410> the

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
when you tell people to relax that's the

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.000 
when you tell people to relax that's the
one<00:04:02.070> thing<00:04:02.610> they<00:04:03.000> don't<00:04:03.330> do<00:04:03.780> if<00:04:04.050> you<00:04:04.440> say<00:04:04.680> relax

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
one thing they don't do if you say relax

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.550 
one thing they don't do if you say relax
damn<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:05.670> it<00:04:05.880> turns<00:04:06.330> it<00:04:06.510> into<00:04:06.660> a<00:04:06.810> joke<00:04:07.140> it's

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
damn it it turns it into a joke it's

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.729 
damn it it turns it into a joke it's
something<00:04:07.830> that<00:04:08.190> they<00:04:08.370> can<00:04:08.580> have<00:04:08.820> fun<00:04:09.239> with<00:04:09.739> so

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
something that they can have fun with so

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.039 
something that they can have fun with so
relaxing<00:04:11.519> is<00:04:11.670> good<00:04:11.760> for<00:04:12.120> two<00:04:12.330> reasons<00:04:12.570> the

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
relaxing is good for two reasons the

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.890 
relaxing is good for two reasons the
first<00:04:13.290> is<00:04:13.769> actually<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.970> physics<00:04:15.450> of<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.810> way

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
first is actually the physics of the way

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.360 
first is actually the physics of the way
a<00:04:15.930> mountain<00:04:16.260> bike<00:04:16.410> works<00:04:16.709> if<00:04:16.919> you're<00:04:17.250> all

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
a mountain bike works if you're all

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.599 
a mountain bike works if you're all
stiff<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.080> then<00:04:19.080> all<00:04:19.470> of<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.890> little<00:04:20.250> bumps

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
stiff and then all of the little bumps

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.270 
stiff and then all of the little bumps
and<00:04:20.850> turns<00:04:21.060> on<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.390> trail<00:04:21.630> get<00:04:22.229> put<00:04:22.890> up<00:04:23.010> into

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
and turns on the trail get put up into

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.740 
and turns on the trail get put up into
you<00:04:23.370> and<00:04:23.460> you're<00:04:23.580> going<00:04:23.700> to<00:04:23.760> crash<00:04:24.000> it's<00:04:24.539> not

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
you and you're going to crash it's not

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.300 
you and you're going to crash it's not
going<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:24.990> be<00:04:25.080> pretty<00:04:25.320> fun<00:04:25.620> but<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:26.190> other

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
going to be pretty fun but the other

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.640 
going to be pretty fun but the other
thing<00:04:26.580> is<00:04:26.729> to<00:04:26.880> remember<00:04:27.000> that

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
thing is to remember that

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.010 
thing is to remember that
biking<00:04:27.979> is<00:04:28.100> supposed<00:04:28.460> to<00:04:28.610> be<00:04:28.759> fun<00:04:29.240> it's<00:04:29.810> not

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
biking is supposed to be fun it's not

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.930 
biking is supposed to be fun it's not
supposed<00:04:30.229> to<00:04:30.560> be<00:04:30.650> this<00:04:30.889> effort<00:04:31.370> it's<00:04:31.729> not

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
supposed to be this effort it's not

supposed to be this effort it's not
supposed<00:04:32.360> to<00:04:32.449> be<00:04:32.540> something<00:04:33.139> that<00:04:33.169> you<00:04:33.440> cry

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
supposed to be something that you cry

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.469 
supposed to be something that you cry
about<00:04:34.100> it's<00:04:34.490> not<00:04:34.639> supposed<00:04:35.000> to<00:04:35.060> be<00:04:35.150> something

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
about it's not supposed to be something

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:36.820 
about it's not supposed to be something
you<00:04:35.660> worried<00:04:35.870> about<00:04:35.960> you<00:04:36.229> do<00:04:36.410> it<00:04:36.530> with<00:04:36.680> your

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
you worried about you do it with your

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.430 
you worried about you do it with your
buds<00:04:37.190> it's<00:04:37.729> just<00:04:38.030> mountain<00:04:38.479> biking<00:04:38.930> relax

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
buds it's just mountain biking relax

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.249 
buds it's just mountain biking relax
damn<00:04:39.889> it<00:04:40.120> finally<00:04:41.120> keep<00:04:41.360> your<00:04:41.509> wheels<00:04:41.720> rolling

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
damn it finally keep your wheels rolling

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.080 
damn it finally keep your wheels rolling
I<00:04:42.410> really<00:04:43.220> wish<00:04:43.370> I<00:04:43.520> knew<00:04:43.669> enough<00:04:43.940> about

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
I really wish I knew enough about

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.870 
I really wish I knew enough about
physics<00:04:44.780> to<00:04:45.050> tell<00:04:45.259> you<00:04:45.380> guys<00:04:45.560> why<00:04:46.009> when<00:04:46.759> you

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
physics to tell you guys why when you

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.210 
physics to tell you guys why when you
lock<00:04:47.180> up<00:04:47.389> your<00:04:47.419> brakes<00:04:47.870> and<00:04:48.199> stop<00:04:48.740> your<00:04:48.919> wheels

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
lock up your brakes and stop your wheels

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.370 
lock up your brakes and stop your wheels
all<00:04:49.520> of<00:04:49.789> a<00:04:49.880> sudden<00:04:50.240> your<00:04:50.389> bike<00:04:50.630> like<00:04:50.900> just<00:04:51.169> goes

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
all of a sudden your bike like just goes

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.310 
all of a sudden your bike like just goes
all<00:04:51.590> skittish<00:04:52.009> but<00:04:52.580> it<00:04:52.759> does<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.720> secret<00:04:54.169> is

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
all skittish but it does the secret is

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.499 
all skittish but it does the secret is
to<00:04:54.500> actually<00:04:54.680> led<00:04:55.400> up<00:04:55.610> to<00:04:55.850> keep<00:04:56.150> your<00:04:56.330> wheels

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
to actually led up to keep your wheels

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:58.450 
to actually led up to keep your wheels
rolling<00:04:57.080> and<00:04:57.229> the<00:04:57.560> more<00:04:57.800> you<00:04:57.830> do<00:04:58.190> that<00:04:58.220> the

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
rolling and the more you do that the

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.820 
rolling and the more you do that the
more<00:04:58.970> you're<00:04:59.509> going<00:04:59.660> to<00:04:59.780> stay<00:05:00.020> on<00:05:00.169> course<00:05:00.440> even

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
more you're going to stay on course even

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.010 
more you're going to stay on course even
though<00:05:01.100> it's<00:05:01.280> just<00:05:01.610> a<00:05:01.789> little<00:05:02.060> bit<00:05:02.210> scary<00:05:02.600> you

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
though it's just a little bit scary you

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.290 
though it's just a little bit scary you
find<00:05:03.320> you<00:05:03.470> make<00:05:03.650> it<00:05:03.800> all<00:05:03.919> the<00:05:03.949> way<00:05:04.100> through<00:05:04.490> so

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
find you make it all the way through so

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.320 
find you make it all the way through so
I<00:05:05.330> hope<00:05:05.539> now<00:05:05.720> you<00:05:05.780> don't<00:05:06.050> crash
