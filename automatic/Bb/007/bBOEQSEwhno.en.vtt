I'm pretty much screwed and see

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.960 
I'm pretty much screwed and see
they<00:01:59.110> told<00:01:59.440> me<00:01:59.560> that<00:01:59.770> best<00:02:00.280> option<00:02:00.820> is<00:02:00.940> to

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
they told me that best option is to

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.680 
they told me that best option is to
irrigate<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:01.750> process<00:02:02.200> as<00:02:02.350> much<00:02:02.620> as<00:02:02.800> possible

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
irrigate the process as much as possible

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.510 
irrigate the process as much as possible
that's<00:02:04.690> really<00:02:05.020> interesting<00:02:05.170> so<00:02:05.710> in<00:02:05.980> his<00:02:06.220> case

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
that's really interesting so in his case

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.490 
that's really interesting so in his case
remaining<00:02:07.090> in<00:02:07.180> Arizona<00:02:07.660> for<00:02:07.990> some<00:02:08.170> reason

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
remaining in Arizona for some reason

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.410 
remaining in Arizona for some reason
saved<00:02:08.800> him<00:02:08.979> from<00:02:09.010> being<00:02:09.280> deported<00:02:09.640> which<00:02:10.030> III

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
saved him from being deported which III

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.150 
saved him from being deported which III
guess<00:02:10.840> every<00:02:11.200> individual<00:02:11.620> case<00:02:11.830> is<00:02:12.010> different

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
guess every individual case is different

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.210 
guess every individual case is different
but<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.520> would<00:02:12.840> think<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.050> exact<00:02:14.350> opposite<00:02:14.800> but

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
but I would think the exact opposite but

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.070 
but I would think the exact opposite but
when<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.430> got<00:02:15.640> from<00:02:15.880> that<00:02:15.910> video<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.630> we<00:02:16.870> really

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
when I got from that video is we really

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.860 
when I got from that video is we really
need<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.410> change<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.700> way<00:02:18.850> we<00:02:19.120> do<00:02:19.300> things<00:02:19.510> with
