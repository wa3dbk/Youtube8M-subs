one<00:00:00.299> of<00:00:00.420> the<00:00:00.480> major<00:00:00.750> issues<00:00:01.170> we<00:00:01.350> have<00:00:01.589> is<00:00:01.829> our

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
one of the major issues we have is our

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.889 
one of the major issues we have is our
pipes<00:00:02.220> are<00:00:02.429> so<00:00:02.580> old<00:00:02.790> that<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.179> water<00:00:03.419> comes

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
pipes are so old that the water comes

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.270 
pipes are so old that the water comes
out<00:00:04.049> brown<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:04.920> Rusty's<00:00:06.649> if<00:00:07.649> it<00:00:07.890> comes<00:00:08.099> out

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
out brown and Rusty's if it comes out

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.209 
out brown and Rusty's if it comes out
and<00:00:08.670> this<00:00:08.790> is<00:00:08.910> what<00:00:09.090> students<00:00:09.450> are<00:00:09.540> drinking

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:10.219 
and this is what students are drinking

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.290 
and this is what students are drinking
and<00:00:11.219> you<00:00:11.370> can<00:00:11.490> kind<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.730> look<00:00:11.849> in<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.120> bucket

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
and you can kind of look in the bucket

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.620 
and you can kind of look in the bucket
there<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:13.139> water<00:00:14.179> the<00:00:15.179> one<00:00:15.330> who<00:00:15.420> turns

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
there and the water the one who turns

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.480 
there and the water the one who turns
off<00:00:15.809> with<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.049> sediment<00:00:16.560> as<00:00:16.710> it's<00:00:17.279> coming

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
off with the sediment as it's coming

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.580 
off with the sediment as it's coming
down<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.910> bucket<00:00:18.240> turns<00:00:18.480> brown<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:19.380> is

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
down in the bucket turns brown this is

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.340 
down in the bucket turns brown this is
from<00:00:19.770> daily<00:00:20.130> accumulation<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.270> iron<00:00:21.900> oxide

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
from daily accumulation of iron oxide

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.550 
from daily accumulation of iron oxide
arrest<00:00:22.680> that's<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.400> our<00:00:23.460> pipes<00:00:23.730> just<00:00:24.410> a<00:00:25.410> very

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
arrest that's in our pipes just a very

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.290 
arrest that's in our pipes just a very
small<00:00:25.650> example<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.730> what<00:00:26.910> we<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
small example of what we have in the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.460 
small example of what we have in the
pipes<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:27.779> our<00:00:28.289> largest<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.849> three<00:00:29.880> gems

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
pipes so our largest of the three gems

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.280 
pipes so our largest of the three gems
leaks<00:00:31.470> water<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.489> if<00:00:32.579> there's<00:00:32.820> heavy<00:00:33.270> rain<00:00:33.630> so

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
leaks water and if there's heavy rain so

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.900 
leaks water and if there's heavy rain so
when<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.620> water<00:00:35.040> leaks<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.610> gym<00:00:35.880> floor

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
when the water leaks on the gym floor

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.260 
when the water leaks on the gym floor
students<00:00:36.750> can't<00:00:36.960> participate<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.710> PE<00:00:38.280> because

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
students can't participate in PE because

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.970 
students can't participate in PE because
of<00:00:39.450> safety<00:00:39.660> concerns<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:40.410> them<00:00:40.559> slipping<00:00:40.890> and

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
of safety concerns of them slipping and

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.400 
of safety concerns of them slipping and
falling<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:41.910> we'll<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.629> line<00:00:43.020> of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
falling and so we'll have a line of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.450 
falling and so we'll have a line of
water<00:00:44.480> probably<00:00:45.480> about<00:00:45.690> six<00:00:46.050> feet<00:00:46.260> wide<00:00:46.469> that

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
water probably about six feet wide that

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.369 
water probably about six feet wide that
will<00:00:47.910> have<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.360> put<00:00:48.510> cones<00:00:48.750> around<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.289> to

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
will have to put cones around just to

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.979 
will have to put cones around just to
make<00:00:49.530> sure<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.860> nobody<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.489> slipping<00:00:51.390> you

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
make sure that nobody is slipping you

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.170 
make sure that nobody is slipping you
can<00:00:52.170> see<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.379> duct<00:00:52.800> taped<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.760> duct<00:00:54.000> taped

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
can see I duct taped it so I duct taped

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.520 
can see I duct taped it so I duct taped
it<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.480> put<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.660> stick<00:00:54.960> there<00:00:55.969> so<00:00:57.350> last<00:00:58.350> year

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
it and put the stick there so last year

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.310 
it and put the stick there so last year
we<00:00:59.149> probably<00:01:00.149> spent<00:01:00.510> one<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:01.050> every<00:01:01.260> three

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
we probably spent one of every three

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.799 
we probably spent one of every three
winter<00:01:02.250> days<00:01:02.489> without<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.420> heat<00:01:03.600> working

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
winter days without the heat working

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.020 
winter days without the heat working
well<00:01:04.170> there's<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.589> lot<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.890> asbestos<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.880> this

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
well there's a lot of asbestos in this

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.210 
well there's a lot of asbestos in this
room<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.900> need<00:01:07.170> be<00:01:07.260> very<00:01:07.500> mindful<00:01:07.799> when

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
room so I need be very mindful when

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.830 
room so I need be very mindful when
moving<00:01:08.430> any<00:01:08.700> equipment<00:01:09.030> around<00:01:09.330> or<00:01:09.510> doing<00:01:09.720> any

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
moving any equipment around or doing any

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.070 
moving any equipment around or doing any
work<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.260> here<00:01:10.530> not<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.400> expose<00:01:12.210> any<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.900> that

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
work in here not to expose any of that

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.260 
work in here not to expose any of that
contained<00:01:13.619> asbestos<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> fourth<00:01:15.090> grade

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
contained asbestos so the fourth grade

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.359 
contained asbestos so the fourth grade
is<00:01:15.420> actually<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.900> other<00:01:16.110> side<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
is actually on the other side of the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.219 
is actually on the other side of the
school<00:01:17.729> but<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.390> then<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.720> one<00:01:18.990> fourth

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
school but and then we have one fourth

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.020 
school but and then we have one fourth
grade<00:01:19.409> class<00:01:19.470> here<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.100> then<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.850> music

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
grade class here and then we have music

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.789 
grade class here and then we have music
out<00:01:21.330> here<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:22.020> some<00:01:22.380> reading<00:01:22.619> intervention

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
out here and some reading intervention

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.820 
out here and some reading intervention
classes<00:01:23.369> out<00:01:23.490> here<00:01:23.900> school<00:01:24.900> sykes<00:01:25.170> out<00:01:25.409> here

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
classes out here school sykes out here

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.850 
classes out here school sykes out here
and<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.850> have<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.270> lot<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.810> lot<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.560> classes

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
and so we have a lot a lot of classes

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.770 
and so we have a lot a lot of classes
that<00:01:28.890> are<00:01:29.040> outside<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:30.150> building<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.630> we

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
that are outside of the building and we

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.990 
that are outside of the building and we
have<00:01:30.930> more<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.979> other<00:01:32.130> side<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.579> our

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
have more on the other side to our

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.390 
have more on the other side to our
classrooms<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.689> not<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.960> real<00:01:34.409> walls<00:01:34.829> these

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
classrooms do not have real walls these

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.399 
classrooms do not have real walls these
are<00:01:35.549> actually<00:01:35.939> room<00:01:36.210> dividers<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.750> are<00:01:37.110> not

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
are actually room dividers that are not

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.140 
are actually room dividers that are not
sound<00:01:37.770> proofed<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:38.850> quite

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
sound proofed and that can be quite

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.090 
sound proofed and that can be quite
distracting<00:01:39.810> for<00:01:40.049> students<00:01:40.470> who<00:01:40.530> are<00:01:40.590> testing

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
distracting for students who are testing

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.889 
distracting for students who are testing
in<00:01:41.189> one<00:01:41.369> classroom<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:42.119> maybe<00:01:42.360> watching<00:01:42.689> a

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
in one classroom but maybe watching a

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.749 
in one classroom but maybe watching a
movie<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.170> another<00:01:43.439> classroom<00:01:43.710> or<00:01:44.280> doing<00:01:44.670> a

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
movie in another classroom or doing a

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.120 
movie in another classroom or doing a
group<00:01:44.970> activity<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.990> here's<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.380> math<00:01:46.799> class

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
group activity so here's a math class

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.219 
group activity so here's a math class
