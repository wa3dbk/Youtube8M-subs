00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.449 
think it's important to share my story
because<00:02:08.329> I've<00:02:08.630> been<00:02:08.660> blessed<00:02:09.200> as<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.590> career<00:02:10.250> to

because I've been blessed as a career to

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:11.890 
because I've been blessed as a career to
be<00:02:10.579> able<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:10.910> rise<00:02:11.209> up<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.450> corporate<00:02:11.810> ladder

be able to rise up the corporate ladder

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.930 
be able to rise up the corporate ladder
so<00:02:12.410> many<00:02:12.590> people<00:02:12.950> haven't<00:02:13.670> had<00:02:13.819> the
