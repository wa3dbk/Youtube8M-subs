three of those open looks he got early

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.530 
three of those open looks he got early
different<00:01:06.430> game<00:01:06.579> but<00:01:06.820> he<00:01:06.880> did<00:01:07.060> knock<00:01:07.270> him<00:01:07.420> down

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
different game but he did knock him down

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.540 
different game but he did knock him down
and<00:01:07.600> like<00:01:07.810> you<00:01:07.840> said<00:01:08.110> got<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:09.070> confidence

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
and like you said got the the confidence

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.130 
and like you said got the the confidence
in<00:01:09.640> himself<00:01:09.760> got<00:01:10.150> some<00:01:10.300> momentum<00:01:10.690> going<00:01:10.930> and

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
in himself got some momentum going and

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.450 
in himself got some momentum going and
it<00:01:11.229> really<00:01:11.409> turned<00:01:11.650> again<00:01:11.890> Allen<00:01:12.250> I<00:01:12.310> don't

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
it really turned again Allen I don't

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.420 
it really turned again Allen I don't
think<00:01:12.640> they<00:01:12.760> respected<00:01:13.570> not<00:01:14.260> only<00:01:14.290> Jeremy<00:01:14.950> Lin

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
think they respected not only Jeremy Lin

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.210 
think they respected not only Jeremy Lin
but<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:15.940> Knicks<00:01:16.800> because<00:01:17.800> they<00:01:17.950> played

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
but the Knicks because they played

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.620 
but the Knicks because they played
back-to-back<00:01:18.640> they<00:01:19.120> didn't<00:01:19.330> know<00:01:19.390> much<00:01:19.570> about

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
back-to-back they didn't know much about

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.210 
back-to-back they didn't know much about
him<00:01:20.080> I<00:01:20.140> don't<00:01:20.290> think<00:01:20.409> they<00:01:20.470> knew<00:01:20.620> much<00:01:20.890> about

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
him I don't think they knew much about

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.950 
him I don't think they knew much about
who<00:01:21.610> they<00:01:21.760> were<00:01:21.850> gonna<00:01:21.940> see<00:01:22.270> on<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.540> Knicks<00:01:22.750> in

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
who they were gonna see on the Knicks in

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.719 
who they were gonna see on the Knicks in
particular<00:01:23.770> because<00:01:23.920> it's<00:01:24.040> a<00:01:24.100> different<00:01:24.370> team

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
particular because it's a different team

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.000 
particular because it's a different team

terrible<00:02:11.200> but<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.099> only<00:02:12.219> thing<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.430> could

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:12.639 
terrible but the only thing you could

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:14.519 
terrible but the only thing you could
say<00:02:12.849> is<00:02:13.029> that<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.419> Knicks<00:02:13.629> are<00:02:13.779> only<00:02:13.900> up<00:02:14.109> eight

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:14.529 
say is that the Knicks are only up eight

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:16.319 
say is that the Knicks are only up eight
and<00:02:14.859> half<00:02:15.040> time<00:02:15.279> when<00:02:15.489> it<00:02:15.609> probably<00:02:16.150> should

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
and half time when it probably should

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:16.720 
and half time when it probably should
have<00:02:16.359> been

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
have been

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.699 
have been
15:18<00:02:18.030> something<00:02:18.450> like<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.750> got<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.110> 14<00:02:19.530> at

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
15:18 something like that got to 14 at

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.199 
15:18 something like that got to 14 at
one<00:02:19.890> point<00:02:20.069> you<00:02:20.250> thought<00:02:20.400> okay<00:02:20.700> push<00:02:20.970> this<00:02:21.150> a

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
one point you thought okay push this a

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.729 
one point you thought okay push this a
little<00:02:21.299> bit<00:02:21.540> closer<00:02:21.659> to<00:02:21.870> 20<00:02:22.110> at<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.319> half<00:02:22.500> and

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
little bit closer to 20 at the half and

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.470 
little bit closer to 20 at the half and
maybe<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.489> get<00:02:23.579> some<00:02:23.640> quit<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.150> lake<00:02:24.329> or

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
maybe you get some quit in the lake or

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.119 
maybe you get some quit in the lake or
legs<00:02:24.689> but<00:02:24.870> no<00:02:24.989> they<00:02:25.110> did<00:02:25.290> hang<00:02:25.439> in<00:02:25.620> there<00:02:25.890> they

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
legs but no they did hang in there they

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.470 
legs but no they did hang in there they
were<00:02:26.220> probably<00:02:26.549> disappointed<00:02:26.939> that<00:02:27.150> the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
were probably disappointed that the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.690 
were probably disappointed that the
Knicks<00:02:27.720> were<00:02:27.900> at<00:02:28.170> halftime<00:02:28.439> only<00:02:29.099> being<00:02:29.340> up<00:02:29.519> a

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
Knicks were at halftime only being up a

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.520 
Knicks were at halftime only being up a
because<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.120> Lakers<00:02:30.450> did<00:02:30.629> not<00:02:30.840> play<00:02:31.079> well<00:02:31.319> and

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
because the Lakers did not play well and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.050 
because the Lakers did not play well and
then<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.860> then<00:02:31.980> third<00:02:32.250> quarter<00:02:32.519> had<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.730> Kobe

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
then and then third quarter had the Kobe

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.500 
then and then third quarter had the Kobe

dynamic one for his first 11 Kobe Bryant

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.119 
dynamic one for his first 11 Kobe Bryant
yet<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.049> third<00:02:37.260> quarter<00:02:37.530> started<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.010> heat

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129
