that<00:01:09.219> they<00:01:09.850> live<00:01:10.000> a<00:01:10.090> long<00:01:10.299> time<00:01:10.329> though<00:01:10.840> which

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
that they live a long time though which

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.889 
that they live a long time though which
is<00:01:11.020> why<00:01:11.259> I<00:01:11.530> say<00:01:11.829> it<00:01:11.890> takes<00:01:12.100> commitment<00:01:12.689> 25<00:01:13.689> to

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
is why I say it takes commitment 25 to

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:21.289 
is why I say it takes commitment 25 to
30<00:01:14.140> years<00:01:17.219> as<00:01:18.509> let's<00:01:19.509> talk<00:01:19.659> about<00:01:19.780> training<00:01:20.280> so

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
30 years as let's talk about training so

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.940 
30 years as let's talk about training so
that's<00:01:22.299> another<00:01:22.570> thing<00:01:22.719> that<00:01:22.960> makes<00:01:23.320> you<00:01:23.770> have

every 30 minutes you can interchange

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.319 
every 30 minutes you can interchange
your<00:01:33.159> monkey<00:01:33.549> but<00:01:33.850> I<00:01:34.179> don't<00:01:34.749> really<00:01:34.899> know<00:01:35.079> how
