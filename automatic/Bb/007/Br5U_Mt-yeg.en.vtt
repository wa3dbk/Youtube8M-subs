again<00:00:45.519> and<00:00:45.789> now<00:00:46.209> they<00:00:46.359> basically<00:00:46.629> just<00:00:46.749> remake

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
again and now they basically just remake

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.049 
again and now they basically just remake
their<00:00:47.530> old<00:00:47.709> games<00:00:47.949> for<00:00:48.489> other<00:00:48.639> people's

their old games for other people's
consoles<00:00:49.569> and<00:00:49.690> devices<00:00:50.409> but<00:00:51.249> with<00:00:51.399> some<00:00:51.549> of

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:51.639 
consoles and devices but with some of

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:52.919 
consoles and devices but with some of
the<00:00:51.699> recent<00:00:52.059> events<00:00:52.359> that<00:00:52.389> have<00:00:52.600> actually

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:52.929 
the recent events that have actually

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:54.750 
the recent events that have actually
been<00:00:53.079> happening<00:00:53.260> in<00:00:53.619> the<00:00:53.769> console<00:00:54.159> industry<00:00:54.309> I

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
been happening in the console industry I

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.759 
been happening in the console industry I
think<00:00:55.299> that<00:00:55.420> Sega<00:00:55.659> could<00:00:56.049> make<00:00:56.229> an<00:00:56.409> excellent

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
think that Sega could make an excellent

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.519 
think that Sega could make an excellent
comeback<00:00:57.280> if<00:00:57.519> they<00:00:57.940> wanted<00:00:58.269> to<00:00:58.409> second<00:00:59.409> is

00:00:59.519 --> 00:00:59.529 
comeback if they wanted to second is

00:00:59.529 --> 00:01:01.079 
comeback if they wanted to second is
still<00:00:59.649> a<00:00:59.769> multi-million<00:01:00.639> dollar<00:01:00.670> company

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
still a multi-million dollar company

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:03.059 
still a multi-million dollar company
they<00:01:01.690> have<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.959> funds<00:01:02.199> to<00:01:02.469> get<00:01:02.589> into<00:01:02.949> the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:03.069 
they have the funds to get into the

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:05.369 
they have the funds to get into the
console<00:01:03.459> war<00:01:03.639> again<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.150> they<00:01:04.930> do<00:01:04.989> have<00:01:05.350> a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
console war again and they do have a

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.380 
console war again and they do have a
reason<00:01:05.649> to<00:01:05.859> be<00:01:05.950> reluctant<00:01:06.219> but<00:01:06.850> I<00:01:06.880> think<00:01:07.149> they

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
reason to be reluctant but I think they

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.899 
reason to be reluctant but I think they
could<00:01:07.659> do<00:01:07.930> it<00:01:08.109> so<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:09.100> current<00:01:09.340> generation<00:01:09.820> of

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
could do it so the current generation of

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.940 
could do it so the current generation of
Microsoft's<00:01:10.390> Nintendo<00:01:10.869> and<00:01:11.049> Sony<00:01:11.259> those

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
Microsoft's Nintendo and Sony those

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.709 
Microsoft's Nintendo and Sony those
three<00:01:12.250> companies<00:01:12.579> they've<00:01:13.030> been<00:01:13.210> around<00:01:13.420> for

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
three companies they've been around for

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.080 
three companies they've been around for
over<00:01:13.750> a<00:01:14.049> decade<00:01:14.289> now<00:01:14.710> as<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.280> three<00:01:15.520> big<00:01:15.820> names

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
over a decade now as the three big names

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.719 
over a decade now as the three big names
in<00:01:16.329> gaming<00:01:16.750> and<00:01:16.929> you<00:01:17.469> know<00:01:17.560> entering<00:01:18.009> a<00:01:18.189> second

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
in gaming and you know entering a second

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.730 
in gaming and you know entering a second
entering<00:01:19.060> now<00:01:19.240> we<00:01:19.750> need<00:01:19.960> them<00:01:20.079> to<00:01:20.200> not<00:01:20.350> only<00:01:20.380> do

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
entering now we need them to not only do

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.649 
entering now we need them to not only do
something<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:21.159> big<00:01:21.340> three<00:01:21.670> don't<00:01:21.909> do<00:01:22.210> they

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
something the big three don't do they

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.419 
something the big three don't do they
would<00:01:22.810> also<00:01:23.049> have<00:01:23.320> to<00:01:23.380> be<00:01:23.530> technologically<00:01:24.189> on

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:24.429 
would also have to be technologically on

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:27.029 
would also have to be technologically on
par<00:01:24.820> which<00:01:25.299> is<00:01:25.450> quite<00:01:25.630> expensive<00:01:25.869> and<00:01:26.380> in<00:01:26.920> of

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
par which is quite expensive and in of

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:29.130 
par which is quite expensive and in of
itself<00:01:27.490> considering<00:01:28.149> that<00:01:28.329> Sony<00:01:28.570> only<00:01:28.929> broke

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
itself considering that Sony only broke

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.679 
itself considering that Sony only broke
even<00:01:29.380> in<00:01:29.679> early<00:01:29.829> 2010<00:01:30.640> so<00:01:31.450> with<00:01:31.600> these

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
even in early 2010 so with these

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.599 
even in early 2010 so with these
barriers<00:01:32.140> to<00:01:32.259> entry<00:01:32.590> what<00:01:32.979> would<00:01:33.130> spur<00:01:33.369> me<00:01:33.490> to

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
barriers to entry what would spur me to

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:36.120 
barriers to entry what would spur me to
think<00:01:33.789> that<00:01:33.880> Sega<00:01:34.119> could<00:01:34.359> rise<00:01:34.539> again<00:01:34.960> well<00:01:35.740> if

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
think that Sega could rise again well if

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.039 
think that Sega could rise again well if
they<00:01:36.310> saw<00:01:36.789> a<00:01:36.820> lot<00:01:37.119> of<00:01:37.149> things<00:01:37.420> that<00:01:37.630> actually

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
they saw a lot of things that actually

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.130 
they saw a lot of things that actually
indicate<00:01:38.530> that<00:01:38.710> for<00:01:38.950> instance<00:01:39.549> 2nd<00:01:40.479> 2010

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.719 
indicate that for instance 2nd 2010

down to their core franchises therefore

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.710

poor<00:02:35.350> ones<00:02:35.590> and<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:36.400> think<00:02:36.490> with<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.030> new<00:02:37.210> console

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
poor ones and I think with a new console

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.150 
poor ones and I think with a new console
that<00:02:38.110> would<00:02:38.230> give<00:02:38.380> them<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.680> freedom<00:02:38.830> once

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
that would give them the freedom once

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.550 
that would give them the freedom once
again<00:02:39.460> to<00:02:39.640> sort<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:39.880> expand<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:40.750> try<00:02:41.380> new

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
again to sort of expand and try new

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.710 
again to sort of expand and try new
things<00:02:41.590> again<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.760> get<00:02:42.880> other<00:02:43.120> developers

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
things again and to get other developers

things again and to get other developers
on<00:02:43.840> board<00:02:44.140> for<00:02:44.470> their<00:02:44.650> console<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.220> think<00:02:45.550> a<00:02:45.640> lot

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
on board for their console I think a lot

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.890 
on board for their console I think a lot
of<00:02:45.940> people<00:02:46.210> could<00:02:46.420> actually<00:02:46.570> be<00:02:46.780> very

sudden<00:03:24.760> you<00:03:25.390> know<00:03:25.510> current<00:03:25.990> consoles<00:03:26.500> they're

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
sudden you know current consoles they're

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.530 
sudden you know current consoles they're
not<00:03:27.190> great<00:03:27.640> steps<00:03:28.030> up<00:03:28.240> from<00:03:28.360> their

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
not great steps up from their

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.480 
not great steps up from their
predecessors<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:29.320> there<00:03:29.770> is<00:03:29.920> certainly<00:03:30.400> room

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
predecessors and there is certainly room

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.640 
predecessors and there is certainly room
for<00:03:30.700> another<00:03:31.060> company<00:03:31.330> to<00:03:31.660> enter<00:03:31.810> if<00:03:32.320> they

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
for another company to enter if they

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.510 
for another company to enter if they
were<00:03:32.770> to<00:03:32.920> do<00:03:33.070> something<00:03:33.370> really

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
were to do something really

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.780 
were to do something really
groundbreaking<00:03:33.970> and<00:03:34.420> innovative<00:03:35.410> if<00:03:36.100> if<00:03:36.610> for

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
groundbreaking and innovative if if for

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.460 
groundbreaking and innovative if if for
instance<00:03:36.850> a<00:03:37.240> goes<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:37.600> come<00:03:37.780> in<00:03:37.930> with<00:03:38.080> a<00:03:38.110> fancy

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
instance a goes to come in with a fancy

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.470 
instance a goes to come in with a fancy
new<00:03:38.650> hybrid<00:03:39.190> console<00:03:39.670> that<00:03:40.180> would<00:03:40.330> be<00:03:40.450> a

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
new hybrid console that would be a

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.320 
new hybrid console that would be a
flawless<00:03:40.990> strategy<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:42.280> think<00:03:42.730> that<00:03:43.030> could

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
flawless strategy and I think that could

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.870 
flawless strategy and I think that could
get<00:03:43.540> Sega<00:03:43.810> back<00:03:44.440> in<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.709> game<00:03:44.920> yet<00:03:45.340> again<00:03:45.640> I

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
get Sega back in the game yet again I

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.699 
get Sega back in the game yet again I
think<00:03:46.420> Sega<00:03:46.870> is<00:03:47.080> up<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.350> something

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
think Sega is up to something

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.830 
think Sega is up to something
and<00:03:47.830> I<00:03:48.340> don't<00:03:48.489> think<00:03:48.820> that<00:03:49.030> a<00:03:49.150> console<00:03:49.600> may<00:03:49.780> be

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
and I don't think that a console may be

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.560 
and I don't think that a console may be
coming<00:03:50.110> too<00:03:50.440> soon<00:03:50.680> from<00:03:50.860> Sega<00:03:51.070> but<00:03:51.790> I<00:03:52.030> think

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
coming too soon from Sega but I think

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.180 
coming too soon from Sega but I think
it's<00:03:52.690> only<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.930> matter<00:03:52.989> of<00:03:53.260> time<00:03:53.380> before<00:03:53.770> Sega

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
it's only a matter of time before Sega

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.100 
it's only a matter of time before Sega
does<00:03:54.430> consider<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.360> possibility<00:03:55.989> of

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
does consider the possibility of

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.229 
does consider the possibility of
releasing<00:03:56.680> another<00:03:57.010> console<00:03:57.459> and<00:03:57.640> getting

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
releasing another console and getting

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.140 
releasing another console and getting
back<00:03:58.390> in<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.780> console<00:03:59.200> game<00:03:59.230> yet<00:03:59.980> again<00:04:00.310> let

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
back in the console game yet again let

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.430 
back in the console game yet again let
