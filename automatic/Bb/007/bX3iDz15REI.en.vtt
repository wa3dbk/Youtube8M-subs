got to say over this series and we were

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.789 
got to say over this series and we were
pretty<00:02:59.390> evenly<00:02:59.840> matched<00:02:59.930> when<00:03:00.350> it<00:03:00.470> came<00:03:00.650> to

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
pretty evenly matched when it came to

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.710
