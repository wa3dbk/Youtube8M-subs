00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.990

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.910

 For three days ago have been calling 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:27.120
 sagres 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.709
 but we were a week the people in 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.540
 very kind airs have treated us 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.340
 very well we have felt at home 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.340
 really all the people very cool 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.819
 tell me the theme is that you have 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.420
 the flat what is the inspiration of this 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.730
 topic 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.150
 the theme is inspiration on which a 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.150
 bachata or a pink flat 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.150
 Explain 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.050
 not bad 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:06.370
 It really is a girl which I 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.800
 I liked it at that time but I did not want 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.540
 that nobody else will find out then I 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.959
 I bought a piece of rum and put it and 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:19.720
 then the bread and butter theme this 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:21.010
 theme is that it's a blues but it's a 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.860
 fusion because what has been heard is a fusion 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.300
 of rock and blues exact but ask the 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.639
 version in the reason why I did 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.419
 system you like to add what is the 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.160
 simple exact reason the reason is so me 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.930
 I started to improvise a blues on a 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.919
 situation for a friend to feel 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.900
 more comfortable you feel identified and nothing 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.600
 he stayed in the song so it was a 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.460
 improvisation in the while and then the 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.960
 I played and people are so identified 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.960
 he learned so much that he keeps recording 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.009
 good for us have really been 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.330

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:57.310
