bit a fishy I guess is when you're

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.969 
bit a fishy I guess is when you're
directing<00:01:48.119> when<00:01:48.630> you're<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> female<00:01:49.049> directing

directing when you're a female directing

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.399 
directing when you're a female directing
you<00:01:50.970> get<00:01:51.119> different<00:01:51.360> responses<00:01:52.079> from<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
you get different responses from the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.289 
you get different responses from the
actors<00:01:52.950> there<00:01:53.100> are<00:01:53.189> some<00:01:53.399> actors<00:01:54.000> or

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
actors there are some actors or

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.230 
actors there are some actors or
actresses<00:01:54.329> who<00:01:55.200> prefer<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:56.399> be<00:01:56.549> directed<00:01:57.060> by<00:01:57.210> a

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
actresses who prefer to be directed by a

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.319 
actresses who prefer to be directed by a
man<00:01:57.509> or<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.930> woman<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.250> there's<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.700> very

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
man or a woman and so you there's a very

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.389 
man or a woman and so you there's a very
distinct<00:02:01.200> swing<00:02:01.590> when<00:02:01.860> they<00:02:01.950> walk<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
distinct swing when they walk in the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.550 
distinct swing when they walk in the
door<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:03.420> can<00:02:03.570> go<00:02:03.659> both<00:02:03.810> ways<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.259> can<00:02:04.380> be

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
door and it can go both ways it can be

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.170 
door and it can go both ways it can be
