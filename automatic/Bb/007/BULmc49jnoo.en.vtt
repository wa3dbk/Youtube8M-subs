this was one of your first plan and we
saw<00:00:03.659> back<00:00:03.899> in<00:00:03.929> April<00:00:04.350> right<00:00:04.710> in<00:00:04.890> now<00:00:05.069> they<00:00:05.910> bit

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
because i think we came up with

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.259 
because i think we came up with
something<00:00:12.630> that<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.110> truly<00:00:13.440> unique<00:00:14.059> it<00:00:15.059> was

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
something that is truly unique it was

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.060 
something that is truly unique it was
very<00:00:15.389> conceptual<00:00:16.139> when<00:00:16.320> we<00:00:16.410> presented<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.859> the

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
very conceptual when we presented it the

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.400 
very conceptual when we presented it the
first<00:00:17.279> time<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:17.720> as<00:00:18.720> we've<00:00:18.990> had<00:00:19.140> time<00:00:19.380> to

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
first time but as we've had time to

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.890 
first time but as we've had time to
spend<00:00:20.010> with<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.609> get<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.510> side<00:00:21.720> and

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
spend with it get it on the side and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.349 
spend with it get it on the side and
make<00:00:22.020> sure<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.320> fits<00:00:22.380> it's<00:00:22.800> been<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.970> more<00:00:24.300> and

today so that's great great and so there

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.370 
today so that's great great and so there
could<00:00:35.130> be<00:00:35.160> tweaks<00:00:35.520> oh<00:00:35.820> absolutely<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:37.320> is

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
could be tweaks oh absolutely this is

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.560 
could be tweaks oh absolutely this is
very<00:00:37.829> very<00:00:37.950> early<00:00:38.430> because<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.450> know

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
very very early because you know

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.090 
very very early because you know
schematic<00:00:40.140> design<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.620> really<00:00:40.649> when<00:00:41.010> you

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
schematic design is really when you

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.790 
schematic design is really when you
start<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.820> earnest<00:00:42.329> drawing<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.469> drawings

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
start in earnest drawing the drawings

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.860 
start in earnest drawing the drawings
that<00:00:43.860> world<00:00:44.190> will<00:00:44.460> ultimately<00:00:45.360> tell<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
that world will ultimately tell what the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.110 
that world will ultimately tell what the
project<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.100> we're<00:00:47.370> really<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.610> concept

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
project is and we're really a concept

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.450 
project is and we're really a concept
right<00:00:48.300> now<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.809> we've<00:00:49.680> got<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> long<00:00:50.010> way<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.250> go

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
right now so we've got a long way to go

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.040 
right now so we've got a long way to go
and<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.760> lot<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.940> things<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.300> figure<00:00:51.329> out<00:00:51.600> but

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
and a lot of things to figure out but

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.799 
and a lot of things to figure out but
this<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.890> great<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.640> have<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.809> proved

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
this is great that we have a proved

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.750 
this is great that we have a proved
direction<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> project<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.399> there<00:00:56.610> could

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
direction for the project so there could

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.000 
direction for the project so there could
be<00:00:56.789> changes<00:00:57.210> but<00:00:57.390> for<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.230> most<00:00:58.350> part<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.800> is

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
be changes but for the most part this is

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.979 
be changes but for the most part this is
it<00:00:59.160> this<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.690> you're<00:01:00.899> not

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
it this is it this is it you're not

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.569 
it this is it this is it you're not
going<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.230> see<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.469> know<00:01:01.829> something

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
going to see you know something

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.130 
going to see you know something
radically<00:01:03.149> different<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.750> know<00:01:03.870> three

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
radically different you know three

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.240 
radically different you know three
months<00:01:04.260> from<00:01:04.470> now<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:04.860> going<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.100> basically

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
months from now it's going to basically

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.600 
months from now it's going to basically
be<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> version<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.570> what<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.840> saw<00:01:07.020> today

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
be a version of what you saw today

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.760 
be a version of what you saw today
refined<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:09.240> know<00:01:09.420> adjusted<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.530> site

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
refined you know adjusted to the site

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.530 
refined you know adjusted to the site
depending<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.610> north<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.000> south<00:01:12.210> side

and depending on you know how open we

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.730 
and depending on you know how open we
can<00:01:15.299> make<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.750> all<00:01:15.900> those<00:01:16.080> things<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.470> yet<00:01:16.590> to

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
can make it all those things have yet to

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.280 
can make it all those things have yet to
be<00:01:16.770> determined<00:01:17.299> this<00:01:18.299> plan<00:01:18.570> when<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.110> look<00:01:19.229> at

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
be determined this plan when we look at

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.249 
be determined this plan when we look at
this<00:01:19.380> place<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:19.740> was<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.070> most<00:01:20.900> blank<00:01:21.900> am

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
this place what was the most blank am

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.200 
this place what was the most blank am
part<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.920> new<00:01:23.040> stage<00:01:23.280> if<00:01:23.790> there's<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.030> lot

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
part of the new stage if there's a lot

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.149 
part of the new stage if there's a lot
of<00:01:24.240> elements<00:01:24.450> yeah<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.560> know<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.830> threw<00:01:26.070> out

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
of elements yeah you know we threw out

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.010 
of elements yeah you know we threw out
some<00:01:26.369> ideas<00:01:26.520> at<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.119> beginning<00:01:27.659> just<00:01:27.869> to

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
some ideas at the beginning just to

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.140 
some ideas at the beginning just to
challenge<00:01:28.920> ourselves<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.549> challenge<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
team about you know how can you reach

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.370 
team about you know how can you reach
the<00:01:32.939> fan<00:01:33.150> make<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.540> more<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.020> game<00:01:34.200> day

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
the fan make it more of a game day

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.719 
the fan make it more of a game day
experience<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.130> don't<00:01:35.310> get<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.549> home

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
experience that you don't get it home

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.670 
experience that you don't get it home
and<00:01:35.970> some<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.570> really<00:01:36.720> funny<00:01:37.079> things<00:01:37.409> like

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
and some of the really funny things like

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.350 
and some of the really funny things like
the<00:01:37.799> hundred-yard<00:01:38.220> bars<00:01:38.520> out<00:01:38.850> there<00:01:38.880> which<00:01:39.329> is

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
the hundred-yard bars out there which is

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.850 
the hundred-yard bars out there which is
the<00:01:39.570> bar<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.810> goes<00:01:40.079> end<00:01:40.290> zone<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.619> end<00:01:40.680> zone

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
the bar that goes end zone to end zone

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.950 
the bar that goes end zone to end zone
we<00:01:41.520> talked<00:01:41.729> about<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.119> know<00:01:42.210> vibrating<00:01:42.780> their

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
we talked about you know vibrating their

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.170 
we talked about you know vibrating their
impact<00:01:43.320> seats<00:01:43.619> everybody<00:01:43.950> loved<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:45.119> I

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
impact seats everybody loved that but I

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.030 
impact seats everybody loved that but I
think<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> thing<00:01:45.509> that's<00:01:45.720> more<00:01:46.170> realistic<00:01:46.619> is

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
think the thing that's more realistic is

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.889 
think the thing that's more realistic is
probably<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.729> video<00:01:47.970> display<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.689> video

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
probably the video display the video

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.300 
probably the video display the video
hallo<00:01:49.170> everybody<00:01:49.500> really<00:01:49.890> seems<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.280> like

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
hallo everybody really seems to like

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.069 
hallo everybody really seems to like
that<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.119> think<00:01:51.299> they<00:01:51.420> just<00:01:51.450> generally

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
that and I think they just generally

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.590 
that and I think they just generally
like<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.590> way<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.100> looks<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.579> feels<00:01:53.820> like<00:01:54.030> it's

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
like the way it looks it feels like it's

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.330 
like the way it looks it feels like it's
in<00:01:54.840> motion<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.409> feels<00:01:55.649> like<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.950> has<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.100> lot<00:01:56.310> of

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
in motion it feels like it has a lot of

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.679 
in motion it feels like it has a lot of
energy<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.119> think<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.390> going<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.540> be<00:01:57.630> a

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
energy and I think it's going to be a

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.050 
energy and I think it's going to be a
great<00:01:58.130> addition<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.399> skyline<00:01:59.820> for

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
great addition to the skyline for

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.990 
great addition to the skyline for
Atlanta<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.869> something<00:02:01.259> I'm<00:02:01.439> sure

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
Atlanta and something I'm sure

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.630 
Atlanta and something I'm sure

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
that was your idea that seems to is

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.340 
that was your idea that seems to is
