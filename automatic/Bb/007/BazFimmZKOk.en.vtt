00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.699
 hello to all today we find ourselves 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.619
 for a new video 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.590
 so it's a culture a customization 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.660
 study phone coke forgiveness 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.640
 phone see doc me it's a holster to 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.470
 valve in all simple after that depends where 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.660
 could also do iphone church or 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.449
 galaxies etc. Anytime any 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:51.059
 phone that can have a holster or a 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:53.220
 hard plastic shell so I have not so 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.620
 you did 20 if you all saw 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.470
 but on twitter and facebook 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.820
 I asked a question so it was 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.860
 golden or silver 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.680
 I had to answer everything 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.540
 sange simply to understand and actually 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.520
 it was for this video here because the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.570
 that I did not know if I was doing in 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.360
 relay tones in tones 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.860
 silvered my phone cop and the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.990
 majority of people told me so 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.700
 silvery so I went on the money 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.920
 you are what I personally prefer 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.900
 so it suited me but I preferred 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.159
 still even do according to 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.420
 my subscribers here is so it's a 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.579
 a very quick question nation to make 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.260
 really very very simple you will see that 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.630
 really takes a few minutes 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.810
 so for that we need everything 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.479
 simply 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.990
 a case and phone or or a shell 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.920
 hard enough plastic then that's it 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.689
 we need what is called the 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.220
 feuillade would have therefore found in 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.130
 recreational recreation store 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.039
 so I'll put the registration link 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.920
 as usual then we need to 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.570
 the glue bomb to be able to stick 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.289
 this golden leaf you will see in the 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.399
 tutorial after if you have if you do not 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.520
 no glue in good you can 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:06.250
 maybe with d1 glue sticks 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.780
 glue but I promise you not the end 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.580
 I promise you nothing because I know 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.500
 that on paper it works well that its 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.459
 paper works pretty well the 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:19.720
 sticky tube finally tube stick 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.489
 but but I do not know so sure one of the 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.200
 plastic it would work you can 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.480
 even try me I advise you to 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.670
 take in then I saw Columbo 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.910
 so I took a pen of the same 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.680
 so silvery color you can take 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.709
 golden if you prefer gilding of course 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.799
 and finally, then, some good varnish for 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.410
 protect everything here so for 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:44.200
 start and well we take the end and 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.630
 golden that we cut and we will apply 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.350
 so some bomb glue on the floor to 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.079
 the phone shell and we're actually going 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.579
 tap we'll say with finally tap 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:58.390
 snatch a little home vaguely too 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.519
 explain the leaf adored so on the 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.130
 on the phone hand on the hull more 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.630
 early or where there was glue 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.130
 so we repeat the operation of the other 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:11.920
 side if you do not have our side of course 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:17.709
 So here we go we'll take 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:20.829
 the the pen so silvery then me as 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.510
 I have a big face I liked it 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.190
 put a little in finally ink 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.260
 quotation marks on the side and iron with a 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.260
 a slightly more refined tip to describe 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.180
 my nickname so lille or on the top of 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.010
 the hull at the back or because and 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.709
 the camera 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.810
 So here we write a law what that 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.870
 give then I made small splat 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.540
 hours with with the pen simply and 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.640
 in fact we let it dry and then 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.290
 we will apply the glue in one layer 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.599
 in that will suffice I think and 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.489
 put layers to be safe and 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.480
 let it dry for two hours and so 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.459
 the result after two hours of drying 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.159
 so here I hope that this tutorial very 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.780
 fast anyway enjoy yourself 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:04.060
 you may want to make you want 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.109
 to teach quizzes and your 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.370
 your phone case is really 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.349
 very simple but I think it's pretty 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.359
 result I do not find it too feminine 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.720
 personally after good tell me what 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:19.030
 as you think in the comments 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.300
 so on the other hand before ending the 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.400
 video we will go to the section at 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.190
 discover that I'm going to take for 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.690
 used to do that at each end of my 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.620
 I make videos last week 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.470
 I had this week and I'm going 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.970
 continue so this week well I 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.169
 will you discover if 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.910
 technology 55 so that's still a 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.960
 times so a little known youtube hours 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.090
 who has few subscribers 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.320
 this is the purpose of the section of course 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.570
 what is this one of the people who do not have 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.240
 hungry help people to make themselves known 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:53.260
 which makes us a lot of subscribers so 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.210
 see technology 55 makes videos have 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.970
 makes noises videos to games 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.150
 independent so horror games 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.030
 also but he also makes videos on 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.949
 ps3 games and soon on ps4 games 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.870
 there are not many videos 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:10.120
 so here I let you go see her 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.830
 chain for those who are 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.930
 interested so that they like that it does not 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.419
 does not make video on call of duty so 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.220
 I prefer to warn you because I 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:19.479
 was not necessarily finally I'm not going 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.430
 necessarily make people know 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.930
 who make the same videos as me here 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.750
 so I do scales weigh on 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.800
 that view if it does not, but the 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.330
 blow maybe it can please 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.979
 other people who do not like it too much 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.150
 that the victim and who want to see 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.240
 other kinds of video games that 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.190
 can be pretty cool here I am you 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.990
 let's discover world technology 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.240
