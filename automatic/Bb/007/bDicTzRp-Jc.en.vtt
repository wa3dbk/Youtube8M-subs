00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello everyone I'm Alejandro Serrano from 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.379
 computer science be aromas you can us 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.260
 find in dot dot fish 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.429
 If you are company or professional or in boxes 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.040
 external dotcom 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.070
 If you are particular today I will introduce you 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:22.470
 the adapter of hard drives two and 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:26.670
 medium to usb 3.0 we made the model to 0 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.750
 60 33 an adapter that will allow us 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:35.370
 connect hard drives two and a half takes out 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.940
 our computer either mac or pc via 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.620
 usb 3.0 the unit is as simple as 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.700
 this brings 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.210
 USB 3.0 cable 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:53.550
 the instruction manual that explains 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.550
 that everything that is the adapter itself is 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.660
 as simple as this piece this piece 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.420
 that on the one hand connects to our 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.280
 disc of three and a half two and a half 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.909
 pulls out 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.170
 and on the other side simply 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:14.659
 we would connect 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.659
 our USB 3.0 cable 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.710
 as is 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:25.479
 and we can connect it 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:29.170
 to our computer by USB 3.0 cable 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:31.090
 it's as simple as the USB 3.0 cable that 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.800
 allows up to 5 gigabits per second of 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.970
 data transfer is also 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.670
 compatible with usb 2.0 and 1.1 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.130
 also if we want what is to leave the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.110
 hard disk in a permanent medium way in 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.090
 this adapter we can use this 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.600
 small box to show this box 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.950
 it simply has that we can insert 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:57.220
 our hard drive with the adapter here 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.280
 and close it and we have our boxes 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.679
 of two and a half that box obviously is not 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.890
 metallic is not to have it always 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:08.200
 it costs but to take it from here and there 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.479
 once we can be saved the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.239
 Cndh also inaugurated the cable can be 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.370
 remove and put when we want is ideal 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.350
 for all those for example that 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.390
 have a computer workshop and 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.310
 want for example to have an adapter 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.310
 easy and simple at the time of 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.720
 this has been the whole presentation of the 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:34.620
 c-60 3.3 for 2.5 inch discs 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:36.630
 take out with usb 3.0 output I hope that you 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.610
 I liked it, I'm Alejandro Serrano from 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.610
 computing will be the most thank you
