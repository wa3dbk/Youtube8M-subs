fifth grade I moved schools for middle
school<00:01:32.610> sixth<00:01:32.880> grade<00:01:33.030> was<00:01:33.180> specifically<00:01:33.780> a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
school sixth grade was specifically a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.899 
school sixth grade was specifically a
terrible<00:01:34.530> year<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:34.799> me<00:01:35.100> not<00:01:35.310> only<00:01:35.579> did<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.729> lose

terrible year for me not only did I lose
all<00:01:36.090> my<00:01:36.119> friends<00:01:36.210> because<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.810> was<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.020> your

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
all my friends because it was in your

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.780 
all my friends because it was in your
school<00:01:37.500> but<00:01:37.860> because<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.310> was<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> charter

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
school but because it was a charter

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.850 
school but because it was a charter
school<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.150> all<00:01:39.299> had<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.479> take<00:01:39.630> tests<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.290> see

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
school we all had to take tests to see

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.649 
school we all had to take tests to see
where<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.130> would<00:01:41.280> be<00:01:41.369> placed<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.090> guess<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.509> for

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
where we would be placed I guess and for

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.149 
where we would be placed I guess and for
some<00:01:42.810> reason<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.229> got<00:01:43.350> placed<00:01:43.649> with<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> older

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
some reason I got placed with the older

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.920 
some reason I got placed with the older
kids<00:01:44.399> at<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.090> time<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> thought<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.659> was<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
kids at the time I thought this was a

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.210 
kids at the time I thought this was a
good<00:01:46.049> thing<00:01:46.259> because<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.590> thought<00:01:46.710> older<00:01:47.040> kids

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
good thing because I thought older kids

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.530 
good thing because I thought older kids
would<00:01:47.280> think<00:01:47.460> I'm<00:01:47.549> cool<00:01:47.759> because<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.180> skipped<00:01:48.390> a

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
would think I'm cool because I skipped a

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.359 
would think I'm cool because I skipped a
grade<00:01:48.570> however<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.439> was<00:01:49.619> pretty<00:01:49.979> much<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
grade however it was pretty much the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.730 
grade however it was pretty much the
opposite<00:01:51.020> so<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.320> part<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.560> story

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
opposite so this is the part of story

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.660 
opposite so this is the part of story
that<00:01:52.799> most<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.340> don't<00:01:53.430> know<00:01:53.549> about

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
that most of you don't know about

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.219 
that most of you don't know about
because<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.210> never<00:01:54.329> really<00:01:54.570> addressed<00:01:54.960> it

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
because I never really addressed it

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.020 
because I never really addressed it
publicly<00:01:55.590> but<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.310> know<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.549> lot<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.850> you

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.540 
it out and I actually found a way to end
the<00:02:38.170> bullying<00:02:38.410> on<00:02:38.530> my<00:02:38.620> own<00:02:38.739> terms<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.250> notice

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
the bullying on my own terms I notice

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.949 
the bullying on my own terms I notice
that<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.700> reason<00:02:39.970> dick<00:02:40.150> was<00:02:40.300> bullying<00:02:40.600> me<00:02:40.660> was

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
that the reason dick was bullying me was

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.479 
that the reason dick was bullying me was
to<00:02:41.050> make<00:02:41.170> people<00:02:41.410> laugh<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:41.980> figured<00:02:42.340> that

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
to make people laugh so I figured that

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.310 
to make people laugh so I figured that
if<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:42.790> could<00:02:42.940> make<00:02:43.090> them<00:02:43.300> laugh<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.810> become

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
if I could make them laugh and become

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.870 
if I could make them laugh and become
the<00:02:44.470> funny<00:02:44.680> guy<00:02:44.860> they<00:02:45.070> would<00:02:45.220> stop<00:02:45.459> treating

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
the funny guy they would stop treating

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.400 
the funny guy they would stop treating
me<00:02:46.000> like<00:02:46.120> I<00:02:46.360> was<00:02:46.510> less<00:02:46.720> than<00:02:46.900> them<00:02:47.080> and

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
me like I was less than them and

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.229 
me like I was less than them and
surprisingly<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.190> worked<00:02:48.370> every<00:02:48.670> time<00:02:49.120> they

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
surprisingly it worked every time they

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.880 
surprisingly it worked every time they
made<00:02:49.360> fun<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:49.600> me<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.780> ran<00:02:50.050> within<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.650> made

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890
