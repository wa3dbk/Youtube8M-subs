I<00:00:21.150> thought<00:00:21.420> I'd<00:00:21.720> do<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> quick<00:00:22.080> follow-up<00:00:22.830> on<00:00:23.160> my

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
I thought I'd do a quick follow-up on my

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.880 
I thought I'd do a quick follow-up on my
robotic<00:00:23.880> arm<00:00:24.119> some<00:00:25.080> maintenance<00:00:25.380> I've<00:00:25.710> been

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
robotic arm some maintenance I've been

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.820 
robotic arm some maintenance I've been
meaning<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.250> do<00:00:26.490> for<00:00:26.849> some<00:00:27.060> time<00:00:27.529> for<00:00:28.529> those<00:00:28.650> of

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
meaning to do for some time for those of

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.500 
meaning to do for some time for those of
you<00:00:28.949> who<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.220> followed<00:00:29.429> my<00:00:29.789> channel<00:00:30.300> you

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
you who have followed my channel you

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.410 
you who have followed my channel you
will<00:00:30.630> have<00:00:30.840> seen<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.009> 3d<00:00:32.730> printed<00:00:33.180> this

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
will have seen that I 3d printed this

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.930 
will have seen that I 3d printed this
robotic<00:00:33.930> arm<00:00:34.260> now<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:34.980> called<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.579> move

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
robotic arm now it's called the in move

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.270 
robotic arm now it's called the in move
you<00:00:36.270> can<00:00:36.450> print<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.809> entire<00:00:36.930> robot<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.800> think

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
you can print the entire robot I think

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.260 
you can print the entire robot I think
from<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.820> waist<00:00:39.030> up<00:00:39.420> at<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.899> point<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:41.270> what

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
from the waist up at this point and what

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.180 
from the waist up at this point and what
I<00:00:42.300> did<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.079> made<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:44.930> brain<00:00:45.930> interface<00:00:46.559> for

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
I did is I made a brain interface for

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.970 
I did is I made a brain interface for
the<00:00:47.399> Arduino<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.300> runs<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.170> I've<00:00:49.710> hooked

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the Arduino that runs it and I've hooked

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.270 
the Arduino that runs it and I've hooked
this<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.730> my<00:00:50.969> brain<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.800> affected<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.920> output

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
this to my brain and affected the output

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.930 
this to my brain and affected the output
of<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.550> arm<00:00:54.949> I'll<00:00:55.949> post<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.309> link<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.820> video

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
of the arm I'll post a link to the video

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.500 
of the arm I'll post a link to the video
here<00:00:58.609> what<00:00:59.609> I've<00:00:59.730> been<00:00:59.850> meaning<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.210> do<00:01:00.480> for

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
here what I've been meaning to do for

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.049 
here what I've been meaning to do for
some<00:01:01.020> time<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:02.129> get<00:01:02.489> around<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
some time is get around to the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.200 
some time is get around to the
maintenance<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:04.080> thing<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:05.339> has<00:01:05.610> worked

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
maintenance on this thing it has worked

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.859 
maintenance on this thing it has worked
good<00:01:06.570> but<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.740> never<00:01:08.159> finished<00:01:08.549> off<00:01:08.970> adjusting

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
good but I never finished off adjusting

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.250 
good but I never finished off adjusting
the<00:01:10.200> ligaments<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.979> operate<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.000> fYI<00:01:12.659> it

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the ligaments that operate it and fYI it

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.580 
the ligaments that operate it and fYI it
is<00:01:13.500> assembled<00:01:14.159> wrong<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.909> wrist<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.930> dogleg

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
is assembled wrong this wrist is dogleg

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.950 
is assembled wrong this wrist is dogleg
to<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.950> wrong<00:01:17.159> way<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.939> can't<00:01:18.299> change<00:01:18.689> it

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
to the wrong way and I can't change it

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.520 
to the wrong way and I can't change it
without<00:01:19.170> partnering<00:01:19.920> up<00:01:20.040> all<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.549> ligaments

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
without partnering up all the ligaments

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.969 
without partnering up all the ligaments
so<00:01:22.530> if<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.009> don't<00:01:23.640> build<00:01:23.759> yours<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.240> way<00:01:24.979> but

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
so if you don't build yours this way but

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.850 
so if you don't build yours this way but
a<00:01:26.659> minor<00:01:27.659> amount<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.080> problems<00:01:28.439> for<00:01:28.680> what<00:01:28.829> I

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
a minor amount of problems for what I

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.030 
a minor amount of problems for what I
wanted<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.549> do<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:30.000> want<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.750> do<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> few

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
wanted to do I want to do a few

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.069 
wanted to do I want to do a few
different<00:01:32.100> interfaces<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.360> one<00:01:33.689> was<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
different interfaces but one was the

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.100 
different interfaces but one was the
main<00:01:34.590> one<00:01:34.799> was<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.130> brain<00:01:35.369> interface<00:01:35.780> now<00:01:36.780> I'm

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
main one was the brain interface now I'm

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.700 
main one was the brain interface now I'm
up<00:01:37.320> against<00:01:37.860> making<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.520> more<00:01:38.790> proportional

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
up against making it more proportional

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.469 
up against making it more proportional
with<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.740> brain<00:01:41.159> interface<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:42.030> saw<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
with the brain interface you saw in the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.560 
with the brain interface you saw in the
previous<00:01:42.659> videos<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.369> do<00:01:44.790> pinch<00:01:45.180> and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
previous videos that I can do pinch and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.179 
previous videos that I can do pinch and
grasp<00:01:46.640> via<00:01:47.640> my<00:01:47.820> brainwaves<00:01:48.500> but<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.950> not

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
grasp via my brainwaves but it's not

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.660 
grasp via my brainwaves but it's not
very<00:01:50.579> human-like<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.829> didn't<00:01:53.159> do<00:01:53.640> a

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
very human-like and I didn't do a

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.819 
very human-like and I didn't do a
proportional<00:01:54.390> output<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.079> servos<00:01:55.530> that

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
proportional output on the servos that

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.100 
proportional output on the servos that
drive<00:01:56.100> each<00:01:56.610> one<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.030> these<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.450> driven<00:01:57.719> by<00:01:58.079> a

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
drive each one of these is driven by a

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.399 
drive each one of these is driven by a
servo<00:01:58.680> which<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.790> located<00:02:00.329> back<00:02:00.840> here<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
servo which is located back here in the

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.289 
servo which is located back here in the
arm<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.770> won't<00:02:01.950> take<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.159> apart<00:02:02.549> but<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.149> can

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
arm I won't take it apart but you can

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.620 
arm I won't take it apart but you can
see<00:02:03.509> them<00:02:03.689> right<00:02:04.020> there<00:02:05.149> what<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.180> never<00:02:06.479> got

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
see them right there what I never got

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.869 
see them right there what I never got
around<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:07.049> doing<00:02:07.140> was<00:02:07.649> tuning<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.670> that

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
around to doing was tuning it so that

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.150 
around to doing was tuning it so that
the<00:02:09.030> servos<00:02:09.539> at<00:02:09.959> max

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
the servos at max

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.660 
the servos at max
extension<00:02:12.160> don't<00:02:12.730> actually<00:02:14.340> overextend<00:02:15.340> and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
extension don't actually overextend and

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.760 
extension don't actually overextend and
I<00:02:16.240> think<00:02:16.570> this<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.050> main<00:02:17.260> reason<00:02:17.560> why

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
I think this is the main reason why

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.220 
I think this is the main reason why
people<00:02:18.130> burn<00:02:18.460> out<00:02:18.490> these<00:02:18.880> cheap<00:02:19.270> servos<00:02:19.930> is

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
people burn out these cheap servos is

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.700 
people burn out these cheap servos is
that<00:02:20.440> they<00:02:20.590> don't<00:02:20.890> actually<00:02:21.190> tune<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:22.000> so<00:02:22.030> that

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
that they don't actually tune it so that

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.310 
that they don't actually tune it so that
the<00:02:23.710> extension<00:02:23.980> is<00:02:24.460> correct<00:02:24.970> for<00:02:25.510> their<00:02:25.750> setup

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
the extension is correct for their setup

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.500 
the extension is correct for their setup
because<00:02:26.560> depending<00:02:27.370> on<00:02:27.580> your<00:02:27.760> ligament<00:02:28.240> set

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
because depending on your ligament set

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.570 
because depending on your ligament set
up<00:02:28.690> whether<00:02:29.410> you<00:02:29.530> built<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.980> wrist<00:02:30.190> wrong

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
up whether you built the wrist wrong

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.350 
up whether you built the wrist wrong
like<00:02:30.850> me

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
like me

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.990 
like me
depending<00:02:32.260> on<00:02:32.410> your<00:02:32.920> limiting<00:02:33.550> of<00:02:33.790> the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
depending on your limiting of the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.380 
depending on your limiting of the
fingers<00:02:34.530> would<00:02:35.530> set<00:02:35.890> how<00:02:36.220> far<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:37.030> need<00:02:37.060> the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
fingers would set how far you need the

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.500 
fingers would set how far you need the
servo<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.810> travel<00:02:38.730> every<00:02:39.730> one<00:02:39.910> set<00:02:40.150> up<00:02:40.270> is

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
servo to travel every one set up is

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.030 
servo to travel every one set up is
going<00:02:40.600> to<00:02:40.930> be<00:02:41.050> different<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:41.740> takes<00:02:41.920> a

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
going to be different and it takes a

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.460 
going to be different and it takes a
little<00:02:42.310> bit<00:02:42.580> of<00:02:42.760> tuning<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:43.480> today<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:44.050> will

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
little bit of tuning so today I will

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.080 
little bit of tuning so today I will
show<00:02:44.710> you<00:02:44.770> this<00:02:45.070> I'll<00:02:45.400> show<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:45.640> what<00:02:45.910> it

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
show you this I'll show you what it

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.380 
show you this I'll show you what it
functions<00:02:46.540> like<00:02:46.600> right<00:02:46.990> now<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.910> this<00:02:49.090> is<00:02:49.240> what

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
functions like right now so this is what

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.840 
functions like right now so this is what
the<00:02:49.570> in<00:02:49.660> move<00:02:49.870> fired<00:02:50.260> up<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.770> running<00:02:51.430> through

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
the in move fired up and running through

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.360 
the in move fired up and running through
some<00:02:52.510> rotations<00:02:53.200> different<00:02:54.010> finger

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
some rotations different finger

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.140 
some rotations different finger
movements<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:56.220> I'd<00:02:57.220> only<00:02:57.400> begin<00:02:57.730> here<00:02:57.940> in<00:02:58.060> the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
movements and I'd only begin here in the

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.880 
movements and I'd only begin here in the
background<00:02:58.780> but<00:02:59.020> there's<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.260> little<00:02:59.560> bit<00:02:59.860> of

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
background but there's a little bit of

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.350 
background but there's a little bit of
circle<00:03:00.370> growl<00:03:00.840> at<00:03:01.840> extension<00:03:02.500> but<00:03:03.490> not<00:03:03.940> much

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
circle growl at extension but not much

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.200 
circle growl at extension but not much
and<00:03:04.840> this<00:03:05.650> is<00:03:05.710> the<00:03:06.040> key<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:06.460> I<00:03:06.640> was<00:03:06.790> trying<00:03:07.150> to

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
and this is the key that I was trying to

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.950 
and this is the key that I was trying to
get<00:03:07.390> rid<00:03:07.540> of<00:03:08.100> none<00:03:09.100> there<00:03:09.520> on<00:03:09.970> those<00:03:10.660> two

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
get rid of none there on those two

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.070 
get rid of none there on those two
fenders<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.740> a<00:03:12.250> little<00:03:12.670> bit<00:03:12.820> right<00:03:13.060> now<00:03:13.120> it's

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
fenders and a little bit right now it's

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.520 
fenders and a little bit right now it's
coming<00:03:14.410> from<00:03:14.709> this<00:03:16.080> this<00:03:17.080> middle<00:03:17.500> finger

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
coming from this this middle finger

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.490 
coming from this this middle finger
mainly<00:03:18.370> which<00:03:19.150> I<00:03:19.300> have<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.570> problem<00:03:19.930> with<00:03:20.290> it

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
mainly which I have a problem with it

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.150 
mainly which I have a problem with it
binding<00:03:21.010> which<00:03:21.220> is<00:03:21.400> probably<00:03:21.850> mainly<00:03:22.330> due<00:03:22.600> to

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
binding which is probably mainly due to

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.000 
binding which is probably mainly due to
the<00:03:24.160> wrist<00:03:24.459> that<00:03:24.640> I<00:03:24.820> messed<00:03:25.240> up<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:26.470> little

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
the wrist that I messed up and a little

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.620 
the wrist that I messed up and a little
bit<00:03:27.130> of<00:03:27.370> mess<00:03:27.940> up<00:03:28.150> down<00:03:29.190> but<00:03:30.190> let's<00:03:30.760> let's<00:03:31.450> take

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
bit of mess up down but let's let's take

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.449 
bit of mess up down but let's let's take
a<00:03:31.690> moment<00:03:32.050> I'll<00:03:32.140> show<00:03:32.170> you<00:03:32.470> how<00:03:32.740> we<00:03:32.800> can<00:03:33.070> fix

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
a moment I'll show you how we can fix

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.050 
a moment I'll show you how we can fix
this<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:35.290> what<00:03:35.440> I<00:03:35.470> did<00:03:35.740> is<00:03:35.920> quickly<00:03:36.220> I<00:03:36.400> modified

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
this so what I did is quickly I modified

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.150 
this so what I did is quickly I modified
the<00:03:37.330> code<00:03:37.360> just<00:03:38.200> to<00:03:38.640> move<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:41.680> middle

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
the code just to move the the middle

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.110 
the code just to move the the middle
finger<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:43.510> you<00:03:43.690> can<00:03:43.840> hear<00:03:44.610> we<00:03:45.610> go<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:45.880> full

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
finger and you can hear we go to full

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.449 
finger and you can hear we go to full
extension<00:03:46.540> which<00:03:47.110> this<00:03:47.650> one<00:03:47.890> has<00:03:47.920> a<00:03:48.100> bit<00:03:48.310> of<00:03:48.400> a

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
extension which this one has a bit of a

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.420 
extension which this one has a bit of a
problem<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:49.300> why<00:03:49.720> we<00:03:49.959> need<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.290> tune<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:50.830> is<00:03:51.040> I

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
problem and why we need to tune it is I

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.300 
problem and why we need to tune it is I
can't<00:03:51.820> get<00:03:51.940> full<00:03:52.209> extension<00:03:52.360> on<00:03:52.959> this<00:03:53.260> I<00:03:53.530> have

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
can't get full extension on this I have

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.170 
can't get full extension on this I have
some<00:03:54.700> binding<00:03:55.209> going<00:03:55.540> on<00:03:56.550> we<00:03:57.550> don't<00:03:57.730> hear<00:03:57.940> any

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
some binding going on we don't hear any

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.380 
some binding going on we don't hear any
Cyril<00:03:58.959> home<00:03:59.350> when<00:03:59.860> we<00:04:00.040> get<00:04:00.220> to<00:04:00.400> max<00:04:00.670> meaning

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
Cyril home when we get to max meaning

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.610 
Cyril home when we get to max meaning
we're<00:04:01.870> not<00:04:01.900> cooking<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.739> servo<00:04:03.300> so<00:04:04.300> if<00:04:04.690> I<00:04:04.989> go

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
we're not cooking the servo so if I go

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.640 
we're not cooking the servo so if I go
ahead<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:06.130> change<00:04:06.610> this<00:04:06.940> code<00:04:07.390> back<00:04:08.140> to<00:04:08.200> what

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
ahead and change this code back to what

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
ahead and change this code back to what
I<00:04:08.680> had<00:04:09.070> it<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.610> Max<00:04:09.940> extension<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:10.959> hit<00:04:11.110> upload

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
I had it to Max extension and hit upload

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.910 
I had it to Max extension and hit upload
I'm<00:04:12.670> willing<00:04:13.030> to<00:04:13.060> bet<00:04:13.380> that<00:04:14.380> we're<00:04:14.590> going<00:04:14.830> to

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
I'm willing to bet that we're going to

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.270 
I'm willing to bet that we're going to
hear<00:04:15.630> what<00:04:16.630> we<00:04:16.810> don't<00:04:17.020> want<00:04:17.410> to<00:04:17.620> hear<00:04:17.919> when

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
hear what we don't want to hear when

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.840 
hear what we don't want to hear when
we're<00:04:18.489> tuning<00:04:18.789> servos<00:04:19.239> for<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:19.660> in<00:04:19.780> move

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.730 

it's<00:04:25.850> faint<00:04:26.270> but<00:04:26.600> you'll<00:04:26.960> be<00:04:27.139> able<00:04:27.229> to<00:04:27.470> hear<00:04:27.710> it

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
it's faint but you'll be able to hear it

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.159 
it's faint but you'll be able to hear it
growling<00:04:29.680> at<00:04:30.680> full<00:04:31.039> extension<00:04:31.190> and<00:04:32.169> that's

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
growling at full extension and that's

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.570 
growling at full extension and that's
what<00:04:33.410> we<00:04:33.560> don't<00:04:33.949> want<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.550> hear<00:04:36.099> so<00:04:37.099> we<00:04:37.340> can<00:04:37.490> do

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
what we don't want to hear so we can do

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.370 
what we don't want to hear so we can do
the<00:04:37.759> same<00:04:37.940> with<00:04:38.150> another<00:04:38.210> finger<00:04:38.780> here<00:04:39.259> and

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
the same with another finger here and

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.110 
the same with another finger here and
give<00:04:40.370> it<00:04:40.490> a<00:04:40.520> try

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
give it a try

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.150 
give it a try
and<00:04:41.210> that<00:04:41.509> was<00:04:41.750> moving<00:04:41.990> it<00:04:42.229> down<00:04:42.380> 10<00:04:42.740> steps

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
and that was moving it down 10 steps

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.379 
and that was moving it down 10 steps
from<00:04:43.580> a<00:04:43.759> full<00:04:44.060> sweep<00:04:44.330> of<00:04:44.509> 90<00:04:45.250> down<00:04:46.250> to<00:04:46.550> 80<00:04:46.789> to

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
from a full sweep of 90 down to 80 to

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.839 
from a full sweep of 90 down to 80 to
make<00:04:47.569> it<00:04:47.720> good<00:04:47.990> and<00:04:48.259> that's<00:04:48.710> back<00:04:49.039> to<00:04:49.069> 90<00:04:49.759> again

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
make it good and that's back to 90 again

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.189 
make it good and that's back to 90 again
so<00:04:52.849> that's<00:04:53.030> it<00:04:53.330> guys

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
so that's it guys

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.860 
so that's it guys
so<00:04:54.530> at<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.550> end<00:04:55.669> of<00:04:55.789> the<00:04:55.910> day<00:04:56.090> what<00:04:56.389> you<00:04:56.539> want

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
so at the end of the day what you want

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.969 
so at the end of the day what you want
is<00:04:57.229> to<00:04:57.830> adjust<00:04:58.009> the<00:04:58.430> max<00:04:58.759> travels<00:04:59.620> so<00:05:00.620> you<00:05:00.680> hear

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
is to adjust the max travels so you hear

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:02.040 
is to adjust the max travels so you hear
nothing

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
nothing

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.180 
nothing
max<00:05:03.050> extension<00:05:04.060> max<00:05:05.060> contraction<00:05:05.870> we<00:05:06.860> don't

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
max extension max contraction we don't

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.050 
max extension max contraction we don't
want<00:05:07.430> to<00:05:07.550> hear<00:05:07.729> the<00:05:07.880> servos<00:05:08.360> growl<00:05:10.060> that's

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
want to hear the servos growl that's

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.580 
want to hear the servos growl that's
pretty<00:05:11.449> much<00:05:11.630> it

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
pretty much it

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.740 
pretty much it
I<00:05:12.620> think<00:05:13.430> that'll<00:05:13.699> save<00:05:13.940> some<00:05:14.180> people<00:05:14.509> some

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
I think that'll save some people some

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.779 
I think that'll save some people some
servos<00:05:15.229> especially<00:05:15.889> if<00:05:16.039> you're<00:05:16.220> using<00:05:16.460> the

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
servos especially if you're using the

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.170 
servos especially if you're using the

get an idea of what this is going to be
so<00:05:55.159> I<00:05:55.490> am<00:05:55.849> starting<00:05:56.270> the<00:05:56.659> in<00:05:56.840> move<00:05:57.110> head

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:57.409 
so I am starting the in move head

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:00.760 
so I am starting the in move head
project<00:05:58.190> the<00:05:58.520> entire<00:05:58.909> skull<00:05:59.539> eyes<00:05:59.900> neck

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
project the entire skull eyes neck

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.240 
project the entire skull eyes neck
assembly<00:06:01.699> I<00:06:02.270> won't<00:06:02.900> be<00:06:03.080> building<00:06:03.469> I<00:06:03.680> don't

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
assembly I won't be building I don't

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.740 
assembly I won't be building I don't
think<00:06:04.520> I'm<00:06:04.639> going<00:06:04.820> to<00:06:05.000> be<00:06:05.120> building<00:06:05.300> the<00:06:05.599> whole

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
think I'm going to be building the whole

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.709 
think I'm going to be building the whole
in<00:06:05.990> move<00:06:06.199> robot<00:06:06.740> but<00:06:07.580> I<00:06:07.820> think<00:06:08.150> this<00:06:08.419> would<00:06:08.690> be

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:08.719 
in move robot but I think this would be

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:11.709 
in move robot but I think this would be
another<00:06:09.259> fun<00:06:09.620> project<00:06:10.009> for<00:06:10.580> interfacing<00:06:11.479> once

00:06:11.709 --> 00:06:11.719 
another fun project for interfacing once

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:16.180 
another fun project for interfacing once

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
I finish up with the the arm and take it

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.120 
I finish up with the the arm and take it
as<00:06:16.310> far<00:06:16.490> as<00:06:16.550> I'm<00:06:16.789> going<00:06:17.000> to<00:06:17.090> go<00:06:17.620> more<00:06:18.620> videos<00:06:18.919> on

tuning<00:06:46.430> their<00:06:46.610> servos<00:06:47.030> for<00:06:47.090> a<00:06:47.360> robotic<00:06:47.900> arm

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
tuning their servos for a robotic arm

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.240 
tuning their servos for a robotic arm
out<00:06:48.319> there<00:06:49.150> what<00:06:50.150> I<00:06:50.180> just<00:06:50.539> discovered<00:06:51.050> and<00:06:51.590> it

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
out there what I just discovered and it

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.600 
out there what I just discovered and it
seems<00:06:52.759> so<00:06:52.970> intuitive<00:06:53.630> when<00:06:54.590> I'm<00:06:55.160> using<00:06:55.400> a

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:55.610 
seems so intuitive when I'm using a

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.559 
seems so intuitive when I'm using a
variable-speed

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:56.569 
variable-speed

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:01.210 
variable-speed
servo<00:06:57.289> library<00:06:58.780> you<00:06:59.780> want<00:07:00.080> to<00:07:00.259> slow<00:07:00.590> the<00:07:00.919> thumb

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.220 
servo library you want to slow the thumb

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.540 
servo library you want to slow the thumb
down<00:07:01.819> you<00:07:02.569> you<00:07:03.169> want<00:07:03.410> this<00:07:03.740> guy<00:07:04.009> to<00:07:04.039> be<00:07:04.280> the

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:04.550 
down you you want this guy to be the

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.080 
down you you want this guy to be the
last<00:07:04.880> guy<00:07:05.060> at<00:07:05.330> the<00:07:05.479> party<00:07:05.720> and<00:07:06.050> any<00:07:06.289> movement

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.090 
last guy at the party and any movement

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.879 
last guy at the party and any movement
except<00:07:08.090> for<00:07:08.389> retract<00:07:08.960> and<00:07:09.349> he<00:07:09.440> has<00:07:09.560> to<00:07:09.680> be<00:07:09.710> the

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:09.889 
except for retract and he has to be the

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:12.129 
except for retract and he has to be the
first<00:07:10.099> guy<00:07:10.280> to<00:07:10.340> leave<00:07:10.639> the<00:07:10.819> parity<00:07:11.240> okay<00:07:11.960> they

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:12.139 
first guy to leave the parity okay they

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:15.730 
first guy to leave the parity okay they
drank<00:07:12.349> the<00:07:12.500> tequila<00:07:13.630> so<00:07:14.630> if<00:07:14.960> you<00:07:15.110> want<00:07:15.289> a<00:07:15.380> pinch

drank the tequila so if you want a pinch

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.480 
drank the tequila so if you want a pinch
you<00:07:16.220> want<00:07:16.460> the<00:07:16.639> thumb<00:07:16.880> to<00:07:17.030> come<00:07:17.270> over<00:07:17.630> it<00:07:17.810> and

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490 
you want the thumb to come over it and

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.790 
you want the thumb to come over it and
not<00:07:19.490> under<00:07:20.180> it<00:07:20.330> and<00:07:20.569> that<00:07:21.139> way<00:07:21.319> you<00:07:21.380> want<00:07:21.680> to

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:21.800 
not under it and that way you want to

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.620 
not under it and that way you want to
end<00:07:21.919> up<00:07:22.009> conflicting<00:07:22.699> with<00:07:22.849> the<00:07:22.880> fingers<00:07:23.389> on

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:23.630 
end up conflicting with the fingers on

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.920 
end up conflicting with the fingers on
this<00:07:23.780> and<00:07:24.050> move<00:07:24.229> arm<00:07:25.150> just<00:07:26.150> silly<00:07:26.419> little<00:07:26.750> note

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:26.930 
this and move arm just silly little note

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:30.159 
this and move arm just silly little note
I<00:07:27.199> hope<00:07:27.409> this<00:07:27.650> helps<00:07:28.039> someone<00:07:28.720> slow<00:07:29.720> that<00:07:29.930> guy

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:30.169 
I hope this helps someone slow that guy

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:33.339 
I hope this helps someone slow that guy
down<00:07:30.500> a<00:07:30.530> little<00:07:30.949> bit<00:07:31.250> on<00:07:31.520> any<00:07:31.759> of<00:07:31.970> the<00:07:32.270> any<00:07:33.199> of

00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:33.349 
down a little bit on any of the any of

00:07:33.349 --> 00:07:35.850 
down a little bit on any of the any of
the<00:07:33.590> retractions<00:07:34.430> and<00:07:34.849> leave<00:07:35.300> him<00:07:35.509> full

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.860 
the retractions and leave him full

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.300 
the retractions and leave him full
acceleration<00:07:36.860> on<00:07:37.159> the<00:07:38.229> open<00:07:39.229> hand<00:07:39.469> motion<00:07:40.039> and

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:40.310 
acceleration on the open hand motion and

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.640 
acceleration on the open hand motion and
you'll<00:07:40.520> get<00:07:40.729> something<00:07:41.030> like<00:07:41.389> this<00:07:41.659> something

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:42.650 
you'll get something like this something

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.909 
you'll get something like this something
a<00:07:42.889> lot<00:07:43.159> more<00:07:43.460> reasonable<00:07:44.199> pretty<00:07:45.199> happy<00:07:45.740> with

00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:45.919 
a lot more reasonable pretty happy with

00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:48.189 
a lot more reasonable pretty happy with
this<00:07:46.219> super<00:07:47.180> happy<00:07:47.570> with<00:07:47.719> the<00:07:47.870> way<00:07:47.960> it's

00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:48.199 
this super happy with the way it's

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:51.969 
this super happy with the way it's
turned<00:07:48.560> out<00:07:48.800> and<00:07:49.810> yeah<00:07:50.810> this<00:07:51.530> video<00:07:51.860> was

00:07:51.969 --> 00:07:51.979 
turned out and yeah this video was

00:07:51.979 --> 00:07:54.790 
turned out and yeah this video was
getting<00:07:52.729> really<00:07:53.030> random<00:07:53.360> now<00:07:53.690> so<00:07:54.020> I'll<00:07:54.380> cut<00:07:54.710> it

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 
getting really random now so I'll cut it

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.040 
getting really random now so I'll cut it
off<00:07:54.949> here<00:07:55.190> thanks<00:07:55.699> guys<00:07:55.880> really<00:07:56.509> appreciate

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.050 
off here thanks guys really appreciate

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:09.930 
off here thanks guys really appreciate
