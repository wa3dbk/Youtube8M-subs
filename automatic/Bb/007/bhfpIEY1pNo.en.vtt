system<00:00:44.900> I'm<00:00:45.900> seeing<00:00:46.260> something<00:00:46.620> really

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
system I'm seeing something really

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.500 
system I'm seeing something really
interesting<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.370> my<00:00:47.520> practice<00:00:47.970> and<00:00:48.150> I<00:00:48.300> would

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
interesting in my practice and I would

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.140 
interesting in my practice and I would
say<00:00:48.720> in<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> last<00:00:49.379> year<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:51.000> really

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
say in the last year it's really

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.960 
say in the last year it's really
increased<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.960> lot<00:00:52.140> as<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.100> know<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.520> muscle

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
increased a lot as you know I do muscle

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.200 
increased a lot as you know I do muscle
testing<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.560> lot<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.739> hair<00:00:56.010> analysis<00:00:56.550> I'm

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
testing and a lot of hair analysis I'm

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.450 
testing and a lot of hair analysis I'm
seeing<00:00:57.660> more<00:00:57.989> than<00:00:58.170> ever<00:00:58.350> people<00:00:58.739> coming<00:00:59.280> in

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
seeing more than ever people coming in

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.450 
seeing more than ever people coming in
with<00:01:00.149> very<00:01:00.810> high<00:01:01.110> levels<00:01:01.560> of<00:01:01.710> mercury<00:01:01.920> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
with very high levels of mercury and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.030 
with very high levels of mercury and
arsenic<00:01:03.210> especially<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.259> their<00:01:04.589> hair<00:01:04.830> and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
arsenic especially in their hair and

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.060 
arsenic especially in their hair and
muscle<00:01:05.850> testing<00:01:06.270> consistently<00:01:07.080> people<00:01:07.830> that

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
muscle testing consistently people that

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.910 
muscle testing consistently people that
have<00:01:08.250> chemical<00:01:08.880> toxicity<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.200> especially

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
have chemical toxicity and especially

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.999 
have chemical toxicity and especially
having<00:01:11.130> heavy<00:01:11.520> metal<00:01:11.850> toxicity<00:01:12.509> and<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.860> is

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
having heavy metal toxicity and this is

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.100 
having heavy metal toxicity and this is
becoming<00:01:14.340> more<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.700> more<00:01:14.820> prominent<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.990> a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
becoming more and more prominent it's a

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.609 
becoming more and more prominent it's a
real<00:01:16.350> problem<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.390> heavy<00:01:18.390> metals<00:01:18.840> basically

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
real problem and heavy metals basically

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.820 
real problem and heavy metals basically
bind<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.790> receptor<00:01:21.300> sites<00:01:21.539> on<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.560> cell

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
bind to the receptor sites on the cell

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.550 
bind to the receptor sites on the cell
which<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:23.850> interfere<00:01:24.600> with<00:01:25.080> cellular

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
which then interfere with cellular

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.070 
which then interfere with cellular
metabolism<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.490> function<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.209> transmission

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
metabolism and function and transmission

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.469 
metabolism and function and transmission
and<00:01:28.289> that<00:01:28.410> may<00:01:28.590> sound<00:01:29.369> complicated<00:01:29.759> but

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
and that may sound complicated but

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.139 
and that may sound complicated but
basically<00:01:30.539> it<00:01:31.410> blocks<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.640> body's<00:01:33.000> ability

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
basically it blocks the body's ability

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.600 
basically it blocks the body's ability
to<00:01:33.539> function<00:01:33.929> properly<00:01:34.289> and<00:01:34.830> when<00:01:35.490> you're

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
to function properly and when you're

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.309 
to function properly and when you're
dealing<00:01:35.759> with<00:01:35.970> nerve<00:01:36.360> tissue<00:01:36.690> in<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.080> brain

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
dealing with nerve tissue in the brain

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.550 
dealing with nerve tissue in the brain
when<00:01:38.009> you're<00:01:38.130> dealing<00:01:38.310> with<00:01:38.840> joint<00:01:39.840> issues

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
when you're dealing with joint issues

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.139 
when you're dealing with joint issues
when<00:01:40.800> you're<00:01:40.890> dealing<00:01:41.100> with<00:01:41.280> intestinal

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
when you're dealing with intestinal

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.960 
when you're dealing with intestinal
issues<00:01:42.810> heavy<00:01:43.619> metals<00:01:44.039> really<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.819> wreak

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
issues heavy metals really can wreak

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.380 
issues heavy metals really can wreak
havoc<00:01:45.319> so<00:01:46.319> the<00:01:46.920> most<00:01:47.130> important<00:01:47.759> thing<00:01:47.819> really

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
havoc so the most important thing really

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.919 
havoc so the most important thing really
though<00:01:48.569> is<00:01:48.959> how<00:01:49.200> they<00:01:49.380> affect<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.740> brain

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
Kosovo has has figured out how to do is

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.979 
Kosovo has has figured out how to do is
take<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.349> zeolite<00:03:13.239> purify<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.299> with<00:03:14.599> all<00:03:14.810> the

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
take the zeolite purify it with all the

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.170 
take the zeolite purify it with all the
heavy<00:03:15.140> metals<00:03:15.560> break<00:03:16.489> it<00:03:16.670> down<00:03:16.819> into<00:03:17.060> very

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
heavy metals break it down into very

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.140 
heavy metals break it down into very

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
small particles not only that they bind

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.930

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
it with the water molecule they add some

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.360 
it with the water molecule they add some
water-soluble<00:03:23.569> vitamin<00:03:24.049> C<00:03:24.260> they<00:03:24.620> bind<00:03:25.040> that

to<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:26.000> zeolite<00:03:26.269> molecule<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:27.230> then<00:03:27.980> it<00:03:28.340> gets

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
to the zeolite molecule and then it gets

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.509 
to the zeolite molecule and then it gets
into<00:03:28.910> the<00:03:29.030> system<00:03:29.480> right<00:03:30.380> into<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:30.860> brain<00:03:31.160> and

into the system right into the brain and

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.780 
into the system right into the brain and
they<00:03:32.480> have<00:03:32.630> proven<00:03:32.900> that<00:03:33.350> it<00:03:33.590> pulls<00:03:33.920> heavy

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
they have proven that it pulls heavy

googling looking up some things I'll be
sending<00:04:32.570> some<00:04:32.750> things<00:04:32.960> out<00:04:33.110> about<00:04:33.260> the

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
sending some things out about the

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.800 
sending some things out about the
toxicity<00:04:34.010> of<00:04:34.220> lead<00:04:34.550> and<00:04:34.789> mercury<00:04:35.240> and<00:04:35.389> arsenic

heavy metals so stay tuned to that and
next<00:04:39.050> week<00:04:39.200> we're<00:04:39.410> going<00:04:39.500> to<00:04:39.560> talk<00:04:39.800> about<00:04:40.040> how

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
next week we're going to talk about how

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.870 
next week we're going to talk about how
