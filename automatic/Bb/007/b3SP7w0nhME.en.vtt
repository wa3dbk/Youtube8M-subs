00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:26.460
 what can I do for you 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:29.009
 hello, of course, understands itself in any case 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.030
 I wanted my feet selling the shoes 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:36.420
 and etc or yes and i wanted mine 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.339
 mother i now become a 50 and 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.230
 I am her son now and I wanted 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:43.829
 always buy the shoes but we can 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.360
 actually recommend or so comes 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.329
 what her mother is for a guy 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.860
 he is a sporty guy he like that 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:01:02.239
 comfortable to know with mufflers 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:02.239
 what's alright you know what i mean 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.250
 already here they are not crazy 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:19.070
 Our souls can be more comfortable and more comfortable 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.070
 I recommend about 80 euro 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:26.300
 So I do not have a tonto or so 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.039
 best 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.259
 mirko heid so echoes through the comfortable 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.259
 shoes for the household maybe that way 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.500
 So look just check out shoe 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.890
 that makes the first variant or at 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.929
 go around at half past then set there 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.479
 missing there and then look up 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.369
 So you can choose the amount 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.979
 that you simply times the amount of 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.890
 choose to save and car 90 euros 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.399
 Just put a limit on them 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.599
 then displayed 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.750
 but rarely several workers 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:05.330
 lace up athletic cords and up 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.009
 that cost about the euro 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:12.660
 For example, I have tomatoes here 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.540
 for 49 95 there is also a skinny one 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.010
 is called c4 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.910
 that's a big deal, but me 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.849
 believe the unknown the world has 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.640
 I also delivered by you yes sc 4 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:30.200
 Do you know that 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:45.970
 no, woman wants to be directed and 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:52.850
 maybe kemper durable is toxic yes 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:56.300
 where is the company if so frank can 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.620
 we can also tell her I am 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.620
 founded spain 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.510
 have experienced now 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:22.450
 In doing so, you can write down the assassins 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:24.709
 dtmt so no matter 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.690
 shoes can have from Kemper always 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.500
 look how much euro the costs 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:35.480
 school winner main by the csu camper 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:39.170
 is also so priced 49 95 69 95 so then 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.630
 in the lower category and pk of course 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.269
 to Opole and it costs the 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.239
 Sent so shipment is with us 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:52.489
 So somehow generally free of is 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:55.340
 go for free and come back 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.060
 still in the box out of such shoes 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.850
 has with it 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:03.620
 There are several extras on offer and 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.900
 then these shoes are not there you have that 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.660
 pity then I would take you where and so 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.660
 What is then with red dot sight 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.829
 the two of them have me in armor 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.479
 everything is clear 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.400
 I want to see you next time 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.750
 So I would not have to order 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.300
 but in any case, thanks for the 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.710
 Information I will definitely 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.830
 maybe what can order yes 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.350
 maybe you have some e-mail 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.760
 address or so where I then just still 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.060
 can write but no rating 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.280
 or something 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.050
 So the rating mail is then always 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.419
 afterwards the order name to 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.340
 get the sent llorenti 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.950
 our order sent to come 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.810
 have a few days later, which is then 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.639
 and then they can send the 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:55.810
 assess overall service 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:05:02.130
 ohso one more question how are these 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:05.500
 shoes can therefore say once a 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.600
 few shoes so there I have now 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:14.290
 different here so that is once 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:22.710
 for example, persil pilot has here eg 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:22.710
 while the price still costs 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.900
 okay, all right 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:38.220
