so<00:03:29.170> that's<00:03:29.680> basically<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.130> thing<00:03:30.340> is<00:03:30.520> I'll

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
so that's basically the thing is I'll

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.070 
so that's basically the thing is I'll
just<00:03:30.820> have<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.000> camera<00:03:31.300> focus<00:03:31.660> it<00:03:31.780> on<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:31.870> box

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
just have the camera focus it on the box

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.450 
just have the camera focus it on the box
you<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.290> nice<00:03:32.410> clean<00:03:32.740> shot<00:03:33.040> of<00:03:33.130> that<00:03:33.160> so<00:03:33.370> you

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
you a nice clean shot of that so you

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.850 
you a nice clean shot of that so you

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.560 
tray things you pop these things off and
as<00:05:24.610> you<00:05:24.760> can<00:05:24.880> see<00:05:24.940> the<00:05:25.120> motherboard<00:05:25.450> tray

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
as you can see the motherboard tray

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.760 
as you can see the motherboard tray
comes<00:05:25.870> up<00:05:26.050> I'm<00:05:26.230> not<00:05:26.320> gonna<00:05:26.410> go<00:05:26.560> ahead<00:05:26.620> and

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
comes up I'm not gonna go ahead and

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.990 
comes up I'm not gonna go ahead and
totally<00:05:27.070> remove<00:05:27.310> it<00:05:27.430> it's<00:05:27.550> really<00:05:27.700> no<00:05:27.850> big

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
totally remove it it's really no big

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.370 
totally remove it it's really no big
deal<00:05:28.180> but<00:05:28.330> it<00:05:28.450> does<00:05:28.630> come<00:05:28.930> on

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
deal but it does come on

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.830 
deal but it does come on
also<00:05:30.160> these<00:05:30.730> screws<00:05:31.060> right<00:05:31.300> here<00:05:31.330> on<00:05:31.540> the<00:05:31.630> side

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
also these screws right here on the side

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.900 
also these screws right here on the side
you<00:05:32.620> can<00:05:32.740> see<00:05:32.950> these<00:05:33.160> that<00:05:33.550> makes<00:05:33.760> this

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
you can see these that makes this

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.370 
you can see these that makes this
removable<00:05:34.390> as<00:05:34.480> well<00:05:34.660> so<00:05:34.810> you<00:05:34.900> can<00:05:35.020> take<00:05:35.230> these

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
removable as well so you can take these

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.160 
removable as well so you can take these
completely<00:05:35.890> off<00:05:36.130> if<00:05:36.310> you<00:05:36.400> want<00:05:36.640> to<00:05:36.850> and<00:05:37.170> you'd

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
completely off if you want to and you'd

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.350 
completely off if you want to and you'd
be<00:05:38.290> okay<00:05:38.320> um<00:05:38.830> also<00:05:39.490> they<00:05:39.730> say<00:05:39.880> that<00:05:40.000> you<00:05:40.090> can't

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
be okay um also they say that you can't

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.090 
be okay um also they say that you can't
use<00:05:40.420> a<00:05:40.540> really<00:05:40.810> long<00:05:40.990> motherboard<00:05:41.530> I<00:05:41.740> don't

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
use a really long motherboard I don't

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.830 
use a really long motherboard I don't
know<00:05:42.190> with<00:05:42.340> these<00:05:42.490> off<00:05:42.820> and<00:05:43.150> some

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
know with these off and some

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.300 
know with these off and some
modification<00:05:44.440> this<00:05:44.560> I<00:05:44.680> think<00:05:44.890> you<00:05:44.980> probably

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
modification this I think you probably

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.950 
modification this I think you probably
use<00:05:45.550> any<00:05:45.730> motherboards<00:05:46.180> you<00:05:46.270> want<00:05:46.510> the

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
use any motherboards you want the

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.420 
use any motherboards you want the
further<00:05:47.200> testing<00:05:47.620> I<00:05:47.680> do<00:05:47.740> I<00:05:47.860> guess<00:05:48.070> we'll<00:05:48.220> see

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
further testing I do I guess we'll see

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.670 
further testing I do I guess we'll see
that<00:05:48.580> flipper<00:05:49.510> on<00:05:49.570> the<00:05:49.690> back<00:05:49.840> real<00:05:50.050> quick<00:05:50.290> and

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 
I said before this n1x frame is coming

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.130 
I said before this n1x frame is coming
in<00:06:23.770> at<00:06:23.950> four<00:06:24.340> hundred<00:06:25.000> dollars<00:06:25.450> they're<00:06:25.930> not

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.140 
in at four hundred dollars they're not

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.780 
in at four hundred dollars they're not
giving<00:06:26.380> these<00:06:26.440> away<00:06:26.620> as<00:06:26.740> test<00:06:27.100> samples<00:06:27.580> I

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:27.790 
giving these away as test samples I

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.460 
giving these away as test samples I
actually<00:06:28.240> like<00:06:28.480> I<00:06:28.540> said<00:06:28.750> before<00:06:28.900> the<00:06:29.080> video<00:06:29.320> if

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:29.470 
actually like I said before the video if

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:30.540 
actually like I said before the video if
you<00:06:29.530> didn't<00:06:29.740> see<00:06:29.800> the<00:06:29.890> beginning<00:06:30.010> of<00:06:30.340> it<00:06:30.430> for

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550 
you didn't see the beginning of it for

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:31.830 
you didn't see the beginning of it for
some<00:06:30.670> reason<00:06:30.700> I<00:06:31.120> actually<00:06:31.270> would<00:06:31.540> just<00:06:31.690> got

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
some reason I actually would just got

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.030 
some reason I actually would just got
this<00:06:31.930> from<00:06:32.050> my<00:06:32.140> friend<00:06:32.170> Jerry<00:06:32.560> and<00:06:32.710> barred<00:06:32.920> it
