two stocks basically these both looked

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.180 
two stocks basically these both looked

before<00:00:11.639> refinishing<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.300> one<00:00:12.450> here<00:00:12.870> came

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
before refinishing this one here came

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.860 
before refinishing this one here came
off<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.469> Ruger<00:00:13.860> 10/22<00:00:14.240> this<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.389> what<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.660> stock

off a Ruger 10/22 this is what the stock

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.590 
off a Ruger 10/22 this is what the stock
looked<00:00:16.139> like<00:00:16.289> before<00:00:17.210> refinishing<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.480> is

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
looked like before refinishing this is

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.609 
looked like before refinishing this is
what<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.750> looked<00:00:18.869> like<00:00:18.900> right<00:00:19.109> out<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.410> box

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
what it looked like right out of the box

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.380 
what it looked like right out of the box
this<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.430> what<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.760> looked<00:00:20.910> like<00:00:21.000> after

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
this is what it looked like after

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.820 
this is what it looked like after
stripping<00:00:21.869> restaining

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
stripping restaining

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.250 
stripping restaining
and<00:00:22.949> refinishing<00:00:23.699> it's<00:00:24.300> now<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> golden<00:00:25.080> brown

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
and refinishing it's now a golden brown

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.269 
and refinishing it's now a golden brown
color<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.769> also<00:00:26.990> glossy<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.650> you<00:00:29.039> can<00:00:29.160> use

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
color and also glossy so you can use

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.529 
color and also glossy so you can use
this<00:00:29.400> process<00:00:29.849> on<00:00:29.970> guitars<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.480> other

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
all right you can see here that I

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.020 
all right you can see here that I
pressure<00:01:07.690> bedded<00:01:08.080> this<00:01:08.229> stock<00:01:08.759> basically<00:01:09.759> I

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
pressure bedded this stock basically I

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.820 
pressure bedded this stock basically I
used<00:01:10.240> some<00:01:10.360> DEF<00:01:10.570> CON<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:11.140> it's<00:01:11.560> pretty<00:01:11.740> much

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
used some DEF CON and it's pretty much

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.760 
used some DEF CON and it's pretty much
like<00:01:11.950> a<00:01:12.100> glass<00:01:12.430> bedding<00:01:12.880> but<00:01:13.090> but<00:01:14.080> it's<00:01:14.200> still

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
like a glass bedding but but it's still

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.399 
like a glass bedding but but it's still
based<00:01:15.070> boxy<00:01:15.790> buddy<00:01:16.030> I'm<00:01:16.720> not<00:01:16.930> really<00:01:17.049> sure<00:01:17.259> how

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
based boxy buddy I'm not really sure how

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:18.660 
based boxy buddy I'm not really sure how
the<00:01:17.470> stripper<00:01:17.770> is<00:01:17.890> going<00:01:18.009> to<00:01:18.070> react<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.430> it<00:01:18.490> so

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
the stripper is going to react to it so

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
the stripper is going to react to it so
I'm<00:01:18.729> going<00:01:18.850> to<00:01:18.880> go<00:01:18.970> ahead<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.270> tape<00:01:19.390> it<00:01:19.509> off

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
I'm going to go ahead and tape it off

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.029 
I'm going to go ahead and tape it off
just<00:01:19.899> to<00:01:20.110> hopefully<00:01:20.500> give<00:01:20.649> it<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:20.770> little<00:01:20.890> bit

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
just to hopefully give it a little bit

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.130 
just to hopefully give it a little bit
more<00:01:21.190> protection<00:01:21.789> than<00:01:21.820> what<00:01:22.600> I<00:01:22.630> might<00:01:22.899> have

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
more protection than what I might have

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:36.090 
more protection than what I might have
if<00:01:23.289> I<00:01:23.409> didn't<00:01:23.619> put<00:01:23.740> anything<00:01:23.920> on<00:01:24.159> it

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.920

and also set us up for the next process
which<00:05:31.610> is<00:05:32.000> steaming<00:05:32.870> out<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:33.380> old<00:05:34.220> stain<00:05:34.580> or

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
which is steaming out the old stain or

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.440 
which is steaming out the old stain or
the<00:05:34.850> old<00:05:34.970> finish<00:05:35.830> basically<00:05:36.830> you<00:05:36.920> just<00:05:36.950> take<00:05:37.340> a

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
the old finish basically you just take a

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.390 
the old finish basically you just take a
household<00:05:38.450> iron<00:05:38.720> using<00:05:39.470> the<00:05:39.680> steam<00:05:39.950> function

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
household iron using the steam function

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.610 
household iron using the steam function
and<00:05:40.640> a<00:05:40.910> cotton<00:05:41.330> cloth<00:05:41.420> you<00:05:42.170> just<00:05:42.350> lay<00:05:42.500> the

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
and a cotton cloth you just lay the

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.320 
and a cotton cloth you just lay the
cotton<00:05:42.950> cloth<00:05:43.100> on<00:05:43.310> top<00:05:43.520> of<00:05:43.640> the<00:05:43.700> stock<00:05:43.970> and

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
cotton cloth on top of the stock and

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.600 
cotton cloth on top of the stock and
then<00:05:44.780> you<00:05:44.870> just<00:05:45.080> rub<00:05:45.380> the<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:46.070> cloth<00:05:46.310> there

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
then you just rub the the cloth there

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.750 
then you just rub the the cloth there
and<00:05:47.140> that<00:05:48.140> steam<00:05:48.500> will<00:05:48.710> help<00:05:48.830> wick<00:05:49.130> out<00:05:49.310> some

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
and that steam will help wick out some

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.850 
and that steam will help wick out some
of<00:05:49.880> the<00:05:49.940> old<00:05:50.120> finish<00:05:50.960> that<00:05:51.140> seeped<00:05:51.410> down<00:05:51.500> into

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
of the old finish that seeped down into

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.520 
of the old finish that seeped down into
the<00:05:52.010> stock<00:05:52.669> or<00:05:52.880> the<00:05:52.940> wood<00:05:53.120> fibers<00:05:53.530> this

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
the stock or the wood fibers this

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.440 
the stock or the wood fibers this
process<00:05:54.950> also<00:05:55.130> helps<00:05:55.610> if<00:05:55.760> you<00:05:55.850> have<00:05:55.940> any<00:05:56.150> dents

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
process also helps if you have any dents

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.810 
process also helps if you have any dents
in<00:05:56.630> your<00:05:56.750> stock<00:05:57.020> and<00:05:57.830> I'll<00:05:58.010> pull<00:05:58.280> those<00:05:58.490> dents

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
in your stock and I'll pull those dents

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.510 
in your stock and I'll pull those dents
out<00:05:59.090> it<00:05:59.720> pretty<00:05:59.900> much<00:05:59.990> realigns<00:06:00.710> the<00:06:00.890> the<00:06:01.370> wood

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
out it pretty much realigns the the wood

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.490 
out it pretty much realigns the the wood
fibers<00:06:01.730> so<00:06:02.150> that<00:06:02.180> they're<00:06:02.510> in<00:06:02.600> the<00:06:02.690> correct<00:06:03.110> or

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
fibers so that they're in the correct or

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.950 
fibers so that they're in the correct or
proper<00:06:03.830> position<00:06:04.310> now<00:06:05.240> I'll<00:06:05.480> go<00:06:05.600> over<00:06:05.630> the

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
proper position now I'll go over the

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.350 
proper position now I'll go over the
same<00:06:06.140> spot<00:06:06.500> for<00:06:07.400> as<00:06:07.550> long<00:06:07.700> as<00:06:07.760> I<00:06:08.000> need<00:06:08.210> to

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
same spot for as long as I need to

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.480 
same spot for as long as I need to
