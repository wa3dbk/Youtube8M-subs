tried yesterday which makes a lot of

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.660 
tried yesterday which makes a lot of
sense<00:01:46.240> for<00:01:46.450> me<00:01:46.590> cuz<00:01:47.590> I<00:01:47.860> want<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.190> record<00:01:48.430> where

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
I'm pointing this guy I think you can

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.260 
I'm pointing this guy I think you can
hear<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:51.280> ambient<00:01:53.670> with<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.790> directional

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
hear the ambient with the directional

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.980 
hear the ambient with the directional
you<00:01:55.390> can<00:01:55.509> only<00:01:55.660> hear<00:01:55.869> me<00:01:56.080> nothing<00:01:56.710> else
