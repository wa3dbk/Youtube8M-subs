00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.880 
started in Inkscape since it's a pretty
straightforward<00:01:39.330> way<00:01:39.690> of<00:01:39.720> making<00:01:40.140> SVG<00:01:40.649> files

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
that can be opened in maker camp and if

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.960 
that can be opened in maker camp and if
I<00:01:42.810> can't<00:01:43.020> get<00:01:43.140> X<00:01:43.380> cam<00:01:43.679> to<00:01:43.860> process<00:01:44.220> STL<00:01:44.700> files

I<00:05:30.690> should<00:05:31.379> also<00:05:31.500> adjust<00:05:31.889> the<00:05:31.919> depth<00:05:32.220> of<00:05:32.370> the

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
I should also adjust the depth of the

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.129 
I should also adjust the depth of the
cut<00:05:32.610> depending<00:05:32.909> on<00:05:33.120> the<00:05:33.210> material<00:05:33.690> here<00:05:34.110> I

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 
cut depending on the material here I

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.809 
cut depending on the material here I
went<00:05:34.560> with<00:05:34.680> the<00:05:34.740> default<00:05:35.069> step<00:05:35.310> size<00:05:35.490> in<00:05:35.639> maker

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:35.819 
went with the default step size in maker

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:37.460 
went with the default step size in maker
cam<00:05:36.090> but<00:05:36.419> I<00:05:36.449> definitely<00:05:36.780> could<00:05:37.139> have<00:05:37.169> milled

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
cam but I definitely could have milled

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.740 
cam but I definitely could have milled
out<00:05:37.560> this<00:05:37.740> cardboard<00:05:38.009> in<00:05:38.250> one<00:05:38.400> pass<00:05:38.639> so<00:05:39.389> it

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
out this cardboard in one pass so it

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.510 
out this cardboard in one pass so it
only<00:05:39.930> took<00:05:40.110> me<00:05:40.169> three<00:05:40.440> weeks<00:05:40.650> but<00:05:41.039> I<00:05:41.099> now<00:05:41.280> have

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
only took me three weeks but I now have

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.460 
only took me three weeks but I now have

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.520 
workflow for future projects next week
I'm<00:05:48.509> going<00:05:48.629> to<00:05:48.690> be<00:05:48.780> doing<00:05:48.900> a<00:05:49.050> slightly<00:05:49.319> more

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
I'm going to be doing a slightly more

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.230 
I'm going to be doing a slightly more
invasive<00:05:49.770> upgrade<00:05:50.280> to<00:05:50.400> my<00:05:50.490> shave<00:05:50.699> Boko<00:05:51.030> I'm

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
invasive upgrade to my shave Boko I'm

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.640 
invasive upgrade to my shave Boko I'm
planning<00:05:51.720> on<00:05:51.780> sinking<00:05:52.139> some<00:05:52.319> threaded

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
planning on sinking some threaded

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.320 
planning on sinking some threaded
inserts<00:05:52.979> into<00:05:53.159> the<00:05:53.250> MDF<00:05:53.639> waste<00:05:53.879> board<00:05:54.060> so<00:05:54.300> I

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
inserts into the MDF waste board so I

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.670 
inserts into the MDF waste board so I
can<00:05:54.479> probably<00:05:54.629> bolt<00:05:55.020> down<00:05:55.169> work<00:05:55.409> pieces

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
can probably bolt down work pieces

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.800 
can probably bolt down work pieces
instead<00:05:56.129> of<00:05:56.219> using<00:05:56.400> tape<00:05:56.699> I'm<00:05:56.909> also<00:05:57.389> hoping<00:05:57.750> to

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
instead of using tape I'm also hoping to

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.360 
instead of using tape I'm also hoping to
test<00:05:58.110> another<00:05:58.229> method<00:05:58.680> of<00:05:58.770> G<00:05:58.979> cogeneration

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
test another method of G cogeneration

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.760 
test another method of G cogeneration
using<00:05:59.940> heat<00:06:00.090> camp<00:06:00.419> those<00:06:01.110> will<00:06:01.319> be<00:06:01.409> the<00:06:01.440> last

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
using heat camp those will be the last

using heat camp those will be the last
steps<00:06:02.009> before<00:06:02.099> I<00:06:02.370> can<00:06:02.520> start<00:06:02.729> making<00:06:03.030> real

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
steps before I can start making real

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.700
