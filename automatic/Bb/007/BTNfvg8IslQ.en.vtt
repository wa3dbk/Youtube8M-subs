00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.700
 hello to all the first screen breaks 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.110
 for Rome here we are going to do 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.710
 so in garmin connect 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.279
 we will plan a training 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:20.460
 so leave on drive create a 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.150
 new workout and there we go 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.800
 so do a workout of 2 x 8 x 36 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:36.540
 euros the 30 seconds of rest was giving 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:41.840
 the title I add a first step 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:44.899
 first step of warming up a time 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.980
 20 minutes 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.680
 I finish 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.039
 I add world to repetition table if 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.660
 I loved 10 x 8 x talk is what we 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:06.740
 is sure what a thousand times I add a 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:09.180
 interval step on a time of 38 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.140
 with the targets hear our prince 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.560
 cardiac 5 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.560
 click on the year 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:32.950
 I add another recovery step 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:42.240
 on a time of 30 seconds of play but 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:45.190
 here it's a little bit capricious 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:50.050
 so in fact you 're going to be repeating 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.700
 eight times this sequence the second to 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.800
 this frequency this frequency area 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:01.720
 cardiac and making one add another 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:07.390
 rest stage that I assure you a 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:10.200
 time of two minutes but I start again 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.200
 but fast 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.870
 mother 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.860
 my recovery 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:48.050
 I expect his finished 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:58.680
 people me all the time of rehearsal I 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.840
 add a last step that will be 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.180
 the rest step yes if you leave it 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.069
 on the key press there or so on 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.400
 a time to be able to put 15 minutes of 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.409
 term 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.609
 and do not forget to record 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.060
 here you have your first 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.950
 training 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.709
 you just have to add in particular 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.959

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.849
 for the days to come or send it 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.470

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:28.849

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.849
