00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
kind of writing still like more JJ but

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.880 
kind of writing still like more JJ but
if<00:02:07.479> I<00:02:07.600> get<00:02:07.780> more<00:02:08.080> into<00:02:08.319> like<00:02:08.470> mountaineering

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
if I get more into like mountaineering

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.229

and ski touring and that kind of thing

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.410 
and ski touring and that kind of thing
that<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:10.539> take<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.319> TST<00:02:11.770> out<00:02:11.950> it's<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.849> narrower

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
that I take the TST out it's a narrower

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.620 
that I take the TST out it's a narrower
ski<00:02:13.720> it's<00:02:13.930> like<00:02:14.050> 103<00:02:14.590> instead<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:15.010> 116

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630

better<00:02:18.760> edge<00:02:19.000> for<00:02:19.420> like<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.600> steeper<00:02:20.050> slope<00:02:20.080> I

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
better edge for like a steeper slope I

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.970 
better edge for like a steeper slope I
ride<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.819> 183<00:02:22.500> sits<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.560> little<00:02:23.620> bit<00:02:23.860> more

single<00:02:28.989> ski<00:02:29.170> touring<00:02:29.440> as<00:02:29.590> well<00:02:29.739> and<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.819> just

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
single ski touring as well and you just

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.690 
single ski touring as well and you just
have<00:02:31.150> like<00:02:31.300> more<00:02:31.660> effective<00:02:32.260> edge<00:02:32.470> on<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.340> so

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
have like more effective edge on it so

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.160 
have like more effective edge on it so
it's<00:02:33.819> important<00:02:34.180> for<00:02:34.330> spring<00:02:34.720> steeps<00:02:35.019> and

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
it's important for spring steeps and

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.170 
it's important for spring steeps and
stuff<00:02:35.319> it's<00:02:35.560> also<00:02:35.680> quite<00:02:35.950> like<00:02:36.250> construction

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
stuff it's also quite like construction

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.539 
stuff it's also quite like construction
so<00:02:37.420> it's<00:02:37.569> a<00:02:37.630> good<00:02:37.780> ski<00:02:38.280> take<00:02:39.280> for

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
so it's a good ski take for

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.140 
so it's a good ski take for
mountaineering<00:02:40.030> alpinism<00:02:41.760> was<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:42.880> long

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
mountaineering alpinism was a long

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.729 
mountaineering alpinism was a long
ramble<00:02:43.860> already<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:46.390> that's<00:02:46.989> four<00:02:47.290> for<00:02:47.560> this

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
ramble already so that's four for this

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.420 
ramble already so that's four for this

anyone know about the energy that we had

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.539 
anyone know about the energy that we had
like<00:03:05.140> it<00:03:05.350> that's<00:03:05.530> kind<00:03:05.739> of<00:03:05.769> our<00:03:05.890> first<00:03:06.160> like

that we have it are not of the original
ski<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:14.170> we<00:03:14.260> have<00:03:14.410> viscal<00:03:14.980> ERG<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.880> that's

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
ski that we have viscal ERG and that's

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.259 
ski that we have viscal ERG and that's
he<00:03:17.049> ended<00:03:17.590> up<00:03:17.709> facing<00:03:18.160> out<00:03:18.489> with<00:03:18.820> all<00:03:19.000> the

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
he ended up facing out with all the

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
advancement that can happen is in the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
end of the we ended up not needing that

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.740 
end of the we ended up not needing that
model<00:03:24.400> anymore<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.060> Baba<00:03:25.390> is<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.660> one

model anymore and the Baba is the one

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.390 
model anymore and the Baba is the one
that<00:03:25.900> took<00:03:26.049> it<00:03:26.200> over<00:03:26.320> it's<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.650> closest<00:03:27.040> ski

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
that took it over it's the closest ski

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.110 
that took it over it's the closest ski
to<00:03:27.730> like<00:03:28.000> a<00:03:28.620> real<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:30.040> know<00:03:30.160> like<00:03:30.400> early<00:03:30.910> rise

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
to like a real you know like early rise

still<00:03:34.299> have<00:03:34.480> like<00:03:34.750> about<00:03:35.709> this<00:03:35.980> much

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
still have like about this much

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.520 
still have like about this much
effective<00:03:37.000> edge<00:03:37.239> and<00:03:37.570> a<00:03:38.170> little<00:03:38.410> bit<00:03:38.500> of
