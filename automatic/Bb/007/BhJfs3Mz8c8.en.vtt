00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
tried to get into this book maybe three

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.390 
tried to get into this book maybe three
times<00:01:18.270> now<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:19.200> can't<00:01:19.500> get<00:01:19.770> into<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.280> and

such<00:01:22.110> an<00:01:22.229> amazing<00:01:22.470> world<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.670> also<00:01:23.820> think

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
such an amazing world but I also think

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.450 
such an amazing world but I also think
that<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.750> world<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.500> don't<00:01:25.560> know<00:01:25.799> maybe<00:01:26.130> to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
that this world is I don't know maybe to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.609 
that this world is I don't know maybe to
high<00:01:26.700> fantasy<00:01:27.299> for<00:01:27.479> me<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:27.900> kind<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.380> hard

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
high fantasy for me it's kind of hard

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.130 
high fantasy for me it's kind of hard
for<00:01:28.829> me<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.189> wrap<00:01:29.549> my<00:01:29.820> head<00:01:30.150> around<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.900> world

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
for me to wrap my head around the world

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.350 
for me to wrap my head around the world
of<00:01:31.470> chimra<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.310> just<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.729> world<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.240> this

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360

of chimra and just this world that this
series<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.930> set<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.920> think<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.159> has<00:01:35.369> a

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
series is set in and I think that has a

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.039 
series is set in and I think that has a
lot<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.240> because<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.659> really<00:01:36.900> about

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
lot to do with it because I really about

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.960 
lot to do with it because I really about
the<00:01:37.200> characters<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.979> story<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.670> just

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
the characters and the story but I just

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.850 
the characters and the story but I just
can't<00:01:39.210> get<00:01:39.360> into<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.930> think<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.290> has<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.680> do

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
can't get into it I think that has to do

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.700 
can't get into it I think that has to do
with

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
with

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.890

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
a really complex world in this story

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.810 
a really complex world in this story
unfortunately<00:01:44.380> I<00:01:44.710> will<00:01:44.950> be<00:01:45.070> continuing<00:01:45.670> on

kind<00:04:12.560> of<00:04:12.620> forced<00:04:12.950> myself<00:04:13.190> through<00:04:13.819> it<00:04:13.849> I<00:04:14.209> might

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
kind of forced myself through it I might

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.590 
kind of forced myself through it I might
continue<00:04:15.349> on<00:04:15.859> with<00:04:16.039> this<00:04:16.160> series<00:04:16.220> if<00:04:17.000> I<00:04:17.329> see

continue on with this series if I see
the<00:04:17.870> other<00:04:18.049> two<00:04:18.320> books<00:04:18.590> for<00:04:18.949> a<00:04:18.979> really<00:04:19.430> cheap

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
the other two books for a really cheap

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.789 
the other two books for a really cheap
price<00:04:20.030> but<00:04:20.150> I<00:04:20.630> really<00:04:21.079> just<00:04:21.109> think<00:04:21.500> it<00:04:21.680> would

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
price but I really just think it would

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.529 
price but I really just think it would
be<00:04:21.919> a<00:04:21.949> complete<00:04:22.430> waste<00:04:22.639> of<00:04:22.850> my<00:04:22.910> time<00:04:23.270> because

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
be a complete waste of my time because

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.840 
be a complete waste of my time because
this<00:04:23.900> series<00:04:24.350> contributes<00:04:25.100> nothing<00:04:25.520> to<00:04:25.699> my

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
this series contributes nothing to my

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.180 
this series contributes nothing to my
literary<00:04:26.300> knowledge<00:04:26.650> generally<00:04:27.650> a<00:04:27.680> lot<00:04:28.070> of

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
literary knowledge generally a lot of

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.790 
literary knowledge generally a lot of
Angel<00:04:28.669> books<00:04:28.910> are<00:04:29.180> quite<00:04:29.360> I<00:04:30.139> don't<00:04:30.169> know<00:04:30.440> just

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
Angel books are quite I don't know just

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.760 
Angel books are quite I don't know just

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
average just how I feel about a lot of

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.550 
average just how I feel about a lot of
vampire<00:04:34.610> books<00:04:34.940> or<00:04:35.240> which<00:04:35.690> books<00:04:36.050> some<00:04:36.530> of

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
vampire books or which books some of

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.700 
vampire books or which books some of
paranormal<00:04:37.520> romance<00:04:37.729> books<00:04:38.270> some<00:04:38.710> subgenres

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
paranormal romance books some subgenres

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.339 
paranormal romance books some subgenres
in<00:04:39.949> that<00:04:40.160> genre<00:04:40.190> are<00:04:40.849> just<00:04:41.150> pretty<00:04:41.570> lame<00:04:41.870> in<00:04:42.199> my

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349 
in that genre are just pretty lame in my

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:44.740 
in that genre are just pretty lame in my
opinion<00:04:42.889> and<00:04:43.130> I<00:04:43.430> might<00:04:43.789> continue<00:04:44.180> on<00:04:44.449> with<00:04:44.630> the

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
opinion and I might continue on with the

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.659 
opinion and I might continue on with the
series<00:04:44.960> but<00:04:45.410> it<00:04:45.620> seems<00:04:45.919> unlikely

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
series but it seems unlikely

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.360 
series but it seems unlikely
next<00:04:47.120> I<00:04:47.270> have<00:04:47.300> Dorothy<00:04:47.900> must<00:04:48.349> die<00:04:48.560> by<00:04:48.830> Danielle

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
this one because once again it receives

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.740 
this one because once again it receives
