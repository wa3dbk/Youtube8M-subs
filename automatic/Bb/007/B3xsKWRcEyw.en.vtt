00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.150
 good day to all I bring the second 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.730
 Make-up option for new year is 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.730
 a naked ice with a touch of gold 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.760
 very important our year makeup 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.279
 new 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.910
 Apply a shadows fixator on all the 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.910
 eyelid 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.640
 let's start by applying corrector 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.160
 I'm using mac finish studio 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.980
 I'm going to apply it under the arch of the eyebrow 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.980
 in order to light up this area well 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.190
 with a dark brown gel eyeliner 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.950
 use the lower of bobby braun I will create 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.470
 a base on the mobile eyelid for 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.100
 further enhance the color of the shadow 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.100
 following 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.739
 I'm going to use a black shadow 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.860
 matte or without shine I am using 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.960
 is from the petricio palette that is one of 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.540
 my favorite shadows with a very shadow 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.910
 segmented and I'm going to apply it to mild 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.130
 touches all over the mobile eyelid 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.770
 on top of the gel eyeliner that 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.780
 apply do not worry if under your eye 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.880
 a little bit of shadow falls, because after 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.369
 we are going to remove it with a brush 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.490
 I'm going to take my favorite brush for 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.649
 blur and what I'm going to do 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.049
 basically it's smoothing the edges of 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.659
 this black shadow by the crease of the eye 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.880
 and go up a little bit of the angle 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.590
 outside but very carefully to 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.590
 very slight movements 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.530
 I will use a shade brown one more tone 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.229
 good clay this shadow coffee will help us 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.140
 to create a softer gradient a 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.600
 transition between the black I'm going 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.000
 for the coffee and I'm getting to the top 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.800
 by the arch in the arch of the eyebrow that a 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.380
 much more clarito color we are going to apply 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.590
 then a vanilla shadow the key 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.010
 to achieve a perfect smoky eyes is 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.530
 patience only patience use 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.440
 the rather light hand not very close to the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.630
 eye the brush pretty soft and I'll go 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.980
 smoking with back and forth movements 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.280
 they can also be movements 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.560
 circular we take a shade color 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.230
 vanilla i'm using this du du 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.120
 the essence that yes before taking this 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.580
 shadow we are going to clean because our 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.519
 brush to remove excess shade 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.920
 dark and let's light up under the arch 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.750
 of the eyebrow and also at the same time let's go 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.080
 softening the edges of this shadow 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.080
 coffee 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.620
 now if we clean up all the excess 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.420
 shadow that could have fallen and I'm going to 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.670
 Apply concealer to dark circles 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.770
 illuminate the area under our eye before 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.620
 to apply the following shadows 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.530
 this step of illuminating under our eye 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.360
 is very important I would say is one of the 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.610
 most important steps when you go to 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.160
 perform a smoky eyes since you have 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.680
 everything dark enough with shadows 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.380
 black coffee so you should not see 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.210
 haggard if you skip this step you can 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.910
 run the risk of you looking like a 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.460
 panda and we do not want that we continue this 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.710
 corrector with a translucent powder of that 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.750
 is this powder does not have any kind of 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.610
 only coverage what is going to be 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.610
 prevent your concealer from melting 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.330
 I apply only a little fixative 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.030
 of shadows flush with my eyelashes 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.310
 lower and with gel eyeliners I'm going to 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.430
 delineate my water line that the 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.280
 Gel eyeliner is long lasting and 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.630
 over I'm going to apply black shadow to 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.630
 flush of the lower lashes 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.940
 and today I'm going to use the mask 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.470
 false eyelashes and first I'm going to 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.920
 apply only on the lashes 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.920
 lower 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.470
 I'm going to apply the shade of color 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.840
 vanilla stool tube throughout 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.500
 lacrimal area in order to give a 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.500
 lightpoint 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.870
 before applying the golden shadow that is 

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:24.780
 the touch of our makeup I 'm going to 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.300
 give an infallible tip so that the color 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.979
 stand out more and last all night 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.340
 moisten in a bristle brush 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.659
 Synthetic with fix plus of mac or if not 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.430
 own this product 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:38.370
 moisten in the brush with droplets to 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.319
 the eyes and by false tears and take 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.310
 this pretty golden shade of castriz 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:46.710
 number 420 I apply it to slight taps 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.930
 by the area of the internal angle always 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.840
 as disk the brush previously of 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.689
 take the shadows and using a brush 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.539
 it was synthetic I could notice that the 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:05:00.150
 color of my shadows looks more intense and 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:02.840
 also makes them last longer and do not run 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.840
 with nothing 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:17.719
 I apply false eyelashes using my 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:19.759
 tube tail and this time only use 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:22.159
 the false eyelashes that are of the 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:24.649
 half of the eyelid towards the angle 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:27.230
 outside finally a little mask 

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:29.720
 to join them 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:32.150

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.600

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.050

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.539
