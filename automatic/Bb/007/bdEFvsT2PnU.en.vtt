00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.540
 from an interesting experiment that 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.850
 involves the publisher between you work and the 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.970
 TV channel you're doing , this is born 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.760
 défaillance a mmo strongly marked 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.150
 to the action that does not only come out on PC but 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.160
 arrives at the same time also on consoles 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.840
 the story told in the video game yes 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.510
 will go to intersect with what we have seen 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.399
 in the show and no series of lawsuits 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.320
 and rather interesting effects that 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.320
 could have repercussions on the plot 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.360
 the defaiance the wotan aliens have 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.579
 reached to the earth aboard huge 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.440
 arc space ships with the intention of 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.059
 to make our planet our home 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.710
 following the destruction of theirs 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.660
 origin system 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.340
 failed any mediation attempt yes 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.199
 unleash the war between the two races that 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.300
 will leave the land devastated by the conflict 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.579
 and from the earth training processes 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.050
 implemented by the bots in the events of the 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.220
 video game start exactly 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.619
 twenty years after the end of the war 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.390
 when alien humans found a 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.390
 fragile balance for collaboration 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.560
 the main peculiarity of défaillance 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.960
 one of them is the shooter in the third 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:29.490
 exclusively multiplayer person 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:30.870
 set in a persistent world in 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.700
 game there is a component 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.040
 role of character growth 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.900
 definitely essential considering how to do it 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.730
 the master action is the biting and dynamic action 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.210
 Flee and the ability of the player in the 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.370
 shootings the physical editor follows this 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.500
 philosophy of fact the only form of 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.270
 Substantial characterization occurs 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.980
 during the initial tutorial when 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.720
 we will have to choose one of the four 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.360
 starting skills choosing between 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.220
 invisibility damage increased super 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.370
 speed or a hologram useful for 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.410
 distract your enemies by increasing ours 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.850
 ego level we are given the 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.890
 possibility of obtaining other fair values 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.720
 passive or to strengthen those already 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.460
 unlocked but to emphasize 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.020
 the more action inclination of the title 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.420
 many of these to offer bonuses 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.790
 rather negligible even though it is 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.900
 of a mmo in défaillance there is not a 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.000
 real need to create groups 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.740
 organized to proceed in the game but 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.990
 obviously the missions can be 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.610
 carried out together with other players 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.800
 the whole is based on a kind of 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.620
 tacit agreement without almost any form 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.510
 communication the same text chat 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.550
 hidden among the forages nose and not menus 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.560
 it is always present on the screen once 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.720
 once this is done everyone comes back to 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.550
 wander your own way defaiance 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.470
 thus it becomes a particular game for 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.330
 lone wolves a kind of single 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.980
 massive player that will please 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.170
 players less likely to bind to a 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.270
 clan but that will make your nose turn up a 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.400
 those mmo rpg fans 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.180
 definitely more used to a form of 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.709
 deeper and more organized cooperation 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.180
 there is no lack of requests to play in 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.550
 organized groups of four players 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.290
 as there is always the possibility of 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.420
 create your own party by inviting friends 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.580
 in the game makes better moments from 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.080
 playing together are the art fall or 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.700
 dynamic events where they come to 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.959
 participate in dozens of players 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.760
 simultaneously 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.680
 in these situations it is possible to create 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.480
 a discreet sense of camaraderie in 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.489
 face the waves of enemies 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.140
 giant bosses while in the same 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.030
 time the challenge is felt between 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.660
 players saw that only the ark hunters 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.940
 what end will be 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.280
 will have access to the most prestigious looks 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.320
 and and leaves if present then one 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.150
 pvp component represented by 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.280
 classic modalities like desk medium 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.170
 capture the circumscribed flag maps 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.510
 with excellent design and more 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.400
 interesting there is from war taking place 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.020
 in the open world and that are nothing more than 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.120
 vast guerrillas for conquest 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.470
 of the territories 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.300
 the basic problem of all this 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.800
 structure is the repetitiveness of the action 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.060
 in the long run 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.340
 shooting in a shine for 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.020
 particular tactic also because of the 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.060
 bad AI intelligence 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.100
 enemies and even missions end 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.030
 to materialize in the usual tasks 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.030
 without too much imagination 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.129
 no in technical and visual terms 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.599
 défaillance a product that must do 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.599
 faced with numerous compromises 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.389
 once the game is started, they are noticed 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.560
 suffered several problems probably 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.389
 inevitable in a production that must 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.159
 manage such a vast area 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.439
 explorable must take into account the number 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:34.680
 of low resolution players 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:36.210
 and aliasing are very present are not 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.340
 also rare moments when they disappear 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.840
 whole portions of the scenery despite 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.520
 as many as 10 gigabytes of 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.500
 mandatory installation on console 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.340
 symptoms of not perfect work of 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.469
 optimization 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:55.710
 without forgetting the instability of the 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:57.900
 framerate in the most crowded moments 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.120
 mm or atypical structure with large 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.800
 focus on solitary action suffers from 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.409
 gameplay that we tend to be in 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.479
 repetitive also due to missions that 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.590
 they don't invent anything 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.029
 recommended for those who ca n't stand too much 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.830
 the idea of ​​depending on a clan 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:13.050
 while the players get used to the close 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.210
 typical mmo rpg cooperation 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.259
 may be disappointed by this 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.259
 hybrid setting 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.259
 so basically défaillance is a 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.270
 interesting cross media experiment a 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.690
 immediate and timeless gameplay 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.360
 dead 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.819
 unfortunately, in the long run it is too much 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.069
 repetitive even different accomplices 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.199
 missions not really original and then a 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:43.819
 technical aspect not really exciting 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.819
 here is our vote 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.720
 no 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.570
 the main peculiarity of défaillance 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.510
 is to be a shooter in 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:08.100
 third person 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:13.930
 the peculiarity prix basically 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:16.960
 strongly slutty has strongly with one 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:20.970
 boat has basically défaillance 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.970
 is an interesting cross media stop
