00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
helps it keep open pretty much anything

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
helps it keep open pretty much anything
as<00:00:45.359> long<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.929> has<00:00:46.140> an<00:00:46.530> edge<00:00:47.280> or<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:48.480> point

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.130 
looked at my fingertips to see if I
slice<00:01:47.130> them<00:01:47.310> open<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.210> didn't<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:48.960> from

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
slice them open and I didn't just from

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.170 
slice them open and I didn't just from
throwing<00:01:49.490> constantly<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.520> already<00:01:50.820> told<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
throwing constantly I already told the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.180 
throwing constantly I already told the
tip<00:01:51.390> I'm<00:01:51.630> gonna<00:01:51.840> do<00:01:52.020> these<00:01:52.230> I<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.650> have<00:01:53.010> to

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
tip I'm gonna do these I just have to

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.580 
tip I'm gonna do these I just have to
because<00:01:53.550> just<00:01:54.060> used<00:01:54.300> to<00:01:54.420> having<00:01:54.840> unsharp

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
because just used to having unsharp

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.810 
because just used to having unsharp
throwing<00:01:55.860> knives<00:01:56.010> and<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.400> thought<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.700> is

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
throwing knives and I thought this is

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.940 
throwing knives and I thought this is
the<00:01:56.940> perfect<00:01:57.150> opportunity<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:58.230> address<00:01:58.770> that

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
the perfect opportunity to address that

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.890 
the perfect opportunity to address that
concern<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.700> sharp<00:02:00.090> throwing<00:02:00.360> knife<00:02:00.510> better

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
concern is a sharp throwing knife better

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.840 
concern is a sharp throwing knife better
than<00:02:01.260> a<00:02:01.290> dull<00:02:01.590> throwing<00:02:02.010> knife<00:02:02.160> I'm<00:02:02.580> gonna

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
than a dull throwing knife I'm gonna

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.190 
than a dull throwing knife I'm gonna
have<00:02:02.970> a<00:02:03.000> goal<00:02:03.210> setters<00:02:03.750> very<00:02:04.409> nice

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
have a goal setters very nice

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.170 
have a goal setters very nice
and<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:05.770> one<00:02:05.979> I've<00:02:06.130> kept<00:02:06.400> sharp<00:02:06.759> we're<00:02:07.090> gonna

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
and the one I've kept sharp we're gonna

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.820 
and the one I've kept sharp we're gonna
throw<00:02:07.420> them<00:02:07.720> you're<00:02:08.229> gonna<00:02:08.349> see<00:02:08.560> if<00:02:08.619> there's<00:02:08.709> a

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
throw them you're gonna see if there's a

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.420 
throw them you're gonna see if there's a
difference<00:02:09.310> there<00:02:09.759> isn't<00:02:10.270> because<00:02:10.750> I'm<00:02:10.899> right

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
difference there isn't because I'm right

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.710 
difference there isn't because I'm right
and<00:02:12.430> here<00:02:12.849> you<00:02:12.940> go<00:02:13.030> now<00:02:13.300> we're<00:02:13.390> gonna<00:02:13.450> do<00:02:13.599> the

and here you go now we're gonna do the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.449 
and here you go now we're gonna do the
sharpest<00:02:14.140> set<00:02:14.319> our<00:02:14.440> versus<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.950> Dola<00:02:15.160> setter

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
sharpest set our versus the Dola setter

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.890

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
and you guys can see if there's a

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.760 
and you guys can see if there's a
difference<00:02:18.000> that's<00:02:19.000> sharp

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
difference that's sharp

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:44.570 
difference that's sharp
that's<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.950> duel<00:02:21.430> try<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:21.819> again<00:02:27.660> no<00:02:28.660> difference

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.729 

like<00:02:45.580> it<00:02:45.760> so<00:02:46.510> conclusion<00:02:47.049> is<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.470> don't<00:02:47.680> need

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739
