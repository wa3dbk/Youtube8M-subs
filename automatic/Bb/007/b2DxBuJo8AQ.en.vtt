twice two or three times three times

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.780

probably<00:01:36.570> at<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.869> max<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:38.009> I've<00:01:38.460> had<00:01:38.610> them

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
probably at the max and I've had them

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.219 
probably at the max and I've had them
for<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> year<00:01:39.270> or<00:01:39.630> something<00:01:39.869> like<00:01:40.140> that

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
for like a year or something like that

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.999 
for like a year or something like that
so<00:01:40.880> I<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:42.360> thinking<00:01:42.420> about<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.290> DIY<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.950> I

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
so I was thinking about a DIY that I

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.950 
so I was thinking about a DIY that I
could<00:01:44.189> do<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:45.119> thought<00:01:45.270> about<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.659> shoes

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
could do and I thought about the shoes

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.429 
could do and I thought about the shoes
because<00:01:46.890> they're<00:01:47.250> really<00:01:47.549> cute<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.840> just

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
because they're really cute I just

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.859 
because they're really cute I just
haven't<00:01:50.220> really<00:01:50.759> worn<00:01:51.149> them<00:01:51.360> or<00:01:51.509> work<00:01:51.689> them

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
haven't really worn them or work them

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.050 
haven't really worn them or work them
into<00:01:51.960> my<00:01:52.439> wardrobe<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.220> thought<00:01:53.790> you're

into my wardrobe and thought you're

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.760
