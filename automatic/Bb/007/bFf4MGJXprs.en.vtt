00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:11.999
 so the machine consists of two compartments 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:15.299
 in one compartment we pour water in the second 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:20.280
 the so-called centrifuge which 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:24.510
 drains a special rag to be honest 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:35.390
 which we and my gender and so fix 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:45.890
 put the rag into the cleaning solution 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:45.890
 hereby we rinse rinse 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:56.609
 then we must drain so we 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:01.969
 we insert at cube and progressive 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:11.610
 forward motion a 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:22.649
 we eat a rag and as a result we can wash a floor 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:25.490
 and so everything is very simple proceed to 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.490
 washing the floor 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:48.550
 that's how pretty simple it is 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.550
 flat or house 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.080
 approximate 50 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.080
 square meters 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:10.510
 washes in literally 15 minutes with you 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.510
 I'm your favorite Alexey
