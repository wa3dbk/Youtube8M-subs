yo Eliot hey so our buddy Joshua wants
to<00:00:12.780> get<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.170> harder<00:00:13.980> look<00:00:14.519> at<00:00:14.700> his<00:00:14.820> muscles<00:00:15.059> so

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
to get a harder look at his muscles so

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.029 
to get a harder look at his muscles so
he's<00:00:15.870> been<00:00:15.990> training<00:00:16.230> for<00:00:16.260> about<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.560> year<00:00:16.890> the

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
he's been training for about a year the

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.830 
he's been training for about a year the
problem<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.670> his<00:00:17.789> muscle<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.359> really

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
problem is that his muscle is really

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.310 
problem is that his muscle is really
soft<00:00:19.199> when<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.650> touch<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:19.920> it's<00:00:20.609> soft

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
soft when you touch it it's soft

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.349 
soft when you touch it it's soft
although<00:00:22.320> he's<00:00:22.619> stranger<00:00:23.279> than<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.670> I'm<00:00:24.150> sorry

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
although he's stranger than it I'm sorry

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.040 
although he's stranger than it I'm sorry
stronger<00:00:24.900> than<00:00:25.050> his<00:00:25.230> buddy<00:00:26.539> it<00:00:27.539> turns<00:00:27.840> out

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
stronger than his buddy it turns out

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.400 
stronger than his buddy it turns out
that<00:00:28.199> his<00:00:28.320> buddy<00:00:28.800> has<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> harder<00:00:30.150> feel<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:31.289> his

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
that his buddy has a harder feel to his

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.200 
that his buddy has a harder feel to his
muscle<00:00:31.710> than<00:00:31.859> he<00:00:32.009> does<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.850> he's<00:00:32.969> wondering

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
muscle than he does and he's wondering

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.799 
muscle than he does and he's wondering
what's<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.480> on

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
what's going on

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.510 
what's going on
so<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.620> very<00:00:34.800> first<00:00:35.010> thing<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.219> want<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.370> keep

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
so the very first thing I want to keep

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.549 
so the very first thing I want to keep
this<00:00:35.610> short<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.329> very<00:00:36.480> first<00:00:36.719> thing<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:36.989> that

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
this short the very first thing is that

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.840 
this short the very first thing is that
in<00:00:37.860> order<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.370> get<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.700> hard<00:00:39.420> dense

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
in order to get that hard dense

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.910 
in order to get that hard dense
myofibrillar<00:00:41.850> tight<00:00:42.570> muscle<00:00:43.050> continue

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
myofibrillar tight muscle continue

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.090 
myofibrillar tight muscle continue
lifting<00:00:44.460> heavy<00:00:45.329> with<00:00:45.989> lower<00:00:46.260> volume<00:00:46.920> and

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
lifting heavy with lower volume and

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.270 
lifting heavy with lower volume and
really<00:00:48.059> focusing<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.110> driving<00:00:49.710> your<00:00:49.860> nervous

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
really focusing on driving your nervous

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.819 
really focusing on driving your nervous
energy<00:00:50.840> through<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.870> muscle<00:00:52.469> when<00:00:52.649> you're

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
energy through the muscle when you're

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.619 
energy through the muscle when you're
when<00:00:53.520> you're<00:00:53.640> doing<00:00:53.670> your<00:00:53.850> exercises<00:00:54.300> really

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
when you're doing your exercises really

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.770 
when you're doing your exercises really
squeezed<00:00:55.410> tight<00:00:56.129> for<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:59.090> longer<00:01:00.090> tempo<00:01:00.570> than

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
squeezed tight for a longer tempo than

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.720 
squeezed tight for a longer tempo than
usual<00:01:01.230> right<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.129> if<00:01:02.190> you're<00:01:02.280> doing<00:01:02.489> chin-ups

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
usual right so if you're doing chin-ups

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.579 
usual right so if you're doing chin-ups
you<00:01:03.329> kind<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.690> take<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.930> little<00:01:04.110> bit<00:01:04.290> longer

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
you kind of take a little bit longer

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.710 
you kind of take a little bit longer
squeeze<00:01:05.070> all<00:01:05.339> your<00:01:05.519> muscles<00:01:05.970> get<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.510> top

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
squeeze all your muscles get to the top

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.300 
squeeze all your muscles get to the top
squeeze<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.260> for<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> few<00:01:07.590> seconds<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.130> then

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
squeeze it for a few seconds and then

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.890 
squeeze it for a few seconds and then
come<00:01:08.460> back<00:01:08.520> down<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.119> shouldn't<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.780> do

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
come back down you shouldn't have to do

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.090 
come back down you shouldn't have to do
very<00:01:10.080> many<00:01:10.260> reps<00:01:10.470> when<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.740> do<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.950> like<00:01:10.979> that

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
very many reps when you do it like that

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.320 
very many reps when you do it like that
because<00:01:11.369> you're<00:01:11.490> really<00:01:11.790> focusing<00:01:12.180> on

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
because you're really focusing on

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.600 
because you're really focusing on
driving<00:01:12.869> you're<00:01:13.409> nervous<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.010> driving<00:01:14.490> all

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
driving you're nervous and driving all

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.910 
driving you're nervous and driving all
that<00:01:14.640> energy<00:01:15.240> into<00:01:15.360> your<00:01:15.570> muscle<00:01:15.869> like<00:01:16.409> this

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
that energy into your muscle like this

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.469 
that energy into your muscle like this
is<00:01:17.070> how<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.220> build<00:01:17.479> myofibrillar

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
is how you build myofibrillar

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.460 
is how you build myofibrillar
hypertrophy<00:01:19.250> it's<00:01:20.250> heavy<00:01:21.119> intensity<00:01:22.110> high

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
hypertrophy it's heavy intensity high

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.050 
hypertrophy it's heavy intensity high
intensity<00:01:23.189> that's<00:01:23.580> really<00:01:23.850> what<00:01:23.970> high

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
intensity that's really what high

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.060 
intensity that's really what high
intensity<00:01:24.570> means<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.409> how<00:01:25.680> much<00:01:25.860> your

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
intensity means it's how much your

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.679 
intensity means it's how much your
nervous<00:01:26.340> system<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.670> working<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.240> produce<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
nervous system is working to produce the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.960 
nervous system is working to produce the
effort<00:01:27.990> associated<00:01:28.860> with<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.070> exercise<00:01:29.310> you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
effort associated with that exercise you

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.370 
effort associated with that exercise you
can<00:01:30.060> do<00:01:30.180> with<00:01:30.329> heavier<00:01:30.570> weights<00:01:30.630> or<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.290> can

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
can do with heavier weights or you can

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.590 
can do with heavier weights or you can
do<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.619> with<00:01:31.770> really<00:01:32.460> straining<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
do it with really straining with the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.660 
do it with really straining with the
exercises<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.680> slowing<00:01:35.130> down<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.400> tempo

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
exercises and slowing down the tempo

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.760 
exercises and slowing down the tempo
right<00:01:36.630> continue<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.140> do<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.409> if<00:01:37.590> you're

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
right continue to do that if you're

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.260 
right continue to do that if you're
doing<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.040> already<00:01:38.340> great<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.909> other<00:01:39.060> thing

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
doing that already great the other thing

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.490 
doing that already great the other thing
is<00:01:39.390> body<00:01:39.780> fat<00:01:39.990> dude<00:01:40.579> body<00:01:41.579> fat<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.420> your<00:01:43.110> body

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
is body fat dude body fat if your body

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.469 
is body fat dude body fat if your body
fat<00:01:43.740> percentage<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.310> too<00:01:44.490> high<00:01:44.729> no<00:01:45.030> matter<00:01:45.119> how

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
fat percentage is too high no matter how

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.469 
fat percentage is too high no matter how
hard<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.530> muscle<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.159> inside<00:01:47.520> you're

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
hard the muscle is on the inside you're

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.750 
hard the muscle is on the inside you're
going<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:49.470> going<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.740> be<00:01:49.829> soft<00:01:50.280> soft<00:01:50.820> so

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.350 

as<00:01:56.020> I've<00:01:57.020> been<00:01:57.050> slimming<00:01:57.860> down<00:01:58.010> and<00:01:58.360> continue

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
as I've been slimming down and continue

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.050 
as I've been slimming down and continue
to<00:01:59.480> lift<00:01:59.690> up<00:01:59.930> it's<00:02:00.530> harder<00:02:00.830> it's<00:02:01.550> funny<00:02:01.880> my

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
to lift up it's harder it's funny my

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.080 
to lift up it's harder it's funny my
muscles<00:02:02.510> look<00:02:02.690> strange<00:02:03.500> because<00:02:04.280> most<00:02:04.730> people

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
muscles look strange because most people

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.640 
muscles look strange because most people
who<00:02:05.240> have<00:02:05.480> built<00:02:05.720> up<00:02:05.930> to<00:02:06.050> a<00:02:06.080> particular<00:02:06.260> size
