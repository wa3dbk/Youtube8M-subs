fall is that you don't want to land and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.880 
fall is that you don't want to land and
support<00:01:00.539> your<00:01:00.690> weight<00:01:00.899> down<00:01:01.440> here<00:01:01.679> you<00:01:01.769> don't

support your weight down here you don't
the<00:01:02.070> form<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.399> kind<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.850> right<00:01:03.059> angle

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the form this kind of this right angle

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.180 
the form this kind of this right angle
here<00:01:03.600> because<00:01:04.230> is<00:01:04.350> he<00:01:04.470> going<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.739> dislocate

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
here because is he going to dislocate

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.700 
here because is he going to dislocate
shoulder<00:01:05.700> or<00:01:05.850> cause<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> additional<00:01:07.110> strain<00:01:07.500> so

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
shoulder or cause a additional strain so

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.620 
shoulder or cause a additional strain so
whenever<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.520> fall<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.909> always<00:01:09.240> want<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.480> try

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
whenever you fall you always want to try

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.110 
whenever you fall you always want to try
and<00:01:09.780> allow<00:01:09.990> yourself<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.440> collapse<00:01:10.910> like<00:01:11.910> this

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
and allow yourself to collapse like this

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.020 
and allow yourself to collapse like this
as<00:01:12.390> opposed<00:01:12.870> to<00:01:13.460> landing<00:01:14.460> your<00:01:14.610> weight<00:01:14.790> like

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
as opposed to landing your weight like

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.060 
as opposed to landing your weight like
this<00:01:15.270> okay<00:01:15.630> now<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.170> realize<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.830> really

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
this okay now I realize that really

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.110 
this okay now I realize that really
often<00:01:17.310> especially<00:01:17.430> when<00:01:17.760> you<00:01:17.820> go<00:01:17.910> backwards

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
often especially when you go backwards

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.240 
often especially when you go backwards
the<00:01:18.600> deck<00:01:19.170> comes<00:01:19.350> out<00:01:19.530> from<00:01:19.680> underneath<00:01:19.950> you

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
the deck comes out from underneath you

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.550 
the deck comes out from underneath you
and<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.270> fall<00:01:21.510> so<00:01:21.750> quickly<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.200> don't<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
and you fall so quickly you don't get a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.880 
and you fall so quickly you don't get a
lot<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.770> chance<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.400> even<00:01:24.090> predict<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.890> to

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
lot of chance to even predict the to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.430 
lot of chance to even predict the to
predict<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.280> fall<00:01:26.490> okay<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.030> I'm<00:01:27.390> even<00:01:28.200> then

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
predict the fall okay so I'm even then

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.010 
predict the fall okay so I'm even then
if<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.920> fall<00:01:29.160> really<00:01:29.430> suddenly<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.690> want<00:01:30.900> to

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
if you fall really suddenly you want to

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.600 
if you fall really suddenly you want to
try<00:01:31.170> not<00:01:31.410> to<00:01:31.590> land<00:01:31.800> back<00:01:32.010> on<00:01:32.220> your<00:01:32.370> tailbone

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
try not to land back on your tailbone

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.850 
try not to land back on your tailbone
you<00:01:33.300> know<00:01:33.420> especially<00:01:34.290> if<00:01:34.500> you're<00:01:34.620> bigger

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
even if you fall back like this you

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.340 
even if you fall back like this you
wanna<00:01:42.690> time<00:01:43.020> collapse<00:01:43.830> yourself<00:01:44.490> down<00:01:44.790> as

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
wanna time collapse yourself down as

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.330 

things<00:03:54.610> are<00:03:54.820> the<00:03:55.420> first<00:03:55.660> numbers<00:03:55.810> often<00:03:56.740> it's

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
things are the first numbers often it's

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.530 
things are the first numbers often it's
all<00:03:57.670> backwards

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
all backwards

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.460 
all backwards
you<00:03:59.470> can<00:04:02.670> cost<00:04:03.670> because<00:04:04.240> obviously<00:04:04.450> adds<00:04:04.840> to

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 
to the door tire boosting divided time

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.350 
to the door tire boosting divided time
your<00:06:48.530> boost<00:06:48.770> and<00:06:49.250> then<00:06:49.580> they<00:06:49.699> go<00:06:49.849> on<00:06:49.879> through
