video<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.310> little<00:00:17.490> back<00:00:17.789> ago<00:00:18.119> but<00:00:18.390> over<00:00:19.260> there

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
video a little back ago but over there

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.260 
video a little back ago but over there
updates<00:00:19.770> were<00:00:19.890> working<00:00:20.250> on<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.460> well<00:00:20.640> and

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
updates were working on that well and

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.090 
updates were working on that well and
then<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.660> actually<00:00:21.900> let<00:00:22.260> my<00:00:22.380> firmware<00:00:22.740> expire

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
then I actually let my firmware expire

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.650 
then I actually let my firmware expire
on<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.430> next<00:00:23.670> firmware<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.240> I'm<00:00:24.390> finally

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
on the next firmware so I'm finally

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.450 
on the next firmware so I'm finally
getting<00:00:24.900> around<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.289> but<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.160> thought<00:00:26.310> I'd

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
getting around to this but I thought I'd

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.980 
getting around to this but I thought I'd
show<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.609> just<00:00:26.939> for<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.269> guys<00:00:27.420> who<00:00:27.660> haven't

preview of what's to come so currently

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.900 
preview of what's to come so currently
if<00:00:31.679> you're<00:00:31.800> not<00:00:31.949> running<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.309> beta<00:00:32.460> version<00:00:32.700> of

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
if you're not running a beta version of

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.790 
if you're not running a beta version of
iOS<00:00:33.090> 5<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.719> actually<00:00:34.079> have<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.380> plug<00:00:34.620> your

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
iOS 5 you actually have to plug your

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.010 
iOS 5 you actually have to plug your
your<00:00:35.280> device<00:00:35.520> up<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.910> iTunes<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:36.899> to

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
your device up to iTunes and you have to

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.110 
your device up to iTunes and you have to
update<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.410> there<00:00:37.800> with<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.969> actually

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
update it there with this you actually

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.020 
update it there with this you actually
update<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.899> via<00:00:40.260> Wi-Fi<00:00:40.770> I'm<00:00:41.460> not<00:00:41.670> sure<00:00:41.820> if<00:00:41.910> this

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
update it via Wi-Fi I'm not sure if this

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.420 
update it via Wi-Fi I'm not sure if this
works<00:00:42.239> over<00:00:42.420> 3G<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.050> doubt<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.620> would<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.070> would

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
works over 3G I doubt it would I would

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.040 
works over 3G I doubt it would I would
really<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.820> depend<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.480> size<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
really just depend on the size of the

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.900 
really just depend on the size of the
update<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.289> guess<00:00:46.620> some<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.370> may<00:00:47.460> allow<00:00:47.670> some

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
update I guess some that may allow some

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.850 
update I guess some that may allow some
they<00:00:48.059> may<00:00:48.180> not<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.230> may<00:00:49.410> change<00:00:49.440> a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
they may not and this may change a

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.350 
they may not and this may change a
little<00:00:49.950> bit<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.340> future<00:00:50.610> not<00:00:50.940> sure<00:00:51.180> yet

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
little bit in the future not sure yet

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.330 
little bit in the future not sure yet
again<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> beta<00:00:52.289> version<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:53.100> at<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
again this is a beta version but at the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.830 
again this is a beta version but at the
current<00:00:53.520> moment<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.940> time<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.390> making<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
current moment in time it's making the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.290 
current moment in time it's making the
actual<00:00:54.960> updates<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.710> lot<00:00:56.129> faster<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.120> I'm<00:00:57.180> going

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
actual updates a lot faster so I'm going

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
actual updates a lot faster so I'm going
to<00:00:57.329> show<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.750> looks<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.230> you

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
to show you what this looks like so you

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.630 
to show you what this looks like so you
basically<00:00:58.440> go<00:00:58.770> into<00:00:58.890> your<00:00:59.070> settings<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.609> go

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
basically go into your settings you go

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.009 
basically go into your settings you go
to<00:00:59.760> general<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.719> go<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.870> software<00:01:01.469> update

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
to general you go to software update

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.080 
to general you go to software update
it's<00:01:04.019> checking<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:04.500> updates<00:01:04.729> again<00:01:05.729> I'm<00:01:05.909> on

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
it's checking for updates again I'm on

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.120 
it's checking for updates again I'm on
the<00:01:06.119> beta<00:01:06.390> 5<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.140> now<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.650> telling<00:01:07.830> me<00:01:07.979> there

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
the beta 5 and now it's telling me there

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.580 
the beta 5 and now it's telling me there
is<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.369> beta<00:01:08.610> 6<00:01:08.909> available<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.170> download

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
is a beta 6 available and the download

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.320 
is a beta 6 available and the download
for<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.130> only<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.430> hundred<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:12.030> forty

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
for this is only a hundred and forty

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.990 
for this is only a hundred and forty
four<00:01:12.570> megabytes<00:01:13.380> which<00:01:14.130> normally<00:01:14.580> firmware

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
four megabytes which normally firmware

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.640 
four megabytes which normally firmware
updates<00:01:15.900> are<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> little<00:01:16.290> bit<00:01:16.380> bigger<00:01:16.530> than

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
updates are a little bit bigger than

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.740 
updates are a little bit bigger than
that<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.549> does<00:01:17.759> cut<00:01:18.030> down<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.240> lot<00:01:18.540> because

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
that so it does cut down a lot because

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.870 
that so it does cut down a lot because
it's<00:01:19.439> doing<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.920> directly<00:01:20.250> from<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> phone<00:01:20.610> it

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
it's doing it directly from the phone it

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.130 
it's doing it directly from the phone it
just<00:01:21.060> makes<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.360> firmware<00:01:21.689> smaller<00:01:21.990> you

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
just makes the firmware smaller you

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.300 
just makes the firmware smaller you
don't<00:01:22.320> actually<00:01:22.439> have<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.710> download<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
don't actually have to download the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.399 
don't actually have to download the
whole<00:01:23.460> firmware<00:01:23.970> basically<00:01:24.869> all<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.170> do<00:01:25.290> to

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
whole firmware basically all you do to

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.740 
whole firmware basically all you do to
do<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.950> hit<00:01:26.100> download<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.670> install<00:01:27.030> and

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
do this is hit download and install and

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.819 
do this is hit download and install and
then<00:01:27.900> you're<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.200> course<00:01:28.229> gonna<00:01:28.619> have<00:01:28.740> to

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
then you're of course gonna have to

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:29.539 
then you're of course gonna have to
agree<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.130> it

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
thinker if you've heard any rumors that

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.090 
thinker if you've heard any rumors that
they're<00:02:15.900> only<00:02:16.080> going<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.470> do<00:02:16.560> over-the-air

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
they're only going to do over-the-air

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.680 
they're only going to do over-the-air
I<00:02:17.340> just<00:02:17.730> highly<00:02:18.090> doubt<00:02:18.240> they<00:02:18.360> would<00:02:18.480> do<00:02:18.540> that

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
I just highly doubt they would do that

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.330 
I just highly doubt they would do that
because<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.930> lot<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.170> people<00:02:19.319> may<00:02:20.010> not<00:02:20.040> have

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
because a lot of people may not have

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.750 
because a lot of people may not have
access<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.790> wireless<00:02:21.060> networks<00:02:21.770> or<00:02:22.770> don't

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
want to do it over 3G because of their

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.250 
want to do it over 3G because of their
data<00:02:26.190> caps<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:27.030> currently<00:02:27.330> says<00:02:27.569> I<00:02:27.690> got<00:02:27.840> 13

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
would be a little bit faster but we'll

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.900 
would be a little bit faster but we'll
come<00:02:37.560> back<00:02:37.740> once<00:02:38.190> this<00:02:38.400> is<00:02:38.580> done<00:02:38.730> downloading

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
development so I'm guessing here once

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.600 
development so I'm guessing here once
the<00:03:31.079> official<00:03:31.440> releases<00:03:31.709> out<00:03:32.070> they'll<00:03:32.400> have

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
information on some of the stuff that

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.430

the<00:03:34.799> new<00:03:34.950> update<00:03:35.340> contains<00:03:35.820> so<00:03:36.780> maybe<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.290> can

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
the new update contains so maybe you can

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.740 
the new update contains so maybe you can
decide<00:03:37.739> if<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:37.950> want<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.220> update<00:03:38.400> or<00:03:38.790> not<00:03:39.030> ok

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
decide if you want to update or not ok

decide if you want to update or not ok
so<00:03:39.810> let's<00:03:40.049> finish<00:03:40.140> it<00:03:40.290> up<00:03:40.410> now<00:03:40.560> we've<00:03:40.680> got<00:03:40.799> this

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
so let's finish it up now we've got this

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.310 
so let's finish it up now we've got this
little<00:03:41.070> pop-up<00:03:41.400> that<00:03:41.610> says<00:03:41.790> software<00:03:42.540> update

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.310 

and<00:03:46.640> it<00:03:47.640> looks<00:03:47.880> like<00:03:48.000> it's<00:03:48.360> verifying<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.260> it

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
and it looks like it's verifying and it

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.960 
and it looks like it's verifying and it
automatically<00:03:49.739> started<00:03:50.130> editing<00:03:50.190> for<00:03:50.640> me<00:03:50.790> I

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
automatically started editing for me I

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.759 
automatically started editing for me I
didn't<00:03:51.390> hit<00:03:51.510> OK<00:03:51.810> on<00:03:51.959> that<00:03:51.989> I<00:03:52.170> don't<00:03:52.500> know<00:03:52.560> why

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
didn't hit OK on that I don't know why

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.800 
didn't hit OK on that I don't know why
it<00:03:52.829> did<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.190> but<00:03:53.579> I<00:03:53.850> guess<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:54.660> was<00:03:54.780> just

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
it did that but I guess it was just

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.360 
it did that but I guess it was just
saying<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:55.590> is<00:03:55.709> ready<00:03:55.980> to<00:03:56.040> start

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
saying is it is ready to start

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.420 
saying is it is ready to start
installing<00:03:57.269> and<00:03:58.040> decided<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.070> do<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.250> on<00:03:59.400> its

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
installing and decided to do it on its

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.210 
installing and decided to do it on its
own<00:04:00.019> maybe<00:04:01.019> they'll<00:04:01.290> fix<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:01.739> in<00:04:01.950> the

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
own maybe they'll fix that in the

faster that's already moving pretty

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.030 
faster that's already moving pretty
quickly<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:42.260> finally<00:04:43.260> it<00:04:43.440> is<00:04:43.620> completely

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040

okay Baba general about and let's see

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.790 
okay Baba general about and let's see
I've<00:05:16.800> got<00:05:17.030> iOS<00:05:18.030> 5<00:05:18.450> it<00:05:19.050> doesn't<00:05:19.440> tell<00:05:19.560> me<00:05:19.650> that

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
I've got iOS 5 it doesn't tell me that

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.800 
I've got iOS 5 it doesn't tell me that
it's<00:05:19.919> beta<00:05:20.100> 6<00:05:20.430> but<00:05:20.669> I'm<00:05:20.790> guessing<00:05:21.300> that<00:05:21.450> it<00:05:21.630> did

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
it's beta 6 but I'm guessing that it did

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.690 
it's beta 6 but I'm guessing that it did
update<00:05:22.020> me<00:05:22.500> so<00:05:22.950> I<00:05:22.979> started<00:05:23.250> the<00:05:23.340> update<00:05:23.580> at

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
update me so I started the update at

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.629 
update me so I started the update at
3:42<00:05:24.330> p.m.<00:05:24.360> and<00:05:25.050> now<00:05:25.169> it<00:05:25.290> is<00:05:25.410> 4:14<00:05:26.040> p.m.<00:05:26.370> so

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
3:42 p.m. and now it is 4:14 p.m. so

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.180 
3:42 p.m. and now it is 4:14 p.m. so
it's<00:05:26.760> about<00:05:26.910> 32<00:05:27.389> minutes<00:05:27.570> to<00:05:27.930> update<00:05:28.110> it<00:05:28.500> which

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
it's about 32 minutes to update it which

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.770 
it's about 32 minutes to update it which
isn't<00:05:29.370> really<00:05:29.520> much<00:05:29.910> different<00:05:30.360> from<00:05:30.630> the

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
isn't really much different from the

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.860 
isn't really much different from the
computer<00:05:31.229> I've<00:05:31.620> updated<00:05:31.950> via<00:05:32.640> iTunes<00:05:33.180> I<00:05:33.510> may

computer I've updated via iTunes I may

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.690 
computer I've updated via iTunes I may
have<00:05:34.020> even<00:05:34.229> been<00:05:34.470> the<00:05:34.650> same<00:05:34.890> or<00:05:35.130> longer

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
have even been the same or longer

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.070
