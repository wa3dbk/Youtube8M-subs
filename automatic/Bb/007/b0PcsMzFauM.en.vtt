 sometimes you will end up opting for a 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.900
 more sophisticated thing because seminova

 vehicle and sometimes the final price that it 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.719

 a vehicle that meets the needs of the 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.189
 day to day it 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.289
 if the decision is by a used one it is 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.630
 I need to be careful when it comes to 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.270
 check the car inside and 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.520
 outside evaluate the mechanics beyond 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.499

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:46.429
 technical survey where you pay a 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.249

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.840
 engine is original if the original 

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:52.880

 vehicle you are buying is 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.020
 same person who is buying and not 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.920
 a third party 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.780
 to prevent this from having any movement 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.540

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.330
 suffered a hit or flood 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.340
 or had the pedometer tampered with 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.709
 consumer today to make a 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.260
 excellent against him to know if the car

 open the hood to look at the 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.890
 car is doors hood food 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.380
 of this car has mass residues or not 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.959
 it's about how mileage always looks 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.810
 Accelerator brake pedals clutch is 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.130
 steering wheel or tire wear depending 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.930
 mileage at the same mileage in 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.100
 low with well worn tires 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.680
 this proves that mileage was 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.780

 buy a used time you can 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.220
 check his origin too 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.890
 through old documents
