crime let's see don't want to go down
there<00:00:24.520> you<00:00:24.760> just<00:00:25.180> find<00:00:25.390> some<00:00:25.600> way<00:00:26.220> what's<00:00:27.220> this

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:41.009 

hover<00:00:30.670> boots<00:00:31.710> ok<00:00:32.710> let's<00:00:32.979> try<00:00:33.100> them<00:00:33.339> out<00:00:40.019> they

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
hover boots ok let's try them out they

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:47.309 
hover boots ok let's try them out they
appear<00:00:41.289> to<00:00:41.319> be<00:00:41.440> working<00:00:41.760> looks<00:00:42.760> good<00:00:44.489> ok<00:00:46.319> so

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:47.319 
appear to be working looks good ok so

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:51.509 
appear to be working looks good ok so
let's<00:00:47.469> see<00:00:47.649> how<00:00:47.679> this<00:00:47.920> all<00:00:48.100> works<00:00:49.949> so<00:00:50.949> I'm

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
let's see how this all works so I'm

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.610 
let's see how this all works so I'm
using<00:00:51.879> a<00:00:52.179> similar<00:00:52.629> mechanic<00:00:53.109> to<00:00:53.199> last<00:00:53.409> night

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
using a similar mechanic to last night

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.199 
using a similar mechanic to last night
ah<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:56.260> you<00:00:57.159> can<00:00:57.309> actually<00:00:57.459> jump<00:00:57.850> with<00:00:58.030> them

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:58.209 
ah so you can actually jump with them

00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:00.299 
ah so you can actually jump with them
but<00:00:58.929> once<00:00:59.139> you<00:00:59.229> are<00:00:59.350> floating<00:00:59.559> you<00:01:00.039> can<00:01:00.219> no

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
but once you are floating you can no

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:07.940 
but once you are floating you can no
longer<00:01:00.519> jump<00:01:02.489> now<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:07.030> take<00:01:07.210> them<00:01:07.420> off<00:01:07.540> here

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
longer jump now just take them off here

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.200 
longer jump now just take them off here
so<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.040> first<00:01:09.190> command<00:01:09.550> blocks<00:01:09.760> here<00:01:10.000> are<00:01:10.180> a

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
so the first command blocks here are a

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.910 
so the first command blocks here are a
fill<00:01:11.110> clock<00:01:12.120> and<00:01:13.120> then<00:01:13.480> everything<00:01:13.990> on<00:01:14.140> this

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
fill clock and then everything on this

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.090 
fill clock and then everything on this
side<00:01:15.160> of<00:01:15.190> the<00:01:15.310> stone<00:01:15.610> is<00:01:16.470> for<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:17.650> hover<00:01:17.830> group

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
side of the stone is for the hover group

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.480 
side of the stone is for the hover group
this<00:01:18.490> side<00:01:18.670> is<00:01:18.700> just<00:01:19.000> for<00:01:19.120> the<00:01:19.180> grappling<00:01:19.510> hook

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
this side is just for the grappling hook

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.560 
this side is just for the grappling hook
so<00:01:21.840> first<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:22.990> command<00:01:23.320> blocks<00:01:23.500> here<00:01:24.570> these

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
so first to command blocks here these

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.230 
so first to command blocks here these
two<00:01:25.780> are<00:01:25.930> for<00:01:26.350> detecting<00:01:26.890> if<00:01:27.040> I<00:01:27.460> am<00:01:27.580> using<00:01:27.790> the

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
two are for detecting if I am using the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.660 
two are for detecting if I am using the
hover<00:01:28.600> boots<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.970> firstly<00:01:31.390> if<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.920> have<00:01:33.160> a<00:01:33.370> score

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
hover boots so firstly if I have a score

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.310 
hover boots so firstly if I have a score
of<00:01:33.820> 14<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.510> hover<00:01:34.750> boots<00:01:35.730> it<00:01:36.730> will<00:01:37.600> constantly

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
of 14 the hover boots it will constantly

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.610 
of 14 the hover boots it will constantly
remove<00:01:38.770> one<00:01:39.040> and<00:01:39.250> then<00:01:40.000> it<00:01:40.360> will<00:01:40.780> do<00:01:41.020> a<00:01:41.230> set

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
remove one and then it will do a set

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.640 
remove one and then it will do a set
score<00:01:41.860> as<00:01:42.040> long<00:01:42.370> as<00:01:42.400> I<00:01:42.610> have<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:43.540> in<00:01:43.720> as<00:01:44.020> long

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
score as long as I have the in as long

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.000 
score as long as I have the in as long
as<00:01:44.770> I<00:01:44.830> have<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.159> hover<00:01:45.340> boots<00:01:45.520> equipped<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.890> it

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
as I have the hover boots equipped so it

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.510 
as I have the hover boots equipped so it
always<00:01:48.190> knows<00:01:48.430> when<00:01:48.670> im<00:01:48.700> using<00:01:49.300> them<00:01:49.570> I<00:01:50.280> need<00:01:51.280> a

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
always knows when im using them I need a

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.640 
always knows when im using them I need a
score<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.270> check<00:01:52.600> when<00:01:52.780> i<00:01:52.810> am<00:01:53.020> on<00:01:53.230> the<00:01:53.409> ground

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
score to check when i am on the ground

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.310 
score to check when i am on the ground
so<00:01:54.430> using<00:01:54.760> the<00:01:54.850> same<00:01:55.030> thing<00:01:55.240> again<00:01:55.480> sets<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:56.260> to

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
so using the same thing again sets it to

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.840 
so using the same thing again sets it to
two<00:01:56.620> if<00:01:56.830> i'm<00:01:56.979> on<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.280> ground<00:01:57.490> and<00:01:57.670> then

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
two if i'm on the ground and then

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.170 
two if i'm on the ground and then
removes<00:01:58.270> one<00:02:00.630> next<00:02:02.159> what<00:02:03.159> i<00:02:03.190> have<00:02:03.430> is<00:02:03.700> i<00:02:03.909> have

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
removes one next what i have is i have

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.999 
removes one next what i have is i have
an<00:02:04.479> excuse<00:02:05.229> and<00:02:05.620> running<00:02:06.460> out<00:02:06.550> all<00:02:06.670> players<00:02:08.009> to

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:22.110 
three by three
bye<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.640> area<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.680> area<00:02:17.860> billing<00:02:18.550> is<00:02:21.120> two

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
bye to area so the area billing is two

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.210 
bye to area so the area billing is two
blocks<00:02:22.270> high<00:02:24.150> by<00:02:25.150> 30<00:02:25.840> is<00:02:26.380> centered<00:02:26.770> around<00:02:26.950> the

roughly approximately the same amount of

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.710 
roughly approximately the same amount of
time<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:01.870> have<00:03:01.900> in<00:03:02.170> Zelda<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:04.540> next

time you have in Zelda and the next

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.270 
time you have in Zelda and the next
thing<00:03:04.930> it<00:03:05.140> does<00:03:05.319> is<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:05.590> does<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.280> affect<00:03:07.269> a<00:03:08.280> for

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
thing it does is it does a affect a for

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.910 
thing it does is it does a affect a for
jump<00:03:09.700> boost<00:03:10.019> they<00:03:11.019> get<00:03:11.170> our<00:03:12.269> 128<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.650> that<00:03:14.799> you

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
jump boost they get our 128 so that you

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.740 
jump boost they get our 128 so that you
can't<00:03:15.160> jump<00:03:15.459> as<00:03:15.580> long<00:03:15.970> as<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.269> have<00:03:16.480> a

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
hovering score between one and two so if

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.449 
hovering score between one and two so if

one<00:03:21.880> and<00:03:22.030> two<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.200> will<00:03:23.380> give<00:03:23.560> you<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.980> jump

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
one and two it will give you the jump

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.280 
one and two it will give you the jump
boost<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.060> you're<00:03:25.299> no<00:03:25.480> longer<00:03:25.660> able<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.079> jump

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
boost and you're no longer able to jump

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.370 
boost and you're no longer able to jump
secondly<00:03:29.290> is<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:31.810> does<00:03:32.680> a<00:03:32.859> clone<00:03:33.280> command<00:03:33.670> to

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
secondly is it does a clone command to

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.509 
secondly is it does a clone command to
player<00:03:35.380> one<00:03:36.239> who<00:03:37.239> has<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.870> hover<00:03:38.109> boots<00:03:38.290> on<00:03:38.560> to

does a fill command over here replacing

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.970 
does a fill command over here replacing
only<00:03:58.090> barriers<00:03:58.600> with<00:03:58.870> damage<00:03:59.260> value<00:03:59.380> 5<00:03:59.709> with<00:03:59.950> a

only barriers with damage value 5 with a
redstone<00:04:00.280> block<00:04:00.609> which<00:04:01.389> will<00:04:01.569> activate<00:04:01.870> this

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
redstone block which will activate this

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.280 
redstone block which will activate this
command<00:04:03.220> block<00:04:03.489> and<00:04:03.730> will<00:04:04.359> prevent<00:04:04.690> these<00:04:05.019> two

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
command block and will prevent these two

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.289 
command block and will prevent these two
command<00:04:05.590> blocks<00:04:05.799> from<00:04:05.950> being<00:04:06.280> activated<00:04:06.730> by

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
command blocks from being activated by

command blocks from being activated by
this<00:04:07.569> clock<00:04:07.840> here<00:04:08.139> so<00:04:08.920> this<00:04:09.069> one<00:04:09.250> here<00:04:09.489> adds<00:04:09.750> a

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
this clock here so this one here adds a

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.129 
this clock here so this one here adds a
score<00:04:11.440> of<00:04:11.650> 1<00:04:12.040> to<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:13.269> player<00:04:13.810> for<00:04:14.109> the

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
score of 1 to the player for the

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:18.240 
score of 1 to the player for the
hovering<00:04:15.000> for<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.060> time<00:04:16.269> and<00:04:16.859> will<00:04:17.859> only<00:04:18.070> go

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
hovering for the time and will only go

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.020 
hovering for the time and will only go
up<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.489> 35<00:04:18.910> and<00:04:19.209> then<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:21.130> it<00:04:21.549> will<00:04:21.820> no<00:04:22.000> longer

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
up to 35 and then it it will no longer

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.300 
up to 35 and then it it will no longer
be<00:04:22.419> able<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.690> hover

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
be able to hover

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.890 
be able to hover
after<00:04:25.310> it's<00:04:25.430> done<00:04:25.639> and<00:04:25.820> you<00:04:26.240> have<00:04:26.449> exceeded

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
after it's done and you have exceeded

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.520 
after it's done and you have exceeded
your<00:04:27.139> score<00:04:27.470> of<00:04:27.590> 35<00:04:27.979> so<00:04:28.490> your<00:04:28.639> time<00:04:28.850> limit<00:04:29.530> it

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
your score of 35 so your time limit it

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.230 
your score of 35 so your time limit it
will<00:04:30.860> unpowered<00:04:31.310> and<00:04:31.520> then<00:04:31.759> these<00:04:32.180> two

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
will unpowered and then these two

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.189 
will unpowered and then these two
command<00:04:32.720> blocks<00:04:32.930> will<00:04:33.110> get<00:04:33.259> activated<00:04:35.080> so<00:04:36.080> the

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
command blocks will get activated so the

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.909 
command blocks will get activated so the
first<00:04:36.350> thing<00:04:36.470> is<00:04:36.699> player<00:04:37.699> 1<00:04:37.789> if<00:04:38.740> they<00:04:39.740> have<00:04:39.860> a

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
first thing is player 1 if they have a

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.310 
first thing is player 1 if they have a
minimum<00:04:40.490> score<00:04:40.789> of<00:04:41.000> 1<00:04:41.360> and<00:04:41.570> are<00:04:41.840> hovering<00:04:42.020> and

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
minimum score of 1 and are hovering and

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.420 
minimum score of 1 and are hovering and
they<00:04:43.009> have<00:04:43.160> landed<00:04:43.550> on<00:04:43.639> the<00:04:43.789> ground<00:04:43.990> it<00:04:44.990> will

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
they have landed on the ground it will

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.020 
they have landed on the ground it will
remove<00:04:46.430> the<00:04:47.030> jump<00:04:47.509> boost<00:04:47.720> effect<00:04:48.910> that<00:04:49.910> way

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
remove the jump boost effect that way

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.490 
remove the jump boost effect that way
when<00:04:50.210> they<00:04:50.330> land<00:04:50.539> on<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:50.780> ground<00:04:50.810> they<00:04:51.320> don't

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
when they land on the ground they don't

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.379 
when they land on the ground they don't
take<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.770> fall<00:04:51.979> damage<00:04:52.370> if<00:04:52.580> they're<00:04:53.180> up

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
take the fall damage if they're up

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.779 
take the fall damage if they're up
higher<00:04:53.960> and<00:04:56.169> next<00:04:57.169> thing<00:04:57.289> is<00:04:57.520> when<00:04:58.520> they<00:04:58.639> are

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
higher and next thing is when they are

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.400 
higher and next thing is when they are
on<00:04:58.820> the<00:04:59.150> ground<00:04:59.270> and<00:04:59.539> they<00:04:59.660> have<00:04:59.780> minimum<00:05:00.229> of

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
on the ground and they have minimum of

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.659 
on the ground and they have minimum of
hovering<00:05:01.039> one<00:05:01.810> it<00:05:02.810> will<00:05:03.100> reset<00:05:04.100> their

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
hovering one it will reset their

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.210 
hovering one it will reset their
hovering<00:05:05.360> score<00:05:05.630> back<00:05:05.870> to<00:05:06.050> zero<00:05:06.289> so<00:05:06.530> they<00:05:07.039> can

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
hovering score back to zero so they can

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.770 
hovering score back to zero so they can
go<00:05:07.580> and<00:05:07.729> hover<00:05:07.880> again<00:05:10.270> so<00:05:11.270> that's<00:05:11.419> pretty<00:05:11.630> much

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
go and hover again so that's pretty much

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.620 
go and hover again so that's pretty much
how<00:05:11.930> it<00:05:11.990> works<00:05:15.550> so<00:05:16.550> thank<00:05:17.180> you<00:05:17.300> all<00:05:17.330> for
