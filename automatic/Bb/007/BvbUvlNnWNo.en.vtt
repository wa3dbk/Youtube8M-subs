00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.350 

hi<00:00:01.079> everybody<00:00:01.410> so<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:01.979> is<00:00:02.220> how<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.820> sound

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
hi everybody so this is how to sound

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.769 
hi everybody so this is how to sound
like<00:00:03.480> McCoy<00:00:03.929> Tyner<00:00:04.259> part<00:00:05.190> two<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.759> made<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.480> part

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
like McCoy Tyner part two I made a part

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.930 
like McCoy Tyner part two I made a part
one<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.290> while<00:00:07.740> ago<00:00:08.040> so<00:00:08.220> it's<00:00:08.340> about<00:00:08.490> time<00:00:08.730> for

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
one a while ago so it's about time for

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.900 
one a while ago so it's about time for
this<00:00:09.030> part<00:00:09.330> two<00:00:10.040> before<00:00:11.040> we<00:00:11.130> get<00:00:11.250> into<00:00:11.550> his

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
this part two before we get into his

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.839 
this part two before we get into his
melodic<00:00:12.509> improvisation<00:00:13.440> let's<00:00:14.130> just<00:00:14.340> do<00:00:14.820> a

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
melodic improvisation let's just do a

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.939 
melodic improvisation let's just do a
quick<00:00:15.089> little<00:00:15.299> concept<00:00:15.809> here<00:00:16.109> left<00:00:16.650> hand

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
quick little concept here left hand

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.070 
quick little concept here left hand
McCoy<00:00:17.460> Tyner<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.850> left<00:00:18.000> hand<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.420> going<00:00:18.900> to

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
McCoy Tyner is left hand is going to

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:29.779 
McCoy Tyner is left hand is going to
consist<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:20.420> this<00:00:24.170> fourth<00:00:25.170> voicings<00:00:28.789> usually

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
consist of this fourth voicings usually

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.840 
consist of this fourth voicings usually
just<00:00:30.179> three<00:00:30.449> fourths<00:00:31.550> technically<00:00:32.550> two

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
just three fourths technically two

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:43.000 
just three fourths technically two
fourth<00:00:33.420> intervals<00:00:33.899> but

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.530 

we're<00:00:44.010> basically<00:00:44.220> working<00:00:44.640> here<00:00:44.910> with<00:00:45.059> an<00:00:45.270> F

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
we're basically working here with an F

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.889 
we're basically working here with an F
minor<00:00:45.930> bass

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.729 

all<00:00:52.649> right<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.539> let's<00:00:54.539> get<00:00:54.719> into<00:00:55.050> his<00:00:55.230> melodic

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
all right so let's get into his melodic

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.580 
all right so let's get into his melodic
improvisation<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.239> there's<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.510> lot<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.410> can

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
improvisation so there's a lot that can

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.950 
improvisation so there's a lot that can
be<00:00:58.649> said<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.910> let's<00:01:00.090> talk<00:01:00.329> about<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
be said in this but let's talk about the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.340 
be said in this but let's talk about the
most<00:01:01.110> basic<00:01:01.589> part<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.370> first<00:01:02.899> his<00:01:03.899> melodic

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
most basic part of it first his melodic

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.340 
most basic part of it first his melodic
improvisation<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.309> based<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.750> pentatonic

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
improvisation is based on the pentatonic

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.690 
improvisation is based on the pentatonic
scale<00:01:07.619> for<00:01:07.920> those<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.340> don't<00:01:08.520> know

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
scale for those of you that don't know

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.180 
scale for those of you that don't know
the<00:01:08.820> pentatonic<00:01:09.330> scale<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.690> an<00:01:10.110> F<00:01:10.619> minor<00:01:11.040> it

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
the pentatonic scale is an F minor it

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:25.190 
the pentatonic scale is an F minor it
would<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:12.649> flat<00:01:21.950> so<00:01:23.179> what<00:01:24.179> he's<00:01:24.330> gonna<00:01:24.479> do<00:01:24.869> is

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
would be a flat so what he's gonna do is

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.639 
would be a flat so what he's gonna do is
he's<00:01:25.610> going<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.700> not<00:01:27.330> only<00:01:27.660> use<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.869> F<00:01:28.229> minor

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
he's going to not only use the F minor

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.130 
he's going to not only use the F minor
pentatonic<00:01:29.009> scale<00:01:29.670> over<00:01:29.820> F<00:01:30.060> minor<00:01:30.360> but<00:01:31.020> he's

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
pentatonic scale over F minor but he's

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.380 
pentatonic scale over F minor but he's
gonna<00:01:31.289> start<00:01:31.560> using<00:01:31.710> other<00:01:32.390> pentatonic

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
gonna start using other pentatonic

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.680 
gonna start using other pentatonic
scales<00:01:33.660> so<00:01:33.899> let's<00:01:34.110> take<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.590> B<00:01:34.770> flat<00:01:34.920> dominant

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
scales so let's take the B flat dominant

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.790 
scales so let's take the B flat dominant
pentatonic<00:01:36.690> scale<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.020> apply<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.380> over<00:01:37.440> F

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
pentatonic scale and apply that over F

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.419 
pentatonic scale and apply that over F
minor<00:01:38.039> B<00:01:38.759> flat<00:01:38.840> C<00:01:40.820> F<00:01:41.820> E<00:01:42.300> flat<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:44.069> can<00:01:44.190> see

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
minor B flat C F E flat and you can see

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:51.950 
minor B flat C F E flat and you can see
why<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.700> works<00:01:47.539> in<00:01:48.539> the<00:01:48.750> F<00:01:49.700> minor<00:01:50.960> pentatonic

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
why that works in the F minor pentatonic

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.190 
why that works in the F minor pentatonic
scale<00:01:52.530> except<00:01:53.069> it<00:01:53.369> adds<00:01:53.789> this<00:01:54.330> note<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.690> D

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
scale except it adds this note this D

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.160 
scale except it adds this note this D
which<00:01:55.800> is<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.160> 6<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.000> turns<00:01:57.239> into<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.569> minor<00:01:57.810> 6

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
which is a 6 so it turns into a minor 6

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:06.710 
which is a 6 so it turns into a minor 6
sound<00:01:58.440> so

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.560 

so<00:02:07.720> next<00:02:08.380> we're<00:02:08.740> gonna<00:02:08.830> start<00:02:09.190> our<00:02:09.570> paginating

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
so next we're gonna start our paginating

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.950 
so next we're gonna start our paginating
these<00:02:10.869> we're<00:02:11.140> gonna<00:02:11.230> run<00:02:11.680> up<00:02:11.980> these<00:02:12.340> scales<00:02:12.960> I

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
these we're gonna run up these scales I

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.840 
these we're gonna run up these scales I
guess<00:02:14.500> we're<00:02:14.770> not<00:02:14.860> really<00:02:14.920> arpeggio<00:02:15.520> inks<00:02:15.730> or

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
guess we're not really arpeggio inks or

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.000 
guess we're not really arpeggio inks or
not<00:02:16.000> chords<00:02:16.360> but<00:02:17.170> we're<00:02:17.320> gonna<00:02:17.410> run<00:02:17.710> up<00:02:17.740> these

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
not chords but we're gonna run up these

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.800 
not chords but we're gonna run up these
scales<00:02:18.400> so<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:25.030> that's<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.420> f<00:02:25.570> minor

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
scales so so that's the f minor

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.120 
scales so so that's the f minor
pentatonic<00:02:26.080> but<00:02:26.590> check<00:02:26.800> out<00:02:26.920> what<00:02:26.980> happens

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
pentatonic but check out what happens

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:37.290 
pentatonic but check out what happens
when<00:02:27.490> we<00:02:28.030> do<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.390> B<00:02:28.570> flat<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:36.580> that's

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
when we do the B flat so that's

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.720 
when we do the B flat so that's
essentially<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:38.080> concept<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.730> applying

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
essentially the concept of applying

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.960 
essentially the concept of applying
different<00:02:40.650> pentatonix<00:02:41.650> over<00:02:42.640> different

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
different pentatonix over different

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.110 
different pentatonix over different
chords<00:02:43.810> now<00:02:44.050> you<00:02:44.890> can<00:02:45.040> get<00:02:45.160> really<00:02:45.610> deep<00:02:45.940> with

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
chords now you can get really deep with

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.050 
chords now you can get really deep with
this<00:02:46.740> I'm<00:02:47.740> going<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.130> try<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.370> either<00:02:48.700> get<00:02:48.910> my

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
this I'm going to try to either get my

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.240 
this I'm going to try to either get my
hands<00:02:49.360> on<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.510> chart<00:02:49.870> or<00:02:49.990> just<00:02:50.530> make<00:02:50.740> one<00:02:51.010> so

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
hands on a chart or just make one so

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.280 
hands on a chart or just make one so
that<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:51.610> can<00:02:51.820> see<00:02:52.350> what<00:02:53.350> pentatonix<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.370> use

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
that you can see what pentatonix to use

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.640 
that you can see what pentatonix to use
over<00:02:56.290> what<00:02:56.620> chords<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:58.300> that's<00:02:59.200> essentially

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
over what chords so that's essentially

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.760 
over what chords so that's essentially
the<00:02:59.860> concept<00:03:00.430> of<00:03:00.580> pentatonix<00:03:01.450> in<00:03:01.660> the<00:03:02.350> next

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
the concept of pentatonix in the next

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.530 
the concept of pentatonix in the next
