00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.669
 hello, welcome to the channel 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.120
 back took on 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.880
 watch looks like this 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.630
 sport style silicone 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.750
 In the bag a small rubber strap immediately 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.850
 I say this is the merit of this watch 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.470
 very good because she is very 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.140
 man's big hand is very big 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.850
 great fit not everyone 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.949
 Cheap watches can dress on hand 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.670
 for example, with 50 kilograms 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:58.070
 man my father put them quietly 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.960
 took them out of the fact that in the first stylish 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.110
 they look very big dial 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.149
 the numbers are very visible there is no date 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.899
 that's natural 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:11.990
 water resistant to 50 meters here 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:14.390
 back side and benches from 5 to 5 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:18.229
 atmospheres here and so they look more 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:22.039
 times in front that is we have weeks 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:24.590
 time and date around changing the ram blast 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.289
 nothing shows children a plus minus 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:32.180
 also useless there is an alarm clock 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:35.770
 ampm stronger hourly signal and proper 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:39.040
 the timer here is a wonderful backlight 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.040
 you will see her 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.460
 Sveta works like that that is on 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.270
 the sun they do not glare visible 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.479
 wonderful only thing on 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.610
 There is some color version on the dial . 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.890
 I do not know about your numbers fade a little 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.290
 if you look more than 90 degrees on 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.270
 watches we usually look arm bring up like 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.570
 here so here and under it tangent 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.090
 Angle could if from the camera to the clock numbers 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.300
 seen great but on camera this is not 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.090
 much visible but if you look like this 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.050
 here 's a different angle 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.930
 how to double and bluff a more principle 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.820
 it claims to have no barometers 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.100
 I don't have an altimeter because 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.010
 I do not see them meaning all this is on 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.980
 phone weather find out how would my goal 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.170
 was to take a cheap watch with a good one 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.800
 dial which is waterproof 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:42.519
 all really i drank them 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:45.340
 do it and now everything works as if 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.310
 no problem there is wonderful 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.980
 one more thing in the sense that the inscriptions on 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.549
 Chinese watches are very often erased 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.500
 she is this model these inscriptions benches 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:00.040
 start one hundred percent they are under 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.060
 glass and on the bottom of the case no 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.720
 no inscriptions that can 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.920
 start to fade and spoils the look of our 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.610
 hours and 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.680
 and as you can see there are masterly for glass 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.640
 poems unfortunately ordinary plastic 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.340
 scratches easily 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.260
 at the side protecting the clock put on the table 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.810
 that is, he will not be protecting 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.569
 this is a ladder to scratch us our glass 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.160
 of our dial 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:32.150
 let's live in the maqam and mokrenkie 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:35.150
 watered their buttons tight good 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.620
 I will not turn on the sounds to tune 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.519
 show them and tune not as 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.360
 the usual watch is nothing black knife 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.000
 water resistant 50 meters at the very 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.000
 of the cell floats diving 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.640
 they engaged in this little - useless here 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.129
 but the fact is that I work in the field 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:57.230
 automatic watering their maintenance and 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:04:02.359
 assembly and sometimes when repairing to watch 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:04.940
 don't take off dealing with water so they 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:09.319
 don't often start to get wet 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.280
 calmly put a hand in a puddle and get it 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.030
 materials 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.530
 these are knots and do n't be like that 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.609
 no they did not survive because of watermelon 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.209
 that plastic and this plastic is pretty 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.930
 soft 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:27.080
 can scratch on that the bezel is already 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:29.599
 a little bit already started scratching but very 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.699
 small scratches them closer to so here not 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:33.800
 it is seen 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.810
 I took a great watch for my money 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:41.060
 it is the black version with a military score 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:43.099
 colors here but damn it is generally at all from 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.540
 Looks awesome hours to me very 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:47.600
 like 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.030
 such was the opinion of the reviewer 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.690
 if advised to take or not to take this 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.510
 cpu model 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.780
 if you want to take a budget time 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.230
 take it you need a big dial 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.300
 water resistant if you have 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.940
 the opportunity to take something more serious 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.210
 take it more serious anyway you can 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.700
 cheaper to buy some kind of headshots 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.010
 which hand does not look at all 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.050
 even on my big hand I did not 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.930
 they look bulky 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.390
 they cling everywhere and there are small numbers 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.810
 that is, no one accumulates shock and did not find 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.980
 to 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.410
 or large numbers that can be seen for example 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.950
 I have this watch 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:29.840
 put on a shelf of two meters with his 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.090
 I calmly watched my time as cool 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.110
 this is a wall clock given that they are 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.830
 even lie on their side 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:39.650
 so I think that I did not lose 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:43.130
 its purchase and investment 200 hryvnia 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.050
 billion was justified thanks for 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.710
 viewing 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.710
