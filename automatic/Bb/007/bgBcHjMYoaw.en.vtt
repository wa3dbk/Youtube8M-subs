office i'll put up close to you guys can
see<00:01:04.250> eventually<00:01:04.640> so<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.720> first<00:01:05.930> thing<00:01:05.990> that<00:01:06.230> I

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
see eventually so the first thing that I

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.590 
see eventually so the first thing that I
pulled<00:01:08.140> was<00:01:09.850> not<00:01:10.850> exactly<00:01:11.150> sure<00:01:11.240> if<00:01:11.360> you<00:01:11.480> can

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
pulled was not exactly sure if you can

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.310 
pulled was not exactly sure if you can
see<00:01:11.660> another<00:01:12.410> ride<00:01:12.740> on<00:01:13.060> another<00:01:14.060> kind<00:01:14.570> of<00:01:14.720> like

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
see another ride on another kind of like

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.110 
see another ride on another kind of like
a<00:01:15.470> little<00:01:15.770> bit<00:01:15.890> of<00:01:15.920> a<00:01:16.070> reverse<00:01:16.430> holo<00:01:16.670> right<00:01:16.940> on

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
a little bit of a reverse holo right on

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.240 
a little bit of a reverse holo right on
but<00:01:17.330> not<00:01:17.420> exactly<00:01:17.840> because<00:01:18.440> it's<00:01:18.740> still<00:01:18.950> rare

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
but not exactly because it's still rare

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.030 
but not exactly because it's still rare
so<00:01:19.550> it's<00:01:19.760> like<00:01:19.910> still<00:01:20.270> holofoil<00:01:20.930> in<00:01:21.410> a<00:01:21.620> sense<00:01:21.830> I

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
so it's like still holofoil in a sense I

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.210 
so it's like still holofoil in a sense I
got<00:01:22.610> a<00:01:23.050> flesh<00:01:24.050> linder<00:01:24.440> which<00:01:24.620> is<00:01:24.770> a<00:01:24.800> secondary

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
got a flesh linder which is a secondary

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.550 
got a flesh linder which is a secondary
evolutionary<00:01:25.850> step<00:01:26.150> to<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.810> fledgling

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
evolutionary step to the fledgling

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.830 
evolutionary step to the fledgling
family<00:01:28.040> so<00:01:28.490> how<00:01:28.610> did<00:01:28.670> talonflame<00:01:29.060> before<00:01:29.600> not

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
family so how did talonflame before not

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.750 
family so how did talonflame before not
also<00:01:30.020> had<00:01:30.290> a<00:01:30.320> fletchling<00:01:30.710> before<00:01:31.250> they're<00:01:31.490> all

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
also had a fletchling before they're all

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.280 
also had a fletchling before they're all
reverse<00:01:32.180> howls<00:01:32.450> with<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.870> exception<00:01:33.230> of

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
reverse howls with the exception of

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.160 
reverse howls with the exception of
talonflame<00:01:33.680> being<00:01:34.040> a<00:01:34.130> rib<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:34.550> I<00:01:35.510> have<00:01:35.780> that

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
talonflame being a rib and I have that

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.170 
talonflame being a rib and I have that
so<00:01:36.410> now<00:01:36.590> I<00:01:36.620> have<00:01:36.830> this<00:01:36.950> complete<00:01:37.460> evolutionary

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
so now I have this complete evolutionary

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.650 
so now I have this complete evolutionary
step<00:01:38.480> so<00:01:39.290> that<00:01:39.320> I<00:01:39.680> have<00:01:39.890> that<00:01:40.340> I<00:01:40.570> pull<00:01:41.570> it

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
step so that I have that I pull it

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.390 
step so that I have that I pull it
another<00:01:41.960> Stoutland<00:01:42.740> i<00:01:42.830> believe<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.220> top

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
another Stoutland i believe the top

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.350 
another Stoutland i believe the top
cards<00:01:43.670> will<00:01:43.760> be<00:01:43.880> a<00:01:43.909> little<00:01:44.030> bit<00:01:44.210> more

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
cards will be a little bit more

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.570 
cards will be a little bit more
difficult<00:01:44.540> to<00:01:44.810> showcase<00:01:45.800> you<00:01:45.920> guys<00:01:46.070> but<00:01:46.370> i

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
difficult to showcase you guys but i

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.500 
difficult to showcase you guys but i
