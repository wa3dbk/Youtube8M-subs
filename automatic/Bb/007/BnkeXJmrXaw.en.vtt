lesson<00:01:11.290> so<00:01:12.040> first<00:01:12.790> of<00:01:12.910> all<00:01:13.060> let's<00:01:13.270> quickly

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
lesson so first of all let's quickly

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.940 
lesson so first of all let's quickly
jump<00:01:13.780> on<00:01:13.930> to<00:01:14.050> the<00:01:14.080> strumming<00:01:14.440> pattern<00:01:14.470> that<00:01:14.830> we

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
jump on to the strumming pattern that we

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.950 
jump on to the strumming pattern that we
using<00:01:15.280> first<00:01:15.490> there<00:01:15.700> are<00:01:15.730> two<00:01:15.910> different<00:01:16.810> kind

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
using first there are two different kind

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.060 
using first there are two different kind
of<00:01:16.990> strumming<00:01:17.290> patterns<00:01:17.590> that<00:01:17.680> I<00:01:17.770> am<00:01:17.830> using

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
of strumming patterns that I am using

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.640 
of strumming patterns that I am using
here<00:01:18.310> one<00:01:19.120> is<00:01:21.720> down<00:01:22.720> down<00:01:22.990> down<00:01:23.260> up<00:01:23.290> down<00:01:23.440> up

one two down down down up down up down
down<00:01:28.530> down<00:01:29.530> down<00:01:29.920> up<00:01:29.950> down<00:01:30.160> down<00:01:32.010> okay

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.400 

right<00:01:38.940> fidelity<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.510> places<00:01:39.900> when<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.050> do

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
right fidelity of the places when you do

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.690 
right fidelity of the places when you do
the<00:01:40.590> first<00:01:40.830> downstroke<00:01:41.340> you've<00:01:41.460> hit<00:01:41.580> the

one<00:01:49.620> thing<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.670> pattern<00:01:51.300> then<00:01:51.480> the<00:01:51.540> other

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
one thing is this pattern then the other

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.810 
one thing is this pattern then the other
one<00:01:51.930> is

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:06.280 

down<00:01:55.570> then<00:01:56.290> down<00:01:56.590> up<00:01:56.620> down<00:01:56.920> up<00:01:56.979> down<00:01:57.190> up

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
okay so there are these tube strumming

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.590 
okay so there are these tube strumming
patterns<00:02:08.750> when<00:02:08.930> we<00:02:09.020> use<00:02:09.200> then<00:02:10.270> how<00:02:11.270> we<00:02:11.330> play

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
patterns when we use then how we play

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.580 
patterns when we use then how we play
