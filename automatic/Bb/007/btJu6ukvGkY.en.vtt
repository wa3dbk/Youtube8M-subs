photographs all the periods online you
can<00:02:33.090> research<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.720> beforehand<00:02:34.380> it's<00:02:35.070> just

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
can research it beforehand it's just

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.830 
can research it beforehand it's just
about<00:02:35.430> knowing<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.820> process<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.510> actually

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
about knowing the process and actually

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.420 
about knowing the process and actually
sticking<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.380> process<00:02:37.800> knowing<00:02:38.250> the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
sticking to that process knowing the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.680 
sticking to that process knowing the
process<00:02:38.700> about<00:02:38.820> how<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.120> photograph<00:02:39.570> is

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
process about how the photograph is

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.270 
process about how the photograph is
going<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.930> work<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.560> actually<00:02:40.710> going<00:02:41.010> out<00:02:41.160> and

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
going to work and actually going out and

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.710 
going to work and actually going out and
taking<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.880> then<00:02:42.240> it's<00:02:42.390> actually<00:02:42.450> not

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
taking it and then it's actually not

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.630 
taking it and then it's actually not
though<00:02:42.840> it's<00:02:43.290> not<00:02:43.440> even<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.710> difficult<00:02:43.890> to

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
though it's not even that difficult to

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.940 
though it's not even that difficult to
go<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:44.940> look<00:02:45.120> through<00:02:45.350> but<00:02:46.350> it's<00:02:46.500> gonna<00:02:46.680> cost

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
go and look through but it's gonna cost

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.320 
go and look through but it's gonna cost
you<00:02:47.190> time<00:02:47.400> it's<00:02:47.640> gonna<00:02:47.730> cost<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.150> money

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
you time it's gonna cost you money

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.940 
you time it's gonna cost you money
usually<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:49.200> get<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.380> photographs<00:02:49.770> that<00:02:49.860> you

the other if the camera fallen in the

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.650 
the other if the camera fallen in the
sea<00:05:43.830> it<00:05:43.950> was<00:05:44.100> gone<00:05:44.310> if<00:05:44.760> I<00:05:45.000> fell<00:05:45.270> in<00:05:45.360> the<00:05:45.390> sea

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
sea it was gone if I fell in the sea

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.590 
sea it was gone if I fell in the sea
well<00:05:46.170> I<00:05:46.200> was<00:05:46.410> going<00:05:46.530> to<00:05:46.590> be<00:05:46.710> very<00:05:46.890> wet<00:05:47.100> and

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
well I was going to be very wet and

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.540 
well I was going to be very wet and
therefore<00:05:48.600> the<00:05:48.720> answer<00:05:48.840> is<00:05:49.020> just<00:05:49.140> to<00:05:49.290> do<00:05:49.470> it

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.630

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
again and again to get this photograph

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.480 
again and again to get this photograph
and<00:06:17.030> his<00:06:18.030> sleeping<00:06:18.420> out<00:06:18.600> in<00:06:18.630> minus<00:06:19.200> ten<00:06:19.500> in<00:06:19.800> a

hammock<00:06:21.200> it<00:06:22.200> was<00:06:22.350> absolutely<00:06:22.950> freezing<00:06:23.190> I

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
hammock it was absolutely freezing I

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.600 
hammock it was absolutely freezing I
think<00:06:23.640> I<00:06:23.700> was<00:06:23.790> gonna<00:06:23.940> die<00:06:24.240> of<00:06:24.300> hypothermia<00:06:25.610> but

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
think I was gonna die of hypothermia but

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.370 
think I was gonna die of hypothermia but
the<00:06:27.270> best<00:06:27.420> time<00:06:27.630> to<00:06:27.750> get<00:06:27.870> photographs<00:06:28.050> is

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
the best time to get photographs is

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.160 
the best time to get photographs is
generally<00:06:28.740> in<00:06:28.830> the<00:06:28.920> morning<00:06:29.220> and<00:06:30.080> there<00:06:31.080> we

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.170 
generally in the morning and there we

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.530 
generally in the morning and there we
are<00:06:31.200> a<00:06:31.640> fox<00:06:32.640> actually<00:06:32.910> going<00:06:33.030> to<00:06:33.150> see<00:06:33.300> me<00:06:33.420> that

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.540 
are a fox actually going to see me that

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.240 
are a fox actually going to see me that
evening<00:06:33.720> and<00:06:33.990> it<00:06:34.080> was<00:06:34.200> a<00:06:34.590> very<00:06:34.800> beautiful

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
evening and it was a very beautiful

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.090 
evening and it was a very beautiful
experience<00:06:36.140> he<00:06:37.140> came<00:06:37.320> out<00:06:37.440> very<00:06:37.590> close<00:06:37.890> and<00:06:38.040> I

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 
experience he came out very close and I

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.020 
experience he came out very close and I
was<00:06:38.220> quite<00:06:38.340> concerned<00:06:38.520> he<00:06:38.820> would<00:06:38.910> actually

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
was quite concerned he would actually

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.540 
was quite concerned he would actually
leap<00:06:39.330> into<00:06:39.540> the<00:06:39.720> hammock<00:06:39.900> for<00:06:40.140> warmth

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
leap into the hammock for warmth

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.629 
leap into the hammock for warmth
so<00:06:42.300> I<00:06:42.330> really<00:06:42.750> hope<00:06:42.870> this<00:06:43.020> has<00:06:43.169> been<00:06:43.199> useful

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 
so I really hope this has been useful

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:45.890 
so I really hope this has been useful
it's<00:06:44.639> one<00:06:44.759> of<00:06:44.849> those<00:06:44.940> concepts<00:06:45.449> as<00:06:45.569> it's<00:06:45.750> been

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
it's one of those concepts as it's been

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.430 
it's one of those concepts as it's been
so<00:06:46.460> vitally<00:06:47.460> important<00:06:47.910> for<00:06:48.030> me<00:06:48.120> the<00:06:49.110> idea

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
so vitally important for me the idea

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.260 
so vitally important for me the idea
that<00:06:49.560> when<00:06:49.710> you're<00:06:49.830> taking<00:06:50.129> anything<00:06:50.340> you

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270 
that when you're taking anything you

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.360 
that when you're taking anything you
want<00:06:51.449> to<00:06:51.539> just<00:06:51.750> plan<00:06:52.050> ahead<00:06:52.229> make<00:06:53.039> sure<00:06:53.220> it's

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
want to just plan ahead make sure it's

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.640 
want to just plan ahead make sure it's
right<00:06:53.580> and<00:06:53.849> put<00:06:54.449> in<00:06:54.539> all<00:06:54.720> that<00:06:54.930> effort<00:06:55.080> you<00:06:55.379> can

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 
right and put in all that effort you can

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.460
