and speak to thicken and the astrometric

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.620 
and speak to thicken and the astrometric
goes<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.140> here<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.610> get<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.909> pilots<00:01:06.450> then

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
goes in here and to get the pilots then

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.500 
goes in here and to get the pilots then
you<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.110> fold<00:01:07.350> Lisp<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:08.040> up<00:01:08.250> then<00:01:09.150> this

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
you have to fold Lisp it up then this

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.609 
you have to fold Lisp it up then this
and<00:01:09.810> fold<00:01:10.170> these<00:01:10.500> sides<00:01:11.270> down<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:13.290> would

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
and fold these sides down and I would

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.969 
and fold these sides down and I would
take<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.950> astromech<00:01:14.580> droid<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.950> take<00:01:16.950> a

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
take the astromech droid and take a

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.240 
take the astromech droid and take a
pilot<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.860> put<00:01:19.860> them<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.100> here<00:01:21.920> there's<00:01:22.920> no

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
pilot and put them in here there's no

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.969 
pilot and put them in here there's no
room<00:01:23.490> for<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> guns<00:01:24.090> they<00:01:24.479> have<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:25.049> just

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
room for the guns they have to like just

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.539 
room for the guns they have to like just
be<00:01:26.130> stuck<00:01:26.490> at<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> side<00:01:26.939> or<00:01:26.970> something<00:01:27.509> and

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
be stuck at the side or something and

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.550 
be stuck at the side or something and
there's<00:01:29.549> controls<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.270> either<00:01:30.420> side<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.200> then

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
there's controls on either side and then

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.670 
there's controls on either side and then
you<00:01:31.650> basically<00:01:31.860> just<00:01:32.130> flip<00:01:32.520> these<00:01:32.700> back<00:01:32.939> down

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
you basically just flip these back down

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.499 
you basically just flip these back down
these<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.070> you've<00:01:35.549> got<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.820> cockpit<00:01:36.299> sealed

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
these and you've got the cockpit sealed

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.399 
these and you've got the cockpit sealed
again<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:38.490> get<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> little<00:01:39.090> chart<00:01:39.630> at<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.020> back

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
again you get a little chart at the back

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.100 
again you get a little chart at the back
it's<00:01:41.040> nothing<00:01:41.880> special<00:01:43.549> it<00:01:44.549> has<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> gun<00:01:45.479> one

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
it's nothing special it has a gun one

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:54.050 
it's nothing special it has a gun one
side<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.250> other<00:01:47.280> ah<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:51.680> young<00:01:53.060> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
side and the other ah the young the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.359 
side and the other ah the young the
wings<00:01:54.270> can<00:01:54.780> be<00:01:55.020> folded<00:01:55.380> out<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> song

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
wings can be folded out like a song

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.240 
wings can be folded out like a song
using

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.460 

right<00:02:04.250> um<00:02:05.710> so<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:08.630> should<00:02:08.780> take<00:02:08.960> a<00:02:08.990> look<00:02:09.229> right

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
right um so you should take a look right

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.540 
right um so you should take a look right
now<00:02:10.120> wings<00:02:11.120> are<00:02:11.600> flat<00:02:12.260> ah<00:02:13.210> then<00:02:14.230> if<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.680> take

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
now wings are flat ah then if I take

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.690 
now wings are flat ah then if I take
this<00:02:16.730> little<00:02:17.000> mechanism<00:02:17.330> here<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.400> turn<00:02:19.400> it

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.250 

you'll<00:02:22.700> see<00:02:22.940> that<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.330> wings<00:02:23.570> are<00:02:23.810> spreading

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
you'll see that the wings are spreading

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.500 
you'll see that the wings are spreading
out<00:02:25.870> due<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:27.490> these<00:02:28.490> little<00:02:28.820> things<00:02:28.940> right

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
out due to these little things right

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.590 
out due to these little things right
there<00:02:29.960> a<00:02:30.200> little<00:02:30.850> bowls<00:02:31.850> or<00:02:32.240> what<00:02:32.390> if<00:02:32.480> you're

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
there a little bowls or what if you're

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
there a little bowls or what if you're
on<00:02:32.750> call<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.200> then<00:02:34.010> you<00:02:34.250> have<00:02:34.460> the<00:02:34.790> wings

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
on call and then you have the wings

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:47.650 
on call and then you have the wings
split<00:02:36.620> which<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.660> pretty<00:02:38.660> cool<00:02:40.510> yeah<00:02:44.560> so<00:02:46.660> put

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
split which is pretty cool yeah so put

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.090 
split which is pretty cool yeah so put
the<00:02:47.780> wing<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.050> back<00:02:48.200> together<00:02:48.380> by<00:02:48.800> again

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
the wing it back together by again

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.960 
the wing it back together by again
turning<00:02:49.760> it<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.710> then<00:02:51.710> there's<00:02:52.310> also<00:02:52.490> another

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
turning it and then there's also another

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.900 
turning it and then there's also another
nifty<00:02:53.810> little<00:02:54.140> use<00:02:54.410> for<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.770> thing<00:02:55.040> if<00:02:55.280> you

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
nifty little use for the thing if you

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.130 
nifty little use for the thing if you
put<00:02:55.940> it<00:02:56.330> back<00:02:57.100> there<00:02:58.100> goes<00:02:58.400> two<00:02:59.270> bombs<00:02:59.950> okay<00:03:00.950> I

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
put it back there goes two bombs okay I

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.229 
put it back there goes two bombs okay I
just<00:03:03.140> round<00:03:04.660> two<00:03:06.280> transparent<00:03:07.280> blue<00:03:07.520> slippers

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239
