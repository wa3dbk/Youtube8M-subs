much control over that application and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.720 
much control over that application and

really<00:00:45.180> poorly<00:00:45.540> dumb<00:00:45.840> application<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.559> it

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
really poorly dumb application and it

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.529 
really poorly dumb application and it
didn't<00:00:46.890> have<00:00:47.010> great<00:00:47.309> functionality<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.269> it<00:00:48.300> so

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
didn't have great functionality to it so

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.360 
didn't have great functionality to it so
