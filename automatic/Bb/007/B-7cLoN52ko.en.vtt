you something that I'm actually gonna do
is<00:00:48.210> do<00:00:48.870> two<00:00:49.260> sets<00:00:49.649> for<00:00:49.800> everything<00:00:50.489> for<00:00:50.700> every

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
is do two sets for everything for every

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.080 
is do two sets for everything for every
body<00:00:51.480> part<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:52.260> for<00:00:52.440> every<00:00:52.800> exercise<00:00:53.100> just

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
body part just for every exercise just

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.569 
body part just for every exercise just
do<00:00:54.239> two<00:00:54.420> sets<00:00:54.710> I'm<00:00:55.710> I'm<00:00:55.890> gonna<00:00:56.039> go<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.280> three

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
do two sets I'm I'm gonna go to three

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.310 
do two sets I'm I'm gonna go to three
sets<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.059> fact<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.960> could<00:00:58.109> always

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
sets just the fact that you could always

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.290 
sets just the fact that you could always
take<00:00:58.739> up<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> intensity<00:00:59.370> just<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.940> fact<00:01:00.210> that

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
take up the intensity just the fact that

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.000 
take up the intensity just the fact that
if<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.870> keep<00:01:01.050> progressing<00:01:01.230> if<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.829> keep

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
if you keep progressing if you keep

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.490 
if you keep progressing if you keep
adding<00:01:02.160> more<00:01:02.399> weight<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:03.080> keep<00:01:04.080> taking<00:01:04.260> our

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
adding more weight you keep taking our

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.080 
adding more weight you keep taking our
momentum<00:01:04.979> from<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.250> exercise<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.970> can

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
momentum from the exercise you can

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.370 
momentum from the exercise you can
always<00:01:06.270> make<00:01:06.540> something<00:01:06.780> more<00:01:07.049> intense

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
always make something more intense

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.830 
always make something more intense
there's<00:01:08.340> no<00:01:08.490> need<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.790> add<00:01:09.119> any<00:01:09.150> more<00:01:09.390> sets

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
there's no need to add any more sets

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.950 
there's no need to add any more sets
that's<00:01:10.619> gonna<00:01:10.799> help<00:01:10.979> me<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.520> know<00:01:11.840> get<00:01:12.840> my

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
that's gonna help me you know get my

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.320 
that's gonna help me you know get my
body<00:01:13.200> enough<00:01:13.650> training<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.790> get<00:01:15.090> even

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
body enough training and I get even

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.289 
body enough training and I get even
close<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.840> over<00:01:16.020> training<00:01:16.670> just<00:01:17.670> for<00:01:17.759> example

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
close to over training just for example

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.910 
close to over training just for example
that<00:01:18.390> if<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.960> know<00:01:19.080> if<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.259> do<00:01:19.380> two<00:01:19.590> sets

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
that if you know if you do two sets

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.810 
that if you know if you do two sets
let's<00:01:20.580> say<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.630> flat<00:01:21.869> bench<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.580> next

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
let's say on a flat bench and the next

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.219 
let's say on a flat bench and the next
week<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.180> five<00:01:24.479> more<00:01:24.630> pounds<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
week you have five more pounds the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.289 
week you have five more pounds the
intensity<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.710> already<00:01:25.979> up<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:27.119> you're

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
intensity is already up and if you're

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.969 
intensity is already up and if you're
not<00:01:27.479> going<00:01:27.840> up<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.560> means<00:01:28.799> you're<00:01:28.950> not

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
not going up that means you're not

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.760 
not going up that means you're not
eating<00:01:29.250> right<00:01:29.610> something<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.659> notices<00:01:31.229> even

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
eating right something I notices even

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.280 
eating right something I notices even
while<00:01:31.950> cutting<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.520> actually<00:01:32.670> get<00:01:33.030> stronger<00:01:33.360> if

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
while cutting I actually get stronger if

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.490 
while cutting I actually get stronger if
you<00:01:34.860> agree<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.610> know<00:01:35.729> enough<00:01:36.060> protein<00:01:36.600> you're

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
you agree you know enough protein you're

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.520 
you agree you know enough protein you're
you<00:01:37.950> know<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.159> know<00:01:38.869> your<00:01:39.869> calories<00:01:40.290> I'm<00:01:40.409> not

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
you know you know your calories I'm not

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.490 
you know you know your calories I'm not
dramatically<00:01:41.130> low<00:01:41.310> you'll<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:42.000> fine<00:01:42.500> so

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
dramatically low you'll be fine so

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.020 
dramatically low you'll be fine so
that's<00:01:43.619> something<00:01:43.860> I'm<00:01:44.009> gonna<00:01:44.130> do<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.460> as<00:01:44.640> far

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
but I just I just hate taking it I might

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.640 
but I just I just hate taking it I might
just<00:03:44.640> get<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.850> protein<00:03:45.660> with<00:03:45.870> creatine<00:03:46.170> in<00:03:46.500> it

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
just get a protein with creatine in it

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.650 
just get a protein with creatine in it
that<00:03:46.800> way<00:03:46.950> I<00:03:46.980> could<00:03:47.130> just<00:03:47.430> you<00:03:48.240> know<00:03:48.270> breeze

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660

that way I could just you know breeze
right<00:03:48.840> through<00:03:48.900> cuz<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.410> does<00:03:49.590> it<00:03:49.830> definitely

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
right through cuz it does it definitely

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.700 
right through cuz it does it definitely
helps<00:03:50.790> especially<00:03:51.480> if<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:51.990> do<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.260> for<00:03:52.470> months

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
helps especially if you do it for months

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.580 
helps especially if you do it for months
on<00:03:52.890> end<00:03:53.600> that's<00:03:54.600> basically<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.110> for<00:03:55.140> my<00:03:55.350> boat

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
on end that's basically it for my boat

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.010 
on end that's basically it for my boat
guys<00:03:55.830> it's<00:03:56.520> gonna<00:03:56.820> be<00:03:56.910> real<00:03:57.270> simple<00:03:57.510> I'm<00:03:57.870> not
