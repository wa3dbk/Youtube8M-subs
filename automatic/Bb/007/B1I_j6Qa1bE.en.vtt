differentiate<00:00:48.780> until<00:00:49.260> all<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.739> critical

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
differentiate until all the critical

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.060 
differentiate until all the critical
cell<00:00:50.850> types<00:00:51.150> in<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.480> body<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.650> this<00:00:52.860> is

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
cell types in a body and that this is

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.950 
cell types in a body and that this is
something<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.640> much<00:00:53.820> more<00:00:54.030> likely<00:00:54.089> to<00:00:54.839> be

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
something that is much more likely to be

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.960 
something that is much more likely to be
acceptable<00:00:55.440> by<00:00:55.589> the<00:00:55.769> body<00:00:56.220> because<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.820> will

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
acceptable by the body because it will

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.060 
acceptable by the body because it will
less<00:00:57.210> likely<00:00:57.600> reject<00:00:58.080> than<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.379> embryonic<00:00:58.769> so

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
less likely reject than the embryonic so

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.920 
less likely reject than the embryonic so

they are or aren't human life but
whatever<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.739> think<00:01:56.099> about<00:01:56.220> them<00:01:56.550> i<00:01:56.700> think

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:56.849 
whatever you think about them i think

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:58.760 
whatever you think about them i think
both<00:01:57.239> sides<00:01:57.539> can<00:01:57.720> come<00:01:58.050> to<00:01:58.170> agreement<00:01:58.649> that

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
both sides can come to agreement that
