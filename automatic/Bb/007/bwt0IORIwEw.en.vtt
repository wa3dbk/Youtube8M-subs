00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 maite my name is ricardo carvalho 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.020
 only 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.299
 works as a tite said that they are paulo 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.670
 I'll talk a little bit here about identifying the guitar strings. 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:12.599
 I got it here 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.939
 wake up 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:14.880
 persist 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.329
 on their packaging 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:17.810
 to talk 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.349
 a little about 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.419
 how to identify it by numbering 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:23.619
 occurrence 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.750
 here is a standard the entrance of the area and kicked 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.019
 and that other companies have 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.569
 is copied 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:33.870
 cool because 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.870
 I was in that pattern that people in that rely on flu 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.120
 What do we have first? 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.130
 09 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.390
 points to zero in the month what is a weapon machine colleague of haiti 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.880
 and it was that he pq mil tec points 0 42 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.430
 wake up thicker 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.010
 so that means we mean here now 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.870
 09 that thinner than rope my 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.200
 and you wake up thicker than me 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.760
 me too 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.620
 and it is with the commission 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.990
 which is 0 42 why 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.390
 there are different games 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.810
 which can be inhibited also beginning with 09 is ending with 1 046 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.650
 euros 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.750
 however it has in the river 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.620
 other appointments 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.280
 to practice a heavier web 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.690
 the residents of not so 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.300
 on the ropes but finances 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.540
 but the standard here is the most common you will find is going to be this one 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.240
 he is seeing here 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.200
 taiana 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.250
 here too that change 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.690
 another way of identifying 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.460
 the color appeal 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.190
 one of the strings 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.940
 earth you can find 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.840
 What rope do you put on? 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.280
 on the guitar the sequence 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.900
 let's be 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.590
 Try to make it easier to look at you. 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.110
 trying to measure any thicker with finer 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.729
 so then you can then look at coloring and help packing 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.120
 entities the instruction here 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.599
 I will not show that the most likely 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.009
 here are the colors 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:13.799
 of the strings in sequence 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.359
 so meet 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:17.999
 as first 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.769
 né in the 5th class 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.289
 you have to go 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:23.839
 malick 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:25.349
 who 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.849
 would be the first thinner rope to have 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.889
 here you have it and cigarettes 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:32.679
 the second race 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:34.389
 would be a baby 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:35.889
 that is like you 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:36.899
 agreement 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:38.219
 here it was true 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.219
 the third race with the letter g 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.849
 here in black 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.379
 the 4th race 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.479
 what a bi 

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:49.719
 the red one 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:52.899
 5th to rope to an air 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:54.069
 is here 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.159
 in gold 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.539
 if it's awake it's a mistake again 

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:02.569
 again what is the bordão and here at low risk in two references in 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.239
 inch 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.090
 inch the best known 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.929
 more usual 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:10.349
 point 0 09 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.669
 the 09 bed but known 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:16.239
 when to identify yourself to buy 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.579
 and here the sequence of the years 11 6 24 32 per son 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.559
 for what you will know 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:25.469
 What is the sex sequence? 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:27.459
 amy lee de souza that we have below 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.459
 23 28 4 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.329
 Item 1 07 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:34.839
 that is very difficult 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:36.479
 see someone using 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.989
 this numbering 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.019
 Regina Celi 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.049
 standardized aquino 09 thumb 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.599
 and down here people have more 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.039
 details about the agreement 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:50.139
 inside of lucky 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.209
 in that seasonal season 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.019
 ef 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.099
 and here spiral 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.099
 rs received an order is what it would help 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.589
 purchase 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:02.999
 see the spiral 

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:05.709
 the core of parke 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.919
 the agreement is firm and does not slip 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.919
 even because it was drawn 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:14.939
 works like a ne spring 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.680
 she can 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.919
 change the sound of floor agreement 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.189
 man talk 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:22.190
 ef 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.330
 this too 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.319
 will depend a little on the placement of the cup 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:27.470
 depends a little 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.389
 Was until 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.569
 I would not say enough 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.490
 according to its quality is important before if you do not know puts you 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.539
 can be especially detrimental when you are going to test a body set 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.319
 is changing from game to game 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:47.300
 for the first time there was commented was indicated by his grandfather test 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.990
 there if you 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.050
 do not give 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.840
 did not have the luck to take this test 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.539
 and placement 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.610
 Deborah was very good. 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.759
 I sometimes you can leave nothing for a placement 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:02.759
 and then when you test the team 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.259
 chou chou 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:06.800
 what's up 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.020
 You will find that the rope 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.759
 It's bad she wants is not good. 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:13.909
 and sometimes this is not the vision problem 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:16.550
 race placement plant 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.620
 It's what left her with the problem. 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.620
 So dizzy and be very careful that day. 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.219
 not to mention that a rope 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:27.990
 it's because he feels 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.770
 know that you are sure that your placement 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.090
 It was good in the way it has a certain shape since good 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:37.650
 that already 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.719
 It is something that one has to take into account who 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:44.799
 now can also happen according to the sector increase good it is already 

00:05:44.799 --> 00:05:46.029
 with the problem 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:48.990
 before placement but the placement of 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.479
 main factors of the network 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:54.699
 if there is rope in the placement and the person to afp 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:57.650
 it's a cabin stayed with the rope that's new 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.330
 the new fourth court ruin 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.330
 but it can be the disease too if the time you put 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.659
 I assure you 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:07.659
 who was then 5 years old 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.659
 Jesus, you do not have a spiral right? 

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:13.539
 tars direct 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:14.710
 ef 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.150
 with more than 300 people 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.949
 want to keep the ropes too. 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:21.770
 port using wd40 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.229
 is a type of lubricant aimed at curbing things 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:28.710
 he running and 40 he has no solvent 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.990
 you can use behind the benfica to the ropes 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.110
 bugs 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.849
 the chords it expires or not 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:38.139
 I do not advise 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:39.349
 but masses 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:42.360
 it's interesting she 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.089
 gives you greater durability 

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:47.789
 in life there is protection 

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:50.319
 may be using 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:54.409
 this is a risk of the product before you use it after you use 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:56.749
 at 5 minutes 

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:59.389
 This will give you a longer life between 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:00.809
 with these things here 

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:03.069
 including that it was a blow but not 

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:04.499
 more ease 

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:07.719
 What's good, we tried to talk a little about it. 

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:10.559
 by the identification of the strings today 

00:07:10.559 --> 00:07:12.419
 try to make a 

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:15.830
 another class it about color placement 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:17.699
 bring it to you 

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:18.219
 and good luck
