00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello my dear viewers today 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.680
 we talk about shadows there was a shadow about me 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.710
 beauty on on youtube pretty famous u 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.290
 by the way, this is a shade in room 400 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.299
 package tear by the way can read if 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.760
 that the composition of everything else is simple 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.080
 press pause 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.630
 the next thing here is of course we see 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.269
 plastic packaging will show the dough 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.400
 here there are no mirrors brush anything 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.580
 that is, so here is the cap removed and 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.830
 All that concerns days here 4 shades 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.510
 shadows and how you on the patch can not 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.190
 say that this one shade which 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.329
 call the base can be quiet 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.430
 use 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.399
 and by himself he is very beautiful 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.500
 fits like a brow shade for example 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.410
 name in the inner corner of the eyes look 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.390
 gently but well underlines it 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.700
 regards compatible as you can see even on 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.010
 okay, they are such a little loose 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.110
 a little dry on the whole I can say 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.699
 that they didn’t sleep too much but 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.250
 it’s better not to go overboard with them 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.410
 especially with this one of patents because 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.290
 it will be with whom so to fall it just under 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.979
 eyes other shades do not do this 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.290
 but they are also less pigmented these two 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.180
 bright shade they are barely noticeable 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.189
 in the eyes did not say something 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.619
 strongly they will be there tilak just say 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.290
 so transitional shades are such very 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.450
 gentle in general as regards the palettes 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.670
 of course she has a ridiculous price and 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.740
 no wonder that such packages are 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.439
 who spent the rest because they don't 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.150
 much noticeable somewhat that this tile 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.250
 bad in not fundamentally like 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.829
 it's hard to work on that 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.250
 I will say that on the brush it is still better 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.200
 get what you want to attack with a spoiler if 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.360
 do you want to put shadows on him then 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.030
 it will be very difficult for you 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.610
 because those won't crumble altogether 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.170
 stamina I tested them on bass base 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.930
 they are absolutely calm all day 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.700
 withstand and as for without a base if 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.020
 on any without rash from foundation 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.929
 just Navkolo iveco Icon 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.850
 lasts three or four hours further start 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.579
 with whom so a little fade and it to me 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.340
 principle not like it but if you are new 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.470
 who is looking for just normal 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.019
 a palette just to learn 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.209
 do makeup just to 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.459
 have budget options which shadows 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.250
 quite good you can look because 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.290
 that it is, in principle, not bad if with it 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.910
 xcom so work together if to her at not 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.430
 you will like it very much 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.049
 like i have still such a family in 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.209
 next video by you and also show 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.579
 now did not do my New Year's makeup 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.799
 he stayed at the base all day and 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.069
 looked very cool and all i 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.760
 By the way, I forgot to show you this texture. 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.920
 in database 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.140
 it has this almost matte 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.799
 I like to open fire only with light 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.110
 texture 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.870
 this shade is pretty pretty such min and 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.870
 here is this satin this satin and here 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.060
 this satin let's say so for lovers 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.900
 Ho Chi Minh their satin shadows seems to me 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.120
 a good option 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.340
 somewhat what on the eyes are they just 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.920
 glittered something like that no they 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.959
 pretty calm you have bright ears 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:07.410
 pretend that the sequins as such are not here 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.410
 visible and not just a good budget
