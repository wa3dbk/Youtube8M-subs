a better alternative than putting a cell
tower<00:02:42.739> right<00:02:43.160> in<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.459> middle<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.820> the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
tower right in the middle of the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.210 
tower right in the middle of the
neighborhood<00:02:44.420> with<00:02:44.540> 3,000<00:02:45.230> people

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.480 

the<00:02:49.790> thing<00:02:50.030> is<00:02:50.060> that<00:02:50.800> tmobile<00:02:51.800> got<00:02:51.980> in<00:02:52.130> here

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
the thing is that tmobile got in here

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.700 
the thing is that tmobile got in here
through<00:02:53.180> basically<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.870> loophole<00:02:54.200> in<00:02:54.410> our

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
through basically a loophole in our

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.950 
through basically a loophole in our
ordinance<00:02:55.400> and<00:02:55.610> what<00:02:56.150> our<00:02:56.180> ordinance<00:02:56.690> said

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
ordinance and what our ordinance said

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.650 
ordinance and what our ordinance said
was<00:02:57.230> that<00:02:57.580> cell<00:02:58.580> towers<00:02:59.030> are<00:02:59.060> not<00:02:59.360> allowed<00:02:59.630> in

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
was that cell towers are not allowed in

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.900 
was that cell towers are not allowed in
residential<00:03:00.290> areas<00:03:00.770> and<00:03:00.920> that's<00:03:01.100> great<00:03:01.340> but

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
residential areas and that's great but

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.600 
residential areas and that's great but
it<00:03:02.060> didn't<00:03:02.360> differentiate<00:03:02.840> between<00:03:03.610> existing

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
it didn't differentiate between existing

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.210 
it didn't differentiate between existing
structures<00:03:05.540> with<00:03:06.140> sell<00:03:06.440> equipment<00:03:06.740> and

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
structures with sell equipment and

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.840 
structures with sell equipment and
that's<00:03:07.970> where<00:03:08.330> we<00:03:08.480> got<00:03:08.750> hit<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.980> biggest<00:03:13.220> fear

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
that's where we got hit the biggest fear

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.820 
that's where we got hit the biggest fear
associated<00:03:14.300> with<00:03:14.900> this<00:03:15.080> is<00:03:15.350> that<00:03:15.590> once

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
associated with this is that once

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.110 
associated with this is that once
t-mobile<00:03:16.550> comes<00:03:16.820> on<00:03:18.280> several<00:03:19.280> other<00:03:19.460> cell

t-mobile comes on several other cell

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.590 
t-mobile comes on several other cell
companies<00:03:20.660> will<00:03:20.870> follow<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:22.120> not<00:03:23.120> only<00:03:23.300> will

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
companies will follow and not only will

they're going to compare I mean this is

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.540 
they're going to compare I mean this is
the<00:04:24.120> Twin<00:04:24.360> Pines<00:04:24.600> airport<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.530> there<00:04:25.979> are<00:04:26.039> 70

acres<00:04:26.729> of<00:04:27.180> open<00:04:27.360> space<00:04:27.630> that<00:04:28.440> we<00:04:29.280> think<00:04:29.580> would

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 
acres of open space that we think would

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.020 
acres of open space that we think would
be<00:04:29.940> a<00:04:29.970> solution<00:04:30.630> for<00:04:30.840> both<00:04:31.610> tmobile<00:04:32.610> and<00:04:32.880> our

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
be a solution for both tmobile and our

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.620 
be a solution for both tmobile and our
community<00:04:33.720> for<00:04:34.729> cell<00:04:35.729> towers<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.360> thing

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
community for cell towers and the thing

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.439 
community for cell towers and the thing
is<00:04:36.840> if<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.500> community<00:04:38.039> can<00:04:38.370> build<00:04:39.030> a<00:04:39.210> cell

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
is if the community can build a cell

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.070 
is if the community can build a cell
tower<00:04:39.750> you<00:04:40.440> know<00:04:40.620> using<00:04:41.550> some<00:04:41.850> type<00:04:42.030> of<00:04:42.090> they

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
tower you know using some type of they

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.540 
tower you know using some type of they
have<00:04:43.169> all<00:04:43.320> types<00:04:43.530> of<00:04:43.650> camouflage<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:44.400> stuff

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
have all types of camouflage and stuff

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.189 
have all types of camouflage and stuff
but<00:04:44.669> if<00:04:44.789> they<00:04:44.910> could<00:04:45.090> build<00:04:45.570> a<00:04:45.750> cell<00:04:46.020> tower

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
but if they could build a cell tower

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:47.870 
but if they could build a cell tower
then<00:04:46.410> they<00:04:46.530> could<00:04:46.680> direct<00:04:47.070> these<00:04:47.310> companies

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
then they could direct these companies

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.839 
then they could direct these companies
if<00:04:48.090> they<00:04:48.150> have<00:04:48.660> to<00:04:48.900> come<00:04:49.250> to<00:04:50.250> where<00:04:50.460> they<00:04:50.669> want

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
if they have to come to where they want

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.230 
if they have to come to where they want
to<00:04:51.150> instead<00:04:51.690> of<00:04:51.750> letting<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.110> company<00:04:52.680> choose

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
to instead of letting the company choose

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.060 
to instead of letting the company choose
you<00:04:54.240> know<00:04:54.419> where<00:04:55.169> they're<00:04:55.410> going<00:04:55.590> to<00:04:55.680> go<00:04:58.070> so

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
you know where they're going to go so

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.520 
you know where they're going to go so
