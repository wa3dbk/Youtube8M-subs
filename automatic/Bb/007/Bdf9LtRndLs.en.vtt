replacement I've been using the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.150 
replacement I've been using the
stimulator<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:46.039> my<00:00:47.450> you<00:00:48.450> know<00:00:48.539> preparation

stimulator for my you know preparation
for<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.309> surgery<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:52.850> 16<00:00:53.850> t<00:00:54.059> P<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.329> good

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
for the surgery the 16 t P is good

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.569 
for the surgery the 16 t P is good
because<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:55.110> strong<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:55.710> powerful<00:00:56.129> and

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
because it's strong it's powerful and

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.340 
because it's strong it's powerful and
it's<00:00:57.180> portable<00:00:57.629> I've<00:00:57.840> got<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.170> right<00:00:58.289> here

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
it's portable I've got it right here

next to my bed and you can set the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.600 
next to my bed and you can set the
frequency<00:01:01.940> the<00:01:02.940> intensity<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.610> stim

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
frequency the intensity and the stim

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.320 
frequency the intensity and the stim
time<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.659> I'm<00:01:06.780> gonna<00:01:06.900> take<00:01:07.170> up<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:08.330> frequency

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
time so I'm gonna take up the frequency

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.410 
time so I'm gonna take up the frequency
right<00:01:09.510> now<00:01:09.689> simply<00:01:10.229> I'm<00:01:10.619> gonna<00:01:10.770> dial<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.189> up

you're<00:01:36.360> gonna<00:01:36.450> need<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.750> stimulator<00:01:37.549> to<00:01:38.549> get

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
you're gonna need a stimulator to get

you're gonna need a stimulator to get
that<00:01:38.850> extra<00:01:39.150> edge<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:40.159> that's<00:01:41.159> what's<00:01:41.460> going

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
that extra edge so that's what's going

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.240 
that extra edge so that's what's going
on<00:01:41.939> here<00:01:42.450> yeah<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.470> pulling<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.829> real<00:01:44.040> good

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
on here yeah it's pulling it real good

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.420 
on here yeah it's pulling it real good
right<00:01:44.490> now<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:45.240> real<00:01:45.450> strong<00:01:46.100> you'll<00:01:47.100> see<00:01:47.310> it

right now it's real strong you'll see it
contracting<00:01:48.060> just<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.299> second<00:01:48.630> there<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.780> goes

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
contracting just a second there it goes

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.010 
contracting just a second there it goes
and<00:01:51.770> it's<00:01:52.770> simple<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.310> units<00:01:53.729> really

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
and it's simple this units really

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.539 
and it's simple this units really
completely<00:01:55.020> transportable<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.399> got<00:01:56.520> a

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
completely transportable it's got a

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.130 
completely transportable it's got a
built<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:56.969> battery<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.840> put<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.110> right

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
built in battery so you can put it right

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.740 
built in battery so you can put it right

needed it's simple it's easy I'm gonna

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.680 
needed it's simple it's easy I'm gonna
lower<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.130> frequency<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.939> second

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
lower the frequency for a second

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.530 
lower the frequency for a second
I'm<00:02:07.870> gonna<00:02:07.990> take<00:02:08.320> up<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.619> intensity<00:02:09.540> and

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
I'm gonna take up the intensity and

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.210 
I'm gonna take up the intensity and
you'll<00:02:10.720> watch<00:02:10.960> it<00:02:10.990> you'll<00:02:11.380> see<00:02:11.620> it<00:02:11.770> contract

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
you'll watch it you'll see it contract

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.160 
you'll watch it you'll see it contract
here<00:02:12.430> there<00:02:13.240> it<00:02:13.330> goes<00:02:13.510> it's<00:02:13.780> pulling<00:02:14.080> it

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
here there it goes it's pulling it

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.240 
here there it goes it's pulling it
really<00:02:14.410> tight<00:02:14.620> right<00:02:14.830> now

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.460 

then<00:02:18.250> it's<00:02:18.430> relaxing<00:02:20.490> there<00:02:21.490> it<00:02:21.580> goes<00:02:21.730> again

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
then it's relaxing there it goes again
