was in f2000 with the thermal let me see
if<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.479> remember<00:01:12.510> after<00:01:12.930> thousand<00:01:13.439> thermal

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
if I can remember after thousand thermal

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.780 
if I can remember after thousand thermal
sidearm<00:01:14.250> would<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.330> javelin<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.790> a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
sidearm would be the javelin and then a

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.880 
sidearm would be the javelin and then a
blink<00:01:18.750> pro<00:01:20.180> scrambler<00:01:21.180> pro<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.780> hardline<00:01:22.619> but

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
blink pro scrambler pro and hardline but

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.130 
blink pro scrambler pro and hardline but
thing<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.159> hard<00:01:23.580> line<00:01:23.790> was<00:01:24.030> useless<00:01:24.390> because<00:01:24.720> I

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
thing is hard line was useless because I

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.160 
thing is hard line was useless because I
didn't<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.950> wasn't<00:01:26.369> he<00:01:26.460> he<00:01:27.270> requested<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:27.990> I

30 on a freaking ground or domination

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.740 
30 on a freaking ground or domination
then<00:01:37.159> and<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.579> do<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.759> really<00:01:39.450> want<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.630> watch

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
then and you do I really want to watch

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.440 
then and you do I really want to watch
that<00:01:40.310> thermal<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.610> hard<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.909> use<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.360> that

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
that thermal is so hard to use and that

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.240 
that thermal is so hard to use and that
thing<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.869> mean<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.320> recoil<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.220> know

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
thing I mean the recoil on that you know

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.999 
thing I mean the recoil on that you know
how<00:01:44.430> recoil<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.030> gun<00:01:45.210> goes<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:46.710> thing

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
how recoil and gun goes up that thing

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.819 
how recoil and gun goes up that thing
the<00:01:47.579> recoil<00:01:48.000> goes<00:01:48.270> like<00:01:48.450> sideways<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.320> dilip

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
the recoil goes like sideways and dilip

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.039 
the recoil goes like sideways and dilip
so<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.250> unpredictable<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.840> can't

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
so it's like unpredictable so you can't

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.630 
so it's like unpredictable so you can't
like<00:01:52.200> aim<00:01:52.439> at<00:01:52.680> their<00:01:52.829> feet<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.280> goes<00:01:53.460> up

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
like aim at their feet so it goes up

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.190 
like aim at their feet so it goes up
because<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:54.119> might<00:01:54.329> go<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.750> right<00:01:54.960> might

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
because it might go to the right might

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.920 
because it might go to the right might
go<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.500> left<00:01:56.060> it's<00:01:57.060> really<00:01:57.450> really<00:01:57.750> hard

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
go to the left it's really really hard

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.380 
go to the left it's really really hard
to<00:01:58.079> use<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.649> mean<00:01:59.009> if<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.610> can<00:01:59.759> get<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> Nuke<00:02:00.180> with

to use I mean if you can get a Nuke with

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.030 
to use I mean if you can get a Nuke with
that<00:02:00.659> gun<00:02:00.960> with<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.350> class<00:02:01.590> right<00:02:01.829> they<00:02:01.979> just

really
but<00:02:07.899> on<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.140> big<00:02:08.380> map<00:02:08.590> that's<00:02:08.800> like

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
but on the big map that's like

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.120 
but on the big map that's like
impossible<00:02:10.020> plus<00:02:11.020> I<00:02:11.200> didn't<00:02:11.440> have<00:02:11.560> scavenger

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
impossible plus I didn't have scavenger

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.960 
impossible plus I didn't have scavenger
anything<00:02:12.520> like<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.700> too<00:02:13.060> late<00:02:13.209> for<00:02:13.480> ammo<00:02:14.170> so

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
anything like that too late for ammo so

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.290 
anything like that too late for ammo so
kind<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.150> useless<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:18.610> I<00:02:18.640> get<00:02:18.790> my<00:02:18.910> Harrier

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
kind of useless so I get my Harrier

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.790 
kind of useless so I get my Harrier
there<00:02:20.880> but<00:02:21.880> yeah<00:02:22.300> I<00:02:22.330> want<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.840> give<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.470> shuttle

who<00:02:36.250> requested<00:02:36.790> this<00:02:36.970> class<00:02:37.269> and<00:02:37.540> Evan<00:02:37.930> 1984

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
who requested this class and Evan 1984

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.590 
who requested this class and Evan 1984
was<00:02:38.680> one<00:02:38.830> who<00:02:38.950> requested<00:02:39.069> the<00:02:39.430> one<00:02:39.760> with<00:02:39.940> s2000

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
was one who requested the one with s2000

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.140 
was one who requested the one with s2000
so<00:02:40.750> go<00:02:40.930> check<00:02:41.110> them<00:02:41.260> out<00:02:41.790> I've<00:02:42.790> talked<00:02:43.060> to

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
so go check them out I've talked to

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.150 
so go check them out I've talked to
heaven<00:02:43.360> before<00:02:43.540> he's<00:02:43.989> pretty<00:02:44.230> cool<00:02:44.380> guy<00:02:44.650> but

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
heaven before he's pretty cool guy but

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.800 
heaven before he's pretty cool guy but
let<00:02:45.610> me<00:02:45.640> keep<00:02:45.819> talking<00:02:46.150> about<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.360> commentary

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
let me keep talking about the commentary

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.559 
let me keep talking about the commentary
um<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:49.030> I<00:02:49.560> would<00:02:50.560> say<00:02:50.739> that<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:51.150> tar-21<00:02:52.150> is

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
um so I would say that the tar-21 is

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.210 
um so I would say that the tar-21 is
going<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:52.870> be<00:02:52.959> one<00:02:53.200> of<00:02:53.260> my<00:02:53.380> classes<00:02:53.890> from<00:02:54.040> now

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
going to be one of my classes from now

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.270 
going to be one of my classes from now
on<00:02:55.500> especially<00:02:56.500> because<00:02:56.709> it<00:02:57.069> has<00:02:57.250> a

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
on especially because it has a

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.160 
on especially because it has a
holographic<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.390> their<00:02:58.599> notice<00:02:59.019> how<00:02:59.049> the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
holographic and their notice how the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.140 
holographic and their notice how the
holographic<00:02:59.739> isn't<00:03:00.280> like<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.549> red<00:03:00.730> dot<00:03:00.940> I

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
holographic isn't like the red dot I

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.240 
holographic isn't like the red dot I
never<00:03:01.690> liked<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.110> because<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.739> that<00:03:02.890> red<00:03:03.099> dot

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
never liked it because of that red dot

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.490 
never liked it because of that red dot
it's<00:03:03.489> so<00:03:03.760> weird<00:03:04.060> like<00:03:04.450> covered<00:03:04.959> up<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.230> whole

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
it's so weird like covered up the whole

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.009 
it's so weird like covered up the whole
I<00:03:05.799> know<00:03:06.340> it's<00:03:06.610> like<00:03:06.700> a<00:03:06.760> real<00:03:07.299> scope<00:03:07.660> it's<00:03:07.900> like

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
I know it's like a real scope it's like

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.990 
I know it's like a real scope it's like
an<00:03:08.140> acog<00:03:08.560> type<00:03:08.830> thing<00:03:09.069> just<00:03:09.310> like<00:03:09.430> cover<00:03:09.760> it<00:03:09.880> up

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
an acog type thing just like cover it up

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.099 
an acog type thing just like cover it up
with<00:03:10.239> a<00:03:10.900> little<00:03:11.019> dot<00:03:11.410> in<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.650> middle<00:03:12.870> but<00:03:13.870> I

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
with a little dot in the middle but I

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.069 
with a little dot in the middle but I
didn't<00:03:14.410> really<00:03:14.530> like<00:03:14.739> it<00:03:14.799> but<00:03:15.340> I<00:03:15.400> saw<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:16.090> with

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
didn't really like it but I saw the with

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.630 
didn't really like it but I saw the with
the<00:03:17.260> holographic<00:03:17.859> it<00:03:18.070> actually<00:03:18.340> looks<00:03:18.519> really

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
the holographic it actually looks really

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.270 
the holographic it actually looks really
really<00:03:19.090> nice<00:03:19.350> trying<00:03:20.350> to<00:03:20.410> find<00:03:20.620> a<00:03:20.739> way<00:03:20.859> in<00:03:21.010> here

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
really nice trying to find a way in here

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.690 
really nice trying to find a way in here
yeah<00:03:21.459> fail<00:03:21.910> um<00:03:22.859> but<00:03:23.859> yeah<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.160> actually<00:03:24.310> looks

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
yeah fail um but yeah it actually looks

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.220 
yeah fail um but yeah it actually looks
really<00:03:24.850> really<00:03:25.359> nice<00:03:25.480> with<00:03:25.660> a<00:03:25.720> holographic

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
really really nice with a holographic

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.380 
really really nice with a holographic
soul<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:27.280> is<00:03:27.489> definitely<00:03:27.910> gonna<00:03:28.030> be<00:03:28.180> one<00:03:28.299> of

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
soul that is definitely gonna be one of

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.880 
soul that is definitely gonna be one of
my<00:03:28.480> classes<00:03:28.930> from<00:03:29.079> now<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.290> it's<00:03:29.560> a<00:03:29.650> really
