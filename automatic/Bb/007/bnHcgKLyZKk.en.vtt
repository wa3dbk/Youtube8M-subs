droid molds that are not molds but I

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.080 
droid molds that are not molds but I
mean<00:00:40.379> super<00:00:40.739> battle<00:00:41.040> droid<00:00:41.250> figures<00:00:41.879> that

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
mean super battle droid figures that

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.700 
mean super battle droid figures that
have<00:00:42.270> top-heavy<00:00:44.450> body<00:00:45.450> parts<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.050> very<00:00:46.379> very

very<00:00:50.910> skinny<00:00:51.329> legs<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.870> actually<00:00:52.230> support<00:00:52.379> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
very skinny legs to actually support the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.310 
very skinny legs to actually support the
actual<00:00:52.949> figure<00:00:53.390> this<00:00:54.390> one's<00:00:54.570> okay<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.930> think

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
actual figure this one's okay I think

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.779 
actual figure this one's okay I think
it's<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.469> lot<00:00:55.559> better<00:00:55.860> than<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.219> battle<00:00:56.550> droid

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
it's a lot better than the battle droid

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.619 
it's a lot better than the battle droid
figure<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.449> we'll<00:00:58.320> talk<00:00:58.469> about<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.739> later

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
figure but we'll talk about that later

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.910 
figure but we'll talk about that later
so<00:01:02.510> packaging<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> galactic<00:01:04.619> battle

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
so packaging it is a galactic battle

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.320 
so packaging it is a galactic battle
game<00:01:05.100> figure<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.640> as<00:01:05.760> such<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.150> has<00:01:06.180> a

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
game figure and as such it has a

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.550 
game figure and as such it has a
galactic<00:01:06.990> battle<00:01:07.320> game<00:01:07.500> card<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:08.010> die<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.610> a

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
galactic battle game card a die and a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.359 
galactic battle game card a die and a
base<00:01:11.720> their<00:01:12.720> size<00:01:13.170> comparison<00:01:13.799> here<00:01:14.070> he<00:01:14.250> is

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
base their size comparison here he is

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.560 
base their size comparison here he is
with<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.820> latest<00:01:15.270> obi-wan<00:01:15.869> Kenobi<00:01:16.590> figure

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
with the latest obi-wan Kenobi figure

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:26.390 
with the latest obi-wan Kenobi figure
it's<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.720> very<00:01:19.080> very<00:01:19.409> big<00:01:19.650> figure<00:01:22.640> okay<00:01:25.400> let's

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.719 
apologize could be a ball joint I'm not
sure<00:01:54.329> but<00:01:55.170> what's<00:01:55.920> interesting<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.549> head

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
sure but what's interesting to the head

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.420 
sure but what's interesting to the head
is<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.299> actually<00:01:58.079> fold<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.500> down<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:59.189> pre

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
is you can actually fold it down to pre

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.270 
is you can actually fold it down to pre
deployment<00:01:59.610> mode<00:02:01.070> so<00:02:02.070> that's<00:02:02.189> pretty<00:02:02.520> cool

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
deployment mode so that's pretty cool

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.850 
deployment mode so that's pretty cool
raise<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.310> up<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:06.020> his<00:02:07.020> shoulders<00:02:07.560> they

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
raise it up like that his shoulders they

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.999 
raise it up like that his shoulders they
have<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.700> ball<00:02:08.970> hinge<00:02:09.470> ball<00:02:10.470> hinge<00:02:10.709> joint

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
have a is a ball hinge ball hinge joint

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.700 
have a is a ball hinge ball hinge joint
here<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:11.790> another<00:02:12.629> ball<00:02:12.930> hinge<00:02:13.260> joint

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
here and another ball hinge joint

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.980 
here and another ball hinge joint
here<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.460> it's<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.790> double<00:02:15.180> ball<00:02:15.390> hand<00:02:15.690> shoulder

hinge<00:02:26.730> hip<00:02:27.150> right<00:02:27.930> there<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.920> Janee<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:30.060> they

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
hinge hip right there in Janee and they

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.220 
hinge hip right there in Janee and they
ball<00:02:30.540> jointed<00:02:31.110> ankle<00:02:31.830> which<00:02:32.160> has

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
ball jointed ankle which has

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.990 
ball jointed ankle which has
articulation<00:02:34.230> for<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.560> toes<00:02:34.770> like<00:02:35.010> here<00:02:35.280> I

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
articulation for the toes like here I

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.810 
articulation for the toes like here I
actually<00:02:36.330> saw<00:02:36.720> some<00:02:36.930> specs<00:02:37.260> on<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.920> website<00:02:38.520> a

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
actually saw some specs on a website a

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.700 
actually saw some specs on a website a
Star<00:02:39.270> Wars<00:02:39.480> website<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:40.140> actually<00:02:40.500> said

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
Star Wars website that actually said

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.150 
Star Wars website that actually said
that<00:02:40.920> these<00:02:41.750> feet<00:02:42.750> actually<00:02:43.230> folded<00:02:43.830> in<00:02:43.950> like

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
that these feet actually folded in like

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.940 
that these feet actually folded in like
that<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.750> acted<00:02:45.750> as<00:02:45.900> propellers<00:02:46.500> when<00:02:46.680> the

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
that and acted as propellers when the

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.000 
that and acted as propellers when the
joint<00:02:47.190> were<00:02:47.760> underwater<00:02:48.350> but<00:02:49.350> strange<00:02:49.650> enough

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
joint were underwater but strange enough

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.190 
joint were underwater but strange enough
when<00:02:50.730> they<00:02:50.850> were<00:02:50.940> following<00:02:51.330> obi-wan<00:02:51.900> when

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
when they were following obi-wan when

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.960 
when they were following obi-wan when
they<00:02:52.320> only<00:02:52.590> wanted<00:02:52.890> spying<00:02:53.160> on<00:02:53.370> them<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:53.700> we

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
they only wanted spying on them and we

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.420 
they only wanted spying on them and we
want<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.180> try<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.330> make<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.540> getaway<00:02:54.930> for<00:02:55.170> it

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
want to try to make it getaway for it

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.250 
want to try to make it getaway for it
trying<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.490> make<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:57.000> was<00:02:57.270> trying<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.510> escape<00:02:57.660> so

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
trying to make I was trying to escape so

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.230 
trying to make I was trying to escape so
I<00:02:58.290> didn't<00:02:58.560> make<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.680> get<00:02:58.920> away<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.970> droids

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
I didn't make it get away the droids

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.270 
I didn't make it get away the droids
didn't<00:03:00.510> actually<00:03:00.630> swim<00:03:01.110> straight<00:03:01.890> with<00:03:02.190> the

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
didn't actually swim straight with the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.070 
didn't actually swim straight with the
propellers<00:03:02.820> I<00:03:02.940> actually<00:03:03.210> saw<00:03:03.510> them<00:03:03.690> swimming

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
propellers I actually saw them swimming

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.920 
propellers I actually saw them swimming
like<00:03:04.280> like<00:03:05.280> mermaids<00:03:05.700> which<00:03:06.210> was<00:03:06.360> quite

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
like like mermaids which was quite

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.560 
like like mermaids which was quite
interesting<00:03:07.410> I<00:03:07.730> would<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:08.760> was<00:03:09.000> expecting<00:03:09.450> them

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
interesting I would I was expecting them

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.280 
interesting I would I was expecting them
to<00:03:09.600> actually<00:03:11.000> just<00:03:12.000> be<00:03:12.060> steady<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.510> this<00:03:12.780> have

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
to actually just be steady and this have

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.250 
to actually just be steady and this have
the<00:03:13.500> propellers<00:03:14.600> rotate<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.780> then<00:03:15.840> propel

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
the propellers rotate and then propel

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.190 
the propellers rotate and then propel
them<00:03:16.440> like<00:03:16.620> torpedoes<00:03:17.550> but<00:03:17.930> that<00:03:18.930> didn't

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
them like torpedoes but that didn't

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.970 
them like torpedoes but that didn't
happen<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:21.260> anyway<00:03:23.300> so<00:03:24.300> very<00:03:24.840> very<00:03:25.380> good<00:03:25.740> very

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
happen so anyway so very very good very

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.400 
happen so anyway so very very good very
very<00:03:26.250> interesting<00:03:26.760> figure<00:03:26.990> pain<00:03:27.990> apps<00:03:28.200> are

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
very interesting figure pain apps are

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.350 
very interesting figure pain apps are
great<00:03:29.040> they<00:03:29.760> got<00:03:29.940> this<00:03:30.060> one<00:03:30.270> spot<00:03:30.600> on<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.110> only

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
great they got this one spot on the only

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.810 
great they got this one spot on the only
problem<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:33.480> have<00:03:33.690> with<00:03:34.050> these<00:03:34.470> figures<00:03:35.460> with

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
problem I have with these figures with

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.930 
problem I have with these figures with
these<00:03:35.970> joined<00:03:36.300> figures<00:03:36.660> is<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.760> half<00:03:38.760> of

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
these joined figures is that the half of

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.380 
these joined figures is that the half of
the<00:03:39.090> body<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.510> top<00:03:39.780> half<00:03:40.110> is<00:03:40.410> very<00:03:41.040> heavy<00:03:41.460> very

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
the body the top half is very heavy very

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.020 
the body the top half is very heavy very
dense<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.220> supporting<00:03:44.700> legs<00:03:44.880> are

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
dense and and the supporting legs are

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.110 
dense and and the supporting legs are
just<00:03:45.240> so<00:03:45.480> skinny<00:03:45.930> that<00:03:46.430> yes<00:03:47.430> they<00:03:47.670> will<00:03:47.850> stand

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
just so skinny that yes they will stand

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.670 
just so skinny that yes they will stand
up<00:03:48.830> for<00:03:49.830> a<00:03:49.890> while<00:03:50.690> even<00:03:51.690> with<00:03:51.990> the<00:03:52.110> base<00:03:52.290> they

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
up for a while even with the base they

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.140 
up for a while even with the base they
will<00:03:52.830> stand<00:03:53.010> up<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.400> without<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.850> base<00:03:53.970> they

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
will stand up you without the base they

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.850 
will stand up you without the base they
will<00:03:54.300> stand<00:03:54.510> up<00:03:54.780> but<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.200> problem<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:55.710> have<00:03:55.830> is

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
will stand up but the problem I have is

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.700 
will stand up but the problem I have is
over<00:03:56.280> time<00:03:56.990> some<00:03:57.990> of<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.200> weight<00:03:58.380> is<00:03:58.530> gonna

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
over time some of the weight is gonna

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.860 
over time some of the weight is gonna
shift<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.280> sooner<00:03:59.820> or<00:03:59.850> later<00:03:59.940> these<00:04:00.300> figures

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
shift and sooner or later these figures

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.930 
shift and sooner or later these figures
are<00:04:00.960> gonna<00:04:01.110> droop<00:04:01.470> like<00:04:01.620> that<00:04:01.860> what<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:02.760> think

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
are gonna droop like that what I think

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.630 
are gonna droop like that what I think
in<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.060> group<00:04:03.270> like<00:04:03.300> this<00:04:04.130> which<00:04:05.130> is<00:04:05.280> really

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
in a group like this which is really

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.040 
in a group like this which is really
annoying<00:04:05.910> which<00:04:06.150> is<00:04:06.270> all<00:04:06.450> which<00:04:06.690> is<00:04:06.840> what's

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
annoying which is all which is what's

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.690 
annoying which is all which is what's
happening<00:04:07.560> with<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.800> battle<00:04:08.070> droid<00:04:08.340> figure

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
happening with the battle droid figure

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.350 
happening with the battle droid figure
and<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.120> have<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:10.640> because<00:04:11.640> of<00:04:11.880> that<00:04:12.000> I'm

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
and I have and because of that I'm

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.460 
and I have and because of that I'm
actually<00:04:12.510> telling<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:12.990> just<00:04:13.170> bring<00:04:13.350> it<00:04:13.440> back

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
actually telling to just bring it back

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.940 
actually telling to just bring it back
into<00:04:13.800> packaging<00:04:14.400> but<00:04:15.470> for<00:04:16.470> Oakley<00:04:16.739> you<00:04:16.859> know

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
into packaging but for Oakley you know

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.710 
into packaging but for Oakley you know
you<00:04:17.549> have<00:04:17.730> that<00:04:17.880> option<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.390> can<00:04:18.570> actually

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
you have that option you can actually

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.240 
you have that option you can actually
just<00:04:19.020> lean<00:04:19.230> him<00:04:19.380> on<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.560> wall<00:04:19.770> it<00:04:19.980> doesn't

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
just lean him on the wall it doesn't

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.490 
just lean him on the wall it doesn't
matter<00:04:20.430> but<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.299> is<00:04:21.420> a<00:04:21.450> bit<00:04:21.720> disappointing<00:04:22.350> I

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
matter but it is a bit disappointing I

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.080 
matter but it is a bit disappointing I
would<00:04:22.650> have<00:04:22.770> wanted<00:04:22.950> perhaps<00:04:23.580> make<00:04:23.940> it's

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
would have wanted perhaps make it's

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.760 
would have wanted perhaps make it's
probably<00:04:24.600> because<00:04:24.840> of<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:25.050> design<00:04:25.380> there<00:04:25.680> is

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
probably because of the design there is

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.379 
probably because of the design there is
some<00:04:25.919> limitation<00:04:26.460> that<00:04:26.490> that<00:04:26.940> has

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
some limitation that that has

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.540 
some limitation that that has
has<00:04:27.659> with<00:04:28.409> a<00:04:28.439> design<00:04:28.830> of<00:04:29.009> the<00:04:29.129> legs<00:04:29.370> and

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
has with a design of the legs and

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.860 
has with a design of the legs and
whatnot<00:04:29.849> but<00:04:29.879> I<00:04:30.150> wish<00:04:30.360> they<00:04:30.509> could<00:04:30.599> have<00:04:30.629> made

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
whatnot but I wish they could have made

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.739 
whatnot but I wish they could have made
the<00:04:31.050> joints<00:04:31.409> more<00:04:31.560> stiffer<00:04:32.629> something<00:04:33.629> to

00:04:33.739 --> 00:04:33.749 
the joints more stiffer something to

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:35.869 
the joints more stiffer something to
that<00:04:33.900> effect<00:04:34.289> to<00:04:34.800> that<00:04:34.949> effect<00:04:35.340> so<00:04:35.580> that<00:04:35.729> we

00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:35.879 
that effect to that effect so that we

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.149 
that effect to that effect so that we
don't<00:04:36.029> we<00:04:36.240> avoid<00:04:36.539> these<00:04:36.779> situations<00:04:37.439> with<00:04:37.889> the

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:38.159 
don't we avoid these situations with the

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:42.619 
don't we avoid these situations with the
Detroit's<00:04:38.909> troops<00:04:39.210> and<00:04:41.029> really<00:04:42.029> really<00:04:42.419> quite

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
Detroit's troops and really really quite

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:44.059 
Detroit's troops and really really quite
impossible<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:43.259> keep<00:04:43.439> him<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.889> key<00:04:44.009> to

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
impossible to keep him the key to

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:45.800 
impossible to keep him the key to
understanding<00:04:44.729> it<00:04:44.849> for<00:04:45.029> a<00:04:45.060> long<00:04:45.240> periods<00:04:45.689> of

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
understanding it for a long periods of

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:46.219 
understanding it for a long periods of
time

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
time

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.230 
time
but<00:04:46.379> anyway<00:04:46.650> it's<00:04:47.249> still<00:04:47.460> a<00:04:47.490> wonderful<00:04:47.699> figure

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240
