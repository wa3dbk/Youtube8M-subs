00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
now I put unpack these onto the wicks

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.480 
now I put unpack these onto the wicks
folder<00:00:26.290> of<00:00:26.620> my<00:00:26.920> amiga<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:29.100> you<00:00:30.100> might<00:00:30.250> have<00:00:30.370> to

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
folder of my amiga and you might have to

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.810 
folder of my amiga and you might have to
go<00:00:30.610> to<00:00:30.640> show<00:00:31.000> off<00:00:31.180> high<00:00:31.420> office<00:00:31.720> to<00:00:31.930> get<00:00:32.320> it<00:00:32.410> up

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
because the s kick program actually has

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.079 
because the s kick program actually has
all<00:00:38.469> these<00:00:38.620> files<00:00:38.920> and<00:00:39.249> if<00:00:39.370> you<00:00:39.489> just<00:00:39.820> put<00:00:39.999> it

by a registered version of whd late and

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:41.080 
by a registered version of whd late and
I<00:07:38.599> you<00:07:38.930> know<00:07:39.080> you<00:07:39.800> probably<00:07:40.340> don't<00:07:40.520> need<00:07:40.789> to<00:07:40.849> do

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:41.090 
I you know you probably don't need to do

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.439 
I you know you probably don't need to do
that<00:07:41.349> straight<00:07:42.349> away<00:07:42.590> but<00:07:42.650> at<00:07:42.889> some<00:07:43.129> point<00:07:43.449> you

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:44.449 
that straight away but at some point you

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:46.209 
that straight away but at some point you
probably<00:07:44.599> you<00:07:44.930> can<00:07:45.080> have<00:07:45.229> to<00:07:45.379> do<00:07:45.560> it<00:07:45.710> do<00:07:46.039> that

00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:46.219 
probably you can have to do it do that

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:48.929 
probably you can have to do it do that
and<00:07:46.460> I<00:07:46.669> think<00:07:47.060> it<00:07:47.180> is<00:07:47.270> worth<00:07:47.449> it

00:07:48.929 --> 00:07:48.939 
and I think it is worth it

00:07:48.939 --> 00:07:51.070 
and I think it is worth it
