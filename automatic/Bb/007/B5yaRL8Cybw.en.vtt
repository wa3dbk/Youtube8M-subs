I'm Statia bliss and this is acupressure

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.660 
I'm Statia bliss and this is acupressure
for<00:00:02.460> your<00:00:03.330> lymph<00:00:03.659> nodes<00:00:03.990> so<00:00:04.410> helping<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.400> move

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
for your lymph nodes so helping to move

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.179 
for your lymph nodes so helping to move
the<00:00:05.839> lymph<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.200> body<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.770> lymph<00:00:08.010> does

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
the lymph and the body the lymph does

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.980 
the lymph and the body the lymph does
not<00:00:08.400> have<00:00:08.610> its<00:00:08.730> own<00:00:08.880> muscles<00:00:09.360> so<00:00:09.480> we<00:00:09.570> need<00:00:09.750> to

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
not have its own muscles so we need to

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.930 
not have its own muscles so we need to
stimulate<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.740> movement<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.580> help<00:00:11.759> move

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
stimulate the movement to help move

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.270 
stimulate the movement to help move
toxins<00:00:12.450> out<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.719> body<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:13.230> two<00:00:13.860> main

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
toxins out of the body so two main

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.230 
toxins out of the body so two main
points<00:00:14.549> are<00:00:14.880> actually<00:00:15.059> up<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.470> jaw<00:00:17.240> near

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
points are actually up in the jaw near

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.240 
points are actually up in the jaw near
some<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.600> your<00:00:18.810> main<00:00:18.990> lymph<00:00:19.320> nodes<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:20.160> we're

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
some of your main lymph nodes so we're

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.769 
some of your main lymph nodes so we're
going<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.430> take<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.760> first<00:00:21.000> two<00:00:21.240> fingers<00:00:21.480> of

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
going to take the first two fingers of

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.300 
going to take the first two fingers of
both<00:00:21.930> hands<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.560> we're<00:00:22.710> going<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.859> go<00:00:23.070> just

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
both hands and we're going to go just

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.300 
both hands and we're going to go just
underneath<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.420> chin<00:00:24.779> like<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.529> triangular

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
underneath the chin like a triangular

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.519 
underneath the chin like a triangular
shape<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.820> then<00:00:27.510> just<00:00:27.720> go<00:00:27.990> ahead<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.260> press

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
shape and then just go ahead and press

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.150 
shape and then just go ahead and press
right<00:00:28.980> up<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.429> underneath<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.929> jaw<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.890> it

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
right up in underneath it the jaw and it

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.729 
right up in underneath it the jaw and it
should<00:00:32.340> be<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> little<00:00:32.730> bit<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.030> tender<00:00:33.450> spot

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
should be a little bit of a tender spot

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.229 
should be a little bit of a tender spot
so<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.800> can<00:00:34.980> maybe<00:00:35.340> poke<00:00:35.670> around<00:00:35.820> for<00:00:36.149> a

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
so you can maybe poke around for a

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.940 
so you can maybe poke around for a
second<00:00:36.570> until<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.870> find<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.320> tender<00:00:37.680> spot

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
second until you find that tender spot

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.319 
second until you find that tender spot
and<00:00:38.219> then<00:00:38.670> we're<00:00:38.790> just<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.090> go<00:00:39.239> ahead

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
and then we're just going to go ahead

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.049 
and then we're just going to go ahead
and<00:00:39.570> hold<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:40.079> with<00:00:40.739> maybe<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.129> little<00:00:41.190> tiny<00:00:41.790> bit

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
and hold it with maybe a little tiny bit

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.630 
and hold it with maybe a little tiny bit
of<00:00:42.090> movement<00:00:44.420> for<00:00:45.420> about<00:00:45.660> 15<00:00:46.140> seconds<00:00:46.649> and

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.610 

when<00:00:50.640> that's<00:00:50.789> done<00:00:51.180> go<00:00:51.780> ahead<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.110> move<00:00:52.260> back

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
when that's done go ahead and move back

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.760 
when that's done go ahead and move back
about<00:00:53.039> two<00:00:53.579> inches<00:00:54.030> more<00:00:54.420> about<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.559> point

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
about two inches more about to the point

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.069 
about two inches more about to the point
where<00:00:56.010> your<00:00:56.160> jaw<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.850> making<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.510> little<00:00:57.750> turn

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
lymph nodes stimulated you just go a

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:52.499 
lymph nodes stimulated you just go a
couple<00:01:49.750> times<00:01:50.200> down<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.590> side<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:51.390> then<00:01:52.390> you
