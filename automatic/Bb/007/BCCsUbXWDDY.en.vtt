a much better flavor
they<00:02:00.090> went<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:00.780> iodized<00:02:01.439> that's<00:02:02.430> good<00:02:02.790> you

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
they went then iodized that's good you

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.850 
they went then iodized that's good you
know<00:02:03.750> when<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:03.990> cook<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.290> lot<00:02:04.500> in<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.710> kitchen

up<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:33.440> for<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.800> parsley<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.460> want<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.670> make

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
up so for the parsley you want to make

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.570 
up so for the parsley you want to make
sure<00:02:34.910> you're<00:02:35.090> using<00:02:35.210> flat<00:02:35.720> leaf<00:02:36.020> Italian

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
sure you're using flat leaf Italian

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.540 
sure you're using flat leaf Italian
because<00:02:38.110> curly<00:02:39.110> parsley<00:02:39.350> is<00:02:39.710> great<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.340> look

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
because curly parsley is great to look

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.360 
because curly parsley is great to look
at<00:02:40.760> but<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:41.630> really<00:02:41.810> has<00:02:42.110> no<00:02:42.350> flavor<00:02:42.710> and<00:02:43.250> what

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
at but it really has no flavor and what

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.070 
at but it really has no flavor and what
is<00:02:43.460> it<00:02:43.580> a<00:02:43.610> forty-nine<00:02:44.000> cents<00:02:44.270> an<00:02:44.450> investment

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
is it a forty-nine cents an investment

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.990 
is it a forty-nine cents an investment
it's<00:02:45.230> actually<00:02:45.590> cheaper<00:02:45.980> than<00:02:46.010> buying<00:02:46.520> a<00:02:46.760> jar

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
it's actually cheaper than buying a jar

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.030 
it's actually cheaper than buying a jar

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
overstuff them because they're gonna

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.410 
overstuff them because they're gonna

cooking<00:04:02.840> and<00:04:03.080> then<00:04:04.010> after<00:04:04.400> you<00:04:04.489> have<00:04:04.520> them

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
cooking and then after you have them

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.520 
cooking and then after you have them
like<00:04:05.239> that<00:04:06.070> what<00:04:07.070> I<00:04:07.100> like<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.610> do<00:04:08.080> is<00:04:09.080> just<00:04:09.350> make

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
like that what I like to do is just make

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.160 
like that what I like to do is just make
a<00:04:09.590> little<00:04:09.890> slit<00:04:10.459> right<00:04:10.760> down<00:04:11.750> there<00:04:12.020> at<00:04:12.110> the

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
a little slit right down there at the

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.670 
a little slit right down there at the
base<00:04:12.610> to<00:04:13.610> allow<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:13.940> steam<00:04:14.450> to<00:04:14.510> escape<00:04:15.140> so

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
base to allow the steam to escape so

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.560 
base to allow the steam to escape so
that<00:04:15.800> the<00:04:15.890> peppers<00:04:16.220> don't<00:04:16.400> really<00:04:16.730> split<00:04:17.270> and

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
that the peppers don't really split and

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.840 
that the peppers don't really split and
then<00:04:18.200> you<00:04:18.350> just<00:04:18.590> turn<00:04:18.830> them<00:04:19.040> upside<00:04:19.250> down<00:04:19.520> so

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
then you just turn them upside down so

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.600 
then you just turn them upside down so
it<00:04:19.910> keeps<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:20.419> whole<00:04:20.950> filling<00:04:21.950> that<00:04:22.100> geison

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
it keeps the whole filling that geison

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.930 
it keeps the whole filling that geison
moist<00:04:22.850> not<00:04:23.090> too<00:04:23.270> dried<00:04:23.539> out<00:04:23.570> that's<00:04:23.960> great
