00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
yeah it'll load faster maybe write

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.060 
yeah it'll load faster maybe write
better<00:01:54.689> than<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:55.829> it's<00:01:55.979> pretty<00:01:56.369> cool

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
better than that but it's pretty cool

it's cool that they added that yeah down

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.450 
it's cool that they added that yeah down
the<00:02:01.259> road<00:02:01.409> instead<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.890> trying<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.430> guess

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
the road instead of trying to I guess

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.030 
the road instead of trying to I guess
some<00:02:03.240> people<00:02:03.270> would<00:02:03.540> be<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:03.810> Becky<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:04.920> why

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
some people would be like Becky like why

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.920 
some people would be like Becky like why
didn't<00:02:05.250> they<00:02:05.310> launch<00:02:05.490> with<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.820> well<00:02:06.119> it's

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
didn't they launch with that well it's

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.900 
didn't they launch with that well it's
better<00:02:07.110> than<00:02:07.229> launching<00:02:08.069> with<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> broken<00:02:08.819> I

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
better than launching with a broken I

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.729 
better than launching with a broken I
guess<00:02:08.940> yeah<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:10.110> mean<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.410> their<00:02:10.530> prerogative

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
guess yeah I mean it's their prerogative

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.230 
guess yeah I mean it's their prerogative
but<00:02:11.220> they<00:02:11.340> don't<00:02:11.459> wanna<00:02:11.580> salesmen

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240
