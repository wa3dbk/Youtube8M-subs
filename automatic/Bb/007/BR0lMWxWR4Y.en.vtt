00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
that's the first place we go riding

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.580 
that's the first place we go riding
bigger<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.300> steeper<00:00:45.600> lines<00:00:45.780> means<00:00:46.140> more<00:00:46.350> face

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
bigger and steeper lines means more face

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.520 
bigger and steeper lines means more face
shots<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.070> more<00:00:47.190> terms

but<00:00:49.250> as<00:00:49.370> steepness<00:00:49.640> and<00:00:49.879> exposure<00:00:50.300> increases

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
but as steepness and exposure increases

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.400

so<00:00:51.350> do<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:51.559> consequences<00:00:53.079> it's<00:00:54.079> not<00:00:54.230> like
