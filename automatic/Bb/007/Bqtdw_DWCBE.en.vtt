00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 cool this switch now, many are playing 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.640
 in counter-strike global offencive 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.529
 and want to try your luck and discover 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.429
 casey or cases and I know that you this 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.410
 the topic is interesting 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.660
 so what is the probability that you 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.030
 hvk will fall out of the goal 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.650
 very expensive average of 40 to 400 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.199
 dollars that our money is transferred 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.390
 from two to twenty thousand rubles of course 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.210
 There is a more expensive but precisely these 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.099
 most often and fall out I will say right away that 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.439
 no official data on this 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.240
 the issue does not exist and the company in HP 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.949
 it is she who owns the steam service and 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.809
 many games including ks go 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.610
 keeps this information in the strictest 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.320
 secret and calculate probability 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.660
 knockout I will be ours 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.280
 favorite video hosting youtube because 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.300
 that everyone who has a knife wants to give them 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.040
 share with everyone 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.539
 and boast while youtube can 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.340
 provide such an opportunity 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.960
 all the more now everybody is shooting a video 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.789
 who's not lazy here is the basic information 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.559
 which you should know before 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.260
 checks can now proceed to 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.789
 counting and since I entered for 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.370
 beginning but also began to search for death video 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.190
 case opening in cs go pages in search 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.949
 a lot of results and about 25,000 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.860
 but adequate pages video 3620 video 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.110
 There are 720 videos on the page 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.630
 and now the most interesting how many people 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.950
 dropped the knife now the search query sounds 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.479
 so fell leg izgo 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.490
 but there is a problem 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.110
 most videos are fake like 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.600
 it says it's a hoax to get classes 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.189
 in this case, the views refer to 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.950
 social network hope you understand and 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.750
 We look at all the results of about 14,000 and 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.490
 page with current videos that is not 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.280
 just black screen or playlists 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.320
 namely video 24 which is quite a lot and 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.930
 again 20 videos per page 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.150
 480 videos can't you say and 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.250
 you will be right therefore we sift fake 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.600
 At first there were five of them on the page, but 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.180
 already on the second page their number 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.780
 half overgrown and eventually became 20 of 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.610
 20 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.860
 it will be a very rough count with 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.750
 results with large errors 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.369
 remind truthful video was first 18 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.070
 and at the end zero of twenty 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.079
 and so all true I saw I counted 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.030
 42 of 480 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.829
 according to such rough calculations 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.960
 without taking into account the difference in the number of pages 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.000
 percentage drop out of a rare knife item 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.979
 is just over eight percent 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.110
 but you shouldn't be happy because john is all 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.270
 errors and differences total percentage 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.580
 in possession of the knife was 3 percent then 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.590
 there is a 3gstar fruit likelihood 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.020
 what you get is also 300 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.390
 cases or attempts if the cut is worth 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.040
 Proximity 3 cases in one you'll find a knife 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.020
 but do not take this data for 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.849
 genuine for a number of reasons which you 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.560
 most likely you will write in the comments 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.510
 I repeat this is quite a rough calculation 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.610
 so try your luck but you can 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.860
 system bail out valuable loot remains and 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.019
 forever remain the secret of the company in 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.060
 someone from a thousand attempts will not drop a knife 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.160
 and someone from the first time can get lucky and 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.530
 when calculating, I did not take into account the different price 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.300
 cases and keys to them video if it were 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.300
 the honorable thing to be spent not less than 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.440
 hours 10 if you liked this video 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.180
 Do not forget to put the likes and 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.230
 subscribe to the channel it was a fistula not 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.910
 forget that official information 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.480
 practically non-existent 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.480
 I'll see you
