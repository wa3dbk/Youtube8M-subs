00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.830
 In that case, not my packet fresh 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.580
 in the world and the mum was catching up like that 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.530
 long in the sun 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.940
 I burned her face the same way 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.110

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.970
 need only when skiing that at 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.840
 Well at least you are that you are allowed 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.190
 but do not fly with one 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.870
 wrong types 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.610
 no my darling there is no other 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.640
 flight here has been nothing for hours 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.080
 more on 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:45.460
 you baby do not worry 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.460
 I have to have your dress doing this 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.500
 lucia where people in with you do you believe 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.010
 you can fool me 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:58.310
 will you be sorry friend 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:58.310
 non-smoking car 2000 132 km the 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.190
 war clerk okay 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.280
 Paul 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.690
 you need a code now you do me 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.300
 Nice open the door and move over it 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:18.040
 the place of the dumb cow a harmonious 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:21.700
 extras on a relaxed trip without 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.760
 special events on ours 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.210
 not messed up year with intake 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.210
 suffice 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:57.340
 I'd sleep at night below occupied 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:58.990
 season okay you've had a nightmare 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.850
 I'm always happy when the story 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.710
 you also get to the cinemas yourself 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.910
 somehow still experienced and himself 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.380
 I can remember that I am 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.790
 not six-year- old now who that 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.710
 everything is pretty much in the past 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.570
 but just this volcanic eruption with 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.640
 Iceland and no plane against more 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.660
 I think everyone has us 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.130
 somehow itself such a story 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.959
 either you do not get yourself in 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.610
 vacation flying or people on the man 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.900
 somehow could not wait 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.320
 That's how it came to me then 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.120
 me 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.650
 and as always when I cool that the 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.570
 in the story is packed and then 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.940
 Doctor very consistent with his road movie 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.830
 that is to say we see 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.360
 incredibly much that's means the 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.270
 most beautiful road movie even if you 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.220
 shit are just amazing 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.450
 many corners of the world to the man 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.920
 probably not in this life at all 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.510
 get more because I would have to 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.920
 Just travel all day 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.390
 made with you now but also like 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.080
 these rites i have these corners in here 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.580
 seen the movie 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.320
 that makes fun in any case and also 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.140
 the story itself is not so 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.239
 poorly conceived and I like 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.190
 basically the actors too 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.989
 unfortunately, but here are the characters 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.850
 accident at unsympathetic and then 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.320
 it does not work that way 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.810
 then comes relatively quickly in a 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.160
 imbalance and this volcano itself 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.019
 So it does not matter anymore 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.540
 you just still have it 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.610
 can talk about cool again and again 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.200
 this sometimes leaves the impression 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.820
 man wanted to have crazy title 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.500
 where everyone is totally crazy and 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.329
 funny at the ticket office a break off 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.889
 then to say the unspeakable 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.109
 cloud on if you already know 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.210
 next to it the feeling brings much more 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.849
 nothing and I would like to have more 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.229
 from having any subject in 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.539
 this trend remains a newly 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.069
 roadmovie of two have disappeared 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.840
 somehow get back together 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:34.610
 have to go around this damned trip 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.710
 doing in the case is but also 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.210
 Unfortunately, that's not a good idea 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.009
 save a complete movie 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.749
 the characters are just a lot for that 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.729
 too unsympathetic so they are easy 

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:45.650
 somehow you do not want that at all 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.539
 are traveling that's really grasp the red 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.490
 only how I make out for me to 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.919
 put the cart and travel with and 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.240
 laugh and be annoyed and with 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.370
 I want to hit it 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.289
 just to witness and he is there 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.449
 just completely above all things because 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.159
 I also name this volcano 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.449
 film already so that's really easy 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:04.520
 just so you can say 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.199
 At the box office that's crazy he 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.719
 now the unspeakable chilled 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.669
 volcano tip of the one you already know 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:13.819
 I would like to see that exactly 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.650
 because that's all the movie is about 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.999
 after that these contents with the volcano 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.770
 not at all with pure 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:20.629
 you could say yes well then 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.150
 take that only as a hanger if 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:26.089
 I really do that in detail 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.800
 with the entry you can then 

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:29.360
 even one or the other time there 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.919
 somehow pull the strings 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.389
 that's also in the story fits that 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.430
 I did not want to do it all in all 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.110
 just too shallow gags you have too 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.479
 already seen a hundred times now 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.800
 not really convince water for that 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.689
 Much more crazy is what you have 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.759
 actually made at that time as the volcano 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:45.349
 erupted i still remember i was 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:47.270
 in berlin did not come back and 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:50.060
 had to be in a completely crowded ic 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.449
 four and a half hours stand and guess 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.589
 Who else has failed, of course, the 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:56.539
 Air conditioning a nice trip 

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:58.099
 stratmann your experience in any case 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:59.779
 below in the comments 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:01.460
 because that makes more sense in any case 

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:02.750
 what has to write in the comments 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.449
 nevertheless to look at this movie 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.699
 my personal rating is this 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.919
 times next to it not so strong from the 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:11.919
 idea was definitely cool implementation 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.819
 at the end then not optimal 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.800
 below average four out of ten 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:16.909
 scores for fans and dany boon makes it 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.800
 certainly in every case makes sense 

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:21.229
 the thing to look at otherwise waiting 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.149
 but until sometime in summer cinema im 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:24.169
 first runs right there he gets in two 

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:26.509
 or three years 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:28.789
 otherwise it does not make much sense 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:30.680
 for 18 euros on a weekend for 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:32.719
 but maybe it does 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.669
 another movie is like the wind 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:35.539
 he raises a new one of mine says everyone 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:38.960
 I link you here 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:40.249
 or if you are blockbuster horny then 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.199
 is there talk of me 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:44.240
 Transformers the current part 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:46.279
 maybe you see you there as he looks 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.990
 I 've been so happy 

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:49.340
 I even sunburn is worth it 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.139
 double and triple rhine to see if 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.550
 I also laugh a little bit and 

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:53.779
 to have them the feeling I want to 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.189
 every time press on the shoulder 

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:57.050
 Who does not want to click on it now ? 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:58.580
 I do not know who does not want to but 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.020
 still not subscribed to the channel 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.339
 we'll see each other 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.349
 namely soon with a new one 

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:06.279
 film criticism here with the film factory 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:06.279
 me the dominik
