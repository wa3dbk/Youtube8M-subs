00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
term is two days yeah I think that

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.260 
term is two days yeah I think that
drives<00:01:03.050> the<00:01:03.350> essence<00:01:04.309> of<00:01:04.399> sustainability<00:01:05.180> in

drives the essence of sustainability in
agriculture<00:01:05.660> its<00:01:06.320> most<00:01:06.500> most<00:01:07.009> operations<00:01:07.460> in

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
agriculture its most most operations in

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.400 
agriculture its most most operations in
farming<00:01:07.910> tend<00:01:08.330> to<00:01:08.420> be<00:01:08.509> long<00:01:08.780> term<00:01:09.050> thing<00:01:09.290> too

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
farming tend to be long term thing too

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.810 
farming tend to be long term thing too
you<00:01:09.470> have<00:01:09.830> to<00:01:09.950> you<00:01:10.039> know<00:01:10.130> if<00:01:10.250> you<00:01:10.340> say<00:01:10.550> winter

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
you have to you know if you say winter

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.520 
you have to you know if you say winter
wheat<00:01:11.060> it<00:01:11.240> goes<00:01:11.420> in<00:01:11.630> you<00:01:12.289> know<00:01:12.380> in

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
wheat it goes in you know in

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.109 
wheat it goes in you know in
september/october<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:13.610> you<00:01:13.670> think<00:01:14.030> got

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
september/october and you think got

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.030 
september/october and you think got
along<00:01:14.300> so<00:01:14.360> a<00:01:14.539> long<00:01:14.780> time<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:15.110> wait<00:01:15.259> and<00:01:15.440> do<00:01:15.800> you

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
along so a long time to wait and do you

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.859 
along so a long time to wait and do you
think<00:01:16.130> that<00:01:16.220> sort<00:01:16.520> of<00:01:16.549> long<00:01:16.790> longevity<00:01:17.600> is

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
think that sort of long longevity is

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.530 
think that sort of long longevity is
inherent<00:01:18.380> in<00:01:18.490> sustainable<00:01:19.490> businesses<00:01:19.970> it<00:01:20.210> is

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
inherent in sustainable businesses it is

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.180 
inherent in sustainable businesses it is
it's<00:01:21.080> an<00:01:21.140> important<00:01:21.560> thing<00:01:21.619> combined

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
it's an important thing combined

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.219 
it's an important thing combined
combined<00:01:23.000> with<00:01:23.090> attention<00:01:23.360> to<00:01:23.540> detail<00:01:23.630> that

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
combined with attention to detail that

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.230 
combined with attention to detail that
you've<00:01:24.530> got<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:24.950> short<00:01:25.369> term<00:01:25.549> factors<00:01:26.030> which

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
you've got the short term factors which

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.270 
you've got the short term factors which
are<00:01:26.360> there<00:01:26.659> and<00:01:26.930> you're<00:01:27.229> aware<00:01:27.619> of<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.100> need

very keen on I'm looking at it is about

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.330 
very keen on I'm looking at it is about
long<00:04:25.169> term<00:04:25.410> relationships<00:04:25.980> it's<00:04:26.190> about

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
long term relationships it's about

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.670 
long term relationships it's about
making<00:04:26.910> businesses<00:04:27.360> survive<00:04:27.660> yeah<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.290> it's

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
making businesses survive yeah and it's

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.230 
making businesses survive yeah and it's
the<00:04:28.800> financial<00:04:29.370> aspect<00:04:29.760> which<00:04:29.940> is<00:04:29.970> where<00:04:30.180> the

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
the financial aspect which is where the

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.150 
the financial aspect which is where the
bank<00:04:30.450> comes<00:04:30.660> from<00:04:30.930> but<00:04:31.320> also<00:04:31.470> I<00:04:31.680> think<00:04:32.010> the

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
bank comes from but also I think the

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.230 
bank comes from but also I think the
relationship<00:04:32.880> that<00:04:33.030> you<00:04:33.150> can<00:04:33.330> build<00:04:33.539> in<00:04:33.840> trust

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
relationship that you can build in trust

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.689 
relationship that you can build in trust
and<00:04:34.330> integrity<00:04:34.810> and<00:04:35.289> to<00:04:35.949> make<00:04:36.130> the<00:04:36.280> businesses

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
and integrity and to make the businesses

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.939 
and integrity and to make the businesses
survive<00:04:37.060> and<00:04:37.630> make<00:04:37.990> them<00:04:38.110> sustainable<00:04:38.319> and<00:04:38.889> I

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
survive and make them sustainable and I

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:40.529 
survive and make them sustainable and I
think<00:04:39.160> sustainability<00:04:39.370> is<00:04:39.940> such<00:04:40.240> a<00:04:40.270> broad

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
think sustainability is such a broad

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.120 
think sustainability is such a broad
heading<00:04:41.080> that<00:04:41.289> you<00:04:41.349> have<00:04:41.650> to<00:04:41.770> break<00:04:41.949> it<00:04:42.099> down

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
heading that you have to break it down

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.159 
heading that you have to break it down
into<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.789> the<00:04:43.060> right<00:04:43.240> chunks<00:04:43.630> hence<00:04:43.840> you<00:04:44.050> know

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
into the the right chunks hence you know

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:45.809 
into the the right chunks hence you know
we'll<00:04:44.590> look<00:04:44.680> at<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:44.860> financial<00:04:45.310> side<00:04:45.490> and<00:04:45.789> I

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:45.819
