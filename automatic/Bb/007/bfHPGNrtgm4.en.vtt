00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
ah okay so it's pretty straightforward

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.070 
ah okay so it's pretty straightforward
pay<00:02:54.070> a<00:02:54.400> little<00:02:54.790> bit<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:55.000> attention<00:02:55.300> of<00:02:55.810> course

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
pay a little bit of attention of course

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.150

repeat of the first line or the

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.420 
repeat of the first line or the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
basically the end of the second line

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.580 
basically the end of the second line
last<00:03:03.790> measure<00:03:04.060> of<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.300> second<00:03:04.630> line<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:04.990> in

last measure of the second line and in

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.130 
last measure of the second line and in
the<00:03:05.770> last<00:03:06.580> measure<00:03:06.880> of<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.300> third<00:03:07.540> line<00:03:07.780> so

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
the last measure of the third line so

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.470 
the last measure of the third line so
there<00:03:08.350> be<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.800> beat<00:03:08.980> or<00:03:09.190> lose<00:03:11.970> they<00:03:12.970> both<00:03:13.180> land

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
there be to beat or lose they both land

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.120

and then the only other thing that might
be<00:03:33.620> new<00:03:33.800> to<00:03:33.830> you<00:03:34.070> in<00:03:34.190> this<00:03:34.340> tune<00:03:34.640> is<00:03:35.140> 1/2<00:03:36.140> C

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
be new to you in this tune is 1/2 C

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.880 
be new to you in this tune is 1/2 C
doubling<00:03:36.950> from<00:03:37.220> high<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:37.910> that's

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
doubling from high a and that's

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.080 
doubling from high a and that's
basically<00:03:39.890> happens<00:03:40.370> at<00:03:40.490> the<00:03:40.580> beginning<00:03:40.880> of

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
basically happens at the beginning of

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.900 
basically happens at the beginning of
the<00:03:41.210> second<00:03:41.570> full<00:03:41.690> part<00:03:42.020> so<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.640> very

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
the second full part so the the very

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.250 
the second full part so the the very
beginning<00:03:44.270> of<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.450> second<00:03:44.810> measure<00:03:44.960> of<00:03:45.080> the

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
beginning of the second measure of the

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:53.130 
beginning of the second measure of the
third<00:03:45.290> line<00:03:45.710> in<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.070> setting<00:03:46.370> that<00:03:46.400> we<00:03:46.580> played

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.180 

so<00:03:53.980> that's<00:03:54.250> see<00:03:54.490> doubling<00:03:54.790> from<00:03:54.940> high<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.120> again

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.740 

so<00:04:00.190> instead<00:04:00.580> of<00:04:00.640> of<00:04:00.880> course<00:04:01.150> when<00:04:01.450> you<00:04:01.540> play<00:04:01.720> a

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
so instead of of course when you play a

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.120 
so instead of of course when you play a
C<00:04:01.960> doubling<00:04:02.230> from<00:04:02.410> any<00:04:02.500> other<00:04:02.680> note<00:04:02.860> you're

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
C doubling from any other note you're

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.520 
C doubling from any other note you're
playing<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.880> G<00:04:04.120> grace<00:04:04.360> note<00:04:04.600> and<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:05.170> D<00:04:05.290> grace

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
playing the G grace note and the D grace

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.600 
playing the G grace note and the D grace
note<00:04:08.160> from<00:04:09.160> high<00:04:09.940> G<00:04:10.480> you<00:04:10.660> would<00:04:10.810> play<00:04:11.020> a<00:04:11.580> high<00:04:12.580> a

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
note from high G you would play a high a

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.540 
note from high G you would play a high a
grace<00:04:13.090> note<00:04:13.330> before<00:04:13.800> playing<00:04:14.800> this<00:04:15.040> needy

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
grace note before playing this needy

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.009 
grace note before playing this needy
grace<00:04:15.760> note<00:04:16.000> to<00:04:16.180> C<00:04:18.180> but<00:04:19.180> from<00:04:19.390> high<00:04:19.540> a<00:04:19.570> you<00:04:19.750> can

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
grace note to C but from high a you can

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.750 
grace note to C but from high a you can
only<00:04:20.140> play<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.560> D<00:04:20.680> grace<00:04:20.890> note<00:04:21.130> so<00:04:21.310> it<00:04:21.400> becomes

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
only play the D grace note so it becomes

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.760 
only play the D grace note so it becomes
a<00:04:22.030> half<00:04:22.300> doubling<00:04:25.470> those<00:04:26.470> are<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.680> only

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
a half doubling those are the only

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.320 
a half doubling those are the only
things<00:04:27.070> of<00:04:27.280> real<00:04:27.430> note<00:04:27.640> in<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.940> tune<00:04:28.120> it's

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
things of real note in the tune it's

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.240 
things of real note in the tune it's
pretty<00:04:28.540> straightforward<00:04:28.890> let<00:04:29.890> me<00:04:30.010> go<00:04:30.130> ahead

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
pretty straightforward let me go ahead

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.040 
pretty straightforward let me go ahead
and<00:04:30.370> give<00:04:30.669> you<00:04:30.850> just<00:04:31.419> a<00:04:31.510> run<00:04:31.690> through<00:04:31.870> the

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
and give you just a run through the

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.110 
and give you just a run through the
first<00:04:32.200> couple<00:04:32.410> lines<00:04:32.770> at<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.370> tempo<00:04:33.760> at<00:04:33.940> which

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
first couple lines at the tempo at which

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.270 
first couple lines at the tempo at which
our<00:04:34.660> band<00:04:35.050> plays<00:04:35.350> it<00:04:35.560> just<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.830> give<00:04:35.950> you<00:04:36.070> some

toward<00:04:38.080> one<00:04:39.000> two<00:04:40.000> three

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.190 

okay<00:05:02.180> so<00:05:02.240> that's<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:02.600> tempo<00:05:02.900> you<00:05:02.990> want<00:05:03.140> to

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
okay so that's the tempo you want to

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.260 
okay so that's the tempo you want to
work<00:05:03.320> toward<00:05:03.620> it's<00:05:03.860> not<00:05:04.040> a<00:05:04.070> it<00:05:04.640> doesn't<00:05:05.030> feel

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
work toward it's not a it doesn't feel

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.850 
work toward it's not a it doesn't feel
like<00:05:05.480> a<00:05:05.540> fast<00:05:05.870> tune<00:05:06.110> it's<00:05:06.320> a<00:05:06.380> nice<00:05:06.560> sort<00:05:06.800> of

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
like a fast tune it's a nice sort of

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.820
