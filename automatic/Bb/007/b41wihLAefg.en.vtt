 in london and german chancellor angels 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.420
 Merkel awaits a truly royal welcome 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.639
 according to the foreign minister were 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.889
 we haiga merkel the most important partner 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.989
 Great Britain 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.940
 interested in EU reform and 1 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:18.130
 German Chancellor who turned to 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.780
 both houses of parliament are not at all 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.400
 compare with a modest pub lunch 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.890
 david cameron 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.570
 for Francois Holland in January it looks like 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.430
 london makes every effort to 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.770
 enlist the support of Germany 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.900
 with great influence with for 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.659
 redefining your relationship with brussels in 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.850
 the end angel merkel no doubt 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:39.280
 doesn't see europe without uk u 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.980
 both sides have reason to reach 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.019
 mutually beneficial agreements then 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.719
 specifically cameron wants to achieve for 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.999
 uk reduction immigration 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.579
 possible by imposing restrictions on 

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:53.620
 the number of workers arriving from s and on 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.839
 requests for payment of benefits to migrants 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.969
 he is also interested in guarantees of freedom 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.219
 London from financial control with 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.769
 EU side and return some 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.550
 powers to the british parliament but 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.660
 questions that I want from instead 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.910
 uk will get certain 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.610
 benefits but you understand not just 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:16.000
 so in exchange she herself will have to go on 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.980
 any concessions amid all this 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.910
 clutter some call a little 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.800
 temper the heat 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.600
 mid uk several times 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.850
 urged the government not to forget that 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.220
 any changes will require consent 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.110
 all EU countries and that Germany 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.920
 naturally will not go against their 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.170
 interests not so long ago the minister 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.760
 Germany's foreign affairs again suggested 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.950
 impose a tax on financial transactions 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.660
 which can get by British 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.350
 depositors of three and a half billion 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.540
 pounds 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.000
 we now have certain 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.680
 arrangements but apparently long term 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.540
 strategy will be quite different from 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.970
 uk all over the world have 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.920
 many friends on whom she should 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.080
 you should not concentrate 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.350
 dwell with s should 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.570
 collaborate with countries around the world 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.210
 vacation money olympian 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.610
 and in the end it all comes down to what 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.860
 someone wants a small piece of Europe and 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.930
 someone a bit much bigger 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.930
