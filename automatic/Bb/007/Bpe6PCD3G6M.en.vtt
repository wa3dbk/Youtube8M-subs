00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello, I'm a pearl, and I 'll give you 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 one more tip of beauty for the planet in 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.400
 this time we are going to make some puppets 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.530
 for finger 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.990
 first let's use some piece 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.020
 you have cardboard out there and what 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.120
 you're going to do is mark your finger you're going to 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.700
 put the outline of your finger so that 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.890
 stay in this way later you go 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.220
 to mark approximately two centimeters 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.380
 around your finger and you already have your 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.110
 mold to make many of the puppets 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.390
 now let's use a little bit of 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.489
 felt there what you find is 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.440
 father to use felt cloth good 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.059
 make it a little textile paint 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.710
 hot silicone scissors thread needle and 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.630
 also then a rule by any 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.120
 thing the first thing we 're going to do 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:53.160
 is to take 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.940
 and I'm going to make a finger puppet of chang 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.940
 short, I'm going to mark 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.500
 all the contour 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.950
 also what you can do is with a 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.560
 pin join two pieces of the 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.450
 Felt I recommend you more filter because 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.270
 it's easier to handle but you can use 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.750
 any other fabric some jeans that already 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.310
 serve us to reuse it here 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.310
 remember that nothing is wasted 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.640
 there we have one cut and we are going to cut 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.870
 remember for easier cuts a 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:44.990
 little picture and then you're already doing 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.990
 good contours you're going to cut 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.390
 in such a way that they remain the same 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.179
 and then what we're going to do is make 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.600
 well the legs of the monkey and the 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.950
 super tail this because it occurred to me 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.399
 make a monkey, but it's also a 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.080
 monster a lady a lady very 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.680
 in love 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.680
 now let's do 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.240
 the arms of the chaco 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.720
 what I do to make the 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.390
 arms and that remain the same is how 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.599
 if you want to make them look good 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:29.090
 right what you can do is put 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.090
 a pin to make it easier to mark 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.140
 since we finished cutting the arms and 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.460
 the monkey's tail we are going to put a 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:41.240
 some silicon where we glue 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:44.080
 for example there goes one of the arms 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.970
 and the hotel cava 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.110
 and now let's stick the tail on 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.800
 monkey 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.800
 over here 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.850
 and then we're going to put the other one 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.870
 piece of cloth 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:05.950
 and now we are going to sew all the contour 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:10.540
 very easy so let's make graffiti 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.540
 simple nothing complicated please 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.530
 and since we finished what we are going to do 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.840
 is to put a knot here 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.090
 we cut the excess thread 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.620
 and now we have the body now what I'm going 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.870
 to do is hit the head 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.000
 and good as I told you this I already had it 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.110
 out there I liked how to do something 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.440
 with the 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.400
 and ready 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.550
 we put him here and there is our 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.220
 cylinder changuitos not as they say 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.710
 hi how are you and here is the 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.430
 benito monster 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.430
 children 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.860
 I'm Natalia Perez and this was a kind of 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.860
 beauty for you
