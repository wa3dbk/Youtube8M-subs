times<00:00:46.530> we've<00:00:47.250> cooked<00:00:47.550> sweet<00:00:47.820> potatoes<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.239> a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
times we've cooked sweet potatoes in a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.350 
times we've cooked sweet potatoes in a
pan<00:00:48.510> they<00:00:48.930> cook<00:00:49.170> very<00:00:49.590> very<00:00:50.070> rapidly<00:00:50.610> um<00:00:50.940> same

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
pan they cook very very rapidly um same

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.119 
pan they cook very very rapidly um same
thing<00:00:51.510> when<00:00:51.629> boiling<00:00:51.840> they<00:00:52.410> will<00:00:52.590> cook<00:00:52.800> very

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
thing when boiling they will cook very

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.500 
thing when boiling they will cook very
very<00:00:53.399> quickly<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:53.910> you're<00:00:54.059> not<00:00:54.120> waiting<00:00:54.360> for

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
very quickly so you're not waiting for

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.389 
very quickly so you're not waiting for
20<00:00:54.899> or<00:00:55.020> 30<00:00:55.260> minutes<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.710> only<00:00:55.829> takes<00:00:56.039> about<00:00:56.129> 10

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
20 or 30 minutes it only takes about 10

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.670 
20 or 30 minutes it only takes about 10
minutes<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.730> smash<00:00:57.329> these<00:00:57.629> up<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.109> or<00:00:58.469> boil

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
minutes to smash these up and or boil

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.020 
minutes to smash these up and or boil
them<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:58.920> then<00:00:59.010> smash<00:00:59.489> them<00:00:59.670> up<00:00:59.730> real<00:00:59.879> quick

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
them and then smash them up real quick

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.299 
them and then smash them up real quick
so<00:01:00.390> we've<00:01:00.510> got<00:01:00.660> our<00:01:00.780> potatoes<00:01:00.899> we're<00:01:01.800> adding<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
so we've got our potatoes we're adding a

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.530 
so we've got our potatoes we're adding a
little<00:01:02.910> bit<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.359> garlic<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:04.880> little<00:01:05.880> bit<00:01:06.210> of

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
little bit of garlic a little bit of

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.190 
little bit of garlic a little bit of
salt<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:08.330> just<00:01:09.330> think<00:01:09.479> if<00:01:09.600> we're<00:01:09.750> usually<00:01:09.900> if

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
salt I just think if we're usually if

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.870 
salt I just think if we're usually if
we're<00:01:10.320> using<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.680> canned<00:01:10.920> just<00:01:11.430> imagine<00:01:11.820> how

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
we're using the canned just imagine how

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.910 
we're using the canned just imagine how
much<00:01:11.970> more<00:01:12.119> sodium<00:01:12.420> well<00:01:12.810> okay<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.439> it's

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
much more sodium well okay so it's

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.580 
much more sodium well okay so it's
slightly<00:01:14.189> better<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.880> what<00:01:15.060> you're<00:01:15.180> saying

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
slightly better is what you're saying

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.499 
slightly better is what you're saying
exactly<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:17.430> your<00:01:17.580> case<00:01:17.820> there<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.360> that

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
exactly like your case there like that

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.960 
exactly like your case there like that
yeah<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:19.220> certainly<00:01:20.220> wouldn't<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.759> good

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
yeah I certainly wouldn't be a good

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.190 
yeah I certainly wouldn't be a good
lawyer<00:01:21.150> what<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.479> am<00:01:21.630> not<00:01:21.780> making<00:01:21.930> I'm<00:01:22.049> not

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
lawyer what I am not making I'm not

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.399 
lawyer what I am not making I'm not
making<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.500> very<00:01:22.619> good<00:01:22.799> argument<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.250> have

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
making a very good argument to have

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.219 
making a very good argument to have
whole<00:01:25.409> grain<00:01:26.159> flour<00:01:26.640> yes<00:01:27.390> very<00:01:27.810> good<00:01:28.020> because

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
whole grain flour yes very good because

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.660 
whole grain flour yes very good because
of<00:01:28.530> course<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.920> white<00:01:29.100> will<00:01:29.280> increase<00:01:29.549> your

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
of course the white will increase your

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.160 
of course the white will increase your
blood<00:01:29.850> sugar<00:01:30.090> level<00:01:30.360> quickly<00:01:30.509> we<00:01:30.810> don't<00:01:30.960> want

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
blood sugar level quickly we don't want

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.260 
blood sugar level quickly we don't want
that<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.890> whole<00:01:32.040> grain<00:01:32.280> will<00:01:32.640> not<00:01:32.850> because<00:01:33.240> of

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
that the whole grain will not because of

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.359 
that the whole grain will not because of
the<00:01:33.479> fiber<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:34.110> releases<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.860> sugar<00:01:35.100> over

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
the fiber it releases the sugar over

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.179 
the fiber it releases the sugar over
time<00:01:35.729> I'm<00:01:36.540> using<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.079> as<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.650> binding<00:01:38.040> agent

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
time I'm using this as a binding agent

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.340 
time I'm using this as a binding agent
for<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.939> potatoes<00:01:39.600> because<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.110> want<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.290> to

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
for the potatoes because we want it to

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.109 
for the potatoes because we want it to
hold<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.680> gutter<00:01:40.829> like<00:01:41.100> up<00:01:41.280> again<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> nice

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
legitimate question because a lot of

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.089 
legitimate question because a lot of
folks<00:02:40.870> ask<00:02:41.080> me<00:02:41.200> that<00:02:41.349> they<00:02:41.500> say<00:02:41.620> well<00:02:41.769> what

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
folks ask me that they say well what

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.710 
folks ask me that they say well what
does<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.250> matter<00:02:42.340> if<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:42.730> only<00:02:42.970> absorb<00:02:43.390> 70

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
does it matter if I only absorb 70

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.210 
does it matter if I only absorb 70
percent<00:02:44.019> or<00:02:44.110> 20<00:02:44.319> percent<00:02:44.349> obviously<00:02:44.799> you<00:02:45.069> want

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
percent or 20 percent obviously you want

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.530 
percent or 20 percent obviously you want
to<00:02:45.280> get<00:02:45.370> as<00:02:45.459> much<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:45.819> actually<00:02:46.209> into<00:02:46.420> your

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
to get as much of it actually into your

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.820 
to get as much of it actually into your
body<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:46.989> think<00:02:47.080> that's<00:02:47.319> a<00:02:47.410> mistake<00:02:47.500> where<00:02:47.799> a

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
body I think that's a mistake where a

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.440 
body I think that's a mistake where a
lot<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:48.010> people<00:02:48.220> think<00:02:48.459> that<00:02:48.610> they<00:02:49.120> eat<00:02:49.299> a

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
lot of people think that they eat a

steak and it's high in protein they're

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.559 
steak and it's high in protein they're
getting<00:02:51.549> a<00:02:51.640> hundred<00:02:51.880> percent<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.239> that<00:02:52.329> steak

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
getting a hundred percent of that steak

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.120 
getting a hundred percent of that steak
is<00:02:52.599> being<00:02:52.900> turned<00:02:53.140> into<00:02:53.290> something<00:02:53.680> no<00:02:53.829> no
