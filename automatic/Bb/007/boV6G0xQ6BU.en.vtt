00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.020 
tested it out with some movies and had a
lot<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.600> fun<00:02:30.780> cranking<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.500> up<00:02:31.590> also<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.850> type

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
lot of fun cranking it up also the type

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.910 
lot of fun cranking it up also the type
of<00:02:33.060> amp<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:33.780> use<00:02:33.990> with<00:02:34.170> these<00:02:34.350> is<00:02:34.680> going

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
of amp that you use with these is going

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.820 
of amp that you use with these is going
to<00:02:35.270> create<00:02:36.270> tremendous<00:02:37.700> difference<00:02:38.700> in<00:02:38.970> the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
to create tremendous difference in the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.710 
to create tremendous difference in the
quality<00:02:40.830> of<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.370> sound<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:41.910> you're<00:02:42.600> going

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
quality of the sound that you're going

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.810 
quality of the sound that you're going
to<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.870> able<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.110> get<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:44.070> so<00:02:44.550> I'd<00:02:44.640> recommend

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
to be able to get and so I'd recommend

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.020 
to be able to get and so I'd recommend
getting<00:02:45.209> a<00:02:45.390> really<00:02:45.570> good<00:02:45.780> amp<00:02:46.400> for<00:02:47.400> these<00:02:47.550> the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
getting a really good amp for these the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.240 
getting a really good amp for these the
one<00:02:48.209> thing<00:02:48.480> up<00:02:49.470> here<00:02:50.090> this<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.800> fabric<00:02:52.800> and

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
one thing up here this is fabric and

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.110 
one thing up here this is fabric and
then<00:02:54.800> there's<00:02:55.800> little<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.489> can<00:02:56.880> feel<00:02:57.090> that

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
then there's little you can feel that

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.509 
then there's little you can feel that
you<00:02:57.720> know<00:02:57.810> it's<00:02:57.959> for<00:02:58.370> ventilation<00:02:59.370> and

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
you know it's for ventilation and

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.150 
you know it's for ventilation and
letting<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.720> air<00:03:00.840> out<00:03:00.870> whatever<00:03:01.530> but<00:03:01.830> this<00:03:01.980> is

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
letting the air out whatever but this is

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.949 
letting the air out whatever but this is
this<00:03:02.340> will<00:03:02.459> get<00:03:02.640> dusty<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.390> you'll<00:03:03.720> just<00:03:03.780> want

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
this will get dusty so you'll just want

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.479 
this will get dusty so you'll just want
to<00:03:04.080> keep<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.290> in<00:03:04.440> mind<00:03:04.739> that<00:03:05.519> you'll<00:03:05.700> need<00:03:05.850> to

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
to keep that in mind that you'll need to

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.710 
to keep that in mind that you'll need to
clean<00:03:08.489> that<00:03:08.519> and<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:08.940> goes<00:03:09.090> around<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.540> back

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
clean that and it goes around the back

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.840 
clean that and it goes around the back
