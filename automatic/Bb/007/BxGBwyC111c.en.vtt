00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 We present the novelty of the company racer in 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.550
 enduro 250 enduro motorcycle class 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:13.440
 today we will meet you motorcycle 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:16.770
 brand enduro 250 we see before 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.619
 a pretty durable plastic novel 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.330
 here is this motorcycle 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.340
 metal annotated boiled out 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.859
 shaped tube 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:29.420
 strong enough on this bike already 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.880
 you can make some jumps 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.660
 milka on these models is a flicker easier 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.440
 torsional than standard plug has 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.809
 preload adjustments 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.660
 control panel is easy to use 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.110
 and informed she does not glare in the sun 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.399
 easy to read has fuel sensors 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.350
 battery charge 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.239
 direction indicators 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.210
 show currently enabled 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.480
 transmission light indicator and naturally 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.300
 speedometer and odometer engine have this 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.579
 motorcycle has water cooling here 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.650
 but here we see radiator cap where 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.460
 poured ordinary antifreeze engine 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:12.689
 volume of 250 cubic centimeters very 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.630
 frisky pronounced lows so 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.490
 called motor very clearly 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.259
 controlled by a gas handle to drive very 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.360
 nice do not be afraid that you 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.880
 worried or something like that all 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.270
 very clearly everything is very verified there 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.790
 kickstarter so here we see the window 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.010
 to control the oil level 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.500
 exhaust system of this motorcycle 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:38.130
 there is no video here such schitochek to 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.620
 don't get burned chrome muffler 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.200
 loud enough too 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.440
 nice sound and you want more and more 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:52.740
 so fall asleep little pensel year back 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:55.700
 metal suspension but made in 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.700
 excellent quality 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.500
 it shows that the torsional stiffness 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:05.500
 very high on this model at the apiary 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.740
 already appeared progression that is it 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.410
 lever system connecting the pendulum and 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:16.209
 motorcycle frames also we eat here he 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:19.239
 shock absorber with adjustments here and 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.819
 here and spring preload and 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:26.080
 expansion tank with the possibility 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:29.200
 paging so that nitrogen or won would 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.840
 increase rigidity at work 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.570
 fuel tank capacity is 7 liters 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.970
 with a fuel consumption of three and two liters per 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.150
 100 kilometers is typical for this. 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.739
 motorcycle class tank capacity 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.989
 equipped with a valve to reset excess 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.040
 pressure 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.040
 formed during active driving 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.750
 on the left side of the bike we see 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.870
 trap type will not put these impressive 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.540
 size protection chain plastic like a 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.940
 all the motorcycles of this is such a cool 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.319
 nice rezinochka have it for 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.000
 fixing the bandwagon once sometime 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.739
 removed for rubber 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.709
 they buttoned you do not fall anywhere 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.319
 principle is a good thing 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.569
 protection front stars too in it 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.340
 there is a need 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.040
 pad speed shift 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.030
 it folds like this 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.000
 less 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.430
 llama tea when the steering wheel falls 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.769
 motorcycle 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.489
 made with a variable cross section diameter 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.269
 here is the video 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.860
 22 millimeters at the point of attachment he 28 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.739
 millimeter photodiode its harder 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.170
 when falling he will not bend he 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.870
 will always keep its shape yet 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.420
 such an interesting detail from the world 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.440
 motocross came to us this glass 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.720
 cap work mechanism 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.420
 gas knobs that is, we see here as 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:05.560
 walks asking for a wheel spinning it 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.090
 made so that you can always 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.579
 control in what condition 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.829
 is your cable that is vzlohmatil 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.959
 sleepy and evil missed you always here at 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.850
 surprise before your eyes breaking 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.639
 this node for you will not always 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.460
 or see we see the front disk 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:25.520
 brakes it is equipped on this side 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.889
 so boot anther thing enough 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.740
 less useful dirt gets on the disk 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.960
 less wear pads normal 2 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.340
 piston caliper 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.900
 normal disc brakes reliable clear 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.979
 reinforced hose is easy to dose 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.380
 steering effort 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.780
 control is very good the current generation 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.940
 Headlights today even though 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.399
 its small size is very bright 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.339
 light i think that 

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:56.879
 footboards and rear brake pedal 

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:59.249
 made in this form they are tooth walls 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:00.499
 and such is specifically made 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:03.089
 so that when 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:07.009
 sticking dirt you never lost 

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:07.009
 pedal contact
