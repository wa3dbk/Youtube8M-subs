00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
with no perks and this gameplay was the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.080

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
and the reason it was not on amp oh the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.769 
and the reason it was not on amp oh the
reason<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.050> was<00:00:25.260> not<00:00:25.500> on<00:00:25.680> amp<00:00:26.570> channel<00:00:27.570> was

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
reason it was not on amp channel was

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.390 
reason it was not on amp channel was
because<00:00:28.140> they<00:00:28.349> don't<00:00:28.560> like<00:00:28.650> demolition<00:00:29.279> your

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
because they don't like demolition your

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.189 
because they don't like demolition your
headquarters<00:00:29.939> as<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.179> guys<00:00:30.330> know<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.720> I

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
headquarters as you guys know and I

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.229 
headquarters as you guys know and I
really<00:00:31.470> just<00:00:31.500> disagree<00:00:32.369> with<00:00:32.520> them<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.120> I

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
really just disagree with them and I

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.970 
really just disagree with them and I
think<00:00:33.300> every<00:00:33.809> game<00:00:34.020> mode<00:00:34.230> should<00:00:34.440> be<00:00:34.620> taken

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
think every game mode should be taken

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.130 
think every game mode should be taken
seriously<00:00:35.340> whether<00:00:36.059> it's<00:00:36.270> demolition<00:00:36.660> or

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
seriously whether it's demolition or

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.470 
seriously whether it's demolition or
headquarters<00:00:37.770> or<00:00:37.950> search<00:00:38.219> or<00:00:38.550> hardpoint<00:00:39.300> or
