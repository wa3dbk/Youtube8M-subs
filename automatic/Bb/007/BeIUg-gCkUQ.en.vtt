00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.390 
film that it was much about getting the
chair<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.470> think<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.799> film<00:01:46.830> was<00:01:47.190> a<00:01:47.220> lot

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
chair and I think this film was a lot

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.520 
chair and I think this film was a lot
about<00:01:47.610> him<00:01:47.850> earning<00:01:48.240> his<00:01:48.390> stripes<00:01:48.570> lien<00:01:49.380> this

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
about him earning his stripes lien this

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.990 
about him earning his stripes lien this
one<00:01:49.710> he<00:01:49.799> really<00:01:50.040> has<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.369> prove<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.820> himself

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
one he really has to prove to himself

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.030 
one he really has to prove to himself
and<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.600> crew<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.840> he's<00:01:52.110> worthy<00:01:52.440> of<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.800> and

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
and the crew that he's worthy of it and

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.760 
and the crew that he's worthy of it and
I<00:01:53.340> think<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.270> man<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.630> usually<00:01:55.050> knows

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
I think for a man that usually knows

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.290 
I think for a man that usually knows
what<00:01:56.040> he's<00:01:56.159> doing<00:01:56.490> or<00:01:56.580> thinks<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.090> he<00:01:57.180> knows

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
what he's doing or thinks that he knows

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.330 
what he's doing or thinks that he knows
what<00:01:57.509> he's<00:01:57.630> doing<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:58.200> feel<00:01:58.440> that's<00:01:58.830> not<00:01:59.130> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
what he's doing to feel that's not the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.480 
what he's doing to feel that's not the
case<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> very<00:01:59.940> weird<00:02:00.479> thing<00:02:00.810> for<00:02:00.840> me

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
case is a very weird thing for me

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.700 
case is a very weird thing for me
