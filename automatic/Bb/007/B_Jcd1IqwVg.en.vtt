on this is some YZ I don't think so but
I<00:03:09.390> think<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.810> we<00:03:10.080> Bri<00:03:10.830> that<00:03:11.340> we<00:03:11.520> brought

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
I think that we Bri that we brought

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.360 
I think that we Bri that we brought
important<00:03:13.020> place<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.500> make<00:03:13.920> our<00:03:14.070> squad

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
important place that make our squad

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.199 
important place that make our squad
their<00:03:14.610> strong<00:03:16.430> not<00:03:17.430> just<00:03:17.459> inland<00:03:18.060> sea

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209

serpents the rostrum

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.130 
serpents the rostrum
I<00:03:22.940> think<00:03:23.940> that<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.150> always<00:03:24.300> must<00:03:24.630> expect<00:03:24.960> that

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
I think that you always must expect that

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.020 
I think that you always must expect that
much<00:03:25.260> an<00:03:25.530> item<00:03:25.680> will<00:03:25.980> be<00:03:26.010> arrival<00:03:26.550> because<00:03:26.880> if

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
much an item will be arrival because if

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.400 
much an item will be arrival because if
you<00:03:27.210> see<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.510> last<00:03:27.720> 10<00:03:27.870> years<00:03:27.900> they<00:03:28.350> were

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
you see the last 10 years they were

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.830 
you see the last 10 years they were
always<00:03:28.890> fight<00:03:29.220> for<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.550> title<00:03:29.670> so<00:03:30.270> maybe<00:03:30.510> last

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
always fight for the title so maybe last

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.960 
always fight for the title so maybe last
year<00:03:30.960> was<00:03:31.260> an<00:03:31.410> exception<00:03:31.860> but<00:03:32.040> this<00:03:32.250> is<00:03:32.550> a<00:03:32.580> very

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
year was an exception but this is a very

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.530 
year was an exception but this is a very
important<00:03:34.040> team<00:03:35.040> very<00:03:35.760> important<00:03:36.180> clue<00:03:36.360> but

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
important team very important clue but

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.710 
hope I suppose that this year there they
are<00:03:40.590> going<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:40.920> do<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:41.130> all<00:03:44.210> I<00:03:45.210> don't<00:03:45.630> think
