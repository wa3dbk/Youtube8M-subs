00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 have a nice day today 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.810
 Wednesday we are in the middle of the week 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.790
 also for the daily news of mister gadgets 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.349
 welcome to all news today 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.580
 main is definitely that of apple 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.890
 and ibm who announced an agreement 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.699
 strategy that in practice will serve the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.789
 ios and icloud development for companies 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.750
 I believe this is a market 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.279
 important and all in all that plan 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.130
 floor is left increasingly uncovered 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.300
 from blackberry that is moving back into 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.759
 this sector 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.070
 ibm obviously knows the solutions well 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.600
 software for companies at best 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.540
 currently than I can do in 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.510
 this time apple and 15 this already 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.350
 instead that should always lead to 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.530
 plus the iphone 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.829
 the ipad tablet and also the services that 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.210
 they come through the apple computer 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.039
 they are closer to what they are 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.870
 action needs we will see what 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.940
 will be the developments about 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.399
 apple ie news also of a new one 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.739
 battery for iphone 6 would have been 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.820
 found the new supplier for the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.739
 next iphone 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.080
 the battery would even have two 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.659
 millimeters thick 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.430
 I must say though that two millimeters of 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.560
 thickness which is almost 30 percent 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.650
 in less than the surface and sorry for 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.189
 global volume that usually has one 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.189
 battery that is around 28 29 mm 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.290
 in the other phones it makes me fear again 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.869
 once the autonomy will not be one 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.240
 of the strengths of the next iphone 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.729
 we will also see rumors on iwatch that 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.250
 would have two sizes and three models to the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.439
 launch someone even goes so far as to say is 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.479
 which will have a price around 300 euros e 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.369
 that will sell 60 million 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.520
 even within a year, too 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.600
 this is a fact that we will verify 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.140
 gladly started yesterday officially 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.840
 rollout of windows 8.1 by 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.360
 microsoft comes to the lumia version either 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.710
 on our phones with many 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.780
 innovations for those who still do not 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.790
 they had tried the de mello for preview 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.400
 obviously the most important 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.140
 notification center action center but 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.090
 then there is a whole series of news that 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.119
 it's about functionality and more 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.060
 species that will surely improve the 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.620
 your phone unfortunately for many 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.390
 models will instead be removed 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.230
 to choose google as the engine of 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.570
 research they will be obliged to Sivera 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.820
 use bing all in all I think 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.290
 is understandable on the platform of 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.470
 microsoft 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.960
 news for the management of htc that has 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.610
 brought two new characters that were 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.760
 already part of the management to do the 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.110
 supervision of the mobile department 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.330
 things are definitely better 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.110
 compared to the past probably still 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.450
 not as good as management and yes 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.940
 waited and then we'll see this thing 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.520
 will then lead into the practice of all 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.680
 days continue to grow 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.209
 applications for android were the thing about 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.670
 which you enjoy most now see 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.680
 also lg watch and on my wrist and one thing 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.090
 on specific networks the more francisco are 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.530
 so the appearance in practice 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.690
 clock 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.700
 yesterday a matrix key was released 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.140
 tonight, instead, a star trek key 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.630
 are very funny 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.100
 if you have a watch for your hands go 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.769
 looking for it taken in question are 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.870
 delivering even the first echoes and live 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.360
 the last thing concerns l gigi 3 because it is 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.750
 leaked the manual for the gigi three 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.130
 mini or lgg 3s exists there really exists e 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.200
 just a matter of time for the 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.480
 presentation then all in all mini for 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.930
 way of saying why there is a 5 screen 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.400
 inch 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.750
 we will also update you on this 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.060
 obviously we find ourselves on mister 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.989
 gadget or if you want at 13 to 20 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.170
