from<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.460> film<00:00:20.760> industry<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.570> really

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
from the film industry and really

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.589 
from the film industry and really
concentrating<00:00:22.890> my<00:00:23.160> efforts<00:00:23.550> on<00:00:23.730> permanent<00:00:24.509> so

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
concentrating my efforts on permanent so

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.990 
concentrating my efforts on permanent so
there<00:00:24.779> are<00:00:24.900> several<00:00:25.230> different<00:00:25.890> styles<00:00:26.310> or

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
there are several different styles or

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.210 
there are several different styles or
methods<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.869> permanent<00:00:28.259> makeup<00:00:28.439> but

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
methods to permanent makeup but

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.870 
methods to permanent makeup but
essentially<00:00:29.939> their<00:00:30.480> main<00:00:30.839> objective<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:31.880> to

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
essentially their main objective is to

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.170 
essentially their main objective is to
implant<00:00:33.510> pigment<00:00:34.290> into<00:00:34.470> the<00:00:35.070> dermis<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:36.120> you

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
implant pigment into the dermis so you

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.319 
implant pigment into the dermis so you
have<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.570> epidermis<00:00:37.379> which<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:38.010> your<00:00:39.000> first

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
have the epidermis which is your first

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.720 
have the epidermis which is your first
layer<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.899> skin<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.620> where<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.340> want<00:00:41.610> that

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
layer of skin and where you want that

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.139 
layer of skin and where you want that
pigment<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.780> go<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.170> into<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.850> dermis<00:00:44.850> which

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
pigment to go is into the dermis which

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.930 
pigment to go is into the dermis which
is<00:00:45.510> below<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:45.989> epidermis<00:00:46.859> so<00:00:47.430> essentially

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
is below the epidermis so essentially

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.189 
is below the epidermis so essentially
what<00:00:48.239> you're<00:00:48.300> seeing<00:00:48.719> when<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:48.989> see

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
what you're seeing when you see

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.279 
what you're seeing when you see
permanent<00:00:49.680> makeup<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.789> are<00:00:50.940> seeing

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
permanent makeup is you are seeing

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.139 
permanent makeup is you are seeing
pigment<00:00:52.289> through<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.859> window<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.340> skin<00:00:53.879> in

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
pigment through a window of skin in

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.660 
pigment through a window of skin in
other<00:00:54.629> words<00:00:54.899> i'll<00:00:55.440> show<00:00:55.769> you<00:00:55.859> my<00:00:56.010> own<00:00:56.160> tattoo

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
other words i'll show you my own tattoo

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.599 
other words i'll show you my own tattoo
a<00:00:57.300> tattoo<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:58.350> not<00:00:58.590> on<00:00:58.769> the<00:00:58.859> top<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.340> skin

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
a tattoo is not on the top of the skin

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.990 
a tattoo is not on the top of the skin
it's<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.750> dermis<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.920> essentially<00:01:02.670> your

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
it's in the dermis so essentially your

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.210 
it's in the dermis so essentially your
skin<00:01:03.300> has<00:01:03.420> grown<00:01:03.750> over<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.379> tattooed<00:01:04.920> area

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
skin has grown over the tattooed area

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.070 
skin has grown over the tattooed area
and<00:01:05.400> now<00:01:05.550> you<00:01:05.610> see<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> pigment<00:01:06.390> peeking

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
and now you see the pigment peeking

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.270 
and now you see the pigment peeking
through<00:01:07.440> so<00:01:08.330> usually<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:10.250> procedures<00:01:11.250> that

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
through so usually the procedures that

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.920 
through so usually the procedures that
we<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.790> do<00:01:12.060> with<00:01:12.840> permanent<00:01:13.770> makeup<00:01:13.920> are

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
we can do with permanent makeup are

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.070 
we can do with permanent makeup are
usually<00:01:15.930> brows<00:01:16.370> upper<00:01:17.370> and<00:01:17.460> lower<00:01:17.640> liner

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
it's an advanced procedure I highly

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.800

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
procedure we leave it on about 20 to 30

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.580 
procedure we leave it on about 20 to 30
minutes<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.250> after<00:02:02.880> we<00:02:03.600> open<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:04.170> skin<00:02:04.440> or

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
minutes and after we open the skin or

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.220 
minutes and after we open the skin or
make<00:02:04.800> our<00:02:04.980> first<00:02:05.280> pass<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:06.600> then<00:02:06.810> put<00:02:07.050> a

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
make our first pass we then put a

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.520 
make our first pass we then put a
topical<00:02:07.890> gel<00:02:08.250> on<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.479> has<00:02:09.810> further

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
topical gel on and that has further

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.949 
topical gel on and that has further
the<00:02:11.590> tizen<00:02:11.980> qualities<00:02:12.490> so<00:02:13.030> most<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.780> time

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
the tizen qualities so most of the time

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.410 
the tizen qualities so most of the time
when<00:02:14.170> I<00:02:14.230> am<00:02:14.650> doing<00:02:15.459> permanent<00:02:15.640> makeup<00:02:16.000> on<00:02:16.300> my

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
to stay ahead of the pain so a lot of

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.470 
to stay ahead of the pain so a lot of
times<00:02:29.680> it's<00:02:29.890> really<00:02:30.220> communication<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.450> how

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
do to address that but primarily I would

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.030 
do to address that but primarily I would
have<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.940> say<00:02:36.970> it's<00:02:37.569> very<00:02:38.230> doable<00:02:38.470> it's

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
have to say it's very doable it's

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.160 
have to say it's very doable it's
completely<00:02:39.940> tolerable<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:41.040> it's<00:02:42.040> not

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
completely tolerable and it's not

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.780 
completely tolerable and it's not
excruciatingly<00:02:44.170> painful<00:02:44.500> now<00:02:45.100> some<00:02:45.640> people
