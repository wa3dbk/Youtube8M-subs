00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
things a top viewport with 3 elements

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.060 
things a top viewport with 3 elements
which<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> cube<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.820> light<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:16.560> camera<00:00:16.710> and

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
which is a cube a light and a camera and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.370 
which is a cube a light and a camera and
in<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.670> lower<00:00:17.910> part<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.420> have<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.990> different

panels which are well the different
blender<00:00:22.170> options<00:00:22.560> shading<00:00:23.100> for<00:00:23.310> materials

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
blender options shading for materials

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.050 
blender options shading for materials
yeah<00:00:25.170> editing<00:00:25.650> functions<00:00:26.099> rendering<00:00:26.849> options

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
yeah editing functions rendering options

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.509 
yeah editing functions rendering options
editor<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:28.349> what<00:00:28.710> we're<00:00:28.830> going<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.039> do<00:00:29.220> is

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
editor so what we're going to do is

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.010 
editor so what we're going to do is
change<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.330> into<00:00:30.570> looking<00:00:31.140> into<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> more<00:00:31.859> 3d

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
change it into looking into a more 3d

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.440 
change it into looking into a more 3d
package<00:00:34.020> look<00:00:34.380> like<00:00:34.920> 3ds<00:00:35.340> max<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.910> more

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
package look like 3ds max a more

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.360 
package look like 3ds max a more

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
merge the top viewport with the panel

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.510 
merge the top viewport with the panel
the<00:00:54.719> lower<00:00:54.899> panel<00:00:55.379> okay<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.219> bring<00:00:56.399> your

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
pointer to this horizontal line where it

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.729 
pointer to this horizontal line where it
comes<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.670> arrows<00:01:00.090> when<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.140> when<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.620> have

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
split area join area or no header in

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.039 
split area join area or no header in
this<00:01:08.610> case<00:01:08.760> we<00:01:08.909> want<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.150> join<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.630> two<00:01:09.810> areas

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
this case we want to join the two areas

so click on join area and if you move
your<00:01:13.110> mouse<00:01:13.380> up<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.830> down<00:01:14.119> it<00:01:15.119> will<00:01:15.360> show<00:01:15.570> you

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
your mouse up and down it will show you

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.300 
your mouse up and down it will show you
in<00:01:15.960> which<00:01:16.170> direction<00:01:16.590> it's<00:01:16.890> going<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.159> merge

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
in which direction it's going to merge

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.670 
in which direction it's going to merge
so<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:18.000> want<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.570> top<00:01:18.810> viewport<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.470> merge

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
so we want the top viewport to merge

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.820 
so we want the top viewport to merge
down<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.580> bring<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.880> down<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.390> click<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.500> now

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
our top viewport is taking all the space

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.170 
our top viewport is taking all the space
next<00:01:26.070> thing<00:01:26.280> we're<00:01:26.430> going<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.640> do<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> same

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
next thing we're going to do the same

bring your pointer down over here where

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.370 
bring your pointer down over here where
it<00:01:29.340> becomes<00:01:29.640> two<00:01:29.909> arrows<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.479> middle<00:01:31.229> mouse

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
it becomes two arrows and middle mouse

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.100 
it becomes two arrows and middle mouse
click<00:01:31.939> but<00:01:32.939> now<00:01:33.090> instead<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.630> saying<00:01:33.840> join

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
click but now instead of saying join

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.230 
click but now instead of saying join
area<00:01:34.470> we're<00:01:34.650> going<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.950> split<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.340> when<00:01:36.150> you

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
area we're going to split it when you

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.539 
area we're going to split it when you
hit<00:01:36.360> split<00:01:36.570> you'll<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> vertical<00:01:37.680> line<00:01:37.979> so

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
hit split you'll have a vertical line so

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.399 
hit split you'll have a vertical line so
you<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:38.880> move<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.540> place<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.079> where<00:01:40.380> you

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
you can move it so place it where you

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.819 
you can move it so place it where you
want<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.890> split<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.310> area<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.150> click<00:01:42.649> OK

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
want to split the area and click OK

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.910 
want to split the area and click OK
so<00:01:44.310> right<00:01:44.490> now<00:01:44.610> we<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.329> top<00:01:45.630> viewports<00:01:46.290> so

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
so right now we have to top viewports so

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.249 
so right now we have to top viewports so
we're<00:01:47.100> going<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.310> change<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:48.149> viewport<00:01:48.810> by

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259
