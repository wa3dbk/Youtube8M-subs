controls<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.930> rock<00:01:16.049> which<00:01:16.170> over<00:01:16.380> my<00:01:16.500> TV

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
controls to the rock which over my TV

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.560

this<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.290> remote<00:01:19.530> control<00:01:19.979> for<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.570> DVD

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
this is the remote control for the DVD

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.840 
this is the remote control for the DVD
player<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.830> my<00:01:22.920> case<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> DVD<00:01:23.549> players

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
player and in my case the DVD players

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.999 
player and in my case the DVD players
cooked<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.509> way<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.470> remote<00:01:25.650> control

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
cooked out the way so the remote control

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.210 
cooked out the way so the remote control
for<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.189> TV<00:01:26.250> actually<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.860> sensing<00:01:28.860> over

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
for the TV actually and sensing over

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.780 
for the TV actually and sensing over
HDMI<00:01:29.400> using<00:01:30.180> CC<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.630> think<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.460> can<00:01:32.460> control

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
HDMI using CC I think so I can control

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.100 
HDMI using CC I think so I can control
this<00:01:32.970> now<00:01:33.210> from<00:01:33.509> here<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:35.570> using<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.689> TV

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.960 
this now from here and using the TV
remote<00:01:37.439> which<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.740> pretty<00:01:37.920> good<00:01:38.070> as<00:01:38.189> well<00:01:38.220> also

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
remote which is pretty good as well also

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.109 
remote which is pretty good as well also
when<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.360> switch<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.659> blu-ray<00:01:39.960> player<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.470> it

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
when you switch the blu-ray player on it

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.550 
when you switch the blu-ray player on it
TV<00:01:42.119> knows<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.720> change<00:01:43.049> over<00:01:43.439> and

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
TV knows and you can change over and

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.889 
TV knows and you can change over and
vice<00:01:43.710> versa<00:01:43.979> when<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.399> select<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.570> source

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.780 
here from the TV
it<00:01:48.840> lacks<00:01:49.320> leaching<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.130> if<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.250> switch<00:01:50.579> over

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
it lacks leaching so if I switch over

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.760 
it lacks leaching so if I switch over
here<00:01:51.000> from<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.630> Sky<00:01:51.990> box<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.560> blu-ray

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
here from the Sky box to the blu-ray

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.359 
here from the Sky box to the blu-ray
player<00:01:54.470> it<00:01:55.470> communicates<00:01:56.040> with<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.219> blue

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
player it communicates with the blue

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.950 
player it communicates with the blue
airplane<00:01:56.549> tells<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.570> let's<00:01:57.719> have<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.869> look

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
airplane tells it so let's have a look

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.670 
airplane tells it so let's have a look
at<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.680> Smart<00:01:58.950> Hub<00:01:59.100> this<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.610> apps<00:02:00.680> okay

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
at the Smart Hub this is the apps okay

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.600 
at the Smart Hub this is the apps okay
so<00:02:01.790> these<00:02:02.790> are<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.719> apps<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.460> you<00:02:05.460> can

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
so these are the apps that you can

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.399 
so these are the apps that you can
install<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.630> looks<00:02:06.810> very<00:02:06.869> if<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.170> look<00:02:07.320> at

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409

quality playback as well even of my
fairly<00:02:46.300> poor<00:02:46.540> broadband<00:02:47.080> so<00:02:47.410> that's<00:02:47.710> and<00:02:47.950> I'm

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
pretty nice and with it being on the

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.620 
pretty nice and with it being on the
blu-ray<00:02:51.160> player<00:02:51.190> I've<00:02:51.880> got<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.180> connected<00:02:52.270> up

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
blu-ray player I've got it connected up

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.840 
blu-ray player I've got it connected up
to<00:02:52.690> my<00:02:52.990> receiver<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.860> obviously<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.640> sound

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
to my receiver and obviously the sound

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.360 
to my receiver and obviously the sound
then<00:02:55.030> goes<00:02:55.180> through<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.480> receiver<00:02:55.570> so<00:02:56.110> that's

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
then goes through the receiver so that's

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.000 
then goes through the receiver so that's
that<00:02:57.370> works<00:02:57.580> pretty<00:02:57.880> nicely<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:59.470> it's<00:02:59.620> BBC

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
that works pretty nicely so it's BBC

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
ways through a cursor which I found

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.710 
ways through a cursor which I found
moved<00:03:33.580> pretty<00:03:33.880> randomly<00:03:34.360> so<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.170> I<00:03:36.570> find<00:03:37.570> this

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
moved pretty randomly so and I find this

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.790 
moved pretty randomly so and I find this
really<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.230> best<00:03:39.420> way<00:03:40.420> of<00:03:40.660> control<00:03:41.080> is<00:03:41.590> it

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
really the best way of control is it

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.590 
really the best way of control is it
it's<00:03:42.130> okay<00:03:42.459> for<00:03:42.519> a<00:03:42.700> browser<00:03:42.940> I'm<00:03:43.180> not<00:03:43.330> sure<00:03:43.510> how

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
it's okay for a browser I'm not sure how

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.199 
it's okay for a browser I'm not sure how
much<00:03:43.750> browsing<00:03:44.200> you<00:03:44.290> actually<00:03:44.620> want<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:44.920> do

devices which is their DLNA type devices
so<00:04:02.350> you<00:04:02.380> can<00:04:02.500> plug<00:04:02.860> the<00:04:03.459> USB<00:04:03.610> device<00:04:04.450> into<00:04:05.050> the

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
so you can plug the USB device into the

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.380 
so you can plug the USB device into the
front<00:04:05.410> panel<00:04:05.769> so<00:04:06.340> you<00:04:06.370> could<00:04:06.730> plug<00:04:06.910> in<00:04:07.120> an

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
front panel so you could plug in an

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.060 
front panel so you could plug in an
external<00:04:07.540> hard<00:04:07.989> drive<00:04:08.050> or<00:04:08.410> a<00:04:08.440> flash<00:04:08.470> drive<00:04:08.680> or

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
external hard drive or a flash drive or

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.220 
external hard drive or a flash drive or
whatever<00:04:09.220> so<00:04:09.970> could<00:04:10.209> find<00:04:10.420> files<00:04:10.690> using<00:04:11.170> a

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
whatever so could find files using a

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.820 
whatever so could find files using a
DLNA<00:04:11.560> server<00:04:11.980> so<00:04:12.310> I<00:04:12.489> could<00:04:13.030> find<00:04:13.330> a<00:04:13.660> file<00:04:14.560> off

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
DLNA server so I could find a file off

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.490 
DLNA server so I could find a file off
the<00:04:14.860> DLNA<00:04:15.310> server<00:04:15.700> and<00:04:16.450> this<00:04:16.780> is<00:04:17.049> so<00:04:17.200> this<00:04:17.380> is

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
the DLNA server and this is so this is

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.810 
the DLNA server and this is so this is
