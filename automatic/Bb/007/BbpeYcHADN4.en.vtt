00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.770 
the nice thing about this I just
realized<00:02:03.890> is<00:02:04.180> typically<00:02:05.180> if<00:02:05.390> you're<00:02:05.570> making

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
realized is typically if you're making

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.719 
realized is typically if you're making
leftovers<00:02:06.620> like<00:02:06.950> you're<00:02:07.130> not<00:02:07.280> going<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:07.550> have

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
leftovers like you're not going to have

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.490 
leftovers like you're not going to have
that<00:02:07.910> much<00:02:08.209> leftover<00:02:08.750> it's<00:02:09.080> like<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.229> little

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
that much leftover it's like a little

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.990 
that much leftover it's like a little
half<00:02:09.800> maybe<00:02:10.250> a<00:02:10.340> quarter<00:02:10.610> of<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:10.759> chicken

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
half maybe a quarter of a chicken

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.970 
half maybe a quarter of a chicken

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
broccoli if you're adding pasta now this

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.620 
broccoli if you're adding pasta now this
is<00:02:13.100> going<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.250> feed<00:02:13.490> a<00:02:13.520> few<00:02:13.730> people<00:02:14.150> exactly

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630
