00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
think as well because after the initial

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.660 
think as well because after the initial
hype<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:43.020> these<00:00:43.200> came<00:00:43.530> out<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.980> didn't<00:00:44.460> touch

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
them at all in my opinion they almost

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.290 
them at all in my opinion they almost
seem<00:00:47.129> like<00:00:47.309> Disney<00:00:47.610> was<00:00:47.700> trying<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.030> push

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
seem like Disney was trying to push

seem like Disney was trying to push
these<00:00:48.480> out<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.500> replacement<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.399> not<00:00:50.520> be

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
these out is the replacement to not be

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.979 
these out is the replacement to not be
able<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.879> do<00:00:50.969> as<00:00:51.059> many<00:00:51.120> play<00:00:51.449> sets<00:00:51.719> for<00:00:51.899> two

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.389 
able to do as many play sets for two
point<00:00:52.230> oh<00:00:52.289> maybe<00:00:52.500> they<00:00:52.649> weren't<00:00:52.770> able<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.160> put

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
point oh maybe they weren't able to put

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.100 
point oh maybe they weren't able to put
as<00:00:53.489> many<00:00:53.610> out<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.030> time<00:00:54.210> now<00:00:54.600> i'm<00:00:54.719> not<00:00:54.750> sure<00:00:54.989> if

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
as many out in time now i'm not sure if

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.299 
as many out in time now i'm not sure if
these<00:00:55.230> were<00:00:55.350> originally<00:00:55.410> pushed<00:00:55.949> out<00:00:56.160> like

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
these were originally pushed out like

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.770 
these were originally pushed out like
the<00:00:56.489> award<00:00:56.699> because<00:00:57.270> there<00:00:57.449> weren't<00:00:57.600> as<00:00:57.750> many

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the award because there weren't as many

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.959 
the award because there weren't as many
play<00:00:58.199> sets<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.590> two<00:00:58.739> point<00:00:59.010> oh<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.670> they<00:00:59.760> made<00:00:59.940> a

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
play sets in two point oh so they made a

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.369 
play sets in two point oh so they made a
couple<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.390> these<00:01:00.539> because<00:01:00.750> they<00:01:00.930> were<00:01:00.989> easier

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
couple of these because they were easier

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.500 
couple of these because they were easier
to<00:01:01.469> make<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.920> replacement<00:01:02.460> for<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.760> I'm<00:01:03.300> not

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
to make and a replacement for it I'm not

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.969 
to make and a replacement for it I'm not
sure<00:01:03.570> but<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.930> honestly<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.439> kind<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:04.890> it

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
sure but it honestly is kind of what it

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.380 
sure but it honestly is kind of what it
felt<00:01:05.129> like<00:01:05.339> because<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:05.760> definitely<00:01:06.180> didn't

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
felt like because we definitely didn't

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.000 
felt like because we definitely didn't
get<00:01:06.479> as<00:01:06.600> many<00:01:06.750> play<00:01:07.020> sets<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.470> two<00:01:07.650> point<00:01:07.890> oh

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
get as many play sets in two point oh

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.320 
get as many play sets in two point oh
like<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.369> did<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.610> first<00:01:08.820> version<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
like we did in the first version of the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.570

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
game maybe I'm in the minority but I

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.310 
game maybe I'm in the minority but I
definitely<00:01:11.880> didn't<00:01:12.299> play<00:01:12.540> these<00:01:12.720> near<00:01:13.200> as

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
definitely didn't play these near as

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.899 
definitely didn't play these near as
much<00:01:13.439> as<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.680> expected<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.220> once<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.610> started

has<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.790> replay<00:01:24.090> ability<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:25.380> it

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
has that replay ability to it but it

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.170 
has that replay ability to it but it
just<00:01:25.619> didn't<00:01:26.040> stick<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.580> place<00:01:26.790> its<00:01:26.970> did

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
just didn't stick like the place its did

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.640 
just didn't stick like the place its did
and<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.780> kind<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.020> felt<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:28.290> they<00:01:28.530> were<00:01:28.619> trying

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
and I kind of felt like they were trying

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.740 
and I kind of felt like they were trying
to<00:01:28.890> push<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.369> route<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:30.240> not<00:01:30.390> have<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.630> make

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
to push this route to not have to make

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.960 
to push this route to not have to make
as<00:01:30.840> many<00:01:30.960> playsets<00:01:31.470> maybe<00:01:31.770> I'm<00:01:31.920> wrong<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.490> don't

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
as many playsets maybe I'm wrong I don't

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.249 
as many playsets maybe I'm wrong I don't
know<00:01:33.060> right<00:01:33.270> now<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:33.659> that's<00:01:33.869> just<00:01:34.079> how<00:01:34.229> I

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
know right now but that's just how I

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.780 
know right now but that's just how I
felt<00:01:34.560> about<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.070> didn't<00:01:35.400> even<00:01:35.460> get<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
felt about it I didn't even get the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.550 
felt about it I didn't even get the
Disney<00:01:36.119> originals<00:01:36.540> ones<00:01:36.720> when<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.170> first<00:01:37.380> heard

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
Disney originals ones when I first heard

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.319 
Disney originals ones when I first heard
about<00:01:37.680> him<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.040> was<00:01:38.220> super<00:01:38.640> pumped<00:01:38.939> about<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.180> I

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
about him I was super pumped about it I

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.609 
about him I was super pumped about it I
was<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:39.450> oh<00:01:39.689> man<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:39.930> can't<00:01:39.990> wait<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.380> play<00:01:40.500> all

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
was like oh man I can't wait to play all

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.569 
was like oh man I can't wait to play all
four<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.890> these<00:01:40.979> they're<00:01:41.189> gonna<00:01:41.280> be<00:01:41.369> awesome

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
four of these they're gonna be awesome

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.370 
four of these they're gonna be awesome
we<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.299> we<00:01:42.360> play<00:01:42.570> them<00:01:42.750> over<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.079> over<00:01:43.200> again

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
we can we play them over and over again

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.889 
we can we play them over and over again
but<00:01:44.100> as<00:01:44.220> soon<00:01:44.310> as<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.490> got<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.630> opinion

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
but as soon as I got in that opinion

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.660 
but as soon as I got in that opinion
definitely<00:01:46.560> changed<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.159> quickly<00:01:47.520> so

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
definitely changed really quickly so

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.310 
definitely changed really quickly so
what<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:47.970> personally<00:01:48.659> like<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.869> see<00:01:49.140> these

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
what I personally like to see these

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.380 
what I personally like to see these
continue<00:01:50.040> on<00:01:50.220> into<00:01:50.520> future<00:01:50.880> versions<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
continue on into future versions of the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.960 
continue on into future versions of the
game<00:01:51.500> honestly<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.590> hope<00:01:52.979> they<00:01:53.159> don't<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.700> would

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
game honestly I hope they don't I would

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.030 
game honestly I hope they don't I would
much<00:01:54.149> rather<00:01:54.210> see<00:01:54.659> more<00:01:54.930> play<00:01:55.200> sets<00:01:55.500> or<00:01:55.649> shoot

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
much rather see more play sets or shoot

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.100 
much rather see more play sets or shoot
for<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.310> matter<00:01:56.490> even<00:01:56.700> more<00:01:57.030> toy<00:01:57.299> box<00:01:57.600> content

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
for the matter even more toy box content

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.389 
for the matter even more toy box content
because<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.469> can<00:01:58.590> make<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.100> toy<00:01:59.219> box

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
because you can make this in the toy box

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.889 
because you can make this in the toy box
and<00:01:59.640> they<00:01:59.759> can<00:01:59.880> just<00:02:00.030> push<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.270> out<00:02:00.509> as<00:02:00.659> free

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
and they can just push it out as free

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.569 
and they can just push it out as free
content<00:02:01.350> instead<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.130> having<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.340> buy<00:02:02.520> these

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
content instead of having to buy these

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.429 
content instead of having to buy these
extra<00:02:03.030> game<00:02:03.210> disc<00:02:03.479> people<00:02:03.840> could<00:02:04.049> potentially

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
extra game disc people could potentially

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.260 
extra game disc people could potentially
recreate<00:02:04.890> these<00:02:04.979> if<00:02:05.130> they<00:02:05.219> wanted<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.549> maybe

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
recreate these if they wanted to maybe

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.210 
recreate these if they wanted to maybe
not<00:02:06.509> as<00:02:06.659> much<00:02:06.689> detail<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:07.829> they<00:02:07.950> could<00:02:08.190> be

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
not as much detail but they could be

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.010 
not as much detail but they could be
redone<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.149> that's<00:02:09.300> my<00:02:09.479> opinion<00:02:09.720> on<00:02:09.929> this

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
redone so that's my opinion on this

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.170 
redone so that's my opinion on this
guy's<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.619> honestly<00:02:11.099> would<00:02:11.520> not<00:02:11.550> like<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.940> see

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
guy's I honestly would not like to see

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.590 
guy's I honestly would not like to see
them<00:02:12.330> continue<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.810> be<00:02:12.900> made

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
them continue to be made

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.000 
them continue to be made
right<00:02:13.750> now<00:02:13.900> we<00:02:13.960> have<00:02:14.140> no<00:02:14.380> clues<00:02:14.590> can<00:02:14.770> happen

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
right now we have no clues can happen

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.370 
right now we have no clues can happen
for<00:02:15.130> three-point<00:02:15.550> oh<00:02:15.640> but<00:02:15.850> me<00:02:16.060> personally

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
unless they take a drastic change in how

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.210 
unless they take a drastic change in how
they're<00:02:19.090> being<00:02:19.240> built<00:02:19.600> I<00:02:19.840> definitely<00:02:20.830> do<00:02:21.070> not
