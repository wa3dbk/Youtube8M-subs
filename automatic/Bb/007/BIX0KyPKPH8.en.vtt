00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.540
 olano vecillas and welcome to new 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.530
 word cloud today as you see Paul and 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.530
 titles I bring a luxury 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.469
 As you can see from the title, I leave one both 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.960
 and I do not know if you see well in the camera but 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.090
 good whiting wears a shirt that 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.950
 has a little cloud and good that captures me 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.480
 It seems super cookie so good if you 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.910
 I like to leave the little box in formation 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.500
 link where you can find the one of yesteryear 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.790
 some time ago he recorded an unboxing of a 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.559
 package that I received from the publisher 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.380
 b editions but good already it aggravated ma and 

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:34.630
 such and I could never upload it so I have 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.190
 as the 'thorn pinned' to record one 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.340
 in the pits from the other day I received a 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.690
 pretty cool big ocean box 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.670
 crossing that I want to talk to you 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.840
 because I do not know what the truth contains 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.280
 is that I think I know it contains the 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.080
 package because I've seen things out there 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.490
 but there's a lot of enthusiasm to open it here 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.950
 in front of all of you on the 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.329
 package not in question is this that you and 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.710
 well you can open it the other day but 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.460
 I said good, I better save it for 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.390
 do some boxing 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.390
 so let's go 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.730
 ok that's the box because they have a 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.950
 so I'm going to take some scissors 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.950
 because I do not think I can open this 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.950
 tiled 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.009
 ok I have the necessary tool 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.579
 for these things because as I am like that, 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.579
 I had it ready 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.860
 I want to see you first so 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.860
 make 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.760
 good 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.659
 when drinking 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.430
 ok to see send me the catalog of 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.720
 juvenile literature that I already have 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.720
 because they sent me a little 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.150
 this is the false side that is a story 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.210
 a kind of prequel to the dark side 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.740
 I have around here and well the truth is 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.750
 that they had sent it to him so 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.580
 I do not know, but that's very cool, it's very 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.399
 well the truth is told a lot to be 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.990
 barely 50 pages and good to those who do not 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.970
 you have read all this saga I 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.980
 I recommend a lot soon it's going to 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.160

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.160
 wild 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.629
 and the third thing in the package 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.580
 is the world of tomorrow that 's' the and 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.650
 which is the second part of angels 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.120
 fallen that I have over here that is this a 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.040
 book that I liked very much although with 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.599
 something of the angels that I do not 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.370
 liked the end but good that I did not 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.410
 it ended up convincing rather well 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.670

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.250
