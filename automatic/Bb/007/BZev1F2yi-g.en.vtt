00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
burned then I'm just applying some lip

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.040 
burned then I'm just applying some lip
balm<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:31.170> moisturize<00:00:31.920> those<00:00:32.160> lips<00:00:32.930> so<00:00:33.930> because

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
balm to moisturize those lips so because

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.299 
balm to moisturize those lips so because
I<00:00:34.200> don't<00:00:34.500> really<00:00:34.559> like<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.010> wear<00:00:35.100> foundation

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
I don't really like to wear foundation

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.639 
I don't really like to wear foundation
during<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.940> summer<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.450> like<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.809> spot<00:00:37.290> conceal

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
during the summer I like to spot conceal

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.130 
during the summer I like to spot conceal
using<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.160> concealer<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:39.690> think<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.079> is

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
using a concealer and I think this is

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.380 
using a concealer and I think this is
more<00:00:40.379> effective<00:00:40.860> than<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.219> using<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.760> tinted

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
more effective than just using a tinted

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.840 
more effective than just using a tinted
moisturizer<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:43.200> course<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.040> find<00:00:44.730> that

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
moisturizer of course so I find that

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.569 
moisturizer of course so I find that
this<00:00:45.000> method<00:00:45.270> works<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:46.020> best<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.379> me<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.460> I'm

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
this method works the best for me so I'm

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.220 
this method works the best for me so I'm
just<00:00:47.789> using<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.059> concealer<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.780> cover<00:00:48.960> up

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
just using that concealer to cover up
