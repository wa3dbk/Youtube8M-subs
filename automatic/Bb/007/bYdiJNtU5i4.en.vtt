00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello to all guys here from the king jack 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:10.040
 today we are here to review 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.040
 a special banshee store bunch in corr 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.070
 let's start with the review in 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.080
 this beautiful bouquet I was expecting from 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.680
 very much directly in the states 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.410
 united that we begin to observe from 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.570
 small box the box is all black with 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.359
 of the silver designs presents on the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.969
 make a logo with written thieves gene al 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.520
 pacis and under the smallest pierced by 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.010
 a katz fring arrow for station kraft 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.140
 the back instead of the little box 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.960
 also remember the back of the cards with 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.300
 the inscription engraved in two arrows and 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.309
 inside a circle with a rectangle 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.610
 inside that says Katz florinda 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.800
 both sides are the sides instead 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.719
 simply with writing 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.030
 I wrote on one side I find in craxi 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.230
 velocity guaranteed while from above 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.820
 crete the bel murphys magic flight test 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.220
 on the bottom instead we can see the logo 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.380
 of the murphys magic which indicates loaded 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.869
 they are of their production while at the top 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.580
 the written pacis we can see that not 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.799
 is a sticker because they are not papers 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.570
 of the us playing at company but of the 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.369
 murphys magic therefore sees no intervention 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.950
 they wanted to put then we go to 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.509
 open the deck and that once opened 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.909
 on the tab will present the writing 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.040
 safe lines we can see on the two 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.650
 letter designs and we can pull out 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.780
 cards directly cards there 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.909
 they seem strange enough to us that 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.259
 we are used to handling cards for 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.570
 make effects 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.110
 in fact these cats are pierced on two 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.299
 arrows that will allow a hiss one 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.240
 once the cards are thrown and there 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.670
 will indicate the rotation motion le 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.700
 papers presenting the colors a green and a 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.759
 red and recall the same design on the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.470
 back of the box there are 54 cards 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.909
 all with the same back and all 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.280
 obviously strangely with the same one 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.079
 make the face that contains so many 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.880
 concentric circles with inside the 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.560
 numbers and this and will indicate us to 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.560
 understand how much 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.940
 will be implanted in our targets 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.800
 so let's see what is the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.959
 main feature of these 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.510
 cards and why they are so suited to 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.890
 launch the main feature of 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.489
 these cards to the fact that they are made 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.670
 all 100 300 in plastic and therefore a 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.900
 unlike normal cards they are 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.120
 more resistant 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.340
 the idea is that which once the 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.890
 card is thrown if the card is one 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.349
 normal paper made therefore in the paper 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.569
 corners bend and dull and then 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.760
 they make the cards not on the saucer 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.280
 more in our target because sometimes 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.380
 don't even fly the cards in 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.930
 plastic, on the other hand, not at the corners 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.120
 cant ever be able to upload to happen 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.640
 but let them break but this is not a 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.470
 problem because the spinning of the bordeaux 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.599
 for example, the card remains the same 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.239
 and therefore will allow the cards to be 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:01.190
 implant in each case less after having 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.190
 having said that we are going to see control 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.580
 as you have seen the cards are a lot 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.590
 precise and especially they are so 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.380
 sharp resilient that implant themselves 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.480
 very easily in our targets 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.540
 so this is the review of the e 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.980
 banking sky sport rowing if the video there 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.890
 liked leaving that online 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.720
 write to the channel and then give a 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.720
 red and black jack channel jack
