okay so it's raining out so I'm sitting
awkwardly<00:00:02.760> in<00:00:03.240> my<00:00:03.389> car<00:00:03.659> trying<00:00:03.929> to<00:00:04.080> get<00:00:04.230> a

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
awkwardly in my car trying to get a

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.330 
awkwardly in my car trying to get a
video<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.920> this<00:00:05.100> so<00:00:06.000> what<00:00:06.720> I've<00:00:06.870> got<00:00:06.899> is

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340 
video of this so what I've got is

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.129 
video of this so what I've got is
there's<00:00:08.340> this<00:00:08.580> red<00:00:08.910> and<00:00:08.940> black<00:00:09.300> wires<00:00:09.690> right

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
there's this red and black wires right

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.129 
there's this red and black wires right
up<00:00:10.349> here<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:11.269> go<00:00:12.269> underneath<00:00:12.809> my<00:00:13.769> car<00:00:14.549> into

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:15.139 
up here that go underneath my car into

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.019 
up here that go underneath my car into
the<00:00:16.139> two<00:00:16.350> wires<00:00:16.680> that<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.190> need<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.550> connect<00:00:17.910> to

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
the two wires that I need to connect to

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.420 
the two wires that I need to connect to
unlock<00:00:18.359> my<00:00:18.570> doors<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.410> can't<00:00:19.710> probably

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
unlock my doors and you can't probably

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.769 
unlock my doors and you can't probably
can't<00:00:20.640> see<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.820> too<00:00:21.090> well<00:00:21.270> but<00:00:21.420> it's<00:00:21.570> one<00:00:21.689> of

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
can't see that too well but it's one of

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.480 
can't see that too well but it's one of
those<00:00:21.869> vague<00:00:22.710> looking<00:00:23.070> connectors

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
those vague looking connectors

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.189 
those vague looking connectors
underneath<00:00:23.760> there<00:00:23.939> okay<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:24.660> those<00:00:25.050> go<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.410> a

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199 
underneath there okay so those go to a

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.890 
underneath there okay so those go to a
transistor<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.529> my<00:00:29.340> board<00:00:30.000> can<00:00:30.330> control

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
transistor that my board can control

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.190 
transistor that my board can control
when<00:00:31.529> they<00:00:31.740> connect<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.399> whatnot<00:00:32.850> so<00:00:33.200> that

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
when they connect and whatnot so that

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.150 
when they connect and whatnot so that
status<00:00:34.829> LEDs<00:00:35.250> blue<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.320> that<00:00:37.320> means<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.890> my

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
status LEDs blue and that means that my

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.810 
status LEDs blue and that means that my
reader<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.700> ready<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.390> read<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> card<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.550> have

to<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> system<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.030> things<00:01:06.659> going

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
to be in the system so the things going

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.240 
to be in the system so the things going
to<00:01:06.930> blink<00:01:07.170> red<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:07.890> not<00:01:08.040> going<00:01:08.189> to

apart<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.869> mount<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.290> eventually<00:02:04.860> I'm<00:02:04.979> going

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
apart to mount it eventually I'm going

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.609 
apart to mount it eventually I'm going
to<00:02:05.310> mount<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.640> reader<00:02:05.880> up<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.990> my<00:02:07.320> little

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
to mount the reader up in my little

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.219 
to mount the reader up in my little
window<00:02:08.069> right<00:02:08.369> here<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.450> can<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.780> walk<00:02:09.989> by

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
window right here so I can just walk by

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
my doors are locked so I'm planning on

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.160 
my doors are locked so I'm planning on
cutting<00:02:15.850> out<00:02:16.060> some<00:02:16.330> of<00:02:16.510> this<00:02:16.630> little<00:02:16.900> plastic

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
cutting out some of this little plastic

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.860 
cutting out some of this little plastic
right<00:02:17.740> here<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:18.280> then<00:02:19.060> just<00:02:19.240> mounting<00:02:19.780> the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
right here and then just mounting the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.710 
right here and then just mounting the
reader<00:02:20.110> inside<00:02:20.680> there<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.450> should<00:02:22.630> be

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
reader inside there and that should be

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.170 
reader inside there and that should be
pretty<00:02:22.960> cool<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:24.130> then<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.700> wire<00:02:24.910> is<00:02:25.030> going

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
pretty cool and then the wire is going

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.700 
pretty cool and then the wire is going
to<00:02:25.240> be<00:02:25.330> run<00:02:25.540> through<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.930> door<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.680> the

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
to be run through the door to the

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.370 
to be run through the door to the
underneath<00:02:27.190> here<00:02:27.490> where<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:28.420> processing

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
underneath here where the processing

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.020 
underneath here where the processing
board<00:02:29.560> will<00:02:29.740> be<00:02:29.860> probably<00:02:30.340> somewhere<00:02:30.700> on<00:02:30.760> top

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
board will be probably somewhere on top

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.180 
board will be probably somewhere on top
of<00:02:31.210> that<00:02:31.300> white<00:02:31.540> box<00:02:31.780> probably<00:02:32.320> just<00:02:32.590> sat<00:02:33.010> down

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
of that white box probably just sat down

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.960 
of that white box probably just sat down
with<00:02:33.460> 3m<00:02:33.880> tape<00:02:34.150> or<00:02:34.360> something<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.970> powered
