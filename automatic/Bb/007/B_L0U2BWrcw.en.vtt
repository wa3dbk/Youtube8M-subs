00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
going to do the Southbridge this is this

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:14.160 
going to do the Southbridge this is this
one<00:01:07.220> I'll<00:01:07.880> show<00:01:07.940> you<00:01:08.270> a<00:01:08.630> little<00:01:09.110> bit<00:01:09.230> more

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.340 

first<00:01:15.170> of<00:01:15.350> all<00:01:15.530> and<00:01:15.830> we<00:01:16.250> have<00:01:16.400> to<00:01:16.550> get<00:01:16.729> rid<00:01:16.909> of

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
first of all and we have to get rid of

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.630 
first of all and we have to get rid of
the<00:01:18.350> pieces<00:01:19.040> we<00:01:19.670> left<00:01:19.909> here

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.310 

squeeze<00:01:25.740> epitome<00:01:26.740> of<00:01:26.770> Lisa<00:01:27.130> so<00:01:27.640> I<00:01:28.630> always<00:01:28.990> used

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
squeeze epitome of Lisa so I always used

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.010 
squeeze epitome of Lisa so I always used
to<00:01:29.440> finance<00:01:29.740> and<00:01:30.160> finger<00:01:30.610> just<00:01:31.540> rather<00:01:31.810> the

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
to finance and finger just rather the

big<00:01:32.170> stretch<00:01:33.130> hood<00:01:33.610> with<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.110> panel<00:01:35.110> that's

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
big stretch hood with the panel that's

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:48.139 
big stretch hood with the panel that's
quite<00:01:36.190> easy

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:02:01.960 

so<00:01:49.149> next<00:01:49.360> step<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.899> agrees

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.890 

you<00:02:02.970> know<00:02:03.120> we'll<00:02:03.300> have<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.510> closer<00:02:03.780> look<00:02:05.660> at<00:02:06.660> the

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
you know we'll have a closer look at the

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:14.710 
you know we'll have a closer look at the
chipset<00:02:07.350> block

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.940

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.280 

don't<00:02:39.270> forget<00:02:40.040> get<00:02:41.040> rid<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.490> this<00:02:41.880> one<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.420> the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
don't forget get rid of this one of the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.890 
don't forget get rid of this one of the
sticker<00:02:43.820> it's<00:02:44.820> just<00:02:45.240> there<00:02:45.450> for<00:02:45.690> safety

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
sticker it's just there for safety

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.680 
sticker it's just there for safety
reasons<00:02:46.440> we<00:02:46.730> don't<00:02:47.730> need<00:02:47.910> anymore

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
reasons we don't need anymore

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.199 
reasons we don't need anymore
otherwise<00:02:49.350> there<00:02:49.680> will<00:02:49.830> be<00:02:49.890> no<00:02:50.690> if<00:02:51.690> this<00:02:51.960> page

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:09.720 

let's<00:02:55.810> have<00:02:56.019> a<00:02:56.049> look

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.440 

first<00:03:10.390> of<00:03:10.540> all<00:03:10.660> take<00:03:10.990> the<00:03:11.140> screw<00:03:12.120> place<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.330> in

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
first of all take the screw place it in

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:21.360 
first of all take the screw place it in
the<00:03:13.540> holes<00:03:14.520> second<00:03:15.520> one<00:03:19.830> push<00:03:20.830> down<00:03:21.070> with<00:03:21.100> your

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
the holes second one push down with your

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:28.600 
the holes second one push down with your
fingers

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.100 

take<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.760> chipset<00:03:30.120> coolant<00:03:32.120> place<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.390> right

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
take the chipset coolant place it right

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:42.770 
take the chipset coolant place it right
on<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.439> chipset

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.590 

come<00:03:43.780> on<00:03:43.930> around

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
come on around

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:54.820 
come on around
just<00:03:46.600> a<00:03:46.720> little<00:03:46.870> bit

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:02.830 

so<00:03:55.690> then<00:03:57.400> keep<00:03:58.400> it<00:03:58.520> like<00:03:58.700> this<00:04:01.570> turn<00:04:02.570> to<00:04:02.750> the

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
so then keep it like this turn to the

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:32.440 
so then keep it like this turn to the
other<00:04:02.960> side

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:39.140 

so<00:04:33.450> that's<00:04:33.720> it<00:04:36.590> right<00:04:37.590> now<00:04:37.860> we<00:04:38.670> have<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:38.970> full

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
so that's it right now we have the full

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.200 
so that's it right now we have the full
motherboard<00:04:39.690> with<00:04:40.170> water-cooling<00:04:41.210> chipset

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
motherboard with water-cooling chipset

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.450 
motherboard with water-cooling chipset
chipset<00:04:42.900> voltage<00:04:43.500> regulators<00:04:44.010> welcome<00:04:44.370> to

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
chipset voltage regulators welcome to

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:55.840 
chipset voltage regulators welcome to
admit<00:04:44.760> it<00:04:44.960> and<00:04:45.960> that's<00:04:46.260> it

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.870 

so<00:04:56.960> this<00:04:57.960> was<00:04:58.140> a<00:04:58.170> mounting<00:04:59.010> a<00:04:59.100> chips<00:04:59.340> and<00:04:59.550> flan

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
so this was a mounting a chips and flan

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.810 
so this was a mounting a chips and flan
on<00:05:00.360> a<00:05:00.420> Mesa<00:05:01.320> strike<00:05:02.100> extreme<00:05:02.640> motherboard

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
on a Mesa strike extreme motherboard

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.590 
on a Mesa strike extreme motherboard
this<00:05:03.630> works<00:05:03.840> with<00:05:03.990> all<00:05:04.730> chipset<00:05:05.730> who<00:05:05.940> was<00:05:06.150> the

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
this works with all chipset who was the

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.440 
this works with all chipset who was the
same<00:05:06.840> way<00:05:07.130> except<00:05:08.130> the<00:05:08.250> ones<00:05:08.450> especially

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
same way except the ones especially

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.140
