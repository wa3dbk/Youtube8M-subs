00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.109 
you'll be sharing experience getting a
little<00:01:45.990> bit<00:01:46.259> more<00:01:46.560> than<00:01:47.340> what<00:01:48.470> you'll<00:01:49.470> be

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
little bit more than what you'll be

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.030 
little bit more than what you'll be
expecting<00:01:51.119> but<00:01:51.750> not<00:01:51.930> by<00:01:52.140> much<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.770> mean<00:01:53.009> if

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
expecting but not by much so I mean if

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.469 
expecting but not by much so I mean if
you<00:01:53.159> get<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> kill<00:01:53.610> obviously<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.180> get<00:01:54.329> more

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
you get the kill obviously you get more

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.530 
you get the kill obviously you get more
experience<00:01:55.340> if<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.759> don't<00:01:57.060> get<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.329> kill

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
experience if you don't get the kill

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.580 
experience if you don't get the kill
then<00:01:57.810> you'll<00:01:57.960> get<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> little<00:01:58.380> bit<00:01:58.560> of

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
then you'll get a little bit of

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.380 
then you'll get a little bit of
experience<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.369> works<00:01:59.549> for<00:01:59.640> both<00:01:59.759> ways<00:02:00.119> so

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
experience so it works for both ways so

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.929 
experience so it works for both ways so

just run up make a loop and come right
back<00:02:53.300> and<00:02:54.300> you'll<00:02:54.540> have<00:02:54.780> some<00:02:55.590> ammo<00:02:55.770> that<00:02:55.890> they

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
back and you'll have some ammo that they

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.350 
back and you'll have some ammo that they
dropped<00:02:56.340> on<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.580> ground<00:02:56.610> state<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.150> keep

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
dropped on the ground state you keep

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.610

around<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:42.120> church<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:45.060> original<00:03:45.480> way<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.660> do

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
around the church the original way to do

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.259 
around the church the original way to do
this<00:03:46.080> is<00:03:46.320> I<00:03:46.410> would<00:03:47.400> climb<00:03:47.610> up<00:03:47.790> on<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.090> roof

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
this is I would climb up on the roof

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.509 
this is I would climb up on the roof
over<00:03:48.720> here<00:03:49.050> right<00:03:49.769> above<00:03:49.860> this<00:03:50.100> guy<00:03:50.310> little

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
over here right above this guy little

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:51.040 
over here right above this guy little
program

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
program

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.230 
program
like<00:03:51.440> right<00:03:51.620> up<00:03:51.710> on<00:03:51.830> their<00:03:51.950> corner<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:52.670> once

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
like right up on their corner and once

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.630 
like right up on their corner and once
you<00:03:53.390> shoot<00:03:53.600> down<00:03:53.870> until<00:03:54.740> a<00:03:54.770> guy<00:03:54.980> if<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.430> come

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
you shoot down until a guy if you come

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.200
