00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:11.429
 Tell people directly here and today. 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.710
 we're back here in flash fans 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.839
 I think not but I say that we are 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.080
 or clash of lance that now the shovel channel 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.789
 it's so full of videos the clash of 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.000
 clans 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.670
 You are already familiar 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.609
 so a video of today what is it that I 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.669
 I'll bring it to you, it's an attack. 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.660
 only with mages right for you who likes 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.120
 mago has viewed the previous videos of 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.300
 attack of archers only with order only with 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.489
 barbaric and only with a European giant and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.149
 that my camp to where you 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:52.800
 all 4 and now I can do 200 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.309
 troops being that the magician occupies four 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.609
 spaces by doing a quick calculation 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.829
 150 magicians we can use the magician 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.220
 level 3 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:08.189
 I'll go for it soon it will be faster 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.200
 possible but for now he's at 3 and until 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.700
 good that he follows the line of attacks 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.900
 that were also troops of 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.750
 Level 3 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.240
 This time I'll give it a peal because 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.619
 I 'll use two healing pots and I'll 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.320
 I'm going 3 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.110
 unfortunately I do not have the pot of 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.750
 fury that wonder here really 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.259
 here 3rd level the moment damage at 30 per 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:36.829
 cent speed in 2011 tactical and if 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:40.310
 You can smoke, Jorge, then you can dance. 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.310
 communication but saw here 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:59.939
 The 50 doctor magician joke today is a 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:02:02.990
 Fantastic destruction and I will not 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:06.450
 Yes, I would call the cope radio if I did. 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.560
 take out would be some wizards make an angel 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.530
 of cure 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.530
 then it would be very much the puppy 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:22.319
 The mage has a good year and has a good 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:27.870
 resistance just wanted a little the side the 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:32.400
 displacement is a bit slower but 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:38.700
 he's an excellent tool, I do not 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.690
 I do not use much because it takes too long to be 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.549
 done 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.400
 I do not have a lot of patience. 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:49.769
 talk and I prefer to use other 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.989
 I think even the most logical thing is 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.590
 the crafts fair blogs on a link that are more 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:03:11.370
 easier, faster and cheaper cm 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:15.780
 done galley 2007 and it comes to life well 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:20.310
 the boy is very well paid easy 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.630
 easy not do not go there you do everything from 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:27.790
 only once 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:42.090
 It's good, this precious Jason cares. 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:42.090
 here o 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:53.100
 what the curve at a crucial moment and then the 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.100
 throw one world each line 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.990
 niwa pure dill 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:20.739
 although this is fantastic it has a damage 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:25.330
 very tall and expensive and he has a 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:36.940
 excellent resistance he can handle 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:40.800
 a lot of total devastation for those who 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.800
 have patience to wait 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.570
 it's worth staying with it it's there for 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.040
 to say that I appealed to vote in the rival 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.790
 bahia to destroy a car in the station 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.790
 eighth 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:59.889
 then 100% 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.389
 easy easy 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.270
 Of course I gave a peal I think 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:08.180
 worth it because it is valid and also 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.270
 You can not sacrifice 50 wizards. 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:16.610
 that way, if you have the option of 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:19.070
 use the spell and is part of the game 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.620
 why not use it if you had a chance 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.229
 of fury and you will really see what 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.479
 it is appealing 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:28.639
 so it's a nice attack there 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:31.940
 and with the mage level 3 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:34.759
 The wizard is thinking level 4 or 5 as 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.210
 It's cool, this is it or three already do damage. 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:36.740
 there 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.110
 And look how the boy's life had a good time. 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:43.759
 of the world well the priest must already be 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.710
 next to go up there you see 7:00 am nothing is 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:48.530
 All very well paid all right 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.080
 so thanks a lot guys physics had 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:55.150
 So far nothing I hope you have enjoyed 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.150
 see you around
