00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:12.999
 hello to all your flights 12 and we will continue with the analysis of the game of 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.659
 super smash bros bravo 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.659
 and well now let's set aside the characters 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.810
 We were going to enter 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.230
 in pain 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.679
 we think it was reasonable to take them out of their majority 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.769
 p but not from another young man tried 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.059
 ia each of them has some other surprise with others are normal not 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:35.590
 has has no way 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.480
 women have these things 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.680
 it's good 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.800
 percent analyze the area staff imposed five videos 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.650
 already to have the review done 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.420
 and well I think it's going to be four but good 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.940
 noooo 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.930
 front 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.489
 in the first two videos 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:55.489
 I'll talk about 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.070
 e of those who most often use 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.250
 and is that they are more striking 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.350
 in the third video I'll talk about the melee scenario 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.290
 and the last video I'll talk about the secret scenarios 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.079
 and good news that was lived in another more 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.710
 to be able to talk about 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.010
 it is necessary that you can 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.170
 that can be created by not talking 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.100
 and good 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.140
 as I said we are going to talk 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.850
 of the scenarios 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.370
 more daring but I have only referred there are I will name twelve of them although good 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:29.950
 north 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.560
 first crowded the battlefield 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.080
 is formed by a large platform I will try smaller ones which 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.340
 they can float and people for that and of course 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.289
 turn in the simplest model 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.660
 and the magician who never stage 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.690
 na not only pop over everything stolen 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.680
 she creates more employment 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.680
 in scene this scenario there are no changes 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.320
 the sex 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.320
 for one thing that those who change the day 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.930
 this record is just because the ball 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.860
 Start by asking for the reprobation of combat 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.060
 can reach 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.189
 at night going through sunset 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:12.790
 in them the combat programmed by day revilla has remembered the by the 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.659
 night 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.659
 that already depends on the duration of the contract 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.320
 the next will be to stop it 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.089
 it's called city of the end 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:25.069
 I got a game of mario bros and in the capital of idaho delfino 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.969
 with this scenario you can tour the island since the stage overflights and 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.159
 landing in the fifth point 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.569
 the poetry of center a cidade 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.979
 the committee that what you have to change rhythm 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:40.869
 there I think there are three or four points what the stage bar lands 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:45.149
 we passed next that is the island of them 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:48.239
 he the best of this scenario only change of season 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.249
 and when it's going to fall you can save yourself going to a plaza a platform 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:56.309
 they come to you near the stage but well saturday is not a matter of luck 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:01.199
 in the next scenario would be hopeless this end 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:03.389
 in the system 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:04.639
 lilac 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.010
 in it the name of the region 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.260
 spaces where the adventure of these things unfolds 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:15.779
 percent is in favor of a spaceship in inter fight that the people do not 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:16.669
 the orb 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:19.849
 or through speaking the cornellá atmosphere 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.849
 how good the almozara strap is supposed to 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:25.359
 is a woman 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.459
 it belongs to you 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.299
 to the pc games of these photos 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.929
 the next scenario 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:34.009
 the bridge of the din 

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:37.919
 n a game of zelda appear specifically in the sprinter rostrum 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.610
 n a game character only appear on stage i threw a barrel of 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:44.509
 gunpowder 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:47.889
 besides that puerto vallarta atropellarte portugal 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.759
 Ivan Silva rebel of gunpowder 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:52.679
 certainly for of course 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:54.949
 and of totora 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.439
 an intermediate part of the ponte a kolla village was rebuilt 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:59.599
 automatically 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.879
 in another order of things of your character the good thing of turin 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.149
 I do not know with whom 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:09.399
 in the next scenario is the town is more 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.019
 what the legendary Spanish jumper but yes 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.919
 the change between night and day depends on the time 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.759
 have the wii console 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:21.769
 and attention to this data is 8 euros soria from port 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.270
 can not or intermediate pages that 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.930
 and is that if the combat 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.800
 on a Saturday for eight in the afternoon 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.689
 at the bottom of the stage 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:33.139
 there will be a kind of this concert 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.699
 because also in tdt said 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.699
 in particular to a dog with Pablo Serrano 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:44.649
 1 there will be who has never played not only under his apparent in that scenario 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.650
 It's been good I'll have to try it one day 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.129
 the next scenario is the great waterfall 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.590
 he was created from a game of don tito 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.479
 and the head does not stop coming up yes 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.110
 I stop you for the moment 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.050
 min 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.509
 we are tired 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:06.509
 pujol to say it in an easy and simple way 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.050
 the centennial of the revolution 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.110
 in scenarios of where the character of this same one comes from 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.580
 game pib 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.860
 On the floor of the centenary you can destroy what fun 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.860
 because that's what the enemy wanted, it will be longer 

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:26.059
 the next scenario in the beleaguered castle 

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:29.059
 in it comes from the entire village 40m 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.540
 the combat you do not feel in the same place as when a time of change passes 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.969
 stage 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:38.360
 pa this scenario much the chancellor 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.230
 the interior of the castle in which there is as commented that they can be destroyed 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.099
 I had I removed the commune dfb of the volcano 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.050
 but apparently that's the 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.999
 more morbid of the castle so good 

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:56.159
 because it looks like lava and fifth of all that you have to have a tad 

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:58.289
 a volcano 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:01.289
 they say that we have erased then good monreal 

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:06.359
 in the following scenario p in any other place 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.150
 the logo of gualeguay 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.150
 have to master one I can see five seconds 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:17.879
 in the fourth and the same happened as the scenario changes and several children enter 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:18.740
 flight 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.419
 for example that put a 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:21.960
 example in new lion 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.960
 efe begins to fall 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.009
 I prefer that you have to return what you want 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:31.409
 this step slow but not all Cubans 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:34.409
 because those dates and agenda topics or of course 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:38.379
 the next 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.099
 in the Canary Islands on the Buenos Aires stage 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:45.780
 in the classic scenario of the Pokémon saga and that scenario change 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:49.999
 min as a scene pokémon de de los dibujitos 

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:51.719
 On the other hand, it also changes 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:54.619
 It must be normal 

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:57.819
 of land ice and from there 

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:00.680
 and good estimated that the penultimate scenario 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.680
 his proposal not only personal with the help of the head 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:05.520
 the last scenario 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.199
 it's called high fence 

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:12.889
 n that the ship well the character put years 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:16.499
 has a good black eye that somebody who can 

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:19.499
 get this enemy to say 

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:25.340
 i was that on the centenary platform keeps flying to that ship 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.499
 therefore called word 

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:30.050
 but by stopping a lot of care 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.919
 because I was stranded 

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:34.069
 in low season 

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:36.169
 can bring something 

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:37.790
 about 307 

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.460
 round that go around 

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.300
 remember 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.770
 hello you close 

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.900
 but opined that in very but very easy to deploy as prolific as 

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.789
 normal 

00:07:48.789 --> 00:07:51.399
 i a tactile scenario of ceded 

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:54.259
 I hope there is not a single vote of the popular 

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:55.919
 and good eighth position
