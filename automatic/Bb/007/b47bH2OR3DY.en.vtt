something that I remember from high
school<00:04:10.190> which<00:04:10.400> would<00:04:10.520> be<00:04:10.610> two<00:04:10.910> arms<00:04:11.390> around

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
school which would be two arms around

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.480 
school which would be two arms around
the<00:04:11.990> net<00:04:12.200> connection<00:04:12.800> worms<00:04:12.980> around<00:04:13.280> the
