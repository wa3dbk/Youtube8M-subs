00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 first about the incredible chip 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.720
 happy ending with Nizhny Novgorod gateway 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.900
 hes working broke he flew from a height 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.880
 16 meters is approximately the height 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.980
 the five-story house fell headfirst but 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.199
 stayed alive today we got 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.590
 the video that captured it 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.590
 event 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.719
 but 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.670
 for 3 years 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:02.010
 middle-aged second height of 16 meters 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.160
 so saved hoses and so the show is not forged 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.869
 the game is a mixer hit 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.390
 hoses there for Putiners 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.450
 half sash oxygen hose and 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.400
 he got confused he is so flying down to you a 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.250
 then he rolled over like that 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.170
 already went to the sides already would have a head like 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.090
 The Sultan is already the rump of the femur 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:29.190
 chest held off the most 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.200
 don't need anything we call height drop 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.149
 I will repeat once again the five-floor house 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.950
 injured from being transported to intensive care but 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.140
 it turned out that he just got off 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:56.039
 broken leg now he's even transferred 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:58.590
 in the general chamber such a happy outcome 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.000
 fall from a height colleagues call a miracle 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.970
 but the reason for this chip 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.039
 man-made thing is that on this very 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.149
 the spot a few months ago collapsed 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.920
 crane boom 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.259
 of this crane as you now see and 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.060
 damaged fence restoring not 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.040
 hurried here in the end it led 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.690
 to the fall the transport prosecutor's office as 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.120
 supposed to be checking what happened 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.780
 no specific charges yet 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.780
 brought
