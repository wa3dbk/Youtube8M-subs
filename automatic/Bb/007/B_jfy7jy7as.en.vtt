00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
one's going to be on the benchmade axis

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.660 
one's going to be on the benchmade axis
lock<00:00:06.509> I'm<00:00:06.899> going<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.170> show<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:07.490> exactly<00:00:08.490> how

this<00:00:12.349> while<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.380> was<00:00:13.530> taking<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.889> apart<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.340> I

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
this while I was taking it apart and I

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:15.890 
this while I was taking it apart and I
found<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.120> just<00:00:15.150> wasted<00:00:15.630> too<00:00:15.719> much<00:00:15.750> time

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
found it just wasted too much time

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.510 
found it just wasted too much time
taking<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.500> screws<00:00:16.770> out<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.039> stuff<00:00:17.400> like

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
taking the screws out and stuff like

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.019 
taking the screws out and stuff like
that<00:00:17.730> but<00:00:18.330> I'll<00:00:18.449> quickly<00:00:18.930> explain<00:00:19.080> what<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.529> did

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
how the axis lock works and kind of had

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.950 
how the axis lock works and kind of had
a<00:00:25.320> lock<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.920> clean<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.300> which<00:00:27.300> was<00:00:27.480> requested

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
a lock to clean it which was requested

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.109 
a lock to clean it which was requested
by<00:00:27.990> LSU<00:00:28.650> Tigers<00:00:29.010> 10/10<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.760> want<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.970> know<00:00:30.029> how

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
by LSU Tigers 10/10 you want to know how

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.069 
by LSU Tigers 10/10 you want to know how
to<00:00:30.210> clean<00:00:30.420> his<00:00:30.660> benchmade<00:00:31.590> axis<00:00:31.949> lock<00:00:32.160> knives

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
to clean his benchmade axis lock knives

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.780 
to clean his benchmade axis lock knives
this<00:00:34.079> one<00:00:34.320> specifically<00:00:34.860> is<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.399> benchmate

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
this one specifically is the benchmate

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.690 
this one specifically is the benchmate
model<00:00:36.059> 420<00:00:36.690> resistor<00:00:37.559> it's<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.980> snow<00:00:38.219> D<00:00:38.280> design

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
model 420 resistor it's a snow D design

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.299 
model 420 resistor it's a snow D design
this<00:00:39.540> actually<00:00:39.899> has<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> handle<00:00:40.649> scale<00:00:41.010> over

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
this actually has a handle scale over

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.510 
this actually has a handle scale over
top<00:00:41.820> of<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.030> handle<00:00:42.360> slab<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.590> first<00:00:44.280> thing<00:00:44.460> I

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
top of the handle slab so first thing I

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.630 
top of the handle slab so first thing I
had<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.670> do<00:00:45.140> was<00:00:46.140> before<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.890> put<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> slab<00:00:47.399> off

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
had to do was before I put the slab off

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.990 
had to do was before I put the slab off
I<00:00:47.789> take<00:00:48.090> these<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.600> handle<00:00:49.050> scale<00:00:49.379> off<00:00:50.000> okay

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
I take these this handle scale off okay

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.100 
I take these this handle scale off okay
so<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.390> what<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> knife<00:00:51.690> looked<00:00:51.960> like

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
so this is what the knife looked like

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.100 
so this is what the knife looked like
all<00:00:52.829> put<00:00:53.039> together<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.610> had<00:00:54.329> four<00:00:54.570> screws<00:00:54.899> for

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
all put together I had four screws for

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.410 
all put together I had four screws for
the<00:00:55.170> handle<00:00:55.440> scale<00:00:55.739> okay<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:57.059> came<00:00:57.239> off

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
the handle scale okay that came off

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.740 
the handle scale okay that came off
those<00:00:57.690> are<00:00:57.809> all<00:00:57.930> size<00:00:58.280> t6<00:00:59.280> the<00:01:00.149> torque<00:01:00.449> some

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
those are all size t6 the torque some

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.980 
those are all size t6 the torque some
driver<00:01:01.199> t6<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.399> then<00:01:03.949> for<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> body<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.489> had

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
driver t6 and then for the body I had

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.810 
driver t6 and then for the body I had
these<00:01:06.990> three<00:01:07.229> screws<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.770> body<00:01:08.220> screws<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
these three screws here body screws and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.649 
these three screws here body screws and
each<00:01:09.450> one<00:01:09.720> having<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.100> back<00:01:11.280> here<00:01:11.700> being

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
each one having on the back here being

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.570 
each one having on the back here being
connected<00:01:12.900> with<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.200> spacer<00:01:13.680> okay<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.250> keep<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
connected with a spacer okay to keep the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.510 
connected with a spacer okay to keep the
scales<00:01:15.240> apart<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.590> there's<00:01:16.830> three<00:01:17.040> spacers

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
scales apart so there's three spacers

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.280 
scales apart so there's three spacers
three<00:01:17.790> screws<00:01:18.119> once<00:01:18.600> those<00:01:18.840> are<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:19.080> again

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
three screws once those are out again

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.120 
three screws once those are out again
all<00:01:19.680> those<00:01:19.860> were<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.520> same<00:01:20.759> t6<00:01:21.360> driver<00:01:22.049> then<00:01:23.040> I

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
all those were the same t6 driver then I

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.890 
all those were the same t6 driver then I
had<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.310> take<00:01:23.369> out<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> pivot<00:01:23.909> screw<00:01:24.000> okay

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
had to take out the pivot screw okay

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.240 
had to take out the pivot screw okay
which<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> t9<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:26.040> switch<00:01:26.460> over<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.850> t9<00:01:28.250> Torx

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
which is a t9 I switch over to a t9 Torx

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.330 
which is a t9 I switch over to a t9 Torx
bit<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.450> now<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.200> handle<00:01:31.799> slab<00:01:32.100> off

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
bit so now I have the handle slab off

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.140 
bit so now I have the handle slab off
okay<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.210> slab<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> scale<00:01:34.020> aside

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
okay so the slab and the scale aside

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.300 
okay so the slab and the scale aside
let's<00:01:36.150> take<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> look<00:01:36.509> at<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.659> knife<00:01:36.869> all

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
let's take a look at this knife all

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.370 
let's take a look at this knife all
access<00:01:38.310> lock<00:01:38.790> knives<00:01:39.119> are<00:01:39.540> going<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.200> have

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
access lock knives are going to have

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.429 
access lock knives are going to have
this<00:01:40.680> middle<00:01:41.280> piece<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> frame<00:01:42.299> okay<00:01:43.170> same

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
this middle piece in the frame okay same

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.710 
this middle piece in the frame okay same
thing<00:01:43.649> with<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> reptilians<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.479> middle

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
thing with the reptilians it's a middle

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.899 
thing with the reptilians it's a middle
piece<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.649> access<00:01:46.950> lock<00:01:47.159> works<00:01:47.340> around

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
piece that the access lock works around

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.999 
piece that the access lock works around
besides<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> handle<00:01:49.229> scales<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.680> also<00:01:49.799> have

to slide those lugs back because what
you're<00:03:02.870> doing<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.290> you're<00:03:03.440> moving<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:04.070> pin

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
you're doing is you're moving the pin

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.430 
you're doing is you're moving the pin
out<00:03:04.730> of<00:03:04.820> the<00:03:04.880> way<00:03:05.030> now<00:03:05.210> to<00:03:05.900> free<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.230> bleed

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
out of the way now to free the bleed

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.180 
out of the way now to free the bleed
okay<00:03:07.010> which<00:03:07.190> will<00:03:07.370> swing<00:03:07.610> freely<00:03:07.880> as<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:08.210> see

so in pulling that down you're freeing

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.520 
so in pulling that down you're freeing
the<00:03:12.950> blade<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.780> again<00:03:14.780> you<00:03:14.900> see<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.200> spring

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
get that blade started it's just rolling

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.270 
get that blade started it's just rolling
on<00:03:49.580> the<00:03:49.720> tang<00:03:50.720> of<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:50.900> blade<00:03:51.110> until<00:03:51.410> there's<00:03:52.220> a

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
on the tang of the blade until there's a

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.500 
on the tang of the blade until there's a
little<00:03:52.459> notch<00:03:52.640> there<00:03:52.940> I'm<00:03:53.030> not<00:03:53.150> sure<00:03:53.330> how<00:03:53.450> good

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
little notch there I'm not sure how good

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.800 
little notch there I'm not sure how good
you<00:03:53.720> can<00:03:53.870> see<00:03:54.050> that<00:03:54.230> or<00:03:54.350> not<00:03:54.790> but<00:03:55.790> once<00:03:56.630> you<00:03:56.750> hit

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
you can see that or not but once you hit

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.050 
you can see that or not but once you hit
that<00:03:56.930> notch<00:03:57.170> it<00:03:57.800> pops<00:03:58.070> in<00:03:58.250> place<00:03:58.459> and<00:03:58.790> then<00:03:58.970> you

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
that notch it pops in place and then you

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.130 
that notch it pops in place and then you
have<00:03:59.209> the<00:03:59.360> blade<00:04:00.019> is<00:04:00.140> that<00:04:00.380> therefore<00:04:00.650> locked

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
have the blade is that therefore locked

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.570 
have the blade is that therefore locked
let<00:04:03.140> me<00:04:03.200> actually<00:04:03.350> grab<00:04:03.709> I<00:04:04.040> have<00:04:04.400> that

let me actually grab I have that
jeweler's<00:04:05.570> loupe<00:04:05.600> they<00:04:06.230> see<00:04:06.440> if<00:04:06.560> I<00:04:06.680> can<00:04:06.860> show

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
jeweler's loupe they see if I can show

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.360 
jeweler's loupe they see if I can show
you<00:04:07.100> with<00:04:07.940> that<00:04:08.530> keep<00:04:09.530> it<00:04:09.680> by<00:04:09.800> my<00:04:09.830> desk

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
you with that keep it by my desk

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.190 
you with that keep it by my desk
someone<00:04:10.880> actually<00:04:11.150> recommended<00:04:11.690> that<00:04:11.750> I<00:04:11.810> show

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
someone actually recommended that I show

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.650 
someone actually recommended that I show
close-ups<00:04:12.709> with<00:04:12.860> this<00:04:13.150> make<00:04:14.150> a<00:04:14.180> little<00:04:14.420> easier

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
close-ups with this make a little easier

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.289 
close-ups with this make a little easier
but<00:04:14.959> it's<00:04:15.110> it's<00:04:15.350> a<00:04:15.410> little<00:04:15.590> bit<00:04:15.709> too<00:04:15.890> close

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
but it's it's a little bit too close

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.610 
but it's it's a little bit too close
let's<00:04:17.299> see<00:04:17.419> if<00:04:17.510> I<00:04:17.600> can<00:04:17.750> use<00:04:17.900> that<00:04:17.930> to<00:04:18.290> out<00:04:18.470> to

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
let's see if I can use that to out to

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.210 
let's see if I can use that to out to
show<00:04:18.769> you<00:04:18.859> this<00:04:18.950> a<00:04:19.010> little<00:04:19.190> better<00:04:19.370> close-up

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
show you this a little better close-up

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.480 
show you this a little better close-up
so<00:04:22.220> let's<00:04:22.370> try<00:04:22.520> that<00:04:22.669> now

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.679 

okay<00:04:26.490> here's<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.389> inside<00:04:27.629> knife<00:04:29.150> you<00:04:30.150> can<00:04:30.539> see

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:30.689 
okay here's the inside knife you can see

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:32.270 
okay here's the inside knife you can see
how<00:04:30.780> dirty<00:04:31.050> it<00:04:31.229> is<00:04:31.319> the<00:04:31.500> thumb<00:04:31.710> stud<00:04:31.949> I<00:04:31.979> got<00:04:32.189> to

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
how dirty it is the thumb stud I got to

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.800 
how dirty it is the thumb stud I got to
clean<00:04:32.430> this<00:04:32.550> one<00:04:32.610> out

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
clean this one out

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.649 
clean this one out
which<00:04:34.289> I<00:04:34.409> will<00:04:34.469> do<00:04:34.680> after<00:04:34.949> this<00:04:35.009> video<00:04:35.659> now

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:36.659 
which I will do after this video now

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:37.730 
which I will do after this video now
unfortunately<00:04:37.229> I<00:04:37.289> can't

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 
unfortunately I can't

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.740 
unfortunately I can't
there's<00:04:38.009> the<00:04:38.189> access<00:04:38.550> lock<00:04:38.759> the<00:04:38.969> bar<00:04:39.180> across

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
there's the access lock the bar across

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.270 
there's the access lock the bar across
the<00:04:39.870> back<00:04:40.139> of<00:04:40.319> the<00:04:40.379> spine<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.680> knife<00:04:41.009> right

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
the back of the spine the knife right

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.089 
the back of the spine the knife right
there<00:04:41.310> now<00:04:42.150> I<00:04:42.210> can't<00:04:42.539> hold<00:04:42.750> this<00:04:42.960> I<00:04:43.259> can't<00:04:44.009> hold

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
there now I can't hold this I can't hold

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:45.439 
there now I can't hold this I can't hold
the<00:04:44.219> Jewelers<00:04:44.520> loop<00:04:44.580> while<00:04:44.969> I'm<00:04:45.060> doing<00:04:45.330> this

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
the Jewelers loop while I'm doing this

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.200 
the Jewelers loop while I'm doing this
only<00:04:45.689> two<00:04:45.930> hands<00:04:46.259> but<00:04:46.729> move<00:04:47.729> that<00:04:47.879> slightly

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
only two hands but move that slightly

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.760 
only two hands but move that slightly
just<00:04:48.479> to<00:04:48.569> show<00:04:48.750> you<00:04:48.810> a<00:04:48.900> different<00:04:49.169> angle<00:04:49.289> now

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.689 

if<00:04:52.770> this<00:04:52.949> helps<00:04:55.039> see<00:04:56.039> it's<00:04:56.190> going<00:04:56.310> to<00:04:56.430> slide

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
if this helps see it's going to slide

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.360 
if this helps see it's going to slide
across<00:04:56.879> that<00:04:57.419> bar<00:04:57.750> and<00:04:58.069> then<00:04:59.069> it's<00:04:59.190> going<00:04:59.310> to

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
across that bar and then it's going to

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.550 
across that bar and then it's going to
hit<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.639> flat<00:05:00.330> area<00:05:00.690> on<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.169> back<00:05:01.349> of<00:05:01.500> the

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
hit the flat area on the back of the

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.409 
hit the flat area on the back of the
spine<00:05:01.800> here<00:05:02.190> as<00:05:03.090> it<00:05:03.330> does<00:05:03.479> it<00:05:03.840> locks<00:05:04.590> in<00:05:04.770> place

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
spine here as it does it locks in place

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.640 
spine here as it does it locks in place
so<00:05:06.419> in<00:05:06.659> my<00:05:06.780> you<00:05:07.080> know<00:05:07.169> it<00:05:07.259> might<00:05:07.440> be<00:05:07.469> a<00:05:07.560> little

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
so in my you know it might be a little

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.800 
so in my you know it might be a little
confusing<00:05:08.129> here<00:05:08.250> but<00:05:08.580> I<00:05:08.819> want<00:05:09.449> to<00:05:09.569> give<00:05:09.659> you<00:05:09.690> a

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
confusing here but I want to give you a

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.790 
confusing here but I want to give you a
you<00:05:10.680> know<00:05:10.770> good<00:05:10.949> look<00:05:11.159> at<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.479> access<00:05:12.479> lock

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
you know good look at the access lock

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.230 
you know good look at the access lock
and<00:05:13.800> of<00:05:13.889> course<00:05:14.069> you<00:05:14.190> can<00:05:14.310> use<00:05:14.430> it<00:05:14.460> to<00:05:14.699> fully

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
and of course you can use it to fully

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.740 
and of course you can use it to fully
closed<00:05:15.779> or<00:05:16.110> open<00:05:16.469> the<00:05:16.680> blade<00:05:17.509> to<00:05:18.509> the<00:05:18.569> lock

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
closed or open the blade to the lock

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.920 
closed or open the blade to the lock
position<00:05:19.610> so<00:05:20.610> that<00:05:20.639> is<00:05:20.909> the<00:05:21.090> benchmade<00:05:21.539> access

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
position so that is the benchmade access

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.600 
position so that is the benchmade access
lock<00:05:22.139> I<00:05:22.349> really<00:05:23.039> wish<00:05:23.159> I<00:05:23.310> could<00:05:23.460> have<00:05:23.550> given

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
lock I really wish I could have given

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.929 
lock I really wish I could have given
you<00:05:23.789> a<00:05:23.849> better<00:05:24.319> close<00:05:25.319> up<00:05:25.349> detail<00:05:26.039> this<00:05:26.610> helps

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:26.939 
you a better close up detail this helps

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:28.249 
you a better close up detail this helps
a<00:05:27.000> little<00:05:27.090> bit<00:05:27.300> but<00:05:27.509> this<00:05:27.599> shows<00:05:27.840> you<00:05:27.870> way<00:05:28.199> to

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
a little bit but this shows you way to

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.080 
a little bit but this shows you way to
close<00:05:28.680> and<00:05:29.009> I<00:05:29.069> can't<00:05:29.310> keep<00:05:29.610> it<00:05:29.819> you<00:05:29.969> know

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
close and I can't keep it you know

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.140 
close and I can't keep it you know
against<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:30.990> camera<00:05:31.319> as<00:05:31.440> I'm<00:05:31.620> filming

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
against the camera as I'm filming

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.010 
against the camera as I'm filming
basically<00:05:33.150> that's<00:05:33.330> how<00:05:33.479> it<00:05:33.539> works<00:05:33.719> it's<00:05:33.960> just

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
basically that's how it works it's just

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.369 
basically that's how it works it's just
it's<00:05:34.770> just<00:05:34.949> a<00:05:35.039> bar<00:05:35.250> that's<00:05:35.940> rotating<00:05:36.629> actually

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:37.379 
it's just a bar that's rotating actually

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.550 
it's just a bar that's rotating actually
here's<00:05:37.740> a<00:05:37.830> better<00:05:38.039> view<00:05:38.370> of<00:05:38.520> the<00:05:39.080> the<00:05:40.080> shape<00:05:40.349> of

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
here's a better view of the the shape of

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.800 
here's a better view of the the shape of
the<00:05:40.919> spine<00:05:41.279> which<00:05:41.580> I<00:05:42.509> get<00:05:42.719> this<00:05:42.870> in<00:05:43.050> here<00:05:44.810> you

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
the spine which I get this in here you

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:47.300 
the spine which I get this in here you
have<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:46.020> bat<00:05:46.169> here's<00:05:46.409> the<00:05:46.560> blade<00:05:46.800> okay

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
have the bat here's the blade okay

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.769 
have the bat here's the blade okay
thumbs<00:05:47.610> done<00:05:47.849> as<00:05:48.060> you're<00:05:48.210> going<00:05:48.330> towards<00:05:48.690> the

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:48.779 
thumbs done as you're going towards the

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:49.730 
thumbs done as you're going towards the
back<00:05:48.900> of<00:05:48.930> the<00:05:49.080> blade<00:05:49.229> you<00:05:49.349> see<00:05:49.500> there's<00:05:49.680> a

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
back of the blade you see there's a

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.579 
back of the blade you see there's a
cutout<00:05:50.449> and<00:05:51.449> then<00:05:51.539> you<00:05:51.599> have<00:05:51.779> this<00:05:51.960> design

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:52.589 
cutout and then you have this design

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:54.589 
cutout and then you have this design
here<00:05:52.889> and<00:05:53.009> that<00:05:53.849> rounded<00:05:54.270> part<00:05:54.479> you're

00:05:54.589 --> 00:05:54.599 
here and that rounded part you're

00:05:54.599 --> 00:05:55.850 
here and that rounded part you're
looking<00:05:54.810> at<00:05:54.900> right<00:05:55.050> now<00:05:55.110> is<00:05:55.289> where<00:05:55.440> the<00:05:55.650> bar

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
looking at right now is where the bar

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.890 
looking at right now is where the bar
kind<00:05:56.069> of<00:05:56.190> rolls<00:05:56.430> across<00:05:56.639> then<00:05:57.479> it<00:05:57.629> hits<00:05:57.750> the

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
kind of rolls across then it hits the

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.570 
kind of rolls across then it hits the
flat<00:05:58.110> side<00:05:58.379> once<00:05:58.710> it<00:05:58.800> hits<00:05:58.949> the<00:05:59.039> flat<00:05:59.279> side

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
flat side once it hits the flat side

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.570 
flat side once it hits the flat side
that's<00:06:00.360> when<00:06:00.690> it<00:06:00.990> locks<00:06:01.620> in<00:06:01.800> place<00:06:01.830> and<00:06:02.310> now

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
that's when it locks in place and now

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.820 
that's when it locks in place and now
without<00:06:03.120> moving<00:06:03.659> this<00:06:03.779> down<00:06:04.139> to<00:06:04.500> get<00:06:04.620> it<00:06:04.740> out

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
without moving this down to get it out

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.529 
without moving this down to get it out
of<00:06:04.919> the<00:06:04.979> way<00:06:05.159> to<00:06:05.669> the<00:06:05.759> round<00:06:05.969> side<00:06:06.210> again

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
of the way to the round side again

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.600 
of the way to the round side again
there's<00:06:07.469> no<00:06:07.650> way<00:06:07.800> it<00:06:07.979> has<00:06:08.069> anywhere<00:06:08.370> to<00:06:08.430> move

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
there's no way it has anywhere to move

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.219 
there's no way it has anywhere to move
that's<00:06:09.150> that's<00:06:09.569> where<00:06:09.750> your<00:06:09.839> locking

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
that's that's where your locking

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.439 
that's that's where your locking
mechanism<00:06:10.680> comes<00:06:10.800> in<00:06:11.009> play<00:06:11.270> okay<00:06:12.270> and<00:06:12.360> then

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
mechanism comes in play okay and then

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:16.550 
mechanism comes in play okay and then
obviously<00:06:12.830> unlocking<00:06:13.830> the<00:06:15.349> studs<00:06:16.349> here

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
obviously unlocking the studs here

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.469 
obviously unlocking the studs here
pulling<00:06:16.830> them<00:06:17.009> down<00:06:17.039> will<00:06:17.789> unlock<00:06:18.120> the<00:06:18.300> blade

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
pulling them down will unlock the blade

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:19.959 
pulling them down will unlock the blade
allowing<00:06:18.900> it<00:06:18.960> to<00:06:18.990> move<00:06:19.080> freely<00:06:19.379> again<00:06:19.740> and

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:19.969 
allowing it to move freely again and

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:23.540 
allowing it to move freely again and
then<00:06:20.969> the<00:06:21.150> close<00:06:21.330> by<00:06:21.870> design<00:06:22.319> it<00:06:23.129> keeps<00:06:23.430> the

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
then the close by design it keeps the

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.189 
then the close by design it keeps the
knife<00:06:23.699> closed<00:06:24.089> so<00:06:24.240> it<00:06:24.300> doesn't<00:06:24.539> like<00:06:24.750> full<00:06:25.050> the

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 
knife closed so it doesn't like full the

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:26.540 
knife closed so it doesn't like full the
blade<00:06:25.409> doesn't<00:06:25.560> fall<00:06:25.830> open<00:06:26.099> it<00:06:26.219> has<00:06:26.339> that

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
blade doesn't fall open it has that

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.610 
blade doesn't fall open it has that
tension<00:06:27.060> in<00:06:27.779> the<00:06:27.870> beginning<00:06:28.259> as<00:06:28.349> you<00:06:28.440> see

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
tension in the beginning as you see

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.850 
tension in the beginning as you see
there<00:06:28.800> so<00:06:29.870> really<00:06:30.870> really<00:06:31.080> strong<00:06:31.379> lock<00:06:31.589> a<00:06:31.620> lot

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
there so really really strong lock a lot

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.439 
there so really really strong lock a lot
of<00:06:31.949> people<00:06:32.159> love<00:06:32.339> it<00:06:32.459> they<00:06:32.669> preferred<00:06:33.270> over
