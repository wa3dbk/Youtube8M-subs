00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.870 
this I think that the Securities wasn't
there<00:01:58.649> in<00:01:58.770> time<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.159> like<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.399> statement

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
there in time just like the statement

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.580 
there in time just like the statement
and<00:02:00.119> if<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.329> looked<00:02:00.570> security<00:02:01.110> was<00:02:01.229> running

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
and if you looked security was running

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.340 
and if you looked security was running
over<00:02:02.520> there<00:02:02.670> quick<00:02:02.939> as<00:02:03.119> they<00:02:03.240> could<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.750> me<00:02:04.320> I

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
over there quick as they could to me I

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.690
