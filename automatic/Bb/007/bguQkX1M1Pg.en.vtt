00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
not you know any biological or physical

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.899 
not you know any biological or physical
-<00:01:16.970> it's<00:01:17.210> mainly<00:01:17.600> a<00:01:17.810> clinical<00:01:18.350> decision<00:01:18.909> but

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
- it's mainly a clinical decision but

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.640 
- it's mainly a clinical decision but
for<00:01:20.119> psychiatry<00:01:20.600> there<00:01:20.780> is<00:01:20.840> no<00:01:20.990> specific<00:01:21.229> test

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
for psychiatry there is no specific test

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.590 
for psychiatry there is no specific test
and<00:01:21.920> that's<00:01:22.070> what<00:01:22.430> actually<00:01:22.610> fascinates<00:01:23.540> me

and that's what actually fascinates me

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.620 
and that's what actually fascinates me
about<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.900> circuit<00:01:24.259> this

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.600 

it's<00:01:28.229> not<00:01:28.439> if<00:01:28.590> there's<00:01:28.890> there's<00:01:29.130> no<00:01:29.340> specific

and someone else doesn't know physical
biological<00:01:43.290> tests<00:01:44.009> exist<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.580> support<00:01:44.759> this

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
biological tests exist to support this

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.960 
biological tests exist to support this
is<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.990> mental<00:01:46.259> illness<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:47.180> mental<00:01:48.180> illness

question I'm done - so are there any

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.309 
question I'm done - so are there any
tests<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:02.280> actually<00:02:02.550> support<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:03.319> little

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
tests to actually support a little

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.999 
tests to actually support a little
physical<00:02:04.800> test<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.159> support<00:02:05.520> mental<00:02:05.729> illness

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009

physical illnesses like like so don't

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.709 
physical illnesses like like so don't
have<00:02:41.219> any<00:02:41.340> physical<00:02:41.489> biological<00:02:41.939> tests<00:02:42.510> to

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
have any physical biological tests to

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:53.229 
have any physical biological tests to
support

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:59.740
