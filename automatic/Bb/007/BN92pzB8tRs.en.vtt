00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 In any case it will start windows 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:10.800
 is and a little gambling, after all 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.509
 so he has is whether delling registry is 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.870
 However, that means now is the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.430
 registry still set up 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.720
 she is already set up but that is 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.150
 a few things that just now 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.430
 be told in the background 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.019
 that you are almost on windows server 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.449
 business services 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.869
 that means there will be services first 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.610
 all started so it had meant 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.320
 I can print that one 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.430
 Screen works that the mouse 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.680
 does that work and keyboard 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.960
 works all these services 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.510
 soundcard that you simply need 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.890
 so that the system can run 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.920
 now the installation 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.260
 completed so if it is everything 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.809
 is installed both contini after 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.850
 restoring your computer 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.480
 that means my computer will be new now 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:04.640
 Windows will now be the first 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:07.439
 Let's start some more 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.909
 facilities settings for the 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.189
 use first 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.659
 the tracking for the performance he 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.520
 now checks if the graphics card fast 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.970
 Enough is all done is go 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.810
 a username a bk password 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.040
 I do not want to enter one now 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.450
 Now nothing activating here , too 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.369
 I do not enter a product key 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.439
 just later and in foil 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.009
 settings use amsterdam berlin 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.049
 Etc 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.380
 blablabla everything is perfect the time 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.299
 is perfect i am in the home network in it 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.770
 I do not want any folders now 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.229
 release somewhere was done 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.110
 just skip it 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.810
 windows is supposed to be of all things now 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.780
 will be the last settings 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:59.690
 hopefully made and windows 7 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:01.220
 ultimate is finished the 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.080
 we prepared that means that specifically 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.880
 will now be loaded into the cache 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.430
 probably changed the old sizes 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:13.880
 and cetera the position prepares the 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:15.020
 tester the start bar the whole 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.990
 stories are going to happen again 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.150
 worked 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.160
 Now we have windows 7 installed 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.790
 dollar everything seems to be there 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.310
 Now there will be a few updates 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.050
 down and what we want to do we want 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:37.300
 press again the apple and the old 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:41.510
 Taste that we here in devices the guest 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.220
 extensions can install the 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.050
 Gas expansion of the we will think it 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.780
 see if they are installed 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.260
 they are quite important for the 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.850
 function of windows that is for the 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:59.240
 cooperation between windows and 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:05.209
 between the virtualbox and the 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:06.739
 host system in the case so max yes that 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.709
 we want we make the folk 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:14.500
 windows editioun there excel run 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:16.690
 go on to continue the run yes 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.660
 Install it all is perfect 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.750
 this guest editions is handy for 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.209
 once in graphics cards 3 was 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.080
 on the other hand it is a sound cards 3 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:32.269
 bar usb driver practically you can 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.400
 Imagine that as if you were one 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.320
 motherboard buys and there is this 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.260
 driver cd thereby became the 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.390
 usb ports of the sata connection this 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.060
 things to be installed with 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.430
 so you just work better 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.680
 they work under windows 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.900
 but there are manufacturers 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.130
 program the three bar itself that 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.070
 means the used one is not so 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.290
 called generic drivers but the 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.910
 used special drivers and so must 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.010
 you can imagine that here too 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:05.690
 Do you want to open these devices like this ? 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.130
 her, of course, always 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.630
 Trust because he will be one now 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.970
 few drivers have to install after 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.390
 if you always have to click that way 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.770
 if all this is installed he wants 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.570
 Restart windows do that of course 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:22.110
 for the nation finish 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:26.430
 now the windows down reports 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.510
 windows prepares us for that 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.460
 he updates a few more and to 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.280
 it has to be like the maria it is now 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.370
 everything installed and he should now 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.780
 windows for the first time restart with 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.710
 Almost all three of them were me 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.660
 have installed 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.000
 it was easy to see if there because 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.120
 a start sound comes when we do that 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.580
 have installed these alley editions 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.960
 we see a message at the first start 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.850
 the virtual machine is reporting 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.130
 Support of the mouse pointer integration 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.040
 By the guest system this means that 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:01.140
 the mouse does not have to be caught 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.730
 means that means I want this one 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.070
 no longer display the message 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.870
 we would be the same see you see 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.270
 go in with the mouse here and go 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.180
 get out and go in again 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.390
 get out the mouse is now handy if 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.540
 I cross the window 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.230
 captured 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.410
 and if I let go out again 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:24.840
 Virtualbox you go again and leave my 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.700
 house system work with it 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.700
 what we had in the beginning that me 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.320
 you have to click with the old one 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.680
 apple button that lacks virtually everything 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.260
 completely gone so this is now our 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.630
 first real state windows is 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:43.620
 So it works with the mouse 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:46.100
 purely you press here on the state with 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:49.410
 ships 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.450
 I will not seitz proposed and 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.850
 using express employment is also 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:56.760
 everything okay but internet explorers 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.290
 I prepare once I close all 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.810
 register gave it too cool 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.740
 yes that was the tutorial I wanted 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.360
 you show that you windows 7 in 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.010
 magix usable via the virtualbox 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.680
 can run that is right 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.260
 I'm running that fast 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.570
 installation has all are all 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.980
 with all three track updates etc 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.100
 ca 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.410
 took an hour as well as easy 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:26.760
 a useful value says so 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:29.370
 already an equivalent to how that in 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.600
 the real installation practically too 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:36.330
 we are now driving down the computer 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.880
 he turns off the virtual box sets and 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.090
 that was it with my tutorial 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.670
 here www.auto.de 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:48.290
 I hope we see each other here more often 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.290
 I am the bernd and tell you
