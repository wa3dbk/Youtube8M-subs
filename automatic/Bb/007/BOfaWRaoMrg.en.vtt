00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
everyday cars on the racetrack coming up

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:49.430 
everyday cars on the racetrack coming up
next<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.620> fast<00:00:34.860> lane<00:00:35.010> car

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.950 

before<00:00:50.440> you<00:00:50.590> 10<00:00:50.890> road<00:00:51.250> cars<00:00:51.610> reviewed<00:00:52.480> on<00:00:52.690> the

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
before you 10 road cars reviewed on the

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.400 
before you 10 road cars reviewed on the
racetrack<00:00:53.260> why<00:00:54.160> well<00:00:54.880> because<00:00:55.270> we<00:00:55.420> can<00:00:55.660> no<00:00:55.900> no

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
racetrack why well because we can no no

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.070 
racetrack why well because we can no no
we<00:00:56.950> think<00:00:57.190> that<00:00:57.490> if<00:00:57.700> a<00:00:57.910> road<00:00:58.240> car<00:00:58.540> does<00:00:58.780> well<00:00:59.050> on

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
we think that if a road car does well on

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.200 
we think that if a road car does well on
the<00:00:59.380> racetrack<00:00:59.590> it'll<00:01:00.280> do<00:01:00.400> exceptionally

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
the racetrack it'll do exceptionally

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.200 
the racetrack it'll do exceptionally
well<00:01:01.450> on<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.840> road<00:01:01.990> so<00:01:02.740> starting<00:01:03.190> today<00:01:03.370> we're

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
well on the road so starting today we're

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.240 
well on the road so starting today we're
going<00:01:04.330> to<00:01:04.390> do<00:01:04.480> these<00:01:04.630> in<00:01:04.870> order<00:01:04.900> of<00:01:05.470> lap<00:01:05.860> times

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
going to do these in order of lap times

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.420 
going to do these in order of lap times
with<00:01:06.760> the<00:01:07.210> slowest<00:01:07.630> to<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:07.900> fastest<00:01:08.430> coming

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430
