00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.039 
I'm going to show you how to get better
water<00:00:04.620> pressure<00:00:05.029> what<00:00:06.029> you<00:00:06.150> can<00:00:06.270> do<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.690> if<00:00:06.990> you

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
water pressure what you can do is if you

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.500 
water pressure what you can do is if you
have<00:00:07.440> poor<00:00:07.830> water<00:00:08.130> pressure<00:00:08.429> at<00:00:08.760> your<00:00:08.820> faucet

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
have poor water pressure at your faucet

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.320 
have poor water pressure at your faucet
you<00:00:09.690> can<00:00:10.469> simply<00:00:11.040> remove<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.580> aerator<00:00:12.000> and

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
you can simply remove the aerator and

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.020 
you can simply remove the aerator and
clean<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.200> out<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.620> aerator<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.429> this<00:00:14.759> little

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
clean it out the aerator is this little

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.269 
clean it out the aerator is this little
guy<00:00:15.179> that's<00:00:15.599> located<00:00:15.990> at<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.560> tip<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:17.010> your

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
guy that's located at the tip of your

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.470 
guy that's located at the tip of your
faucet<00:00:18.410> so<00:00:19.410> what<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.680> do<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.580> unscrew<00:00:20.939> the

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
faucet so what you do is unscrew the

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.689 
faucet so what you do is unscrew the
aerator<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.710> lot<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.100> lot<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.369> times<00:00:23.550> you

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
aerator and a lot of a lot of times you

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.849 
aerator and a lot of a lot of times you
can<00:00:23.850> do<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.090> just<00:00:24.269> with<00:00:24.420> your<00:00:24.600> fingers<00:00:25.109> but

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
can do it just with your fingers but

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.500 
can do it just with your fingers but
sometimes<00:00:26.310> they're<00:00:26.550> frozen<00:00:26.939> on<00:00:27.060> they're<00:00:27.300> so

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
sometimes they're frozen on they're so

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.900 
sometimes they're frozen on they're so
good<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:28.349> you'll<00:00:28.529> need<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:29.039> get<00:00:29.189> some

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
good that you'll need to get some

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.299 
good that you'll need to get some
channel<00:00:30.240> locks<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.840> instead<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.920> putting<00:00:32.219> it

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
channel locks and instead of putting it

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.850 
channel locks and instead of putting it
right<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:33.120> aerator<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.870> getting<00:00:34.739> these

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
right on the aerator and getting these

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.370 
right on the aerator and getting these
teeth<00:00:35.219> marks<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.660> aerator

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
teeth marks on the aerator

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.590 
teeth marks on the aerator
and<00:00:37.680> making<00:00:37.950> an<00:00:38.070> ugly<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:39.000> can<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.300> simply

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and making an ugly you can just simply

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.209 
and making an ugly you can just simply
put<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> rag<00:00:40.050> over<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.860> put<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> aerator

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
put a rag over it put it on the aerator

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.220 
put a rag over it put it on the aerator
give<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.399> little<00:00:44.520> spin<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.270> now<00:00:46.020> I've

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
give it a little spin and now I've

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.590 
give it a little spin and now I've
loosened<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.770> enough<00:00:47.039> where<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:47.969> can<00:00:48.210> get<00:00:48.450> it

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
loosened it enough where I can get it

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.220 
loosened it enough where I can get it
with<00:00:48.690> my<00:00:48.840> finger<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:50.449> take<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.570> off<00:00:51.690> like<00:00:51.930> this

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
with my finger and take it off like this

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.799 
with my finger and take it off like this
now<00:00:53.039> here's<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.520> thing<00:00:53.730> when<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.360> take<00:00:54.539> this

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
now here's the thing when you take this

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.740 
now here's the thing when you take this
you<00:00:55.199> see<00:00:55.379> how<00:00:55.500> much<00:00:55.680> rust<00:00:56.190> sometimes<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.180> a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
you see how much rust sometimes and a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.689 
you see how much rust sometimes and a
lot<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.020> times<00:00:58.199> we'll<00:00:58.379> get<00:00:58.500> calcium<00:00:59.100> deposits

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
lot of times we'll get calcium deposits

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.790 
lot of times we'll get calcium deposits
and<00:00:59.850> things<00:01:00.120> like<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.750> there<00:01:00.989> now<00:01:01.559> this

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
and things like that in there now this

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.470 
and things like that in there now this
is<00:01:02.039> preventing<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> water<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:03.149> flow<00:01:03.449> through

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
is preventing the water to flow through

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.950 
is preventing the water to flow through
it<00:01:03.930> properly<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:05.309> very<00:01:05.519> simply<00:01:06.030> what<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.420> like

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
it properly so very simply what I like

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.890 
it properly so very simply what I like
to<00:01:07.140> do<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:08.100> run<00:01:08.310> some<00:01:08.580> water<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.210> clear

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
to do is just run some water and clear

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.929 
to do is just run some water and clear
that<00:01:10.049> out<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> little<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:11.119> run<00:01:12.119> some<00:01:12.390> water<00:01:12.420> and

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
that out a little to run some water and

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.880 
that out a little to run some water and
clean<00:01:14.939> all<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.509> stuff<00:01:16.110> out<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.619> top<00:01:16.860> like

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
clean all that stuff out of the top like

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:41.220 
clean all that stuff out of the top like
this

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.470 

and<00:01:42.230> if<00:01:42.380> they're<00:01:42.610> so<00:01:43.610> bad<00:01:43.910> that<00:01:44.210> you<00:01:44.390> don't

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
and if they're so bad that you don't

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.690 
and if they're so bad that you don't
want<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.780> replace<00:01:45.050> it<00:01:45.440> these<00:01:46.160> things<00:01:46.370> are<00:01:46.580> only

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
want to replace it these things are only

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.370 
want to replace it these things are only
a<00:01:46.820> few<00:01:47.090> dollars<00:01:47.270> down<00:01:47.690> at<00:01:47.870> the<00:01:47.960> hardware<00:01:48.350> store

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.840 

once<00:01:54.380> I've<00:01:54.530> got<00:01:54.710> it<00:01:54.740> as<00:01:54.979> clean<00:01:55.370> as<00:01:55.400> I'd<00:01:55.670> like<00:01:55.820> it

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
once I've got it as clean as I'd like it

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.080 
once I've got it as clean as I'd like it
you<00:01:56.630> can<00:01:56.810> put<00:01:56.960> it<00:01:57.050> back<00:01:57.200> together<00:01:57.970> simply<00:01:58.970> by

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
you can put it back together simply by

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.710 
you can put it back together simply by
screwing<00:01:59.390> it<00:01:59.570> on<00:01:59.720> and<00:02:01.330> testing<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:02.570> make

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
screwing it on and testing it to make

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.870 
screwing it on and testing it to make
sure<00:02:02.900> you've<00:02:03.110> got<00:02:03.259> it<00:02:03.290> tighten<00:02:03.710> up<00:02:06.430> and<00:02:07.430> your

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
sure you've got it tighten up and your

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.990 
sure you've got it tighten up and your
water<00:02:08.090> pressure<00:02:08.300> should<00:02:08.690> be<00:02:08.810> much<00:02:08.990> better

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
water pressure should be much better

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.090 
water pressure should be much better
what<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.120> can<00:02:11.240> also<00:02:11.450> do<00:02:11.750> while<00:02:12.380> you<00:02:12.650> have<00:02:12.890> the

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
what you can also do while you have the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.030 
what you can also do while you have the
aerator<00:02:13.459> off<00:02:14.230> if<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.380> notice<00:02:15.740> there's<00:02:15.950> a

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
aerator off if you notice there's a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.940 
aerator off if you notice there's a
