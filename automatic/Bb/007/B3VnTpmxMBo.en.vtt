00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.969 
four dimensions going on we got the
excise<00:01:21.930> either<00:01:22.170> mentioned<00:01:22.470> we<00:01:22.770> got<00:01:22.890> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
excise either mentioned we got the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.679 
excise either mentioned we got the
fusion<00:01:23.310> dimension<00:01:23.820> we've<00:01:24.240> got<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.420> synchro

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
fusion dimension we've got the synchro

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.480 
fusion dimension we've got the synchro
dimension<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.290> then<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:25.500> got<00:01:25.590> standard<00:01:26.189> which

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
dimension and then we got standard which

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.920 
dimension and then we got standard which
is<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.850> current<00:01:27.240> dimensional<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.810> know

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
is the current dimensional you know

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.210 
is the current dimensional you know
holds<00:01:28.229> all<00:01:28.409> which<00:01:28.560> i'm<00:01:28.740> guessing<00:01:28.860> that's

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
holds all which i'm guessing that's

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.160 
holds all which i'm guessing that's
where<00:01:29.340> pendulum<00:01:29.909> was<00:01:30.329> found<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.810> its<00:01:31.020> only

heartland is a part of their and as you
see<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> fusion<00:01:55.680> one<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.130> though<00:01:56.250> on

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
see with the fusion one that though on

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.950 
see with the fusion one that though on
the<00:01:56.490> island<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.030> they<00:01:57.149> had<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.479> know<00:01:57.509> slice

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
the island and they had you know slice

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.469 
the island and they had you know slice
of<00:01:58.170> red<00:01:58.380> route<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:59.070> know<00:01:59.100> yellow<00:01:59.880> you<00:01:59.939> know<00:02:00.270> so

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
of red route you know yellow you know so

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.179 
of red route you know yellow you know so
I<00:02:00.630> Ovilus<00:02:01.020> blue<00:02:01.290> then<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.649> saw<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.159> know

I Ovilus blue then you saw that you know

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.830 
I Ovilus blue then you saw that you know
that's<00:02:02.460> connected<00:02:02.850> GX<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.390> then<00:02:03.509> as<00:02:03.659> well

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
that's connected GX and then as well

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.810 
that's connected GX and then as well
with<00:02:04.020> also<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> single<00:02:05.130> dimension<00:02:05.219> we<00:02:05.640> get

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
with also the single dimension we get

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.700 
with also the single dimension we get
see<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.509> they<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.659> their<00:02:06.930> motorcycles<00:02:07.560> no

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
see that they have their motorcycles no

see that they have their motorcycles no
land<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.129> know<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.399> whole<00:02:08.550> sink<00:02:08.789> or

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
land you know the whole sink or

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.059 
land you know the whole sink or
something<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.330> it's<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.959> lot<00:02:10.229> very<00:02:10.500> interesting

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
something so it's a lot very interesting
