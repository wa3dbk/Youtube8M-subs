repeat now it's just my personal opinion

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.480 
repeat now it's just my personal opinion
so<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.580> DJI<00:00:51.170> phantom<00:00:52.170> one<00:00:52.470> is<00:00:52.710> good<00:00:53.250> drone

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
so the DJI phantom one is good drone

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.040 
so the DJI phantom one is good drone
it's<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.700> proper<00:00:54.000> drone<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.480> does<00:00:54.720> a<00:00:54.750> good<00:00:54.990> job

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
it's a proper drone it does a good job

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.990 
it's a proper drone it does a good job
right<00:00:55.500> up<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> air<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.310> was<00:00:56.460> flying<00:00:56.700> it<00:00:56.910> as

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
right up in the air I was flying it as

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.730 
right up in the air I was flying it as
well<00:00:57.210> but<00:00:57.690> only<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.990> couple<00:00:58.200> of<00:00:58.320> times<00:00:58.560> because

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:58.740 
well but only a couple of times because

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.039 
well but only a couple of times because
I<00:00:58.950> was<00:00:59.250> really<00:01:01.040> it's<00:01:02.040> just<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:03.300> battery<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.810> so

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
I was really it's just the battery is so

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.319 
I was really it's just the battery is so
weak<00:01:04.290> yeah<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.610> only<00:01:05.790> be<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> air

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:06.329 
weak yeah you can only be up in the air

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:08.270 
weak yeah you can only be up in the air
for<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.750> couple<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.110> minutes<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.530> if<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.100> then

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
for a couple of minutes and if you then

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.370 
for a couple of minutes and if you then
attach<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:10.430> camera<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.329> I<00:01:12.479> mean<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.350> can

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
attach a camera to to it I mean you can

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.780 
attach a camera to to it I mean you can
just<00:01:13.799> forget<00:01:14.159> about<00:01:14.340> it

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
just forget about it

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.700 
just forget about it
but<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.509> batteries<00:01:16.079> are<00:01:16.170> actually<00:01:16.470> very

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
but the batteries are actually very

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.620 
but the batteries are actually very
cheap<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.490> you're<00:01:17.850> getting<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.300> phantom

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
cheap so if you're getting the phantom

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.170 
cheap so if you're getting the phantom
one<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.770> really<00:01:20.159> buy<00:01:20.340> several<00:01:20.940> batteries

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
one you can really buy several batteries

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.330 
one you can really buy several batteries
and<00:01:21.690> put<00:01:22.290> them<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.500> there<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.100> course

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
and put them in there but of course

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.610 
and put them in there but of course
every<00:01:23.670> time<00:01:23.909> while<00:01:24.420> changing<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.200> got<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.470> fly

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
every time while changing you got to fly

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.080 
every time while changing you got to fly
back<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.159> land<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.670> takes<00:01:26.909> some<00:01:26.970> time

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
back and land and that takes some time

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.420 
back and land and that takes some time
so<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.479> would<00:01:27.690> recommend<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.350> stepping<00:01:29.100> up<00:01:29.250> to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
so I would recommend you stepping up to

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.210 
so I would recommend you stepping up to
the<00:01:29.729> DJI<00:01:30.210> phantom<00:01:30.659> 2<00:01:30.690> but<00:01:31.290> there<00:01:31.830> are<00:01:31.950> two

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the DJI phantom 2 but there are two

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.430 
the DJI phantom 2 but there are two
available<00:01:32.460> as<00:01:32.850> well<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.510> the<00:01:33.720> simple<00:01:34.170> DJI

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
available as well it's the simple DJI

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.160 
available as well it's the simple DJI
phantom<00:01:34.799> 2<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.610> DJI<00:01:35.940> phantom<00:01:36.510> 2<00:01:36.720> vision

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
phantom 2 and the DJI phantom 2 vision

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.860 
phantom 2 and the DJI phantom 2 vision
so<00:01:37.890> now<00:01:38.010> let's<00:01:38.190> talk<00:01:38.310> about<00:01:38.370> them<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> DJI

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
so now let's talk about them so the DJI

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.899 
so now let's talk about them so the DJI
2<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.440> DJI<00:01:40.740> 2<00:01:40.920> vision<00:01:41.340> they<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.670> a

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
2 and the DJI 2 vision they have a

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.200 
2 and the DJI 2 vision they have a
difference<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.290> DJI<00:01:43.590> 2<00:01:43.710> vision<00:01:44.130> has<00:01:44.610> an

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
difference the DJI 2 vision has an

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.750 
difference the DJI 2 vision has an
inbuilt<00:01:45.630> camera<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.280> if<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.580> need<00:01:47.729> a

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
inbuilt camera to it so if you need a

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.730 
inbuilt camera to it so if you need a
camera<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.869> might<00:01:49.020> go<00:01:49.200> with<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.470> one<00:01:49.619> but

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
camera you might go with that one but

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.039 
camera you might go with that one but
don't<00:01:49.950> forget<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.940> can<00:01:51.210> because<00:01:51.869> I've

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
don't forget that you can because I've

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.649 
don't forget that you can because I've
got<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.770> DJI<00:01:53.070> phantom<00:01:53.490> 2<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:53.790> me<00:01:53.940> as<00:01:54.270> most<00:01:54.479> of

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
got the DJI phantom 2 with me as most of

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.719 
got the DJI phantom 2 with me as most of
the<00:01:54.750> time<00:01:55.159> you<00:01:56.159> can<00:01:56.369> put<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.540> camera<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.280> DJI

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
the time you can put a camera to the DJI

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.539 
the time you can put a camera to the DJI
phantom<00:02:00.360> 2<00:02:00.570> as<00:02:01.200> well<00:02:01.470> so<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.400> actually

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
phantom 2 as well so that is actually

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.480 
phantom 2 as well so that is actually
simple<00:02:03.140> it<00:02:04.140> depends<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:04.680> what<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.010> want<00:02:05.280> if

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
simple it depends on what you want if

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.350 
simple it depends on what you want if
you<00:02:05.909> really<00:02:06.299> want<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.510> go<00:02:06.659> for<00:02:08.000> just<00:02:09.000> getting

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
you really want to go for just getting

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.839 
you really want to go for just getting
some<00:02:09.750> aerial<00:02:10.289> shots<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.189> you<00:02:11.519> don't<00:02:11.670> really

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
some aerial shots and you don't really

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.240 
some aerial shots and you don't really
care<00:02:11.970> about<00:02:12.470> issues<00:02:13.470> as<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.830> jello<00:02:14.040> effect

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
care about issues as the jello effect

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.570 
care about issues as the jello effect
and<00:02:14.819> stuff<00:02:15.510> like<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.439> can<00:02:16.470> simply<00:02:17.340> go

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
and stuff like that you can simply go

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.559 
and stuff like that you can simply go
with<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.879> to<00:02:18.090> vision<00:02:19.730> because<00:02:20.730> it's<00:02:21.180> just<00:02:21.450> the

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
with the to vision because it's just the

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.659 
with the to vision because it's just the
camera<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.139> it's<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.799> nice<00:02:22.950> camera<00:02:23.159> and<00:02:23.549> it

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
they're way better than the camera of

they're way better than the camera of
the<00:03:03.660> 2<00:03:03.810> Vision+<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:05.040> can<00:03:05.340> if<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.670> have<00:03:05.820> the

the 2 Vision+ you can if you have the

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.910 
the 2 Vision+ you can if you have the
money<00:03:06.030> by<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:08.510> system<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.680> stabilizes<00:03:10.680> the

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
money by a system that stabilizes the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.770 
money by a system that stabilizes the
camera<00:03:11.310> it's<00:03:11.459> that<00:03:11.640> system<00:03:12.120> right<00:03:12.150> here

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
camera it's that system right here

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.870 
camera it's that system right here
it's<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.380> gimbal<00:03:13.800> that's<00:03:14.220> what<00:03:14.340> it's<00:03:14.490> called

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
it's a gimbal that's what it's called

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.960 
it's a gimbal that's what it's called
it's<00:03:15.270> a<00:03:15.390> gimbal<00:03:15.630> system<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:17.130> I<00:03:17.580> mean<00:03:17.700> when

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
it's a gimbal system and it I mean when

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.610 
it's a gimbal system and it I mean when
it's<00:03:18.120> turned<00:03:18.420> on<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.660> keeps<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.350> camera

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
it's turned on it keeps the camera

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.340 
it's turned on it keeps the camera
steady<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:21.150> really<00:03:21.510> does<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.690> great<00:03:21.870> job<00:03:21.930> on

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
steady and it really does a great job on

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.260 
steady and it really does a great job on
it<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.620> mean<00:03:24.590> it's<00:03:25.590> it's<00:03:26.310> just<00:03:26.520> way<00:03:26.790> better<00:03:27.000> than

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
it I mean it's it's just way better than

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.360 
it I mean it's it's just way better than
the<00:03:27.420> tewevision<00:03:27.750> or<00:03:28.020> just<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.680> GoPro<00:03:29.100> attached

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
the tewevision or just a GoPro attached

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.280 
the tewevision or just a GoPro attached
to<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:29.730> old<00:03:29.880> phantom<00:03:30.240> one<00:03:30.420> because<00:03:31.080> the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
to the old phantom one because the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.530 
to the old phantom one because the
gimbal<00:03:31.650> plus<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.160> GoPro<00:03:32.489> Hero<00:03:32.700> 3<00:03:32.790> or<00:03:33.120> 3<00:03:33.300> plus

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
gimbal plus the GoPro Hero 3 or 3 plus

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.360 
gimbal plus the GoPro Hero 3 or 3 plus
is<00:03:33.720> really<00:03:34.590> an<00:03:34.709> awesome<00:03:36.830> it's<00:03:37.830> just<00:03:38.160> an

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
is really an awesome it's just an

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
you might get the vision to put a

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.910 
you might get the vision to put a
efficient<00:03:58.110> 2<00:03:58.230> plus<00:03:58.440> now<00:03:58.590> I'm<00:03:58.709> getting
