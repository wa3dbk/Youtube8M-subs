in<00:00:07.920> the<00:00:08.010> Quincy<00:00:08.370> office<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.820> Harvard<00:00:09.120> Vanguard

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:09.270 
in the Quincy office of Harvard Vanguard

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.609 
in the Quincy office of Harvard Vanguard
I've<00:00:09.990> been<00:00:10.200> in<00:00:10.320> practice<00:00:10.500> since<00:00:11.000> 2004<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.619> love

being<00:00:13.860> an<00:00:13.949> OBGYN<00:00:14.580> for<00:00:14.850> several<00:00:15.299> reasons<00:00:15.719> I

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
being an OBGYN for several reasons I

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.109 
being an OBGYN for several reasons I
think<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.590> most<00:00:16.860> important<00:00:17.550> reason<00:00:17.970> is

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
think the most important reason is

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.169 
think the most important reason is
because<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.810> get<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.830> share<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.490> woman's<00:00:20.910> life

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:21.179 
because I get to share a woman's life

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:24.620 
because I get to share a woman's life
throughout<00:00:22.109> her<00:00:22.439> entire<00:00:22.560> life<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.119> know

throughout her entire life so you know
from<00:00:24.990> her<00:00:25.439> teen<00:00:25.679> years<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.189> her<00:00:26.339> 20s<00:00:26.759> into

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:27.259 
from her teen years and her 20s into

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.230 
from her teen years and her 20s into
childbearing<00:00:28.259> and<00:00:28.849> perimenopause<00:00:29.849> and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
childbearing and perimenopause and

childbearing and perimenopause and
menopause<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:31.259> and<00:00:31.560> beyond<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.430> I<00:00:32.669> really

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
menopause and and beyond so I really

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.700 
menopause and and beyond so I really
feel<00:00:33.510> like<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.780> get<00:00:34.050> testable<00:00:34.560> --is--

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.970 
it's really special to be there at
multiple<00:00:41.910> aspects<00:00:42.359> of<00:00:42.539> somebody's<00:00:42.930> life<00:00:43.170> so

questions<00:01:06.330> about<00:01:06.810> history<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:07.980> also<00:01:08.160> think

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
questions about history but I also think

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.130 
questions about history but I also think
it's<00:01:08.610> really<00:01:08.670> important<00:01:09.420> when<00:01:09.510> people<00:01:09.720> come

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
it's really important when people come

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.530 
it's really important when people come
in<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:11.520> an<00:01:11.640> idea<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.940> what<00:01:12.120> they<00:01:12.240> want<00:01:12.450> to

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
in and have an idea of what they want to

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.660 
in and have an idea of what they want to
talk<00:01:12.750> about<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.800> I<00:01:13.830> actually<00:01:13.980> really<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.520> it

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
talk about so I actually really like it

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.010 
talk about so I actually really like it
when<00:01:14.790> people<00:01:14.820> come<00:01:15.240> in<00:01:15.360> with<00:01:15.510> lists<00:01:15.900> of

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
when people come in with lists of

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.050 
when people come in with lists of
questions<00:01:16.710> because<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.370> way<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.670> know<00:01:17.790> that

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
questions because that way I know that

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.940 
questions because that way I know that
I'm<00:01:18.180> addressing<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:19.050> things<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.530> she<00:01:19.680> wants

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
I'm addressing the things that she wants

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.400 
I'm addressing the things that she wants
to<00:01:20.070> talk<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.490> me<00:01:20.610> about<00:01:20.900> and<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.990> also<00:01:22.140> think

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:22.410 
to talk to me about and I also think

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.250 
to talk to me about and I also think
it's<00:01:22.620> important<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:24.330> know<00:01:24.450> oftentimes

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
it's important that you know oftentimes

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.170 
it's important that you know oftentimes
you<00:01:25.740> know<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:25.920> TV<00:01:26.130> everything's<00:01:26.730> resolved<00:01:27.090> in

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
you know on TV everything's resolved in

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.180 
you know on TV everything's resolved in
a<00:01:27.240> half-hour<00:01:27.570> sitcom<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.560> that's<00:01:28.740> not<00:01:28.980> real

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
a half-hour sitcom but that's not real

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.310 
a half-hour sitcom but that's not real
life<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.820> that's<00:01:30.300> not<00:01:30.600> my<00:01:30.780> approach<00:01:31.110> to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
life and that's not my approach to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.380 
life and that's not my approach to
medicine<00:01:31.590> either<00:01:31.920> some<00:01:32.820> issues<00:01:33.120> can<00:01:33.360> be

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
medicine either some issues can be

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.540 
medicine either some issues can be
resolved<00:01:33.930> pretty<00:01:34.170> quickly<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:35.310> there<00:01:35.430> are

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
resolved pretty quickly but there are

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.070 
resolved pretty quickly but there are
some<00:01:35.700> issues<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:36.210> take<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.690> lot<00:01:36.930> of

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
some issues that take a lot of

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.810 
some issues that take a lot of
discussion<00:01:37.650> or<00:01:37.950> testing<00:01:38.850> or<00:01:39.110> you<00:01:40.110> know<00:01:40.260> just

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
discussion or testing or you know just

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.970 
discussion or testing or you know just
monitoring<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.870> think<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.440> important

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
monitoring and so I think it's important

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.920 
monitoring and so I think it's important
to<00:01:44.040> come<00:01:44.400> in<00:01:44.580> with<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.180> expectation<00:01:45.510> that

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
to come in with the expectation that

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.540 
to come in with the expectation that
this<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.320> going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> relationship<00:01:47.220> and

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
this is going to be a relationship and

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.460 
this is going to be a relationship and
it's<00:01:47.640> going<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.850> take<00:01:48.060> time<00:01:48.330> sometimes<00:01:49.020> to

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
it's going to take time sometimes to

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.860 
it's going to take time sometimes to
sort<00:01:49.710> things<00:01:49.980> out<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.550> that's<00:01:51.120> okay

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
sort things out and that's okay

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.810 
sort things out and that's okay
I<00:01:51.900> mean<00:01:52.410> it's<00:01:52.560> okay<00:01:52.860> if<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.190> need<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.430> talk<00:01:53.610> to

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
I mean it's okay if you need to talk to

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.300 
I mean it's okay if you need to talk to
