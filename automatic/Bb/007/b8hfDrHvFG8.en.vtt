00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.499 
and we were blessed to have a working
father<00:01:55.799> in<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> house<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.790> mom<00:01:57.000> who<00:01:57.360> was

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
father in the house and a mom who was

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.690 
father in the house and a mom who was
right<00:01:57.750> there<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.979> means<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.430> great<00:01:59.460> deal

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
right there and it means a great deal

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.999 
right there and it means a great deal
and<00:02:00.060> we<00:02:00.180> can't<00:02:00.450> take<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.840> for<00:02:01.110> granted<00:02:01.140> and

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
and we can't take that for granted and

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.100 
and we can't take that for granted and
families<00:02:02.640> can<00:02:02.670> look<00:02:03.090> like<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.509> whole<00:02:03.719> bunch<00:02:03.990> of

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
families can look like a whole bunch of

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.340 
families can look like a whole bunch of
things<00:02:04.399> but<00:02:05.399> kids<00:02:05.700> need<00:02:05.850> those<00:02:06.299> models<00:02:07.079> in

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
things but kids need those models in

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.839 
things but kids need those models in
their<00:02:07.530> lives<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.039> I<00:02:08.160> think<00:02:08.369> we<00:02:08.459> just<00:02:08.489> have<00:02:08.729> to

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
their lives and I think we just have to

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.760 
their lives and I think we just have to
be<00:02:08.970> honest<00:02:09.330> about<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.720> fact<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:10.080> they<00:02:10.259> you
