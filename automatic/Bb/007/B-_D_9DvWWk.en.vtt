delicately the main benefit behind
furrow<00:00:51.180> boletus<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> fact<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.230> they

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
furrow boletus is the fact that they

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.650 
furrow boletus is the fact that they
transfer<00:00:53.579> every<00:00:53.850> bit<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.030> energy<00:00:54.180> from<00:00:54.600> your

transfer every bit of energy from your

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.470 
transfer every bit of energy from your
cast<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.949> with<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> tapered<00:00:56.699> leader<00:00:57.000> we<00:00:57.300> all

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
cast so with a tapered leader we all

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.240 
cast so with a tapered leader we all
been<00:00:57.719> there<00:00:57.750> stretching<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:58.949> straighten

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
been there stretching it and straighten

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.650 
been there stretching it and straighten
it<00:00:59.370> out<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.789> trying<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.300> get<00:01:00.390> rid<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.539> the

it out and trying to get rid of the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.709 
it out and trying to get rid of the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
coils if there's any coils left in a

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.200 
coils if there's any coils left in a
tapered<00:01:04.049> leader<00:01:04.430> that<00:01:05.430> Rob's<00:01:05.729> your<00:01:05.850> cast<00:01:06.060> of

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
tapered leader that Rob's your cast of

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.149 
tapered leader that Rob's your cast of
memory<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.140> fact<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.439> furled<00:01:07.860> leaders

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
memory and the fact that furled leaders

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.820 
memory and the fact that furled leaders
have<00:01:08.340> no<00:01:08.520> memory<00:01:08.850> every<00:01:09.390> bit<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.570> energy

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
have no memory every bit of energy

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.560 
have no memory every bit of energy
travels<00:01:10.830> through<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.130> leader<00:01:11.360> through<00:01:12.360> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
travels through the leader through to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.570 
travels through the leader through to
the<00:01:12.689> tippet<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.080> ultimately<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.860> fly<00:01:14.040> so

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the tippet and ultimately to you fly so

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.490 
the tippet and ultimately to you fly so
therefore<00:01:14.850> your<00:01:14.970> presentation<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.689> pretty

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
therefore your presentation is pretty

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.830 
therefore your presentation is pretty
much<00:01:16.619> enhanced<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:17.909> you're<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.090> dry<00:01:18.270> fly<00:01:18.509> guy<00:01:18.689> at

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
much enhanced if you're a dry fly guy at

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.630 
much enhanced if you're a dry fly guy at
all<00:01:19.049> probe<00:01:19.830> leaders<00:01:20.070> are<00:01:20.159> definitely<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.520> way

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
all probe leaders are definitely the way

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.660 
all probe leaders are definitely the way
to<00:01:20.670> go<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.590> as<00:01:22.590> mentioned<00:01:22.770> for<00:01:23.100> old<00:01:23.430> leaders

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
to go so as mentioned for old leaders

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.460 
to go so as mentioned for old leaders
have<00:01:23.790> no<00:01:23.939> memory<00:01:24.210> therefore<00:01:24.810> when<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:24.960> open<00:01:25.380> I

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
have no memory therefore when you open I

this leader I'm done
okay<00:02:12.110> now<00:02:13.110> these<00:02:13.319> coils<00:02:13.590> I'm<00:02:13.950> not<00:02:14.220> sure<00:02:14.340> if<00:02:14.459> you

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
okay now these coils I'm not sure if you

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.130 
okay now these coils I'm not sure if you
can<00:02:14.610> see<00:02:14.819> them<00:02:15.000> but<00:02:15.540> we're<00:02:15.750> familiar<00:02:15.959> with

can see them but we're familiar with

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.020 
can see them but we're familiar with
what<00:02:16.350> they<00:02:16.470> have<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.220> be<00:02:17.340> stretched<00:02:17.670> and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
what they have to be stretched and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.780 
what they have to be stretched and
straightens<00:02:18.600> and<00:02:19.080> many<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.650> times<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.280> know

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
straightens and many a times you know

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.340 
straightens and many a times you know
you're<00:02:21.000> hoping<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.360> catch<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.840> first<00:02:22.110> fish

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
to actually straighten up the leader

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.449

entirely<00:02:24.560> with<00:02:25.560> frilled<00:02:25.830> leaders<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.280> don't

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
entirely with frilled leaders you don't

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.850 
entirely with frilled leaders you don't
that's<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.880> non-issue<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.720> basically<00:02:28.080> open

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
that's a non-issue you basically open

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.150 
that's a non-issue you basically open
the<00:02:29.130> leader<00:02:29.310> tie<00:02:29.850> on<00:02:30.060> your<00:02:30.090> tip<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.540> and<00:02:31.160> and

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
the leader tie on your tip it and and

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.800 
the leader tie on your tip it and and
you're<00:02:32.370> ready<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.640> go<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.030> there's<00:02:33.360> none<00:02:33.780> of

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
you're ready to go and there's none of

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.810 
you're ready to go and there's none of

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
that memory none of that coiled mess

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.690 
that memory none of that coiled mess
that<00:02:36.120> lands<00:02:36.330> on<00:02:36.480> top<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.870> water<00:02:37.050> and

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
that lands on top of the water and

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.920 
that lands on top of the water and
making<00:02:38.700> your<00:02:38.910> casting<00:02:39.209> more<00:02:39.390> difficult<00:02:39.780> so

AK well any of them work but the pace
tends<00:03:02.489> to<00:03:02.640> work<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.910> lot<00:03:03.030> better<00:03:03.180> because<00:03:03.540> it

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
tends to work a lot better because it

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.930 
tends to work a lot better because it

dry leader try it to a day efficient the
leader<00:03:28.140> will<00:03:28.380> basically<00:03:28.560> float<00:03:29.100> all<00:03:29.340> day<00:03:29.489> long

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
leader will basically float all day long

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.340 
leader will basically float all day long

unless you have a twenty to thirty fish
day<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.620> might<00:03:31.980> have<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.310> reapply<00:03:32.610> from<00:03:33.570> the

day you might have to reapply from the
fish<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:34.049> know<00:03:34.140> pulling<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.530> leader

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
fish you know pulling the leader

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.440 
fish you know pulling the leader
underwater<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.430> going<00:03:35.610> against<00:03:35.880> vegetation

underwater and going against vegetation
and<00:03:37.640> that's<00:03:38.640> basically<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.209> this<00:03:40.110> leader<00:03:40.380> that

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
and that's basically it this leader that

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.370 
and that's basically it this leader that
I<00:03:40.650> have<00:03:40.799> in<00:03:40.890> my<00:03:41.010> hand<00:03:41.310> is<00:03:41.989> ends<00:03:42.989> in<00:03:43.079> a<00:03:43.170> small
