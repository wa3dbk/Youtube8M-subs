00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.370
 hello everyone to his two rivals in 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.280
 company the atomium for a mood 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.759
 zen for an atmosphere of a word we 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.880
 hated 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.320
 oh yes lounge you're lying on a 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.199
 sofa and listening to music 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.580
 techno hype it's so much that 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.400
 but at the same time it's a game that is 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.050
 a little resting my faith and that is rather 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.480
 not bad to make ben that's for 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.189
 decorate we will say your sessions of 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.869
 two big games mainly then to 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.120
 expectations so this is a game that 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.280
 is called light plug the wood are from 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.809
 light the sequel to cindy's album 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.309
 sanders the butterfly of light 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.050
 was waiting for him all of course going on 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.850
 love it even a cindy if you 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.020
 listen we tell you stop stop stop going 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.180
 although the weight of this contest was 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.020
 a game that came out when then that's 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.120
 a game that came out a little ago 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.750
 moment of that about two years ago and 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.610
 their readers 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.570
 yes we are completely in the news but 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.649
 at the same time it's true that right now 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.789
 there was not much going on 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.160
 today in celebration and suddenly we had 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.010
 want to make presentations to you 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.850
 games that we liked well and so that 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.019
 he did france is a game I had 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.200
 rather liked because I knew 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.640
 very well the game so a kicks 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.080
 the origin of this trailer of this game there and 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.130
 so it's true that it's true 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.800
 bring a touch of freshness a 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.480
 little modernity 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.360
 so why not and we say you 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.280
 present well start somewhere 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.690
 on an imac introduce you to a game of 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.320
 bowling took a lot of fights and salutes 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.430
 well make a kill choke're finally 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.280
 the joke whoever takes pies 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:32.330
 you want no no no no no more 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.470
 late then principle of the game wii rigology 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.760
 mellow France they want I drink it 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.590
 reminds me of a mini games of boli 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.100
 scholarship edition but it's possible 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.420
 that there is going through that thing 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.560
 to yummy yeah so in fact the principle 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.120
 is that you will be able to like that 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.190
 created lines and delimited zones 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.330
 in fact mainly you have a 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.560
 area which is red the zone khz and 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.300
 violet that you do not control the area 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.640
 which rochelle you control and in 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.780
 big and well you can solve the 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.100
 time to get you the smallest 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.380
 part and you're going to have to do without a 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.260
 number of times until you get 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.330
 the 75% which is indicated at the top left 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.380
 of the screen now in the ideal is 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.140
 well what should be done would be 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.620
 to score to do this you have to stop 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.090
 maximum of enemies 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.920
 in delimiting vote represents so in 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.540
 what needs to be inside of 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.350
 what are you going to capture then that is 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.360
 for that in fact you see I'm doing 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.830
 small like that it looks like nothing but 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.960
 it's a super nes and super good because 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.180
 that in addition there is a management of 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.680
 collisions so enemies bounce off 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.550
 in we blow birth I can 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.280
 delimited two years that I can them 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.300
 capture a little bit and so there but you 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.310
 see what I'm going to do in fact it's 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.140
 that I'm just going to delimit this 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.330
 zone there I continue in this direction the 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.090
 agents the envied is there up up boom bim 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.550
 and so I'm going to get some states 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.500
 already 47% of the map then the whole body 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.060
 the whole game relies on it will not have 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.410
 of gameplay variations 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.240
 there will be the hut of course 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.710
 climb into trouble with a lot more 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.850
 of enemies there will be stuff I see 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.230
 that you have small bonuses to recover 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.640
 so it can be interesting to 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.200
 speak yeah so there for example you 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.730
 see it's a shield if I get back I 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.290
 I'm immune so if I want you 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.370
 I pass quiet I hear that it 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.690
 will last for a few seconds 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.640
 this is it so it allows to do 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.610
 a lot of things a little crazy and 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.570
 especially not it will allow to 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.070
 actually actually scoring because 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.390
 there you can go through big areas and 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.830
 towards the end of the game it's almost 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.380
 mandatory to go through a shield 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.550
 to recover the maximum in front of the 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.290
 canvas in a couple in a situation 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.620
 complicated west actually I enclose 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:20.080
 on both sides 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.849
 of the 5% it should do it hop there 74 and 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.920
 75 so it looks like nothing but actually 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.090
 I said that we can only move on 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.180
 the lines of course that's gone 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.500
 in my free control area actually 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.849
 no then what are we going to do now 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.950
 I will show something else 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.230
 we will show levels that are a 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.459
 little bit different this makes it there 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.170
 you will see a bestiary a bit of a 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.040
 a little more crazy here I have not 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.420
 necessarily that is the level 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.190
 according to if we start to see the 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.019
 jellyfish already or business jellyfish 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.760
 only walk on your line to you 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.829
 then no it was a yes so the 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.060
 lobster must score on your stuff to you 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.230
 actually the menus are very 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.970
 big opponent but who is suddenly 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.519
 complicated enough to smash except that there 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.750
 down I had played well 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:00.970
 the jellyfish and you have reached Thursday 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.079
 an apron not established an apron because 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.280
 that you cook, so you are 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.290
 know the second aspect of the game ian 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.540
 Whitten Manama near the one 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.190
 very important in tata of the time that you 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.989
 can not you finally have a tone that goes into 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.040
 descending that name went but no longer 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.389
 go quickly that you will do points 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.590
 look there you see you have the front made 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.500
 and what I get into there that I 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.340
 do some wise tutorials so what does it 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.020
 must do now it's 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.580
 capture these lava areas but especially 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.530
 they intend to dodge them 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.750
 but there you see when once I close 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.040
 to access the pigs the fake and the game 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.540
 knock them out a game I want to say it 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.710
 it's a game I really did in 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.760
 done at the time and I had to redo a 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.750
 part moderately there I had when 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.580
 even finished a number of times 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.380
 yes tell me you go I was going to tell you 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.880
 it's a je ne sais plus I was going to te 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.380
 of asylum times two friends 1/2 the x 2 is 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.690
 a point combos multiplier 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.900
 yes yes here it is for the holidays or there 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.520
 or where it was very limited there then we 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.110
 will iron like that your choice actually 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.490
 when you understand how the 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.690
 game it goes pretty fast besides the game 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.910
 maybe we can give him this 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.620
 default there is to be simple enough to 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.360
 finish once we have assimilated 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.950
 the displacements of the opponents 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.900
 look almost even more and you see 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.510
 nothing prevents me from being very small 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.919
 roeulx is it need to play it at the 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.300
 ball to little player but hey that's right 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:10.790
 works like that you do not see the pc 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.870
 big ray sony yes yes you fuck them 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.330
 the agglo says she is a game that is 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.530
 only available on pc 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.150
 the ass l'alm the moment you ask me a 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.229
 glue actually it seems to me that these pc and 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.580
 mac on eight hits 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.660
 after is it available on 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.550
 tablets for example I see you a 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.139
 result there I do not think well one 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.229
 will look and it will be a dif and get 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.729
 syndicate on the game vida yes we're going 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.470
 swim as not necessarily a principle 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.030
 which was well applicable on tablet 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.620
 since these controls quite fast enough 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.120
 accurate yeah it must be above all very 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.440
 quickly and actually because if ever in 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.030
 do you see that an opponent is coming 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.400
 you can stop pressing the key 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.690
 x and it's been a year I have nothing so that 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.580
 it feels like it's interesting here 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.900
 it's made of yoyo and not the shot 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.160
 must be taken into account 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.139
 because sometimes you will make 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.970
 actions that will have to be reversible 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.530
 so you're just going to die 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.180
 the project does not become big either 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.389
 more to tell you about their 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.190
 launched by another level or a little 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:59.539
 others have other background colors there 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.099
 I ask basic questions 1 but we 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:02.360
 will always be desert well yes but the 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:04.130
 problem is they are they are 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.990
 in the sequel actually but you see it's going 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.110
 quite quickly, in fact, we come back to 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.190
 close to play for a nil player 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.169
 frankly not long ago I think of 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.280
 three hours max max okay after 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.639
 yal time trial which is not bad too 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.460
 the uncle at his door 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.990
 a surplus value yeah you're obliged in 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.099
 Wholesale emulator I'll start 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.620
 you'll understand very quickly 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:24.210
 there the goal will be to finish the level 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.979
 in the allotted time of which you agree 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.210
 see it's exactly the same kind of 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:29.189
 level except that there is with a 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.289
 degressive timer but ok this is 

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:33.419
 almost the same thing to say that 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:35.099
 it really brings added value I do not 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:37.319
 think it's nice you like it 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:39.419
 principle it adds a good little 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:41.520
 oh yes last I had cut out then the 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:43.139
 music is nice the atmosphere and well 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.520
 take and the graphical aspect actually and 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:45.930
 roughly chosen because the same 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.289
 game without this graphical aspect I think 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:52.680
 that that would be it's all there the side 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:56.580
 drinks and neon fish the 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.419
 poets and clothes to lola married everything 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.000
