00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:08.830
 good as they are today, I 'm going to 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:08.830
 show a clue a clue 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:19.289
 a skate track bicycle searches 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.770
 or skate the skateboard 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:27.050
 you make your own homemade track 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.050
 I have 3 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.660
 I have three the first one I have is 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.660
 is 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.710
 I did not 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.780
 he is my brother 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:48.730
 but as we can see it's very very well 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:52.000
 made and resistant as he did what 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.180
 we can see is that he did it with a box 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.180
 of shoes 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:02.750
 as you can see this he did with the 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:07.020
 stage but did with him with a sorbet 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.790
 and inside in a ring 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.040
 a skewer stick 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.190
 I do not know if it looks to support also 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.820
 put on the sticks inside to make 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.990
 as a support 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.990
 where you can see 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.890
 and what you can enjoy is very very bacano 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.370
 cool 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:38.230
 As you can see, it's simple 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:42.490
 my brother and several with about three 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:46.430
 years but they practice 21 tracks their 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.320
 the first time you will be fine but 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.140
 it's called life and you go 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.140
 practicing and doing their triumphs 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.070
 as what is 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.330
 good 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.280
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.080
 can make their own homemade track and 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.540
 for them to be and well they should be 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.440
 buying those compound faces tracks 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.989
 between 1000 and 60 65 dollars 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.900
 and I hope you liked it and if you 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.239
 liked to put on if in another video they 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.980
 we teach we will teach step by step how 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.980
