00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
as well it takes a lot of batteries just

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.390 
as well it takes a lot of batteries just
to<00:02:51.329> control<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.840> Hexbug<00:02:52.110> spider<00:02:52.530> -<00:02:53.070> for<00:02:53.310> the

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
to control the Hexbug spider - for the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.490 
to control the Hexbug spider - for the
remote<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.880> three<00:02:54.239> for<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.570> spider<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.200> that

remote and three for the spider and that

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.199 
remote and three for the spider and that
can<00:02:55.680> get<00:02:55.799> very<00:02:55.860> pricey<00:02:56.370> because<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.940> spider

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
can get very pricey because the spider

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.140 
can get very pricey because the spider
isn't<00:02:57.570> cheap<00:02:57.810> either<00:02:58.049> it's<00:02:58.620> 23<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.340> 25<00:02:59.760> dollars
