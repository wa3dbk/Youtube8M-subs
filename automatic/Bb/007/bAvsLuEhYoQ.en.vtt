00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
this played a see like this so you just

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.830 
this played a see like this so you just
go<00:00:44.380> from<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:44.680> G<00:00:44.970> up<00:00:45.970> on<00:00:46.240> the<00:00:46.330> top<00:00:46.540> and<00:00:46.750> then

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
go from the G up on the top and then

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.710 
go from the G up on the top and then
just<00:00:47.020> move<00:00:47.140> these<00:00:47.290> top<00:00:47.530> two<00:00:47.740> fingers<00:00:47.950> down<00:00:48.720> one

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.910 
just move these top two fingers down one
string<00:00:50.050> so<00:00:50.590> it<00:00:50.650> will<00:00:50.740> sound<00:00:50.890> like<00:00:51.010> this

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.389 

and<00:00:55.850> the<00:00:56.239> next<00:00:56.480> one<00:00:56.690> will<00:00:56.930> be<00:00:56.960> an<00:00:57.230> e-minor<00:00:57.829> and

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
and the next one will be an e-minor and

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.180 
and the next one will be an e-minor and
you're<00:00:58.850> going<00:00:59.000> to<00:00:59.059> just<00:00:59.270> take<00:00:59.840> out<00:01:00.710> your<00:01:00.980> first

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
you're going to just take out your first

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.770 
you're going to just take out your first
finger<00:01:01.489> put<00:01:01.760> on<00:01:01.879> the<00:01:01.970> fifth<00:01:02.149> string<00:01:02.270> 2nd<00:01:02.720> fret

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
finger put on the fifth string 2nd fret

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.079 
finger put on the fifth string 2nd fret
your<00:01:03.020> middle<00:01:03.170> finger<00:01:03.440> on<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:03.620> 4th<00:01:04.519> string<00:01:04.699> 2nd

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
your middle finger on the 4th string 2nd

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.550 
your middle finger on the 4th string 2nd
fret<00:01:05.119> and<00:01:05.330> we'll<00:01:05.540> sound<00:01:05.720> like

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
fret and we'll sound like

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.040 
fret and we'll sound like
when<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.430> do<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.560> think<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.980> just

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
when you can do this I think this just

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.540 
when you can do this I think this just
matchbox<00:01:13.050> 20<00:01:13.440> it<00:01:13.500> really<00:01:13.680> doesn't<00:01:13.980> sound<00:01:14.280> like

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
matchbox 20 it really doesn't sound like

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.920 
matchbox 20 it really doesn't sound like
that<00:01:15.120> to<00:01:15.390> me<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:17.150> that<00:01:18.150> sounds<00:01:18.510> more<00:01:18.660> like<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
that to me so that sounds more like the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.500 
that to me so that sounds more like the
actual<00:01:19.260> song<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.700> then<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> next<00:01:21.300> one<00:01:21.420> is

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
actual song and then the next one is

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.540 
actual song and then the next one is
going<00:01:21.660> to<00:01:21.720> be<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.870> D<00:01:22.200> now<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:22.950> do<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> you

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
going to be a D now you can do it you

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.550 
going to be a D now you can do it you
know<00:01:23.640> your<00:01:23.790> standard<00:01:24.030> D<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.170> way<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.380> like

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
know your standard D but the way I like

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.930 
know your standard D but the way I like
to<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.010> again<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:26.820> my

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
to do it again this is just my

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.080 
to do it again this is just my
preference<00:01:27.360> but<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:28.340> dropped<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.610> first

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
preference but I just dropped this first

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.420 
preference but I just dropped this first
finger<00:01:30.330> down<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> 3rd<00:01:31.050> string<00:01:31.380> 2nd<00:01:31.830> fret

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.570 

and<00:01:38.430> that's<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.320> your<00:01:40.979> intro<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.369> going<00:01:41.520> to

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
and that's it so your intro is going to

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.480 
and that's it so your intro is going to
sound<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.810> going<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.990> be<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> G<00:01:43.530> then

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
sound like this is going to be a G then

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.730 
sound like this is going to be a G then
a<00:01:44.520> C<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.330> G<00:01:45.570> then<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.899> seen<00:01:46.110> then<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.410> starts

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
a C and a G then it seen then it starts

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.700 
a C and a G then it seen then it starts
the<00:01:46.800> verse<00:01:47.100> so

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.990 

you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.020 

you

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.090 

and<00:01:59.930> you're<00:02:00.230> going<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.380> do<00:02:00.530> that<00:02:00.710> two<00:02:00.890> times

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
and you're going to do that two times

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.010 
and you're going to do that two times
and<00:02:01.340> then<00:02:01.460> you'll<00:02:01.610> start<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:01.970> verse<00:02:02.150> so<00:02:02.480> the

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
and then you'll start the verse so the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.100 
and then you'll start the verse so the
rows<00:02:03.170> are<00:02:03.290> going<00:02:03.320> to<00:02:03.440> start<00:02:03.680> on<00:02:03.830> G<00:02:04.360> then<00:02:05.360> C<00:02:05.390> II

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
rows are going to start on G then C II

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:14.650 
rows are going to start on G then C II
