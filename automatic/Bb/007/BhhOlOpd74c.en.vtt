know just this is this is a fight that
it's<00:04:53.040> actually<00:04:53.250> beneficial<00:04:53.910> to<00:04:54.180> have<00:04:54.300> hots<00:04:54.600> on

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
it's actually beneficial to have hots on

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.300 
it's actually beneficial to have hots on
pretty<00:04:55.139> much<00:04:55.260> every<00:04:55.560> one<00:04:55.680> rolling<00:04:56.070> the<00:04:56.160> whole

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
pretty much every one rolling the whole

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.900 
pretty much every one rolling the whole
time<00:04:56.520> because<00:04:56.760> of<00:04:56.940> how<00:04:57.660> much<00:04:57.900> add<00:04:58.229> damage<00:04:58.910> goes

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
time because of how much add damage goes

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.810 
time because of how much add damage goes
around<00:05:00.240> so<00:05:00.750> if<00:05:00.900> you're<00:05:01.020> able<00:05:01.139> to<00:05:01.350> keep<00:05:01.580> tabs<00:05:02.580> on

them then that will help you out quite a
bit<00:05:07.400> other<00:05:08.400> than<00:05:08.639> that<00:05:08.700> it's<00:05:09.210> pretty<00:05:09.389> simple

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
bit other than that it's pretty simple

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.240 
bit other than that it's pretty simple
mechanics<00:05:10.520> take<00:05:11.520> them<00:05:11.639> out<00:05:11.790> and<00:05:12.830> move<00:05:13.830> on<00:05:14.040> to

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
mechanics take them out and move on to

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:22.580 
mechanics take them out and move on to
the<00:05:14.370> last<00:05:14.850> boss

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:30.110 

so<00:05:23.340> here<00:05:23.790> ah<00:05:24.530> shut<00:05:25.530> up<00:05:25.590> dog<00:05:26.780> um<00:05:28.160> not<00:05:29.160> too<00:05:30.000> much

at<00:05:42.330> burst<00:05:42.660> healing<00:05:43.080> so<00:05:43.680> it<00:05:43.890> does<00:05:44.250> help<00:05:44.520> to

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
at burst healing so it does help to

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.310 
at burst healing so it does help to
learn<00:05:44.970> mechanics<00:05:45.570> and<00:05:45.750> be<00:05:45.900> able<00:05:45.990> to<00:05:46.140> throw

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320

to happen throwing a couple rejuve out

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.130 
to happen throwing a couple rejuve out
is<00:05:55.430> really<00:05:56.430> beneficial<00:05:56.610> since<00:05:57.270> our<00:05:57.540> only<00:05:57.780> real

swiftness Healing Touch macro and that's
about<00:06:06.180> it<00:06:06.360> so<00:06:06.750> right<00:06:07.380> now<00:06:07.410> no<00:06:07.770> one's<00:06:07.980> really

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
about it so right now no one's really

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.780 
about it so right now no one's really
taking<00:06:08.460> any<00:06:08.580> damage<00:06:09.830> so<00:06:10.830> I'm<00:06:10.920> not<00:06:11.100> using<00:06:11.400> the

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 
taking any damage so I'm not using the

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.610 
taking any damage so I'm not using the
regrowth<00:06:12.300> proc<00:06:12.630> right<00:06:12.870> away<00:06:13.140> I<00:06:13.170> probably

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
regrowth proc right away I probably

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.080 
regrowth proc right away I probably
could<00:06:13.830> have<00:06:13.860> thrown<00:06:14.100> it<00:06:14.250> on<00:06:14.340> the<00:06:14.640> hunter

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
could have thrown it on the hunter

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.390 
could have thrown it on the hunter
instead<00:06:15.600> of<00:06:15.690> the<00:06:15.780> tank<00:06:15.990> right<00:06:16.200> there<00:06:16.280> but<00:06:17.280> it's

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
instead of the tank right there but it's

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.130 
instead of the tank right there but it's
ok<00:06:17.700> I<00:06:17.730> put<00:06:18.000> a<00:06:18.030> couple<00:06:18.270> regions<00:06:18.690> on<00:06:18.840> him<00:06:18.990> so

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.140 
ok I put a couple regions on him so

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.250 
ok I put a couple regions on him so
he'll<00:06:19.320> be<00:06:19.440> back<00:06:19.620> to<00:06:19.770> full<00:06:19.800> pretty<00:06:20.250> quick

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:21.260 
he'll be back to full pretty quick

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.140

keeping<00:06:22.260> life<00:06:23.130> bloom<00:06:23.370> up<00:06:23.520> on<00:06:23.700> the<00:06:23.820> tank<00:06:24.030> as

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
keeping life bloom up on the tank as

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.180 
keeping life bloom up on the tank as
always<00:06:24.480> keeping<00:06:24.930> up<00:06:25.080> both<00:06:25.290> regions<00:06:25.710> on<00:06:25.860> him<00:06:26.040> as

well and you'll see that once again
it'll<00:06:28.860> fall<00:06:29.130> off<00:06:29.930> just<00:06:30.930> so<00:06:31.110> I<00:06:31.140> can<00:06:31.290> maybe<00:06:31.740> get<00:06:31.980> a

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.040 
it'll fall off just so I can maybe get a

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.980 
it'll fall off just so I can maybe get a
bloom<00:06:32.280> he'll<00:06:32.820> just<00:06:33.060> for<00:06:33.240> more<00:06:33.420> healing<00:06:33.780> done

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
bloom he'll just for more healing done

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.120 
bloom he'll just for more healing done
without<00:06:34.230> having<00:06:34.740> to<00:06:34.890> expend<00:06:35.670> mana<00:06:35.970> for<00:06:36.240> it<00:06:36.390> and

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
without having to expend mana for it and

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.950 
without having to expend mana for it and
then<00:06:38.130> right<00:06:39.030> here<00:06:39.060> yep<00:06:39.420> i'll<00:06:39.630> use<00:06:39.840> the

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
then right here yep i'll use the

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.160 
then right here yep i'll use the
regrowth<00:06:40.260> croc<00:06:40.590> on<00:06:40.860> the<00:06:41.930> Warlock<00:06:42.930> that<00:06:43.080> was

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:44.640 
taking damage and then i'll throw read

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.950 
taking damage and then i'll throw read
you<00:06:44.820> on<00:06:45.030> the<00:06:45.150> paladin<00:06:46.110> and<00:06:47.330> i'll<00:06:48.330> see<00:06:48.510> that<00:06:48.750> the
