pass<00:00:34.380> for<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:34.800> season<00:00:35.219> now<00:00:35.880> can<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.149> tell<00:00:36.180> me

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
pass for this season now can you tell me

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.709 
pass for this season now can you tell me
how<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.780> works<00:00:37.610> so<00:00:38.610> these<00:00:38.940> machines<00:00:39.450> are

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
how it works so these machines are

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.340 
how it works so these machines are
pretty<00:00:40.050> advanced<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.390> they<00:00:42.390> use<00:00:42.809> electric

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
pretty advanced so they use electric

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.049 
pretty advanced so they use electric
motors<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.120> a<00:00:45.120> lot<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.480> sensors<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.590> this

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
motors and a lot of sensors so this

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.420 
motors and a lot of sensors so this
machine<00:00:48.059> determines<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.350> get<00:00:49.710> an<00:00:49.860> angle<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
machine determines the get an angle of a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.310 
machine determines the get an angle of a
skier<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:52.730> when<00:00:53.730> he<00:00:53.940> start<00:00:54.210> moves<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.719> pushed

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
skier and when he start moves and pushed

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.189 
skier and when he start moves and pushed
him<00:00:55.410> there<00:00:55.800> are<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.250> more<00:00:56.430> people<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
him there are the more people and the

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.170 
him there are the more people and the
person<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.530> client<00:00:58.920> skis<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.760> heart<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
person a client skis the heart of the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.680 
person a client skis the heart of the
machines<00:01:00.859> push<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.329> weekly<00:01:03.329> person

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
machines push and the weekly person

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.080 
machines push and the weekly person
drives<00:01:03.960> except<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:05.040> also<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.909> see

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
drives except that here also you can see

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.800 
drives except that here also you can see
screams<00:01:06.420> big<00:01:06.750> screens<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.500> which<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:09.299> slope

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
screams big screens on which the slope

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.500 
screams big screens on which the slope
is<00:01:10.049> reproduced<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.950> person<00:01:11.520> can't<00:01:11.790> even<00:01:12.030> go

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
is reproduced and person can't even go

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.620 
is reproduced and person can't even go
between<00:01:12.930> gates<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.740> joy<00:01:14.010> workout<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.450> on

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
between gates and joy workout and so on

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.320 
between gates and joy workout and so on
so<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.560> great<00:01:16.979> thing<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.250> do<00:01:17.549> now

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
so it's just a great thing to do now

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.179 
so it's just a great thing to do now
