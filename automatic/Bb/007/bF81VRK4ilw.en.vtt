measure a half an inch from the top of
our<00:01:50.970> quilt<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.710> that's<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.979> position<00:01:53.159> that

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
our quilt and that's the position that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.060 
our quilt and that's the position that
we're<00:01:53.850> going<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.240> put<00:01:54.450> our<00:01:54.630> sleeve<00:01:54.990> now<00:01:55.890> you're

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
we're going to put our sleeve now you're

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.300 
we're going to put our sleeve now you're
just<00:01:56.189> going<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.520> position<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.829> just<00:01:58.829> inside

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
just going to position it in just inside

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.170 
just going to position it in just inside
your<00:02:00.110> binding<00:02:01.130> so<00:02:02.130> once<00:02:02.549> you've<00:02:02.759> got<00:02:02.939> that

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
your binding so once you've got that

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.359 
your binding so once you've got that
measured<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.899> would<00:02:04.140> measure<00:02:04.320> both<00:02:04.890> ends

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
measured and I would measure both ends

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.029 
measured and I would measure both ends
obviously<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> didn't<00:02:06.600> do<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.930> right<00:02:07.140> now<00:02:07.170> but

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
obviously I didn't do that right now but

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.400 
obviously I didn't do that right now but
I've<00:02:08.250> gotten<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.670> half<00:02:08.910> an<00:02:09.119> inch<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.629> so<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.959> was

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
I've gotten a half an inch and so I was

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.230 
I've gotten a half an inch and so I was
pin<00:02:10.710> that<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.040> place<00:02:11.070> so<00:02:11.550> it's<00:02:11.700> all<00:02:11.850> ready<00:02:12.120> for

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
pin that in place so it's all ready for

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.960 
pin that in place so it's all ready for
me<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.780> sew<00:02:13.050> now<00:02:13.770> one<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.190> critical<00:02:14.670> things

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
me to sew now one of the critical things

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.360 
me to sew now one of the critical things
is<00:02:15.210> is<00:02:15.480> sometimes<00:02:15.720> we<00:02:16.200> get<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.440> sleeve<00:02:16.800> on<00:02:17.070> there

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
is is sometimes we get a sleeve on there

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.090 
is is sometimes we get a sleeve on there
and<00:02:17.820> it<00:02:17.910> kind<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.180> goes<00:02:18.330> like<00:02:18.600> this<00:02:18.870> that<00:02:19.170> makes

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
and it kind of goes like this that makes

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.010 
and it kind of goes like this that makes
it<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.460> your<00:02:20.640> your<00:02:21.060> quilt<00:02:21.390> doesn't<00:02:21.780> hang

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
it so your your quilt doesn't hang

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.890 
it so your your quilt doesn't hang
particularly<00:02:22.830> straight<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.850> when<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:24.690> get

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
particularly straight so when you get

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.130 
particularly straight so when you get
your<00:02:25.080> sleeve<00:02:25.670> taken<00:02:26.670> pin<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.210> opposite<00:02:27.870> end

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
your sleeve taken pin the opposite end

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.740 
your sleeve taken pin the opposite end
in<00:02:28.500> place<00:02:28.860> because<00:02:29.700> now<00:02:30.000> we<00:02:30.060> have<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> better

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
in place because now we have a better

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.540 
in place because now we have a better
chance<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.410> think<00:02:31.440> I'm<00:02:31.830> having<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.460> a

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
chance I think I'm having that in a

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.850 
chance I think I'm having that in a
completely<00:02:32.910> straight<00:02:33.330> line<00:02:33.630> then<00:02:34.440> if<00:02:34.740> you

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
completely straight line then if you

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.830 
completely straight line then if you
need<00:02:35.070> to<00:02:35.190> add<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.370> few<00:02:35.730> more<00:02:35.760> pins<00:02:36.270> as<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.630> go

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
need to add a few more pins as you go

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.770 
need to add a few more pins as you go
pin<00:02:37.680> those<00:02:37.890> in<00:02:38.130> place<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.820> then<00:02:39.540> we're<00:02:39.750> just

alone<00:03:38.430> a<00:03:39.270> long<00:03:39.630> strip<00:03:40.140> of<00:03:40.440> a<00:03:40.590> sleeve<00:03:41.430> seems

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
alone a long strip of a sleeve seems

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.330 
alone a long strip of a sleeve seems
kind<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.810> cumbersome<00:03:43.290> not<00:03:43.470> only<00:03:43.709> to<00:03:43.860> work<00:03:44.070> with

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
kind of cumbersome not only to work with

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.290 
kind of cumbersome not only to work with
but<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.600> also<00:03:45.780> is<00:03:46.350> easier<00:03:46.830> to<00:03:47.040> hang<00:03:47.310> if<00:03:47.700> you

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
but it also is easier to hang if you

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.720 
but it also is easier to hang if you
would<00:03:48.480> split<00:03:48.900> that<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.500> if<00:03:49.980> this<00:03:50.160> was<00:03:50.400> a<00:03:50.430> white

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
would split that and if this was a white

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.270 
would split that and if this was a white
quilt<00:03:51.120> then<00:03:51.690> maybe<00:03:52.050> what<00:03:52.440> I<00:03:52.470> would<00:03:52.770> do<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:53.130> I'd

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
quilt then maybe what I would do is I'd

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.620 
quilt then maybe what I would do is I'd
split<00:03:53.580> it<00:03:53.760> into<00:03:53.940> thirds

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
split it into thirds

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.080 
split it into thirds
and<00:03:54.780> if<00:03:55.230> you<00:03:55.380> do<00:03:55.620> that<00:03:55.950> don't<00:03:56.370> put<00:03:56.670> more<00:03:56.880> than

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
and if you do that don't put more than

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.020 
and if you do that don't put more than
an<00:03:57.270> inch<00:03:57.600> between<00:03:58.080> those<00:03:58.560> sections<00:03:59.190> because

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
an inch between those sections because

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.300 
an inch between those sections because
if<00:04:00.300> you<00:04:00.660> do<00:04:00.810> if<00:04:01.020> you<00:04:01.050> put<00:04:01.140> a<00:04:01.350> wide<00:04:01.650> space<00:04:02.040> in

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
if you do if you put a wide space in

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.340 
if you do if you put a wide space in
there<00:04:02.550> then<00:04:03.180> your<00:04:03.390> quilt<00:04:03.780> is<00:04:03.840> going<00:04:03.989> to<00:04:04.080> droop

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
there then your quilt is going to droop

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.010 
there then your quilt is going to droop
in<00:04:04.770> that<00:04:05.070> spot<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:06.030> don't<00:04:06.209> want<00:04:06.420> that<00:04:06.510> so

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
in that spot and you don't want that so

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.410 
in that spot and you don't want that so
if<00:04:07.260> you<00:04:07.680> split<00:04:08.040> it<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.340> it's<00:04:08.640> perfectly<00:04:09.060> okay

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
if you split it and it's perfectly okay

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.110 
if you split it and it's perfectly okay
to<00:04:09.480> do<00:04:09.720> that<00:04:09.930> then<00:04:10.709> just<00:04:11.220> put<00:04:11.370> an<00:04:11.489> inch<00:04:11.730> between

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
to do that then just put an inch between

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.540 
to do that then just put an inch between
each<00:04:12.239> of<00:04:12.570> those<00:04:12.690> sections<00:04:13.260> so<00:04:14.070> now<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.280> have

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
each of those sections so now you have

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.610 
each of those sections so now you have
