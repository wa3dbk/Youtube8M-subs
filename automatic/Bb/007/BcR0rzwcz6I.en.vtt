 Odd and even new words came out 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:12.230
 The Tteyuu even, like a knee this Sea low heart 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:20.090
 The number of divisible by is even 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:21.240
 Odd is the dregs 13579 like a cold a little And then practice not divisible by 2 in reverse 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.700
 Try 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:30.900
 There are a lot of numbers here or here in the head this number 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:36.620
 Let's divide into each group of odd and even hem 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.620
 Well, so here's an odd group under here 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.739
 Odd is this meeting 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.989
 Surrounded 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.989
 Say that I please bring to this range 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:01:01.960
 But here it has become not come in even number, and I please bring in the range of here of plaque 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:04.800
 Let's divide it. Well, while I'm writing this, which is a kiss and which is an even 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.800
 Just think about it 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.530
 leg 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:18.780
 Then let's split up and let's go from something easy 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:26.220
 This 4 Toka Do not like the first I fleet 4 This odd-even number Dochi 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:28.780
 4 is Tayowa even-energy four-in of a had also come out HitoShiro result a little while ago as divisible in two 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.690
 I will be in an even group 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:39.369
 Well then 7 of the same 8 nana came out earlier 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:44.950
 Miss too City Once you have the split clean Nana evil 135,792 Ena 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:47.130
 Such since 7 is odd stars Which Yaro this 9 What is 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:52.380
 This foundation Ya ne 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:56.039
 Min c Low heart Even voice of 13579 entered 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.240
 And there has been a 11 or Let's said something about what in hot in there 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.450
 Which one is 11 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:07.340
 This is a basic or odd number 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:10.170
 More and more eco-x is somehow still have 19-way Chongqing 19 This kiss ugly opening 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.480
 Do not say this is also just odd it a kiss 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:19.930
 Low is Kana 16 type 16 there are no other is taken 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:24.129
 This is an even number because it is divided into 8 roofs if it is divided into 16 or 16 percent 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.280
 Now it's getting a little harder, so let's say it's flexible next time 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:31.980
 Which is the 2323? 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:36.540
 If this is the number of machines or 23 bad 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.180
 This is odd in 11 very 1 hole of the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.239
 This 24 is 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:47.090
 If this is even energy 24 evil 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:50.340
 12 will not come out too much and it's this 26 yards 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.879
 If it gets harder then there are 26 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:57.150
 Ne divisible by 2 is 13 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:03:01.760
 But this is also an even number because divisible in two 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:05.680
 Booth attached a little and double last 19 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:10.030
 If this ends in an even odd 2nd place 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:14.290
 14 because too much Well then, such chest and I This is odd 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:20.019
 Even if it is divided and divided , it is a bit like this two-digit number 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:25.700
 Even if the number becomes large because of this 100 or so, it is odd and even 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:32.330
 It's easy to tell the distinction between meat and meat 112 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:37.160
 There is a way to easily distinguish odd and even numbers even with the number of trees 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:40.520
 Please look at how good or a little number gathered here Once you have, etc. 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:46.850
 I want you to see the 1st place Well this is originally 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:48.670
 Since this is a city ​​single digit , please take a look at the 1's of this two digit number as good 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.350
 Then 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.860
 The index is 17 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.860
 Rescue 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:02.239
 q Ya ne 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:03.200
 1939 magic ball is 1 and 3 and 9 is here Irya wearing of Goose 's 1 of the place but two there 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.790
 Forward or 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:12.430
 This is 64 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:21.280
 6 Makore also 6, such as that coming out is a book called 6 but two can have 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:25.509
 That's right I guess it's a wound If you look at this 2-digit number , if the one's place becomes odd, that number 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:31.810
 It is odd because the whole is not divisible by 3rd place 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:32.449
 If turned to the even-numbered to whether 6 like Na-young in the Goose around 4 and one 6 hand when looking at one's place in reverse 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.889
 That 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:45.080
 The whole side of the two-digit side dish is even 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:46.430
 So look at the one's place of the number without thinking whether you divide by one or not 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.260
 If you have been raised Te 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.860
 I know whether it is odd or even 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:56.700
 Let's try going from the continuation, let's try it in that way 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:00.040
 There are 30 on the next 30 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:04.300
 Which Yaro this 37 odd and even number 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:07.780
 When I think about this I want to see only this one's place 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:13.380
 And If you nana because they become a position 7 of this one 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:17.610
 As the number of machines and so on, this whole 37 will be odd 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:24.120
 As round and it will happen tree 32 This would be the fleet you buy 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:29.340
 32 brothers who want to see only ones wo n't even even 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.490
 Goose not come in 14 as a whole or it is 48 with Yong Jun 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.590
 This is 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:38.620
 It becomes goose even as the whole even roof because it is about once 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:42.780
 48 is also in the first place 8 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:49.470
 I This is also an even number because they become the booth 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:52.620
 Kiss Ya from kiss called Mecha fast Do 51 is apparently the one's place City If you do it this way 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:56.940
 64 is the first place 4 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:06:04.070
 Goose energy 77 from one place the foundation Ya 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:08.300
 It is odd 80 people have even or even first place 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:10.760
 91 will be the odd number from one-position overnight 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.800
 And the last 100 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:18.949
 This How Nareyo 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:24.949
 Actually I didn't talk to my mom for a moment, though it was zero when I saw it at 1st place 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:27.889
 Each one is divisible by not or three divisible went and kiss even number for clarity 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:29.660
 I wonder what happens to zero 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:35.100
 0 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:36.449
 To what happens 0 evil After you have put into this I 0 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.319
 0 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:46.490
 So 0 is divisible by 2 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:46.490
 So this zero is actually an even number 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:59.819
 Zero is even because this 100 is an even number of zeros 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:03.340
 This will be even and this is odd and even 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:08.290
 I was able to separate properly 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:13.030
 Well zero is even, so I want you to keep in mind 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:16.449
 How to distinguish between this odd and even number 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:19.780
 If the first place is odd, it will be odd 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:22.110
 If the first place is even, it will be even 

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.150
 The Well of the example 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:34.020
 And there was a number 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:38.580
 Is one hundred thousand manju sometimes 100,000,23567 an odd number 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:44.139
 I I want to see only once times when asked by an even number Tsu Is 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:49.930
 I'm going to be 7 here, so this will be odd 

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:56.819
 1923567 This is also an odd place 

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:56.819
 Odd and even can be distinguished in this way when it becomes odd
