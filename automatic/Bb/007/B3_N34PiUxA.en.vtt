00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.500 
got the tap and let me just first turned
on<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:06.290> this<00:01:07.290> will<00:01:07.680> be<00:01:07.920> definitely<00:01:08.580> cold

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
on and this will be definitely cold

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.750 
on and this will be definitely cold
water<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:10.820> lot<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.850> cold<00:01:12.240> water<00:01:12.390> there<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.760> here

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
water a lot of cold water there and here

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.970 
water a lot of cold water there and here
we<00:01:14.880> go

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:35.440 

oh<00:01:32.350> so<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:33.440> can<00:01:33.560> see<00:01:33.710> that<00:01:34.000> we<00:01:35.000> don't<00:01:35.120> have<00:01:35.240> to

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
oh so you can see that we don't have to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.990 
oh so you can see that we don't have to
touch<00:01:35.600> ID<00:01:35.900> sensor<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:36.860> I<00:01:37.130> think<00:01:37.370> I<00:01:37.670> don't<00:01:37.850> have

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
touch ID sensor so I think I don't have

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.800 
touch ID sensor so I think I don't have
to<00:01:38.300> worry<00:01:38.540> about<00:01:38.600> that<00:01:40.270> it<00:01:41.270> looks<00:01:41.570> really
