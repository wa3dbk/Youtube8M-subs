00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.569
 recognized more than ten years ago would be 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.460
 the cutest 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.050
 delivering his technique and delivering the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.940
 quality of life for all women 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.519
 Antioquia and Colombian 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.289
 then the fabulous technical systems 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.150
 in permanent makeup and their 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.590
 canadian makeup meter diana 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.750
 had done very well explained a little 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.510
 of that Canadian technique that during 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.279
 So much time has also worked 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.019
 clear good is a technique that all 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.450
 viewers know it most 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.360
 which in fact is a recognized technique to 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.399
 national and international level yes it is a 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.579
 Canadian technique because based on a 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.559
 anesthetic that is being this spice 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.780
 liquid but that really does not 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.090
 needs to be injected to avoid 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.950
 pain like me 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.410
 action then and it remains the same 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.540
 permanent makeup in huancas because 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.370
 it has to be that makeup 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.290
 traditional permanent so you can 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.840
 to be durable is not the technique 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.130
 software or those techniques that are very 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.690
 superficial because actually 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.869
 Makeup is not going to last at 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.820
 patience him but we do not have that trauma 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.369
 and the fear of making us a makeup 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.229
 permanent that because it's aggressive or that 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.090
 because it will leave us disabled or 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.450
 with this job is from the take 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.920
 here are 06 disability addresses 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.259
 I live always impacted with this 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.509
 His technique target especially 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.520
 makeup and eyebrows the paper goes up 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.979
 those good permanent makeups 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.840
 leaving you at this moment is giving a lot 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.479
 boom hair to hair because it 's a 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.840
 Very natural makeup is like doing the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.390
 simulation of hairs where the client does not 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.160
 has his hair here that all the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.229
 people are losing their eyebrows 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.180
 which two years the fasts punish is 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.820
 there in the eyelid then you have to 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.850
 the fallen goose and raise the little veggies 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.950
 huanca with a mold taking measures 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.620
 the person is first drawn in their 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.070
 eyebrows so that she visualizes how she is going to 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.080
 be the end of your permanent eyebrows 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.210
 It must also be clarified that the 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.520
 pigments have a lot to see so that 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.649
 the result is really natural 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.230
 mark it because if you work with us 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.510
 pigments or inks with which to make them 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.300
 current for example bodily because the 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.310
 result will be perfect I think that 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.970
 you have seen good on the street 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.739
 people with tile makeup like 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.350
 unfortunately its luxurious greenish 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.600
 purple these eyebrows that are with inks 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.830
 non-national Chinese the look is like 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.540
 if they had put the pint of a 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.120
 pen in there while these 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.920
 pigments as they are made with nuance 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.990
 before included and have been designed 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.060
 especially to make makeup 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.610
 permanent as the result is going to be 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.500
 As if it were a little button, it happens 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.290
 with the outline of the lips the line 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.030
 of the eyes the eyebrows at all times the 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.340
 makeup the heifer is not going to be very 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.989
 natural or be clear unlike 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.700
 these pigments the incentives that 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:00.319
 use the markets that we see 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.209
 usually the difference especially 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.680
 for the complexion and for makeup 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.290
 permanent not for body tattoos 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.660
 we are already seeing it even in the 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.250
 target screen we also know that it is 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.310
 almost all people interested in 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.810
 learn but I would like to know where 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.069
 came out the idea of ​​sharing those 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.030
 knowledge problems we had 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.640
 It seemed very nice 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.650
 clear huanca good the idea came out one day 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.989
 in which a girl told me that I for the USA 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.450
 that already helps to work a space 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.510
 If I taught him and well, it seemed very 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.040
 good idea to share this knowledge and 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.129
 Forward, I am being called 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.540
 other cities in other countries that if I 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.610
 I do not travel that if I do in 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.930
 permanent makeup homes and in 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.610
 I do not really have time 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.400
 then I prefer to share my 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.019
 knowledge with me that are 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.090

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.340
 own business then trained them with 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.290
 this technique that is fabulous that how 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.989
 could already see in the images of the 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.200
 screen is a procedure that does not 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.359
 cause disability is not bleeding there is no 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.579
