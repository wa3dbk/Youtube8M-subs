00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
position on defense this game is very

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.819 
position on defense this game is very
difficult<00:00:34.649> for<00:00:35.160> me<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.820> play<00:00:36.290> because<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.500> love

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
difficult for me to play because I love

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.580 
difficult for me to play because I love
to<00:00:37.980> play<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.579> free<00:00:38.820> safety<00:00:39.059> position<00:00:39.840> and

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
to play the free safety position and

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.650 
to play the free safety position and
I'll<00:00:40.710> show<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.090> exactly<00:00:42.090> what<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.420> mean

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.630 

this<00:00:49.180> always<00:00:50.180> seems<00:00:50.450> to<00:00:50.630> happen<00:00:51.640> regardless

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
this always seems to happen regardless

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.890 
this always seems to happen regardless
of<00:00:53.350> what<00:00:54.350> button<00:00:54.710> on<00:00:54.800> pressing<00:00:55.900> what

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
of what button on pressing what

of what button on pressing what
difficulty<00:00:57.650> setting<00:00:58.070> I<00:00:58.250> select<00:01:00.910> the<00:01:01.910> safety

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
difficulty setting I select the safety

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.390 
difficulty setting I select the safety
is<00:01:02.420> usually<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.320> last<00:01:03.530> line<00:01:03.860> of<00:01:03.890> defense

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
is usually the last line of defense

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.859 
is usually the last line of defense
depending<00:01:05.000> on<00:01:05.210> what<00:01:05.960> play<00:01:06.400> in<00:01:07.400> most<00:01:07.729> cases<00:01:08.030> the

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
depending on what play in most cases the

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.870 
depending on what play in most cases the
safeties<00:01:09.380> are<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:10.040> last<00:01:10.190> line<00:01:10.430> of<00:01:10.490> defense

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
safeties are the last line of defense

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.910 
safeties are the last line of defense
again<00:01:11.330> depending<00:01:11.780> on<00:01:11.930> foreplay<00:01:12.350> they're

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
again depending on foreplay they're

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.109 
again depending on foreplay they're
blitzing<00:01:13.160> or<00:01:13.610> whatever<00:01:14.830> now<00:01:15.830> the<00:01:16.640> defensive

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
blitzing or whatever now the defensive

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.630 
blitzing or whatever now the defensive
backs<00:01:18.190> are<00:01:19.190> a<00:01:19.250> man<00:01:19.610> coverage<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:21.460> for<00:01:22.460> some

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
backs are a man coverage and for some

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.090 
backs are a man coverage and for some
reason<00:01:23.470> they<00:01:24.470> always<00:01:24.860> tend<00:01:25.220> to<00:01:25.460> gamble<00:01:27.100> they

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
reason they always tend to gamble they

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.410 
reason they always tend to gamble they
always<00:01:28.520> tend<00:01:28.759> to<00:01:28.910> gamble<00:01:29.950> like<00:01:30.950> this<00:01:31.220> move<00:01:32.149> on

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
always tend to gamble like this move on

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.120 
always tend to gamble like this move on
for<00:01:32.869> these<00:01:33.320> interceptions<00:01:34.450> when<00:01:35.450> they

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
for these interceptions when they

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.520 
for these interceptions when they
realistically<00:01:37.130> they<00:01:37.910> have<00:01:38.149> no<00:01:38.509> shot<00:01:38.899> but<00:01:39.380> they

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
realistically they have no shot but they

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.320 
realistically they have no shot but they
still<00:01:39.830> go<00:01:40.759> free<00:01:41.020> why<00:01:42.020> I<00:01:42.380> don't<00:01:42.680> know<00:01:42.860> now<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:44.000> am

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
still go free why I don't know now I am

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.820 
still go free why I don't know now I am
aware<00:01:44.690> that<00:01:44.750> if<00:01:45.410> you<00:01:45.800> get<00:01:47.050> so<00:01:48.050> close<00:01:48.289> to<00:01:48.560> a<00:01:48.590> wide

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
aware that if you get so close to a wide

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.730 
aware that if you get so close to a wide
receiver<00:01:49.190> if<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.460> stand<00:01:49.789> in<00:01:50.060> front<00:01:50.300> of<00:01:50.509> them

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
receiver if you stand in front of them

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.430 
receiver if you stand in front of them
while<00:01:51.740> they're<00:01:51.950> about<00:01:52.099> to<00:01:52.250> catch<00:01:52.429> the<00:01:52.610> pass

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
while they're about to catch the pass

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.469 
while they're about to catch the pass
your<00:01:54.440> player<00:01:54.709> won't<00:01:55.009> automatically<00:01:55.880> go<00:01:56.149> for

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
your player won't automatically go for

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.070 
your player won't automatically go for
an<00:01:56.750> interception<00:01:57.610> which<00:01:58.610> is<00:01:58.759> a<00:01:58.789> terrible<00:01:59.780> idea

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
an interception which is a terrible idea

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.680 
an interception which is a terrible idea
but<00:02:00.619> I<00:02:01.220> understand<00:02:01.849> that<00:02:02.000> this<00:02:02.149> is<00:02:02.330> how<00:02:02.479> this

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
but I understand that this is how this

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.309 
but I understand that this is how this
game<00:02:02.899> plays<00:02:03.229> it<00:02:03.530> reminds<00:02:04.009> me<00:02:04.069> of<00:02:04.190> Tecmo<00:02:04.700> Bowl

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
game plays it reminds me of Tecmo Bowl

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.559 
game plays it reminds me of Tecmo Bowl
where<00:02:06.319> in<00:02:06.530> order<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.950> make<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.369> interception

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
where in order to make the interception

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.120 
where in order to make the interception
all<00:02:08.569> you<00:02:08.840> had<00:02:08.990> to<00:02:09.080> do<00:02:09.229> was<00:02:09.259> stand<00:02:09.560> in<00:02:09.740> front<00:02:09.890> of

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
all you had to do was stand in front of

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.420 
all you had to do was stand in front of
the<00:02:10.910> wide<00:02:11.120> receiver<00:02:11.800> Tecmo<00:02:12.800> Bowl<00:02:12.830> was<00:02:13.250> an

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
the wide receiver Tecmo Bowl was an

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.229 
the wide receiver Tecmo Bowl was an
arcade<00:02:13.819> game<00:02:14.770> now<00:02:15.770> knowing<00:02:16.310> that<00:02:16.340> if<00:02:17.060> I

that<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:44.000> computer<00:02:44.480> will<00:02:45.470> tell<00:02:45.500> me<00:02:45.860> what<00:02:46.040> I

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
that the computer will tell me what I

the<00:02:59.870> gameplay<00:03:00.110> is<00:03:01.090> not<00:03:02.090> spectacular<00:03:02.900> in<00:03:03.019> this

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140
