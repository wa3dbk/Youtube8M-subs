00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 nice all guys i'm blade 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.150
 today I am in the company of better 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.309
 sonay for declan improvements of the kingdom 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.340
 where my name males like you already have 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.960
 understood from previous videos of which he was 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:20.100
 presented the gameplay that I bring you today 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.230
 is a nuclear fantasy spallitta rate 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.630
 almost life narrow because I had to 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.670
 juggle parkour in certain 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.310
 situations however it was made 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.320
 in killing confirmed also to 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.149
 contracts I only want to clarify 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.520
 because obviously in only the difficulty 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.410
 increase a detergent then for how many 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.120
 they have katy that driving that made on claps 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.790
 which is not a map that sees you much 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.489
 but I really like it as a canteen blade 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.390
 how to map de tilla well this 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.390
 triples 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:58.489
 so we also wanted everything 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.820
 thank the 1,600 members who 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:05.030
 thanks zombies best have come true 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.300
 because for the video with wine we are 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.830
 went up a lot we did I was looking for 60 50 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.110
 subscribers that nothing would be enough 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.409
 then this video was practically 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.539
 ideas for upcoming videos that 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.270
 maffi and kidd and they thought therefore 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:26.600
 before letting it talk but you will have to 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:31.280
 say that maybe we could do some 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:34.330
 roses 10 live less in the comments 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.310
 leave your perfect match then 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.920
 such as celebrating a good surprises 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.990
 idea then about my live liszt 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.240
 always church we thought we would do 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.190
 the ipad not always known because of the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.960
 long tired then above all that is not there 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.090
 gotta lose two gold on pressing 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.729
 giustolo black 23 years in a row for a while 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.160
 tired and we thought we would do others 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.660
 always play for whoever is the most 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.340
 part for a free to play 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.310
 ie you can download reason with 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.590
 hiv therefore here power 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.810
 they find you easy they are very funny 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.970
 I have to say and there are no people extracting 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.590
 arda to do worse templates 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.009
 actually a play tutu does it to me 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.099
 do 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.209
 and therefore I am very playable and that 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.360
 I'm free to play 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.489
 you could do it live with the fans ie 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.980
 we tell you like in a week 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:24.580
 we will do a live of groups like the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.620
 game 3 you want you can join you like 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.890
 we have done with some times with black 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.700
 hawk 23 all the goods that the idea for 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.319
 moreover, some interventions by some 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.650
 promote second axis but why 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.600
 here it is very good sea and for the sea it is 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.110
 much nicer a lot warmer it is 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.110
 different that there is direct interaction that 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.080
 make videos that we don't like 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.780
 then another another idea they had 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.190
 I always had in mind above all then 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.670
 oh well that instead gave his consent 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.530
 kind of stamp then to make a stuff has 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.080
 remembered that between divided writings 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.390
 we have to load the kilt age we had 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.040
 attempted to act as dalt of 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.140
 sneijder google clicks 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.359
 obviously we have so many clips though 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.750
 some clips hurt then maybe you can 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:15.850
 also see how my dai called him 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.709
 let's dance style is nigh because the 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.769
 all arm they make filippo then there were 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.750
 others also continue and everyone's blade 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:27.700
 almost a bit to say between play letters 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.940
 with the sniper you are fine let's give it a little 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.150
 desperate 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.950
 for david the english video will come 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.230
 we have to agree because of him 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.700
 this period is studying as a 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:45.180
 crazy that I understand is so I do not know not 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.860
 it's online for a while so we'll see why 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.560
 point the gameplay you want to load 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.340
 something absurd 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.140
 you will see it later m 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.690
 this will really expand the fanbase into 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.270
 absurd manner and English published e 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.310
 festive then another idea I had in 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.260
 mind I always do but make mistakes 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.970
 also in live streams however always in 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.510
 live matches that maybe I'll call you 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.720
 load and make a great rate bisio 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.180
 that is, in which we then use or use 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.070
 of the type classes I have some classes 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.560
 very good for the united for those of you 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.660
 there and poletti have some advice on 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.090
 how to snipe better on pc 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.710
 I can give you 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.660
 the place of riganti which are the 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.090
 good quality classes of the types 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.190
 as je all well puts them in live 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.110
 or you can also all the slides 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.419
 the class of strange or challenges 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.260
 details to do and live that makes 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.699
 all a bit more exciting there is obviously 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.229
 obviously above all on the cultures 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:48.680
 however, given that even 993 got what 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:51.620
 preferably not even some 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.139
 for v2 it would be a pity in part 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.490
 some of them I myself have 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.710
 studied with a friend of mine more 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:02.139
 Germany that of dish in particular 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:07.490
 still means life by adding acergy 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:10.669
 still about 5 kg maximum what it must 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.070
 then tell us about these ideas of course 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.710
 game attempted I recommend psi's 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.720
 below in the comments if they win likes 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.490
 you didn't like them maybe propose 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.370
 some already you can start proposing 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.410
 several crack stuff to do in live 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.710
 so the road while spies mi 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:31.389
 I recommend because it deserves said ok 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.389
 beautiful beautiful 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.229
 flake fans
