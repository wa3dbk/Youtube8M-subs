00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.830 
are erasing them and then the next thing
is<00:04:42.460> to

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.710 

to<00:04:47.290> run<00:04:47.470> a<00:04:47.550> championship<00:04:48.550> there's<00:04:49.120> nothing

to run a championship there's nothing
actually<00:04:50.230> more<00:04:50.620> or<00:04:50.710> less<00:04:50.889> that's<00:04:51.220> s<00:04:51.520> our<00:04:51.990> unity

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
actually more or less that's s our unity

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.570 
actually more or less that's s our unity
amount<00:04:54.630> for<00:04:55.630> example<00:04:56.110> so<00:04:56.440> there's<00:04:57.190> a<00:04:57.280> lot<00:04:57.520> of

amount for example so there's a lot of

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.980 
amount for example so there's a lot of
room<00:04:58.110> that<00:04:59.110> there<00:04:59.979> are<00:05:00.100> no<00:05:00.280> rules<00:05:00.490> for<00:05:00.669> so<00:05:01.419> we
