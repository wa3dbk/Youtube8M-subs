00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 since the beginning of this program that the 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.870
 Mexican science since yesterday 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.179
 is in Los Angeles is training 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.280
 double session at the University of Chile 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.990
 and today a topic álex magallán has come out 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.880
 beyond what we already hear right now 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.039
 with our colleagues and gerardo in 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.420
 where the watford and the portal have 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.000
 requested to the Mexican federation of 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.130
 soccer that Miguel Layún and Héctor Herrera 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.439
 do not dispute in the match against Paraguay 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.570
 and return to the end of the duel before 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.609
 Ecuador with their respective teams one 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.289
 arguing that the watford good then 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.880
 we already know in what situation they are in that 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.040
 moment a situation where they seek 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.079
 ascend and the port will be disputing 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.360
 I think the semifinal of the cup 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.340
 portugal and therefore they have asked for this 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.989
 request to miguel hervella the selection 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.520
 national which appears miguel has not 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.770
 denied neither by gonzález iñárritu 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.539
 because these two players have them 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.579
 intended to only play against 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.739
 Ecuador and will no longer have them 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.050
 for the match against the selection of 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.820
 paraguay since apart we both know 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.970
 which are flame I assure you selection 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.980
 National are gold cup material 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.970
 in the sense of keeping good 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.460
 relations 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.900
 clear of the positive protocols with 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.000
 the teams because after the favor 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.250
 it may be the other way around that needs me 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.020
 it seems that they are going to open the door and 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.730
 trouble etc they leave and the two 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.560
 because Miguel has already said it 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.780
 álex a team will play next Saturday 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.340
 another team will play on Tuesday at the 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.690
 first match and I think he follows me 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.760
 confirming more miguel herrera the 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.170
 information that we were already driving 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.510
 will play the one who will start in the cup 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.370
 gold the second game will play those that 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.930
 are probably already palomeados for 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.550
 go to the test migration a favor like that 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.280
 it can be another planning for the other 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.810
 I find and see other players what 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.180
 it's tonight some that may not have 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.619
 a lot of chance but have what we say 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.960
 in baseball a tacna to a 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.460
 depth of each position and have them 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.780
 because also when already at 24 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.820
 bad players have what you most 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.880
 It is convenient that a team plays the 90's 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.830
 full minutes do not do five or six 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.869
 changes and from the other party to 56 when 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.000
 what is good for you and taking into account that 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.680
 those teams are only two of trials are 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.290
 two teams that play full the 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.550
 whole party be change from one another 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.230
 party completely change the 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.480
 alignment is not about seeing it 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.250
 to frame the then of no use 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.290
 as you say finish doing some 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.910
 friendly party at carnival no and the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.620
 promoter will not complain when they play 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.870
 with another team totally when 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.570
 they promised something that is already speculated 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.950
 since he is already claiming to be spoken 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.690
 if you already go for players in the league 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.190
 mx will not see another one 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.470
 Maybe ticket sales can go down a 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.940
 little depending on who he is but 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.740
 finally in the angels we know well 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.740
 that there is a lot of Mexican
