one<00:00:09.800> best<00:00:10.800> ones<00:00:11.010> we've<00:00:11.070> seen<00:00:11.540> this<00:00:12.540> season

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
one best ones we've seen this season

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.919 
one best ones we've seen this season
looking<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:14.790> much<00:00:15.000> typically<00:00:15.450> in<00:00:15.630> these<00:00:15.750> will

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
looking so much typically in these will

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.560 
looking so much typically in these will
but<00:00:16.199> if<00:00:16.350> they<00:00:16.470> don't<00:00:16.590> flip<00:00:16.890> every<00:00:17.160> time

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
but if they don't flip every time

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.540 
but if they don't flip every time
multiple<00:00:18.570> times<00:00:19.100> usually<00:00:20.100> if<00:00:20.160> they<00:00:20.310> flew

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
multiple times usually if they flew

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.259 
multiple times usually if they flew
they'll<00:00:20.820> take<00:00:21.000> several<00:00:21.300> breaths<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.840> then

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
they'll take several breaths and then

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.609 
they'll take several breaths and then
move<00:00:24.269> towards<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.810> end<00:00:24.930> let<00:00:25.050> me<00:00:25.140> down<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.350> a
