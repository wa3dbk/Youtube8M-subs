00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.490
 ah 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.369
 two 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.600
 cortez 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.120
 the triple cut to one hand is very 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.430
 similar to the one by signing him 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.820
 but it's a little more complex we start 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.830
 with the grip also finger heart 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.350
 cancel on the outer side of the deck 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.090
 and on the short sides the index and the 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.500
 loonie that the thumb will take care of 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.750
 inside side 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.470
 this opening starts in the same way 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.770
 that the chat separating and dividing the 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.410
 hug in the middle and dropping in the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.650
 bottom hand that's what 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.410
 change with the index finger 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.960
 the index finger will have to divide the 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:24.490
 part of the pile from above in 2 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.409
 and he will have to take it to us 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.850
 letting fall 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:34.690
 this heap 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:36.760
 it's fine what we'll do now be 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.210
 the tip finger 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.780
 Push 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.880
 both heaps 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.860
 and thumb 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.910
 a lot of top 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.910
 to me
