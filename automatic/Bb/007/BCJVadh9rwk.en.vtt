00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:21.270 

so<00:00:01.050> I've<00:00:01.110> got<00:00:01.260> five<00:00:01.439> quarts<00:00:01.890> in<00:00:02.040> it<00:00:04.580> check<00:00:05.580> it

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:21.280 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.970 

and

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
and

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:32.160 
and
it<00:00:24.550> is<00:00:27.930> still<00:00:28.930> a<00:00:28.960> little<00:00:29.170> low<00:00:30.990> she<00:00:31.990> does<00:00:32.110> it

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.170 
it is still a little low she does it

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.980 
it is still a little low she does it
needs<00:00:32.320> about<00:00:32.470> half<00:00:32.710> a<00:00:32.830> quart<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.630> by<00:00:34.720> the<00:00:34.780> time

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:34.990 
needs about half a quart and by the time

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.250 
needs about half a quart and by the time
we<00:00:35.110> started<00:00:35.530> up<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:37.480> will<00:00:37.600> probably<00:00:37.840> need<00:00:38.080> the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
we started up it will probably need the

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.260 
we started up it will probably need the
rest<00:00:38.470> of<00:00:38.650> the<00:00:38.890> court<00:00:39.370> by<00:00:39.730> the<00:00:39.790> time<00:00:39.940> it<00:00:40.030> fills

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
rest of the court by the time it fills

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.350 
rest of the court by the time it fills
up<00:00:40.540> the<00:00:41.430> filter<00:00:42.430> reservoir<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.489> go<00:00:46.180> ahead<00:00:46.270> and

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
up the filter reservoir so go ahead and

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.650 
up the filter reservoir so go ahead and
add<00:00:46.630> half<00:00:47.380> the<00:00:47.410> port<00:00:47.800> now<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:49.120> after<00:00:49.239> we<00:00:49.480> run

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
add half the port now and after we run

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.760 
add half the port now and after we run
it<00:00:49.780> we'll<00:00:49.900> probably<00:00:49.960> have<00:00:50.230> to<00:00:50.290> add<00:00:50.500> the<00:00:50.590> rest

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
it we'll probably have to add the rest

00:00:50.770 --> 00:01:26.260 
it we'll probably have to add the rest
of<00:00:50.950> it

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270

all campfire weight to put the cover
back<00:01:31.640> on<00:01:32.030> -<00:01:32.329> after<00:01:32.840> we<00:01:32.929> started<00:01:33.229> absolutely

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
back on - after we started absolutely

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.740 
back on - after we started absolutely

make sure the filter housing is not
leaking<00:01:35.990> or<00:01:36.259> anything<00:01:37.210> now<00:01:42.039> we<00:01:43.039> need<00:01:43.219> to<00:01:43.429> reset

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969

the run position the accessory position

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:08.559 
the run position the accessory position
and<00:02:02.860> yeah<00:02:03.860> actually<00:02:04.069> the<00:02:04.429> run<00:02:04.610> position

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.960 

match<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.590> accelerator<00:02:10.190> like<00:02:10.519> in<00:02:11.500> 20<00:02:12.500> times

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
match the accelerator like in 20 times

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.490 
match the accelerator like in 20 times
forget<00:02:13.970> how<00:02:14.060> many<00:02:14.209> times<00:02:15.940> just<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:17.380> bunch<00:02:18.380> of

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
forget how many times just a bunch of

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:32.070 
forget how many times just a bunch of
times<00:02:20.739> and

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.360 

let's<00:02:32.500> go<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:32.740> info

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.880 

all<00:02:36.909> life<00:02:37.299> 100%<00:02:38.489> so<00:02:39.489> we've<00:02:40.420> reset<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.080> I<00:02:41.290> think

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
all life 100% so we've reset it I think

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.089 
all life 100% so we've reset it I think
it's<00:02:42.010> ten<00:02:42.310> times<00:02:42.640> or<00:02:43.650> ten<00:02:44.650> or<00:02:44.769> fifteen<00:02:45.069> times

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
it's ten times or ten or fifteen times

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.330 
it's ten times or ten or fifteen times
but<00:02:45.730> can<00:02:46.599> never<00:02:46.780> remember<00:02:46.989> so<00:02:47.409> just<00:02:47.680> do<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.280> a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
but can never remember so just do it a

00:02:48.340 --> 00:03:09.230 
but can never remember so just do it a
bunch<00:02:48.459> of<00:02:48.580> times<00:02:48.670> so<00:02:49.260> now<00:02:50.430> start<00:02:51.430> it<00:02:51.489> up

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.440 

you<00:03:09.720> got<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> service<00:03:10.350> air<00:03:10.620> bag<00:03:11.000> light<00:03:12.000> coming

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
you got a service air bag light coming

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.010 
you got a service air bag light coming
on<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.720> I've<00:03:12.840> got<00:03:13.050> a<00:03:13.080> fix

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.089 

let's<00:03:19.020> check<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.530> whole<00:03:20.160> life

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
let's check the whole life

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.559 
let's check the whole life
100

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.150 

but<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.319> won't<00:03:28.499> run<00:03:28.680> for<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:29.010> minute

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
but it won't run for a minute

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.140 
but it won't run for a minute
and<00:03:30.490> then<00:03:30.970> I'll<00:03:31.360> check<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.080> oil<00:03:32.110> again<00:03:32.620> and

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
and then I'll check the oil again and

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.280 
and then I'll check the oil again and
how<00:03:34.150> they<00:03:34.240> have<00:03:34.330> to<00:03:34.450> add<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:34.780> extra<00:03:35.080> half<00:03:35.260> a

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
how they have to add the extra half a

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.620 
how they have to add the extra half a
quart<00:03:35.790> that's<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:36.970> pretty<00:03:37.870> easy<00:03:39.300> never<00:03:40.300> take

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
quart that's it pretty easy never take

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.410 
quart that's it pretty easy never take
them<00:03:40.780> all<00:03:41.670> you'll<00:03:42.670> never<00:03:42.880> take<00:03:43.090> any<00:03:43.270> of<00:03:43.390> my

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
them all you'll never take any of my

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.820 
them all you'll never take any of my
vehicles<00:03:43.900> anywhere<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.410> have<00:03:44.530> a<00:03:44.560> little

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
vehicles anywhere to have a little

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.449 
vehicles anywhere to have a little
change

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
change

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.330 
change
and<00:03:46.640> it's<00:03:46.790> just

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:56.210 

-<00:03:49.910> easy

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220
