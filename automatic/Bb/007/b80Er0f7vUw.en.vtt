00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.230
 friends farmers friends farmer hello 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.820
 welcome to the farm welcome to 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.520
 cocotte tv today I present to you 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.470
 know it 240 m long since we 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.809
 let's continue an overview of all in one 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.239
 who arrived at the farm and there are some 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.640
 some believe me so here we 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.410
 are on goal 240 mm planned for 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.210
 overclocking and that offers especially 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.720
 a lack of maintenance since this 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.120
 are the only one firm and then crimped 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.129
 inside the box since 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.590
 basically that's what we 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.010
 interest again we have them 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.870
 warranty clauses the assembly guide 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.610
 for the cdh have besides small 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.729
 very simple passing remark really 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:08.640
 very simple and easy it may be 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.160
 its strong point of the two fans of 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.039
 120 mm so we find the same 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.140
 models than with the cdh which 120 the 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.810
 working blades and the cooler reminder 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.910
 master on a nepal rigid frame a 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.439
 sheath that surrounds the 3 pin but that can 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.000
 by the way is too much and the too fine the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:34.979
 pwm sorry I say anything the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.570
 second is to know a big this is 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.720
 in which we find in bulk the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.250
 backplate the claws of the frames in 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.439
 soft rubber to cushion the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.829
 vibrations about and fan 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.140
 frozen thermal paste at all to 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.110
 the time I made there a new take 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.640
 before us I will not say how much 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.549
 hold two takes it would be 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.130
 ridiculous so the airlock the tube of dough 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.829
 thermal and so that's all he 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.770
 must to proceed to the assembly 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.649
 then we have the cdh have in him 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.330
 even that's what interests us 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.600
 kind do my box and guard 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.400
 and close to me since I you 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.170
 give technical information 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.260
 just now so big 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.830
 changes compared to c's 120 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.470
 the 240 a radiator of 240 to its purposes 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.920
 classic finish a radiator 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.650
 watercooling simply so need 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.900
 to lay on it for a long time 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.920
 time against here 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.930
 the tips crimped here like it is 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.790
 certainly it is if you are made levels 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.910
 raise this little sticker recipe 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.150
 the warranty disappears with so 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.760
 pipes as you see it rather 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.220
 rigid guen of happy spring guen 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:57.570
 and mans rubber at a time to get 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.970
 return to the whole mass pump then 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.610
 the student a little angular freedom 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.410
 here I show you it's hard enough 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.650
 it's pretty steep but good at least we 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.590
 can place them starting the big 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.650
 quality of these gifts is its surface 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.959
 are not quite clean then 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.130
 the whole together with davis that 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.070
 you will not be able to disassemble head 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.110
 triangular the mazan without the set 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.459
 very healthy pong mass very very simple 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.350
 it is to be a pl is the healthiest to 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:31.050
 right now and I galley with the 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.560
 pipes to introduce you to the hood 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.180
 black who follows and pump a little 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.010
 range will illuminate on the cooler side 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.940
 master if I'm not mistaken since about 120 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.060
 it already is 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.260
 I am currently testing the 120th 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.700
 there is no reason that it does not make 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.590
 with this one so the pump is powered 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.810
 by a tiny guen is once again 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:57.480
 and in 3 pin here I went around 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.370
 to lend the small screws here I 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.959
 mets wanted to introduce what allows for 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.190
 proceed to a very fast assembly very 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.380
 simple you just put the grid you 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.970
 put the finished evisa it's actually it's 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.620
 not as simple as the iceberg that was 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.440
 the king of simplicity that level 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.030
 but really very fast so at 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.180
 level of technical characteristics 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.600
 and then I teach you is noted on the 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.390
 box 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.739
 we have very little information about 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.180
 the pump except it's a 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.690
 life expectancy of 70 thousand hours and 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.690
 that she consumes 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.210
 eight times sorry I was in the process of 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:31.860
 search and that's pretty much everything after 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.750
 a lot of information about the 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.909
 milk and fan which are therefore 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.490
 120 mm wanted to said they have a 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:40.530
 rotation speed from 600 to 2400 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:45.180
 minimal and 1400 rpm 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:50.699
 definitely that they have done enough m2 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.810
 cfm decidedly from 19 17 to 86,15 and who 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.550
 we have a life expectancy of 40 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.680
 thousand hours and that's about it all so 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.169
 the noise because I was going to tell you 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.110
 about knows whose noise 120 m 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.360
 from 19 to 40 db so in this case for 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.080
 120 which is currently being tested 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.150
 a rather quiet all in one at 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.650
 condition not to use the pwm 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.759
 otherwise they help me incessant shots 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.349
 accelerator 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:15.419
 I hope that will not be the case 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:17.610
 with this one I still have a small 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.009
 so the idea is still to 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.479
 my sense of putting them on a rheobus of 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:25.050
 way to see peace because 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:28.440
 truly when placed on 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.659
 a rheobus they are very quiet and 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.319
 victim years old i work with a vtx 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:37.020
 which has two fans on so 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:39.919
 it's dual gpu processor it's not 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:43.800
 necessarily a guarantee of silence 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.639
 but in my opinion placing them that can 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.009
 to be a good idea 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.259
 So here I invite you to read 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:51.120
 the written test that priest who will appear 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.469
 very soon on cowcotland.com and 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.889
 I wish you a very nice day 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:54.889
 to get
