00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
one here the last couple hours so I can

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.750 
one here the last couple hours so I can
actually<00:00:16.770> tell<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.160> difference<00:00:17.490> between<00:00:17.520> the

actually tell the difference between the
two<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.539> seat<00:00:18.840> was<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:19.109> lot<00:00:19.260> more<00:00:19.520> ergonomics

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
two the seat was a lot more ergonomics

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.220 
two the seat was a lot more ergonomics
adjustable<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.090> comfortable<00:00:21.480> even<00:00:22.170> though

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
adjustable and comfortable even though

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.259 
adjustable and comfortable even though
the<00:00:22.470> seat<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.010> pro<00:00:23.460> anglers<00:00:23.880> pretty<00:00:24.119> damn

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
the seat on the pro anglers pretty damn

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.670 
the seat on the pro anglers pretty damn
comfortable<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.170> ash<00:00:25.289> believe<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.619> or

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
comfortable this is ash believe it or

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.410 
comfortable this is ash believe it or
not<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.800> little<00:00:26.039> higher<00:00:26.160> more<00:00:26.430> comfortable<00:00:26.820> and

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
not a little higher more comfortable and

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.740 
not a little higher more comfortable and
as<00:00:27.510> far<00:00:27.660> as<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.900> boat<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.320> concerned<00:00:28.830> it's

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
as far as the boat is concerned it's

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.990 
as far as the boat is concerned it's
obviously<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.840> very<00:00:30.869> similar<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:32.000> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
obviously is very similar to the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.270 
obviously is very similar to the
original<00:00:33.570> pro<00:00:34.050> angler<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.710> one<00:00:34.890> however<00:00:34.980> is

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
original pro angler this one however is

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.229 
original pro angler this one however is
to<00:00:35.309> foot<00:00:35.610> shorter<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:37.110> couple<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.920> lessons

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
to foot shorter a couple of lessons

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.119 
to foot shorter a couple of lessons
horizontal<00:00:39.239> rod<00:00:39.329> storage<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.860> boat<00:00:41.100> is

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
horizontal rod storage here the boat is

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.190 
horizontal rod storage here the boat is
much<00:00:41.640> more<00:00:41.879> nimble<00:00:42.210> for<00:00:42.629> our<00:00:42.719> spinning<00:00:43.110> of

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
much more nimble for our spinning of

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.100 
much more nimble for our spinning of
stuff<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.559> concerned<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.300> it's<00:00:45.300> 25<00:00:45.750> pounds

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
stuff is concerned you it's 25 pounds

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.900 
stuff is concerned you it's 25 pounds
lighter<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:46.890> man<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.489> spin<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:47.879> a

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
lighter but man you can spin on a

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.889 
lighter but man you can spin on a
freaking<00:00:48.329> dime<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.379> did<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> 180<00:00:50.899> while

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
freaking dime I just did a 180 while

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.910 
freaking dime I just did a 180 while
we're<00:00:52.079> on<00:00:52.430> well<00:00:53.430> I'm<00:00:53.550> vlogging<00:00:53.760> here<00:00:54.920> it's

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
we're on well I'm vlogging here it's

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.340 
we're on well I'm vlogging here it's
more<00:00:56.219> nimble<00:00:56.640> meaning<00:00:56.940> also<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.930> seems<00:00:58.170> like

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
more nimble meaning also it seems like

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.930 
more nimble meaning also it seems like
it's<00:00:58.739> just<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.010> little<00:00:59.190> higher<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.579> waters

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
it's just a little higher in the waters

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.389 
it's just a little higher in the waters
to<00:01:00.090> me<00:01:00.359> well<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.500> probably<00:01:01.739> sitting<00:01:02.280> higher

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
to me well it's probably sitting higher

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.539 
to me well it's probably sitting higher
and<00:01:03.080> I<00:01:04.080> can<00:01:04.229> actually<00:01:04.530> move<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.070> little<00:01:05.189> faster

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
and I can actually move a little faster

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.980 
and I can actually move a little faster
well<00:01:06.030> that's<00:01:06.180> probably<00:01:06.299> because<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.780> also

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
well that's probably because it's also

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.230 
well that's probably because it's also
25<00:01:07.530> pounds<00:01:08.369> lighter<00:01:08.549> from<00:01:08.760> what<00:01:08.909> they<00:01:09.000> tell<00:01:09.180> me

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
25 pounds lighter from what they tell me

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.149 
25 pounds lighter from what they tell me
so<00:01:10.020> far<00:01:10.290> all<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:12.200> feature<00:01:13.200> wise<00:01:13.500> it's<00:01:13.950> pretty

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
so far all the feature wise it's pretty

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.670 
so far all the feature wise it's pretty
close<00:01:14.400> obviously<00:01:15.060> two<00:01:15.420> foot<00:01:15.630> Celeste<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.500> get

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
close obviously two foot Celeste you get

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.499 
close obviously two foot Celeste you get
less<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.100> them<00:01:17.600> you<00:01:18.600> get<00:01:18.780> less<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.290> storage

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
less of them you get less of a storage

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.499 
less of them you get less of a storage
but<00:01:21.509> for<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.750> most<00:01:21.900> part<00:01:22.020> everything<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.740> here

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
but for the most part everything is here

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.190 
but for the most part everything is here
stability<00:01:24.509> wise<00:01:24.979> it's<00:01:25.979> actually<00:01:26.369> negligible

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
stability wise it's actually negligible

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.870 
stability wise it's actually negligible
it's<00:01:28.200> yes<00:01:28.500> it's<00:01:28.740> lot<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> little<00:01:29.520> less

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it's yes it's lot is a little less

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.060 
it's yes it's lot is a little less
stable<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:30.479> as<00:01:30.600> far<00:01:30.810> as<00:01:30.869> stability<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.920> was

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
stable but as far as stability it was

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.980 
stable but as far as stability it was
still<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.520> most<00:01:32.610> stable<00:01:32.850> kayak<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.750> haven't

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
still the most stable kayak I haven't

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.670 
still the most stable kayak I haven't
been<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:35.299> next<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> pro<00:01:36.570> angler<00:01:36.750> the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
been in next to the pro angler the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.560 
been in next to the pro angler the
original<00:01:38.009> one

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
original one

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.790 
original one
so<00:01:40.440> far<00:01:40.770> it's<00:01:41.159> pretty<00:01:41.370> cool<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.800> basically

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
so far it's pretty cool so basically

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.540 
so far it's pretty cool so basically
it's<00:01:44.040> lighter<00:01:45.710> still<00:01:46.710> stable<00:01:46.979> set<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.430> can

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
it's lighter still stable set I can

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.680 
it's lighter still stable set I can
definitely<00:01:47.610> stand<00:01:47.970> up<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.210> paddle<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.540> this

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
definitely stand up and paddle in this

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
definitely stand up and paddle in this
and<00:01:48.840> take<00:01:48.930> pictures<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.380> do<00:01:49.470> whatever<00:01:49.590> I

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
and take pictures and do whatever I

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.020 
and take pictures and do whatever I
gotta<00:01:49.860> do<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:52.560> bat<00:01:55.369> just<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.580> cool<00:01:56.820> seat

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
gotta do so the bat just a cool seat
