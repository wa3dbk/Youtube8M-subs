00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
we'll do next let's take our straight

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.660 
we'll do next let's take our straight
edge<00:00:24.470> lay<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.529> across<00:00:25.619> our<00:00:26.070> cylinder<00:00:26.550> right

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
edge lay it across our cylinder right

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.240 
edge lay it across our cylinder right
here<00:00:27.110> what<00:00:28.110> we're<00:00:28.230> gonna<00:00:28.320> do<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.740> check<00:00:29.070> from

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
here what we're gonna do is check from

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.269 
here what we're gonna do is check from
warpage<00:00:29.700> and<00:00:30.439> get<00:00:31.439> an<00:00:31.560> idea<00:00:31.829> of<00:00:31.890> how<00:00:32.040> much

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
warpage and get an idea of how much

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.250 
warpage and get an idea of how much
we're<00:00:32.700> going<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.970> take<00:00:33.120> off<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.420> head<00:00:33.570> we<00:00:34.050> get

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
we're going to take off the head we get

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.310 
we're going to take off the head we get
it<00:00:34.350> put<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.560> on<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.680> middle<00:00:35.010> okay<00:00:36.079> so<00:00:37.079> take<00:00:37.290> a

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
it put it on the middle okay so take a

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.729 
it put it on the middle okay so take a
feeler<00:00:37.680> gauge<00:00:38.270> you<00:00:39.270> got<00:00:39.390> mm<00:00:40.110> right<00:00:40.260> here<00:00:42.739> right

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
feeler gauge you got mm right here right

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.470 
feeler gauge you got mm right here right
now<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.100> not<00:00:44.309> getting<00:00:45.120> underneath<00:00:45.269> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
now it's not getting underneath the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.250 
now it's not getting underneath the
straight<00:00:45.750> edge<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.800> far<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.070> good<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:48.260> little

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
straight edge so so far so good a little

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.580 
straight edge so so far so good a little
low<00:00:50.070> spot<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.489> everything<00:00:50.730> right<00:00:50.940> there<00:00:51.590> so

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
low spot and everything right there so

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.639 
low spot and everything right there so
get<00:00:53.070> mm<00:00:53.699> underneath<00:00:54.000> there

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
get mm underneath there

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.009 
get mm underneath there
usually<00:00:55.649> say<00:00:56.609> it's<00:00:56.730> out<00:00:56.850> say<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.449> out<00:00:57.600> for

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
usually say it's out say it's out for

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.619 
usually say it's out say it's out for
thousands<00:00:58.500> okay<00:00:59.100> they'll<00:00:59.370> take<00:00:59.640> roughly<00:01:00.179> five

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
thousands okay they'll take roughly five

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.560 
thousands okay they'll take roughly five
five<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.769> a<00:01:01.800> half<00:01:02.210> just<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.359> get<00:01:03.480> it

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
five and a half just to get it

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.010 
five and a half just to get it
straightened<00:01:03.929> up<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.470> true

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.410 

once<00:01:07.560> also<00:01:07.830> gives<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.340> an<00:01:08.430> idea<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:09.060> they're

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
once also gives you an idea that they're

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.620 
once also gives you an idea that they're
out<00:01:09.510> too<00:01:09.750> much<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.380> they<00:01:10.860> have<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.100> adjust

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
out too much and they have to adjust

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.880 
out too much and they have to adjust
what<00:01:12.630> they<00:01:12.780> can<00:01:12.960> set<00:01:13.110> gasps<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.470> get<00:01:13.620> to<00:01:13.710> put

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
what they can set gasps you get to put

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.260 
what they can set gasps you get to put
on<00:01:14.010> -<00:01:14.280> okay<00:01:15.830> so<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.860> can<00:01:17.160> take<00:01:17.190> up<00:01:17.910> some<00:01:18.150> of

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
on - okay so that can take up some of

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.270 
on - okay so that can take up some of
the<00:01:18.330> slack<00:01:18.510> for<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.110> being<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.410> wheel<00:01:19.560> off<00:01:19.740> right

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
the slack for it being a wheel off right

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.380 
the slack for it being a wheel off right
and<00:01:20.430> they<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.550> also<00:01:23.000> adjust<00:01:24.000> your

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
and they can also adjust your

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.000 
and they can also adjust your
compression<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:24.990> everything<00:01:25.290> -<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.800> say

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
compression and everything - you say

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.080 
compression and everything - you say
yeah<00:01:26.810> usually<00:01:27.810> when<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.320> get<00:01:28.940> you<00:01:29.940> start

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
yeah usually when you get you start

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.940 
yeah usually when you get you start
cutting<00:01:30.450> at<00:01:30.750> least<00:01:30.930> ten<00:01:31.200> thousandths<00:01:31.740> when

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
cutting at least ten thousandths when

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.210 
cutting at least ten thousandths when
you<00:01:32.070> start<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.700> notice<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.060> change<00:01:33.330> in<00:01:33.600> your

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
you start to notice the change in your

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.910 
you start to notice the change in your
compression<00:01:35.220> points<00:01:35.610> okay<00:01:36.590> but<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.770> can

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
compression points okay but you can

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.090 
compression points okay but you can
compensate<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:39.259> with<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> different

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
compensate that with a different

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.210 
compensate that with a different
thickness<00:01:41.570> gasket<00:01:42.570> all<00:01:43.320> right<00:01:43.530> sounds<00:01:43.979> pretty

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
thickness gasket all right sounds pretty

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.820 
thickness gasket all right sounds pretty
straight<00:01:44.570> what's<00:01:45.570> those<00:01:45.690> Camry<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:46.619> then<00:01:46.740> you

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
straight what's those Camry but then you

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.680 
straight what's those Camry but then you
got<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> little<00:01:47.190> larger<00:01:47.399> from<00:01:47.550> stock<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.630> know

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
little more sturdier and they last

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:50.150 
little more sturdier and they last
longer

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
longer

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.320
