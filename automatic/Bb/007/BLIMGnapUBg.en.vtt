00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
and fish them out afterwards

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.090 
and fish them out afterwards
you've<00:01:48.990> got<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.259> cracked<00:01:49.500> black<00:01:49.649> pepper<00:01:49.710> in

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
there it'll turn to mush and it just

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.719 
there it'll turn to mush and it just
won't<00:01:51.540> be<00:01:51.630> very<00:01:51.840> nice<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.200> eat<00:01:52.350> also<00:01:53.310> going<00:01:53.549> in

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729

too<00:02:02.340> much<00:02:02.369> about<00:02:02.549> measuring<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.240> half<00:02:03.680> and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
too much about measuring that half and

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.289 
too much about measuring that half and
the<00:02:04.829> liquid<00:02:05.250> going<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.640> there<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:06.000> grape

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
the liquid going in there is grape

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.880 
the liquid going in there is grape
molasses<00:02:06.869> now<00:02:07.020> if<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.200> haven't<00:02:07.530> heard<00:02:07.680> of

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
molasses now if you haven't heard of

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.309 
molasses now if you haven't heard of
grape<00:02:08.129> molasses<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:09.330> just<00:02:09.599> an<00:02:09.720> unrefined

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
grape molasses it's just an unrefined

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.840 
grape molasses it's just an unrefined
grape<00:02:10.800> sugar<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.340> they<00:02:11.430> can't

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
grape sugar that they can't

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.820 
grape sugar that they can't
trade<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.180> down<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.810> could<00:02:13.050> use<00:02:13.230> golden<00:02:13.560> syrup

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
trade it down you could use golden syrup

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.770 
trade it down you could use golden syrup
you<00:02:14.010> could<00:02:14.160> just<00:02:14.340> use<00:02:14.460> normal<00:02:14.670> sugar<00:02:14.850> I<00:02:15.360> just

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
you could just use normal sugar I just

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.060 
you could just use normal sugar I just
think<00:02:15.930> this<00:02:16.020> adds<00:02:16.200> a<00:02:16.320> really<00:02:16.530> really<00:02:16.920> nice
