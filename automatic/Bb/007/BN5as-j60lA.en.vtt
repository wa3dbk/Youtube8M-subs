we're<00:00:54.899> getting<00:00:55.109> the<00:00:55.199> back<00:00:55.379> wheel<00:00:55.559> off<00:00:55.679> and

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
we're getting the back wheel off and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.680 
we're getting the back wheel off and
putting<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.670> back<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:57.030> there's<00:00:57.390> actually<00:00:57.659> a

putting it back on there's actually a

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.540 
putting it back on there's actually a
simple<00:00:58.079> way<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.230> doing<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.249> should<00:00:59.429> be

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
simple way of doing it and you should be

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.799 
simple way of doing it and you should be
able<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.909> change<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.420> relatively

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
able to change it in the relatively

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.410 
able to change it in the relatively
short<00:01:00.870> space<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.350> time<00:01:01.559> with<00:01:02.249> these<00:01:02.370> tips<00:01:02.640> so

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
short space of time with these tips so

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.999 
short space of time with these tips so
the<00:01:03.539> likelihood<00:01:03.749> is<00:01:04.140> when<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.500> punch<00:01:04.769> sure

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
the likelihood is when you punch sure

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.440 
the likelihood is when you punch sure
you're<00:01:05.430> not<00:01:05.610> going<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.880> be<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.149> smallest

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
you're not going to be in the smallest

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.440 
you're not going to be in the smallest
gear<00:01:06.810> at<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.049> back<00:01:07.320> what<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.340> want<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.670> do<00:01:08.820> to

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
gear at the back what you want to do to

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.940 
gear at the back what you want to do to
make<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> back<00:01:09.899> really<00:01:10.110> easier<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.560> take<00:01:10.710> off

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
make the back really easier to take off

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.910 
make the back really easier to take off
is<00:01:11.220> put<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.210> chain<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.869> smallest<00:01:13.140> gear<00:01:13.470> so

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
is put the chain in the smallest gear so

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.670 
is put the chain in the smallest gear so
to<00:01:13.979> do<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.369> just<00:01:14.579> lift<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.060> bike<00:01:15.180> up<00:01:15.680> start

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
to do that just lift the bike up start

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.160 
to do that just lift the bike up start
spinning<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> pedals<00:01:17.579> and<00:01:17.790> change<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.960> gears

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
spinning the pedals and change the gears

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.209 
spinning the pedals and change the gears
down<00:01:20.719> so<00:01:21.719> the<00:01:21.840> bike<00:01:22.020> then<00:01:22.290> goes<00:01:22.770> into<00:01:22.979> its

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
down so the bike then goes into its

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:24.679 
down so the bike then goes into its
smaller<00:01:23.490> skier<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.880> makes<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.329> back<00:01:24.509> wheel

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
smaller skier that makes the back wheel

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.440 
smaller skier that makes the back wheel
easier<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.350> drop<00:01:25.560> off<00:01:25.820> stop<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.969> wheeler<00:01:27.149> spin

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
easier to drop off stop the wheeler spin

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.730 
easier to drop off stop the wheeler spin
in<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:29.119> clip<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:31.350> quick-release<00:01:32.509> and<00:01:33.740> drop

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
in and clip the quick-release and drop

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.730 
in and clip the quick-release and drop
the<00:01:34.890> wheel<00:01:35.009> out<00:01:35.270> as<00:01:36.270> simple<00:01:37.020> as<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.649> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
the wheel out as simple as that so the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.800 
the wheel out as simple as that so the
back<00:01:37.920> wheels<00:01:38.189> off<00:01:38.399> the<00:01:38.460> bike<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:39.299> next<00:01:39.630> step

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
back wheels off the bike the next step

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.529 
back wheels off the bike the next step
is<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.110> take<00:01:40.289> the<00:01:40.409> tire<00:01:40.680> or<00:01:40.950> half<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.880> tire<00:01:42.270> off

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
is to take the tire or half the tire off

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.840 
is to take the tire or half the tire off
the<00:01:42.600> rim<00:01:42.930> need<00:01:43.799> your<00:01:43.920> tire<00:01:44.130> leave<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.700> do

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
the rim need your tire leave this to do

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.749 
the rim need your tire leave this to do
this<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:46.200> one<00:01:46.409> tire<00:01:46.680> lever<00:01:47.930> under<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> tire

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
this so one tire lever under the tire

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.569

into<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:26.170> tire<00:02:26.410> but<00:02:27.040> before<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.550> do<00:02:27.700> that<00:02:27.850> you

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
into the tire but before you do that you

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.400 
into the tire but before you do that you
need<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.240> check<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.780> tire<00:02:28.990> doesn't<00:02:29.320> have

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
be wire from the road in the tire so if

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.750 
be wire from the road in the tire so if
there's<00:02:53.530> no<00:02:53.650> problems<00:02:54.040> with<00:02:54.130> the<00:02:54.250> tire<00:02:54.460> and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
there's no problems with the tire and

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.730 
there's no problems with the tire and
you've<00:02:55.270> checked<00:02:55.510> it<00:02:55.660> for<00:02:55.840> any<00:02:55.960> cuts<00:02:56.230> any<00:02:56.410> glass

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
you've checked it for any cuts any glass

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.460 
you've checked it for any cuts any glass
the<00:02:57.370> next<00:02:57.670> step<00:02:57.880> is<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.720> get<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.080> new<00:02:59.320> inner

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
the next step is to get the new inner

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.840 
the next step is to get the new inner
tube<00:02:59.610> onto<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.790> wheel<00:03:01.170> so<00:03:02.550> you've<00:03:03.550> got<00:03:03.730> your

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
tube onto the wheel so you've got your

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.730 
tube onto the wheel so you've got your
new<00:03:04.000> inner<00:03:04.180> tube<00:03:04.350> firstly<00:03:05.350> you<00:03:05.410> want<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.590> put<00:03:05.710> a

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
new inner tube firstly you want to put a

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.730 
new inner tube firstly you want to put a
little<00:03:05.980> bit<00:03:06.130> of<00:03:06.280> air<00:03:06.460> into<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.850> tube<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:08.560> make

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
little bit of air into the tube to make

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.240 
little bit of air into the tube to make
sure<00:03:08.950> that<00:03:09.100> when<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.430> do<00:03:09.610> pump<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:10.030> back<00:03:10.180> up

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
sure that when you do pump it back up

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.010 
sure that when you do pump it back up
you<00:03:12.250> don't<00:03:12.460> pinch<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.120> on<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.420> rim<00:03:13.600> or<00:03:13.810> with

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
you don't pinch it on the rim or with

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.580 
you don't pinch it on the rim or with
the<00:03:14.110> tire

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.190 

you<00:03:20.160> don't<00:03:20.340> need<00:03:20.489> too<00:03:20.670> much<00:03:20.819> just<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:22.170> little

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
you don't need too much just a little

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.290 
you don't need too much just a little
bit<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.739> air<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:25.590> find<00:03:26.129> where<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.819> valve<00:03:27.030> hole

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
bit of air so find where the valve hole

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.670 
bit of air so find where the valve hole
is<00:03:27.510> initially<00:03:28.069> the<00:03:29.069> valve<00:03:29.310> holes<00:03:29.610> there<00:03:30.680> put

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
is initially the valve holes there put

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.449 
is initially the valve holes there put
the<00:03:31.800> valve<00:03:32.040> through<00:03:32.879> the<00:03:33.450> rim<00:03:33.660> first<00:03:34.459> then

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
the valve through the rim first then

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.619 
the valve through the rim first then
you're<00:03:35.670> going<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.849> run<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.900> tube<00:03:38.239> into<00:03:39.239> the

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
you're going to run the tube into the

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:46.520 
you're going to run the tube into the
tire<00:03:43.129> then<00:03:44.129> from<00:03:44.430> the<00:03:44.549> valve<00:03:45.230> roll<00:03:46.230> all<00:03:46.349> that

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
tire then from the valve roll all that

00:03:46.530 --> 00:04:08.500 
tire then from the valve roll all that
tube<00:03:46.860> so<00:03:47.819> it's<00:03:47.970> sitting<00:03:48.180> on<00:03:48.390> top<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.870> rim

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.470 

so<00:04:09.050> now<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.290> tube<00:04:09.620> should<00:04:09.830> be<00:04:09.890> sat<00:04:10.250> in<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:11.269> rim

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
so now the tube should be sat in the rim

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.300 
so now the tube should be sat in the rim
all<00:04:11.840> the<00:04:12.379> way<00:04:12.500> around<00:04:13.690> once<00:04:14.690> you've<00:04:14.870> done<00:04:14.989> that

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
all the way around once you've done that

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.879 
all the way around once you've done that
you<00:04:16.310> can<00:04:16.430> let<00:04:16.760> a<00:04:16.790> little<00:04:16.970> bit<00:04:17.209> of<00:04:17.299> air<00:04:17.620> back<00:04:18.620> out

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
you can let a little bit of air back out

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.860 
you can let a little bit of air back out
of<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:19.519> inner<00:04:19.669> tube<00:04:19.820> but<00:04:20.060> make<00:04:20.239> sure<00:04:20.269> there's

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
of the inner tube but make sure there's

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.020 
of the inner tube but make sure there's
a<00:04:20.959> bit<00:04:21.109> of<00:04:21.139> air<00:04:21.380> left<00:04:21.799> in<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.340> inner<00:04:22.460> tube<00:04:22.550> so

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
a bit of air left in the inner tube so

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.000 
a bit of air left in the inner tube so
that<00:04:23.150> when<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.419> roll<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.660> tire<00:04:23.990> back<00:04:24.229> on<00:04:24.500> you

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
that when you roll the tire back on you

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.800 
that when you roll the tire back on you
don't<00:04:25.190> pan<00:04:25.400> sure<00:04:25.550> it<00:04:25.669> or<00:04:25.790> pinch<00:04:26.030> it<00:04:26.240> so<00:04:26.419> the

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
don't pan sure it or pinch it so the

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.460 
don't pan sure it or pinch it so the
inner<00:04:26.930> tube<00:04:27.199> is<00:04:27.800> now<00:04:28.100> back<00:04:28.910> on<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.449> rim<00:04:29.660> you

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
inner tube is now back on the rim you

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.760 
inner tube is now back on the rim you
need<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:30.710> get<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:30.919> tire<00:04:31.190> on<00:04:31.880> to<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.660> wheel<00:04:32.780> so

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
need to get the tire on to the wheel so

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.640 
need to get the tire on to the wheel so
you<00:04:33.800> start<00:04:34.160> folding<00:04:35.050> from<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.199> valve<00:04:36.410> area

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
you start folding from the valve area

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.480 
you start folding from the valve area
first<00:04:37.419> around<00:04:38.419> the<00:04:39.229> wheel<00:04:39.440> making<00:04:40.100> sure<00:04:40.310> the

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
first around the wheel making sure the

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.010 
first around the wheel making sure the
tire<00:04:40.699> goes<00:04:41.060> into<00:04:41.510> it<00:04:41.630> into<00:04:41.960> the<00:04:42.050> rim<00:04:43.900> make<00:04:44.900> sure

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
tire goes into it into the rim make sure

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.350 
tire goes into it into the rim make sure
it<00:04:45.139> sits<00:04:45.320> in<00:04:45.530> there<00:04:45.680> properly<00:04:45.949> and<00:04:46.340> just<00:04:47.210> keep

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
it sits in there properly and just keep

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.629 
it sits in there properly and just keep
rolling<00:04:47.570> and<00:04:48.190> roll<00:04:49.190> in<00:04:49.430> all<00:04:49.850> the<00:04:50.479> way<00:04:50.600> around

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
until you get to the end most tires you

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.590 
until you get to the end most tires you
can<00:04:57.169> just<00:04:57.380> roll<00:04:57.740> them<00:04:58.039> on<00:04:59.740> all<00:05:00.740> the<00:05:01.039> way<00:05:01.160> around

if you're struggling to get the tire on
the<00:05:04.130> last<00:05:04.340> little<00:05:04.699> bit<00:05:05.020> which<00:05:06.020> mostly<00:05:06.440> most<00:05:06.979> of

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
the last little bit which mostly most of

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.040 
the last little bit which mostly most of
the<00:05:07.160> time<00:05:07.340> you<00:05:07.460> can<00:05:07.580> just<00:05:07.610> roll<00:05:07.940> it<00:05:08.090> on<00:05:08.240> but<00:05:08.930> if

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
the time you can just roll it on but if

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.200 
the time you can just roll it on but if
you<00:05:09.139> can't<00:05:09.440> then<00:05:10.100> you<00:05:10.130> can<00:05:10.400> use<00:05:10.580> a<00:05:10.610> tire<00:05:10.970> lever

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
you can't then you can use a tire lever

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.779 
you can't then you can use a tire lever
to<00:05:11.539> get<00:05:11.660> it<00:05:11.810> on<00:05:11.930> if<00:05:12.710> you're<00:05:13.400> going<00:05:13.550> to<00:05:13.669> use<00:05:13.760> a

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
to get it on if you're going to use a

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.730 
to get it on if you're going to use a
tire<00:05:14.120> lever<00:05:14.330> to<00:05:14.690> put<00:05:14.840> the<00:05:14.930> last<00:05:15.110> little<00:05:15.410> bit<00:05:15.620> on

tire lever to put the last little bit on

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.589 
tire lever to put the last little bit on
you've<00:05:15.889> got<00:05:15.979> to<00:05:16.010> be<00:05:16.130> very<00:05:16.310> careful<00:05:16.669> that<00:05:17.180> you

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
you've got to be very careful that you

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:19.629 
you've got to be very careful that you
don't<00:05:17.810> pinch<00:05:18.169> the<00:05:18.380> inner<00:05:18.530> tube<00:05:18.740> with<00:05:18.919> it<00:05:19.039> so

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:19.639 
don't pinch the inner tube with it so

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:21.129 
don't pinch the inner tube with it so
you<00:05:19.729> just<00:05:19.880> have<00:05:20.060> to<00:05:20.120> do<00:05:20.300> a<00:05:20.330> little<00:05:20.690> bit<00:05:20.960> at<00:05:21.080> a

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
you just have to do a little bit at a

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:21.670 
you just have to do a little bit at a
time

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
time

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:32.620 
time
put<00:05:22.099> the<00:05:22.190> tire<00:05:22.430> lever<00:05:23.919> under<00:05:24.919> the<00:05:25.010> rim

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.010 

and<00:05:33.220> roll<00:05:34.220> it<00:05:34.250> and<00:05:34.610> that<00:05:35.450> I'll<00:05:35.540> just<00:05:35.720> get<00:05:35.900> the

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
and roll it and that I'll just get the

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.380 
and roll it and that I'll just get the
last<00:05:36.170> little<00:05:36.470> bit<00:05:36.620> of<00:05:36.650> the<00:05:36.770> tire<00:05:36.980> on<00:05:37.580> and<00:05:38.330> you

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
last little bit of the tire on and you

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.810 
last little bit of the tire on and you
can<00:05:38.510> just<00:05:38.660> flick<00:05:39.260> it<00:05:39.440> once<00:05:40.400> you've<00:05:40.580> got<00:05:40.700> the

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
can just flick it once you've got the

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.820 
can just flick it once you've got the

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
tire back on the rim you just want to

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.740 
tire back on the rim you just want to
check<00:05:42.980> that<00:05:43.040> the<00:05:43.220> inner<00:05:43.430> tube<00:05:43.670> isn't<00:05:44.270> sticking

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
check that the inner tube isn't sticking

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.840 
check that the inner tube isn't sticking
out<00:05:44.870> from<00:05:45.080> underneath<00:05:45.350> the<00:05:45.500> tire<00:05:45.770> anywhere<00:05:46.220> so

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
out from underneath the tire anywhere so

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.670 
out from underneath the tire anywhere so
just<00:05:47.090> have<00:05:47.240> a<00:05:47.270> quick<00:05:47.480> look<00:05:47.540> around<00:05:47.960> make<00:05:48.650> sure

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
just have a quick look around make sure

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
properly if it's all looking good then

the bike it was in the smallest gear on
the<00:06:25.030> back<00:06:25.240> that<00:06:25.600> was<00:06:25.750> easier<00:06:26.080> to<00:06:26.230> take<00:06:26.380> it<00:06:26.530> off

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
the back that was easier to take it off

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.890 
the back that was easier to take it off
it<00:06:27.280> sorts<00:06:27.520> we're<00:06:27.640> going<00:06:27.760> to<00:06:27.820> eat<00:06:27.940> be<00:06:28.120> easier<00:06:28.630> to

it sorts we're going to eat be easier to

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:37.350 
it sorts we're going to eat be easier to
put<00:06:29.020> it<00:06:29.140> back<00:06:29.290> on
