in other words scarring is inherited

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.130 
in other words scarring is inherited
just<00:00:52.100> like<00:00:52.280> you<00:00:52.490> inherit<00:00:52.970> your<00:00:53.180> hair<00:00:53.870> color

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
just like you inherit your hair color

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.070 
just like you inherit your hair color
and<00:00:54.350> eye<00:00:54.470> color<00:00:54.500> from<00:00:55.070> mom<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:55.490> dad<00:00:55.640> so<00:00:56.090> -<00:00:56.150> you

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
and eye color from mom and dad so - you

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.250 
and eye color from mom and dad so - you
inherit<00:00:57.560> wound<00:00:57.800> healing<00:00:58.040> characteristics

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
in the year 2000 I believe are near

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.670 
in the year 2000 I believe are near
there<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:04.400> human<00:01:04.790> genome<00:01:05.299> was<00:01:06.020> mapped<00:01:06.380> out

there the human genome was mapped out
that<00:01:06.860> I<00:01:06.890> should<00:01:07.009> believe<00:01:07.460> that<00:01:07.520> over<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:08.000> next

that I should believe that over the next
twenty<00:01:08.570> to<00:01:08.600> thirty<00:01:08.930> years<00:01:09.320> as<00:01:09.560> details<00:01:10.310> of

question regarding it in summary I will

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.860 
question regarding it in summary I will
say<00:05:48.419> that<00:05:49.139> if<00:05:49.500> you<00:05:49.560> have<00:05:50.340> are<00:05:50.610> a<00:05:51.150> very<00:05:51.539> strong

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
say that if you have are a very strong

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.409 
say that if you have are a very strong
candidate<00:05:52.500> for<00:05:52.530> a<00:05:52.770> given<00:05:53.099> procedure<00:05:53.490> keloids

candidate for a given procedure keloids

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.450 
candidate for a given procedure keloids
running<00:05:55.409> your<00:05:55.530> family<00:05:55.949> or<00:05:56.039> you've<00:05:56.190> had<00:05:56.340> them

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:58.889 
before they can't occur again so that's

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:00.469 
before they can't occur again so that's
where<00:05:59.280> you're<00:05:59.430> going<00:05:59.460> to<00:05:59.699> take<00:05:59.729> the<00:06:00.000> benefits
