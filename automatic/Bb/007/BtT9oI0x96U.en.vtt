00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.929
 this month highlights the flowering of 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.779
 roses and jasmines to growth 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.340
 we are going to dedicate these two species 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:19.200
 encouraging the flowering by pruning what 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.689
 no longer serves and preventing those 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.310
 pests that can damage them is also 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.500
 time to make a garden garden 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.110
 that's why we will do a very practical and 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.150
 comfortable to put on a terrace even 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.579
 of department 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.860
 we will leave for the jasmine at this time 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.690
 you have to do a pruning of cleaning is 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.820
 one of the most difficult species of 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.410
 clean but if it's not done over time 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.320
 is transformed into a dirty bush that 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.600
 becomes uncontrollable with a scissor 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.660
 bypass we are cutting the branches and flowers 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.519
 In addition, it is good to move the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.680
 creeper for flowers to fall 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.769
 loose and help us hand in hand 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.140
 overcutting with this help 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.449
 between light and do not age before 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.030
 in addition, this avoids creating 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.610
 corners where they can nest spiders 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.710
 fungus or other pests is a pruning 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.869
 drastic but you have to do them in a couple 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.310
 of weeks more will sprout again and for 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.840
 stimulate this development we are going to 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.510
 apply a complete fertilizer and 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.510
 we will improve the earth 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.510
 and 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.430
 and 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.250
 in general when the springs are very 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.290
 humid species like the roses 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.750
 geraniums and discs are attacked 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.820
 for a white mushroom called glass that 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.490
 It occurs mainly in the leaves 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.920
 and on the stems what it does is dry 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.619
 leaves and branches to damage the plant 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.659
 completely the best is to prevent your 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.040
 appearance with the magnetic suffers a 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.420
 powder that dissolves in water 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.420
 maybe it weighs on the foliage 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.920
 in this time we can start 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.840
 enjoy the herbs and vegetables from 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.910
 the orchards and of course think about 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.729
 have your own with very little space what 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.050
 we can achieve for example with these 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.580
 vegetable boxes that can be 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.710
 get in the meadow or any other 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.600
 fair they choose a little to get the 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.110
 splinters and then protected with a 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.110
 impregnating 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.920
 and we settled on the height with some 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.870
 supports that can be made of bricks or 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.629
 even old plastic flowerpots 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.970
 and as a base a table where to put the 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:36.010
 garden drawers 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.660
 it is good that the drawers have these 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.580
 separations because they do not work for the 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.770
 drainage but to prevent the earth 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.630
 come out let's put inside a 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.010
 plastic covering the base and 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.270
 sides 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.220
 it is important to do some 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.620
 perforations to the plastic so that the 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.290
 water can drain the soil mixture 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.000
 it has to be compost in abundance for 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.920
 some sand from the ampa to help the 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.260
 sewer system 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.000
 and in the upper layers with the compost 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.000
 We apply peat to retain moisture 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.710
 when we raise them we have to group the 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.630
 according to size so there are no shadows 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.760
 with each other and we can put one 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.470
 aromatic plant like rue at the center 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.110
 in order to drive away pests 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.820
 those chosen in lettuce should be 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.700
 face in spring when the 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.580
 temperature is not so high you need a 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.310
 soft soil a lot of organic matter and a 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.560
 Daily watering excess water produces 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.040
 diseases or burns on the edges 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.040
 of the leaves 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.890
 other varieties to plant are the tomato 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.630
 cherry and cilantro that needs more 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.210
 Sun 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.760
 the sun and basil are semi shade 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:54.860
 and wet floors and regrets that if you have 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.860
 a cool floor resists the sun and frost 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.950
 we add a little fertilizer 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:03.400
 for vegetables and then we water in 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.400
 abundance 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.500
 the garden can also start from 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:16.139
 seedlings to make our plants 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.299
 here is to plant in containers 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.419
 small ones controlling moisture well and 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.310
 light on the subject of the maximum we have 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.199
 A question from Katy who wants to know 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.720
 if on the seed it is advisable 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.550
 use compost or a common ground the 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.500
 ideal is that you use compost because it is 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.150
 a much more fluffy land instead 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.430
 leaf land or other common land 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.409
 comes with the remains of leaf sprigs that 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.449
 could interfere with germination 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:42.729
 the next question is from alexis 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.469
 vargas who has a durable in that his 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.110
 fruit is chopped and you want to know what 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:49.209
 make the mica fruit or it may be due to a 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.580
 attack of a bird or a plot 

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:53.289
 that attack in the night for both cases 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.360
 there are specialized products that 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.330
 orient the birds or control the 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.699
 appearance of cribs 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.069
 we have the question of change kings that 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.810
 planted grass very recently and stella has 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:06.030
 left irregularly and wants to know 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.800
 if you must re-sow if you have left 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.539
 irregular shape is probably because 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.270
 in some sectors it does not receive well water 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:14.159
 or because it has shade in those cases there are 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.020
 to give it a little more time and it could 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:18.060
 help him with some fertilizer rich in 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.500
 nitrogen but it should not be a 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.870
 Reseed until at least wait 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.760
 three months 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.170
 not all the plants in the garden 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.150
 they need light with the same intensity 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.710
 that's why they can use a pair of water 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.540
 totora that we can move it from 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.100
 according to the need for shadows in addition 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.810
 remember that the earth must be 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.090
 always wet therefore it is done 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.660
 a lot of heat to water at least two 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.660
 times a day
