 hello to all gamescollection.it friends 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.809
 welcome to this very special 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.300
 dedicated to nintendo world 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.849
 championship one of the cartridges no more 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.799
 coveted on the face of the earth 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.539
 so today let's talk about something related 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.490
 to the world of competitions 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.170
 video games for which we cannot not 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.599
 to mention other titles 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.670
 details like atlantis 2 released for 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.199
 atari vcs a much more version 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.509
 difficult indeed from competition 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.000
 challenged by the magic it is the 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.880
 same original atlantis but modified 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.829
 ready for live championships like 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.950
 don't even remember the cartridge for 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.070
 mega drive master world videogames 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.579
 championship 2 with nba jam inside 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.800
 tournament edition is already thread 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.329
 obviously in the championship version and 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.690
 live therefore always with limits of 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.940
 time 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.739
 moreover, they went out for PC engines 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.870
 special cartridges for the action 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.239
 caravan festivals in particular 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.019
 we remember dog the star soldier find a 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.420
 soldier 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:06.020
 finally the cartridges come out only at the level 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.750
 of star fox star live competitions 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.689
 wing but now we come to what the is 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.700
 highlight of our video which is the 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.159
 nintendo world championship 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.280
 what you see is one of the cartridges 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.280
 go out for the nintendo workshop 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.320
 will change called from the inside and 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.680
 realized in 1990 that has traveled well 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.350
 29 cities in the united states is this one 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.869
 shannon webster in the 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.030
 stage of tenders the distributed cartridges 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.610
 they were officially 90 in the version 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.240
 gray and 25 in the golden version that 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.790
 also sells extracted from the readers of 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.710
 nintendo power evaluation 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:51.020
 currently on ebay is enough 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.200
 tending upwards since the last one 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.619
 sold cartridges and gray is gone 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.119
 at some $ 10,500 though 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.060
 probably the most evaluation 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.170
 consistent and is between 7 thousand e 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.780
 9 thousand dollars 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.670
 in any case, guys since we're on 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.330
 games with accents come and see always 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.009
 the dott 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.459
 let's see how they worked the 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.459
 voice plan 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.430
 the games inside from cartoon 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.130
 there were three super mario bros 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.770
 there was a time red racer and tetris 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.930
 6 minutes limit and 21 in which 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.180
 he drew in the first level dedicated to 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.890
 super mario bros complete the collection 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:53.910
 as many as 50 repressed coins complete 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.790
 all the path from norcia to growth 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.920
 being a ntsc cartridge on ours 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.320
 nintendo that I do not mean pal turns anymore 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.240
 slowly even tracer areas presents of 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.020
 graphic glitches probably due 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.310
 just for use on the hand console 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.250
 finally that awakens to do the most 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.020
 points were taken points 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.690
 made of super mario bros 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.850
 points made in rai tracer e 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.940
 multiplied by 10 and the points made 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.780
 in the trees and multiplied by 25 that 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.780
 gave the total 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.340
 the absolute record is 4 million 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.430
 points while the tournament record was from 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.689
 it seems to me about 2 million and 800 thousand 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.200
 points 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:44.269
 and I made as many as 108 thousand moreover 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.420
 you can find a king pro pro am et 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.670
 still today on the retro usb site that 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.329
 produces both the india world championship 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.400
 that the camusso guys is everything there 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.739
 we really presented a pearl 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.569
 which I would say probably unique in Italy 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.040
 because I don't know any other owners 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.879
 Italians of a Nintendo World 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.739
 championship 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.769
 hello to all from web faith see you at 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.769
