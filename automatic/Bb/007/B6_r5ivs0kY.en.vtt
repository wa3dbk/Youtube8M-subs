separated and then I'm going to add in

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.090 
separated and then I'm going to add in
just<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.550> little<00:02:17.060> bit<00:02:17.210> of<00:02:17.360> Dijon<00:02:17.660> or<00:02:18.290> mustard

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
just a little bit of Dijon or mustard

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.880 
just a little bit of Dijon or mustard
I've<00:02:19.460> used<00:02:19.670> spicy<00:02:20.090> mustard<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:21.380> don't<00:02:21.590> have

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
I've used spicy mustard you don't have

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.190 
I've used spicy mustard you don't have
to<00:02:22.220> do<00:02:22.370> this<00:02:22.580> it's<00:02:22.910> just<00:02:22.970> I<00:02:23.240> think<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.810> adds<00:02:24.020> a

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
to do this it's just I think it adds a

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.680 
to do this it's just I think it adds a
little<00:02:24.500> bit<00:02:24.620> more<00:02:24.920> moisture<00:02:25.850> I'm<00:02:26.300> not<00:02:26.480> really

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
little bit more moisture I'm not really

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.960 
little bit more moisture I'm not really
measuring<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.650> would<00:02:27.830> say<00:02:28.040> it's<00:02:28.280> probably<00:02:28.580> a

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
measuring I would say it's probably a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.810 
measuring I would say it's probably a
tablespoon<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:30.200> little<00:02:30.680> bit<00:02:30.800> more<00:02:31.100> maybe<00:02:31.459> and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
tablespoon a little bit more maybe and

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.690 
tablespoon a little bit more maybe and
then<00:02:32.330> I'm<00:02:32.510> going<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.810> be<00:02:32.990> adding<00:02:33.470> in<00:02:33.590> two<00:02:34.220> of

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.520 
recipe technically calls for two pounds
but<00:02:44.660> this<00:02:44.930> is<00:02:45.820> 1.25<00:02:46.820> pounds<00:02:47.690> and<00:02:47.870> I<00:02:47.959> think<00:02:48.260> it's

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
but this is 1.25 pounds and I think it's

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.360 
but this is 1.25 pounds and I think it's
fine<00:02:48.920> just<00:02:48.950> adding<00:02:49.820> all<00:02:50.060> of<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.390> in<00:02:50.540> there<00:02:51.370> so

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
fine just adding all of it in there so

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.210 
fine just adding all of it in there so
to<00:02:52.400> mix<00:02:53.030> it<00:02:53.270> up<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:53.420> just<00:02:53.660> add<00:02:54.170> everything<00:02:54.890> in

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
to mix it up you just add everything in

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.840 
to mix it up you just add everything in
and<00:02:55.550> just<00:02:55.820> really<00:02:56.810> really<00:02:57.020> use<00:02:57.890> your<00:02:58.130> hands

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.490 
and incorporate it all together it takes
a<00:03:02.450> little<00:03:02.630> while<00:03:04.300> so<00:03:05.300> here<00:03:05.720> is<00:03:05.989> what<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.320> looks
