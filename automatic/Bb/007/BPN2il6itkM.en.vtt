00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.930
 Hello, welcome to Todd's kitchen. Mousse is a well-known desert, it is also easy to make, 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.930
 But I am going to make it much better. So join me today because I put my version of peanut butter and marshmallow mousse. 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.660
 To start getting into the microwave bowl 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.179
 Will be in our marshmallows. I have already quickly rinsed these marshmallows. 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.249
 Just to remove excess flour, it may be outside. I also gave them a quick 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.309
 Take some paper towels to remove any excess water to dry. 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.610
 Pour a glass of milk in the first quarter 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.230
 Then add in our peanut butter 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.460
 Now, put the bowl in the microwave, we want microwave 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.739
 One minute at a time 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.090
 Stir each time 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.690
 Until it is melted and combined 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.390
 Thicken the cream or heavy cream or whipped cream and pour it into the mixing bowl. 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.390
 Next, whip it with a hand mixer or a blender until the soft peak begins to form. 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.520
 So this is what we are after. 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.160
 You can see that the soft peak has formed 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.490
 Next with the cream, you will need about a quarter 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.600
 Place in 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.700
 Peanut butter mix 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.670
 Now fully mixed, through 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.240
 Once mixed 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.350
 The rest of our cream 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.549
 Put it into the intestines 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.299
 And what we have to do is be careful 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.420
 By folding 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.870
 It is difficult to mix, so keep the cream in the air. 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.750
 So continue to fold until you combine 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.170
 Once the cream has been completely folded through 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.760
 We want to use a dessert glass 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.760
 Pour some mixture immediately 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.630
 Just some clear packaging 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.810
 Cover 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.620
 So it's beautiful and airtight 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.959
 Now put it in the fridge, a good two hour setting 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.669
 I have taken it out of the fridge and it is set up very well. 

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.239
 So the last step, I have to add a little bit 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.769
 cream 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.619
 Just at the top 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:22.950
 Itâ€™s time to try this. 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.349
 Look at that 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.899
 Nice, fluffy 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:34.259
 This is fantastic 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:38.400
 This is really a lovely infusion from the taste of peanut butter and marshmallow 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.330
 The mousse is so fluffy and light, I can say with certainty that this peanut butter and marshmallow mousse taste 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.979
 Simple and incredible 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:50.609
 So give it a go, because I promise you will like this one, you really will. 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.219
 You can see it is very easy to make 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:58.099
 So, just a few hours before dinner, you will have a lovely dessert 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.070
