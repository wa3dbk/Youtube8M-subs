I<00:02:36.070> see<00:02:36.760> it's<00:02:36.880> probably<00:02:37.150> going<00:02:37.240> to<00:02:37.300> switch<00:02:37.480> out

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690

this<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.200> next<00:02:38.440> stone<00:02:38.620> so<00:02:38.830> I'm<00:02:39.010> thinking<00:02:39.310> he

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
this the next stone so I'm thinking he

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.340 
this the next stone so I'm thinking he
might<00:02:39.400> go<00:02:39.820> into<00:02:40.060> his<00:02:40.330> Heatran<00:02:40.720> because<00:02:41.020> he

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
might go into his Heatran because he

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.230
