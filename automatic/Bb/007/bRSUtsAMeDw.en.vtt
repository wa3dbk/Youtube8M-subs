ACR<00:03:26.110> which<00:03:26.320> is<00:03:26.580> absolutely<00:03:27.580> crazy<00:03:27.850> because<00:03:28.120> I

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
ACR which is absolutely crazy because I

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.900

think<00:03:28.390> in<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:29.110> entire<00:03:29.410> lifecycle<00:03:30.070> of<00:03:30.400> monitor

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
think in the entire lifecycle of monitor

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.400 
think in the entire lifecycle of monitor
for<00:03:31.030> three<00:03:31.209> I<00:03:31.239> didn't<00:03:31.600> get<00:03:31.720> a<00:03:31.780> gun<00:03:31.959> streak<00:03:32.260> this

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
for three I didn't get a gun streak this

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.810 
for three I didn't get a gun streak this
high<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:32.739> so<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:32.920> fact<00:03:33.160> that<00:03:33.250> I<00:03:33.400> jump<00:03:33.670> on

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
high and so the fact that I jump on

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.509 
high and so the fact that I jump on
there<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.290> you<00:03:35.290> know<00:03:35.380> first<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.830> second<00:03:36.340> game

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
there and you know first the second game

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.090 
there and you know first the second game
on<00:03:36.550> I<00:03:36.940> get<00:03:37.209> a<00:03:37.239> 43<00:03:37.690> gunstreak<00:03:38.050> so<00:03:38.290> I<00:03:38.470> think<00:03:38.890> I

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
on I get a 43 gunstreak so I think I

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.350 
on I get a 43 gunstreak so I think I
