00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.109
 hello in touch lad violet and 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.110
 today i will tell you how easy and 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.910
 just root a rose from a bouquet 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.730
 surely many lovely ladies as a gift for 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.090
 March 8 from their favorite men received 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.070
 a gorgeous bouquet of roses and of course many 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.290
 of us thought about how to extend 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.790
 the beauty of your home or at the very 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.480
 household plot 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.310
 but many probably did not succeed 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.460
 propagate a rose from a bouquet 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.859
 usually we put the stalk just in the water and 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.820
 sooner or later he either dries up either 

00:00:35.859 --> 00:00:41.890
 rotting but trying to reproduce suffers 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.780
 fail today tell you how easy and 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.559
 just all the same 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.719
 root the rose from the cutting and step by step 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.890
 I will show you how to do this for us. 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.579
 you will need a rose stalk itself 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.489
 earth mixture 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.479
 containers in which we will plant roses 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:05.770
 water blade sand and root for 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:09.000
 speeding rooting so for a start 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.000
 prepare the mixture 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.960
 which we will plant our cutting 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.640
 take the capacity of it one in put 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.100
 small drainage I as a drainage 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.670
 use foam can be put 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.399
 pebbles but drainage is a must in 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:33.189
 In this case, we put a small thin 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:36.240
 layer so that the moisture does not stagnate it 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.369
 level I think you will be enough 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.859
 next layer 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.909
 go earthy mix remember the saying 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:47.259
 rose is the daughter of dung and oddly enough better 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.560
 all rooted 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:54.000
 rose in peat mix so I chose 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.850
 specially substrate purchased and out 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 did myself and about half 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.000
 containers 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:10.149
 we sprinkle the earth and the third part which 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.120
 maybe someone doesn't know maybe someone 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.280
 He knows, but this sand is always on top. 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.060
 need to fill a layer of sand not thick 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.900
 less than 3 centimeters can take the river 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.909
 sand sea as possible as my case 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.909
 usually and even building sand 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.230
 so in the end 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.790
 capaciously earthy mixture we have turned 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.750
 I repeat at the bottom we have a small 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.459
 drainage layer your soil and top layer 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.730
 sand 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.549
 approximately two to three centimeters now 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.769
 go to the very cuttings 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.049
 not recommended rooting cuttings of roses 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.900
 which stood for so long the best 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:57.489
 part for rooting will be 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.010
 the middle part of our stem stalk we 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.470
 we will do from here this part 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:08.379
 on the kidneys they are all green great and 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:11.110
 cheerful so we leave three buds 1 2 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:14.140
 and 3 lower kidney will serve 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:18.010
 the basis for the formation of the root 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:24.280
 systems and 2 3 kidneys i have to give 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:30.370
 sprigs and so the top of the rose we 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:35.500
 cut off at right angles just above 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:39.040
 kidney roughly several 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.519
 millimeters here are little fingers bottom 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.319
 we cut at a 45 degree angle 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.310
 directly by the kidney itself that is 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:50.760
 I cut it will burn 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.760
 copper so 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.790
 Well, our cutting is now left 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:02.940
 just plant it prepared in advance 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.940
 so land we are now in wet sand 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:13.180
 therefore fastens to not very fast 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:18.510
 the lower part is where my husband's roots i 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.510
 I recommend dipping fed 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:35.140
 for faster our rooting she 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:37.050
 tried to hole in and rooted on 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:45.210
 the depth 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:47.080
 boundaries of gum sand so here 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.340
 now only 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:54.270
 cover the whole thing with a can or 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.590
 as a package you create greenhouse conditions and 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.110
 wait a week three four when 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.030
 there will be first roots follow my 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.690
 video I'll show you what of this 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.690
 happened
