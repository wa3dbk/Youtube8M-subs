00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:43.000
 hello, I 'm Santa Claus, as you know 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.160
 my main mission is to deliver gifts 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.680
 to children around the world in 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.190
 poinsettia sure you will be 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:55.600
 asking how can I do it in so 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:59.379
 only one day and one night, it's thanks 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:03.010
 to my best friends the reindeer here in 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:06.190
 Lapland I have lots and lots of 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.039
 reindeer and they are very dear to me but 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.640
 there is one that is especially in my 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.979
 heart 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.570
 I guess you know I'm talking 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.890
 of quartz 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.039
 Rodolfo gets his great speed 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.850
 mainly thanks to a plant that 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:26.039
 it's called super lichen the super lichen 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.670
 gives special powers that allow you 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:32.909
 fly the reindeer I challenge the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.600
 time zones taking the routes of the 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.600
 Aurora borealis 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:43.659
 lichen is an indigenous plant of 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.659
 laponia and of course it's organic 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.180
 first the lichen dries and then 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.490
 we add a magic potion since 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.000
 we are talking about a magic potion 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.660
 I can not tell you what they contain 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.960
 but if I can tell you that we have added 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:05.740
 a tree lichen especially 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.220
 selected by the elves 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.060
 and they have collected and ground into powder 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:17.520
 I'm also sure that it includes some 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.520
 of the special herbs of mama noel 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:26.830

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:34.370

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:37.099
 [Music] 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.010
 but I can not give much super lichen to 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.830
 my hands if I did, they would be flying 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:49.480
 through the skies of Lapland to the 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.480
 summer this has happened years ago 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.779
 [Music] 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.110

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:03.000
 dazzling speed of my ninth 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:05.250

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.030
