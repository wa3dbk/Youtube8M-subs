have<00:01:39.509> also<00:01:39.689> used<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:42.000> cap<00:01:42.710> staples<00:01:43.710> as

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
have also used the the cap staples as

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.770 
have also used the the cap staples as
well<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:44.820> when<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.060> staple<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.570> we're

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
well so when we staple this we're

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.749 
well so when we staple this we're
stapling<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.290> caps<00:01:46.560> which<00:01:47.310> helps<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.640> little

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
stapling with caps which helps a little

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.399 
stapling with caps which helps a little
bit<00:01:47.970> for<00:01:48.180> weather<00:01:48.360> sealing<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:48.960> really<00:01:49.200> even

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
bit for weather sealing but really even

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.960 
bit for weather sealing but really even
more<00:01:49.710> importantly<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.490> make<00:01:50.640> sure<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
more importantly is to make sure in a

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.120 
more importantly is to make sure in a
windy<00:01:51.210> day<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.409> our<00:01:52.439> tie<00:01:52.710> VEX<00:01:52.979> not

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
windy day like this that our tie VEX not

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.490 
windy day like this that our tie VEX not
getting<00:01:53.369> blown<00:01:53.579> off<00:01:53.869> exactly<00:01:54.869> okay<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.320> our

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
getting blown off exactly okay so our

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.260 
getting blown off exactly okay so our
build<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.770> demeanor<00:01:56.040> oath<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:56.880> wrap<00:01:57.060> our

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
build in demeanor oath so we wrap our

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.260 
build in demeanor oath so we wrap our
house<00:01:57.479> we<00:01:58.049> just<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:59.280> we<00:01:59.549> do<00:01:59.729> on<00:01:59.850> all<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.149> them

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
house we just like we do on all of them

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.630 
house we just like we do on all of them
we<00:02:00.420> will<00:02:00.689> cut<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.049> flush<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.710> Tyvek<00:02:01.950> flush

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
we will cut the flush the Tyvek flush

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.090 
we will cut the flush the Tyvek flush
with<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.969> sill<00:02:03.479> at<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.530> top<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:04.950> bottom

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
with the sill at the top and the bottom

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.059 
with the sill at the top and the bottom
will<00:02:05.850> wrap<00:02:06.060> our<00:02:06.270> legs<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.829> so<00:02:07.829> we've<00:02:07.979> got

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
will wrap our legs in so we've got

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.949 
will wrap our legs in so we've got
protection<00:02:08.580> there<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.060> then<00:02:09.690> what<00:02:09.840> we'll

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
protection there and then what we'll

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.020 
protection there and then what we'll
take<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.679> our<00:02:10.920> DuPont<00:02:11.370> flex<00:02:11.670> wrap<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.540> action

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
take is our DuPont flex wrap and action

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.720 
take is our DuPont flex wrap and action
we<00:02:13.120> run<00:02:13.990> it<00:02:14.140> from<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:14.440> inside<00:02:14.709> of<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.890> SIL<00:02:15.130> all

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
we run it from the inside of the SIL all

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.600 
we run it from the inside of the SIL all
the<00:02:16.090> way<00:02:16.209> down<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.690> face<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.380> this<00:02:18.069> flex<00:02:18.340> rep

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
the way down the face and this flex rep

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.130 
the way down the face and this flex rep
is<00:02:18.760> great<00:02:19.000> because<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:19.330> can<00:02:19.480> actually<00:02:19.750> make<00:02:20.110> a

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
is great because you can actually make a

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.460 
is great because you can actually make a
90-degree<00:02:20.530> corner<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.520> you<00:02:21.610> just<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:22.720> wrap

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
90-degree corner and you just you wrap

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.430 
90-degree corner and you just you wrap
it<00:02:23.620> up<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.250> then<00:02:25.150> you<00:02:25.300> pull<00:02:25.569> it<00:02:25.750> down<00:02:25.990> and<00:02:26.350> it

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
it up and then you pull it down and it

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.110 
it up and then you pull it down and it
actually<00:02:26.470> makes<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.160> corner<00:02:27.550> real<00:02:27.730> good<00:02:27.940> and

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
actually makes this corner real good and

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.840 
actually makes this corner real good and
it<00:02:28.240> just<00:02:28.420> sticks<00:02:28.660> break<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:30.400> we'll<00:02:30.580> handle

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
it just sticks break so we'll handle

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.120 
it just sticks break so we'll handle
that<00:02:31.030> that<00:02:31.420> way<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.930> then<00:02:32.080> at<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.319> top<00:02:32.530> we<00:02:32.830> cut

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
that that way and then at the top we cut

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.840 
that that way and then at the top we cut
from<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.120> corners<00:02:34.510> we<00:02:34.690> cut<00:02:34.900> up<00:02:34.930> 45<00:02:35.830> and<00:02:36.130> 45<00:02:36.430> on

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
from the corners we cut up 45 and 45 on

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.820 
from the corners we cut up 45 and 45 on
each<00:02:37.000> side<00:02:37.300> so<00:02:37.660> after<00:02:38.110> we<00:02:38.230> set<00:02:38.410> our<00:02:38.530> window

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
each side so after we set our window

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.600 
each side so after we set our window
flange<00:02:39.160> in<00:02:40.440> we'll<00:02:41.440> first<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.340> window

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
flange in we'll first the window

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.820 
flange in we'll first the window
flange<00:02:42.880> on<00:02:43.180> three<00:02:43.420> sides<00:02:43.660> up<00:02:44.170> so<00:02:44.530> we<00:02:44.650> get<00:02:44.770> a

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
flange on three sides up so we get a

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.009 
flange on three sides up so we get a
good<00:02:45.010> air<00:02:45.220> seal<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:45.880> we<00:02:46.420> have<00:02:46.570> a<00:02:46.600> means<00:02:46.900> of

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
good air seal and we have a means of

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.440 
good air seal and we have a means of
escape<00:02:47.170> for<00:02:47.650> any<00:02:47.800> moisture<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.340> may<00:02:48.550> get

escape for any moisture that may get

but it's something like 10% of all
windows<00:03:21.970> leak<00:03:22.269> and<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:23.049> problem<00:03:23.350> is<00:03:23.440> the

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
windows leak and the problem is the

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.020 
windows leak and the problem is the
manufacturers<00:03:24.190> are<00:03:24.340> not<00:03:24.459> putting<00:03:24.670> a<00:03:24.790> sticker

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.160 
manufacturers are not putting a sticker
on<00:03:25.120> there<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.480> tell<00:03:25.630> you<00:03:25.690> which<00:03:25.840> ones<00:03:26.079> are

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
on there to tell you which ones are

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.870 
on there to tell you which ones are
going<00:03:26.260> to<00:03:26.350> leak<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.709> which<00:03:26.799> ones<00:03:27.070> aren't<00:03:27.310> so

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
going to leak and which ones aren't so

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.090 
going to leak and which ones aren't so
we<00:03:28.090> have<00:03:28.299> to<00:03:28.450> assume<00:03:28.780> that<00:03:28.840> every<00:03:29.530> window<00:03:29.709> is

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
we have to assume that every window is

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.009 
we have to assume that every window is
going<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.489> leak<00:03:30.790> which<00:03:31.030> of<00:03:31.180> course<00:03:31.420> it<00:03:31.570> will<00:03:31.720> in

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
going to leak which of course it will in

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.810 
going to leak which of course it will in
time<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:32.860> what<00:03:33.070> we're<00:03:33.220> doing<00:03:33.250> here<00:03:33.519> with<00:03:33.760> the

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
time so what we're doing here with the

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.000 
time so what we're doing here with the
sill<00:03:34.180> pan<00:03:34.450> protection<00:03:35.019> is<00:03:35.380> incredibly

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
sill pan protection is incredibly

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.370 
sill pan protection is incredibly
important<00:03:36.549> do<00:03:37.000> not<00:03:37.299> miss<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.810> step<00:03:38.110> from

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
important do not miss the step from

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.620 
important do not miss the step from
protecting<00:03:38.860> your<00:03:39.010> sill<00:03:39.280> from<00:03:39.850> water<00:03:40.120> that<00:03:40.390> may

protecting your sill from water that may
intrude<00:03:41.110> especially<00:03:41.799> at<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:41.980> corners<00:03:42.400> where

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
intrude especially at the corners where

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:44.580 
intrude especially at the corners where
your<00:03:43.420> window<00:03:43.750> frames<00:03:44.049> are<00:03:44.230> coming<00:03:44.470> together

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
your window frames are coming together

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.009 
your window frames are coming together
that's<00:03:44.980> an<00:03:45.130> important<00:03:45.670> step<00:03:45.910> that<00:03:46.510> I<00:03:46.570> cannot

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
that's an important step that I cannot

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.050 
that's an important step that I cannot
stress<00:03:47.470> enough<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.829> must<00:03:48.489> be<00:03:48.579> taken<00:03:48.940> on

products that we throw it at these
houses<00:03:57.090> we<00:03:58.090> really<00:03:58.720> need<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:58.959> be<00:03:59.049> careful

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
houses we really need to be careful

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.380 
houses we really need to be careful
about<00:03:59.440> how<00:03:59.950> we're<00:04:00.220> applying<00:04:00.459> these<00:04:00.850> products

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
about how we're applying these products

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.660 
about how we're applying these products
yeah<00:04:01.720> how<00:04:01.989> we're<00:04:02.230> installing<00:04:02.590> them<00:04:02.950> and<00:04:03.190> you

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
yeah how we're installing them and you

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.550 
yeah how we're installing them and you
just<00:04:03.850> have<00:04:04.030> to<00:04:04.150> think<00:04:04.420> about<00:04:04.660> what<00:04:05.079> a<00:04:05.109> window

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
just have to think about what a window

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.380 
just have to think about what a window
does<00:04:05.799> in<00:04:06.100> an<00:04:06.220> opening<00:04:06.700> it's<00:04:06.880> just<00:04:07.090> a<00:04:07.180> perfect

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
does in an opening it's just a perfect

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.930 
does in an opening it's just a perfect
place<00:04:07.630> for<00:04:07.720> water<00:04:08.140> and<00:04:08.500> air<00:04:09.100> to<00:04:09.280> get<00:04:09.430> in<00:04:09.640> so<00:04:09.880> you

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
place for water and air to get in so you

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.550 
place for water and air to get in so you
really<00:04:10.480> have<00:04:10.600> to<00:04:10.660> be<00:04:10.840> careful<00:04:11.230> with<00:04:11.350> how<00:04:11.500> you

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
really have to be careful with how you

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.250 
really have to be careful with how you
seal<00:04:11.950> these<00:04:12.160> all<00:04:13.090> right<00:04:13.239> so<00:04:13.540> we're<00:04:13.690> back<00:04:13.720> what

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
seal these all right so we're back what

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.870 
seal these all right so we're back what
we've<00:04:14.410> done<00:04:14.560> is<00:04:14.799> we<00:04:14.950> put<00:04:14.980> our<00:04:15.280> caulking<00:04:15.700> all

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
we've done is we put our caulking all

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.870 
we've done is we put our caulking all
around<00:04:16.150> three<00:04:16.450> sides<00:04:16.720> top<00:04:17.109> both<00:04:17.799> sides<00:04:18.130> and

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
around three sides top both sides and

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.300 
around three sides top both sides and
not<00:04:19.120> on<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:19.359> silk<00:04:19.630> not<00:04:20.079> in<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.380> sill<00:04:20.620> we<00:04:21.099> want

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
not on the silk not in the sill we want

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.740 
not on the silk not in the sill we want
a<00:04:21.370> means<00:04:21.580> of<00:04:21.700> escape<00:04:21.849> for<00:04:22.270> any<00:04:22.390> water<00:04:22.539> that

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
a means of escape for any water that

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.170 
a means of escape for any water that
might<00:04:22.990> get<00:04:23.229> in<00:04:23.380> there<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:24.700> we've<00:04:24.849> laid<00:04:25.030> our

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
might get in there and we've laid our

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.550 
might get in there and we've laid our
window<00:04:25.479> up<00:04:25.659> there<00:04:25.870> too

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
window up there too

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.470 
window up there too
they<00:04:26.650> what<00:04:26.830> we're<00:04:26.980> using<00:04:27.190> is<00:04:27.490> because<00:04:28.150> we<00:04:28.270> have

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
they what we're using is because we have

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.000 
they what we're using is because we have
a<00:04:28.510> bunch<00:04:28.780> of<00:04:28.900> windows<00:04:29.230> on<00:04:29.380> our<00:04:29.530> first<00:04:29.800> floor

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
a bunch of windows on our first floor

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.920 
a bunch of windows on our first floor
that<00:04:30.250> all<00:04:30.430> need<00:04:30.730> to<00:04:30.820> be<00:04:30.940> lined<00:04:31.150> up<00:04:31.360> what<00:04:31.660> we<00:04:31.780> did

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
that all need to be lined up what we did

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.040 
that all need to be lined up what we did
is<00:04:32.050> we<00:04:32.230> ran<00:04:32.410> our<00:04:32.590> laser<00:04:32.860> level<00:04:33.280> from<00:04:33.460> inside

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
is we ran our laser level from inside

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.600 
is we ran our laser level from inside
and<00:04:35.050> this<00:04:35.169> just<00:04:35.470> ensures<00:04:35.620> that<00:04:35.860> all<00:04:36.250> of<00:04:36.520> our

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
and this just ensures that all of our

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.659 
and this just ensures that all of our
windows<00:04:37.090> are<00:04:37.389> all<00:04:37.570> common<00:04:38.110> and<00:04:38.320> one<00:04:38.950> constant

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
windows are all common and one constant

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.220 
windows are all common and one constant
level<00:04:39.970> from<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.240> inside<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:40.810> it<00:04:40.930> really

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
level from the inside and it really

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.350 
level from the inside and it really
helps<00:04:41.560> you<00:04:41.680> a<00:04:41.710> lot<00:04:41.919> when<00:04:42.070> you<00:04:42.130> come<00:04:42.400> to<00:04:42.550> trim

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
helps you a lot when you come to trim

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.100 
helps you a lot when you come to trim
stage<00:04:44.760> and<00:04:45.760> really<00:04:46.060> on<00:04:46.210> the<00:04:46.300> exterior<00:04:46.630> as<00:04:46.900> well

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
stage and really on the exterior as well

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.960 
stage and really on the exterior as well
so<00:04:47.440> everything<00:04:47.530> aligns<00:04:47.980> up<00:04:48.190> by<00:04:48.340> sight<00:04:48.580> as<00:04:48.730> well

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
so everything aligns up by sight as well

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.790 
so everything aligns up by sight as well
so<00:04:49.660> we've<00:04:49.810> got<00:04:49.930> our<00:04:50.050> window<00:04:50.320> set<00:04:50.590> in

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
so we've got our window set in

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.879 
so we've got our window set in
everything<00:04:51.790> is<00:04:51.880> perfectly<00:04:52.270> plumb<00:04:52.889> perfectly

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
everything is perfectly plumb perfectly

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.920 
everything is perfectly plumb perfectly
level<00:04:54.250> we've<00:04:54.940> got<00:04:55.090> it<00:04:55.210> centered<00:04:55.480> in<00:04:55.630> a<00:04:55.720> hole

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
level we've got it centered in a hole

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.219 
level we've got it centered in a hole
like<00:04:56.230> we<00:04:56.410> like<00:04:56.590> it<00:04:57.690> we've<00:04:58.690> got<00:04:58.810> two<00:04:58.900> lined<00:04:59.080> up

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
like we like it we've got two lined up

windows in with a nail gun what I like
to<00:05:09.910> do<00:05:10.060> is<00:05:10.150> I<00:05:10.270> like<00:05:10.690> to<00:05:10.750> use<00:05:10.870> a<00:05:10.960> roofing<00:05:11.380> nail

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
to do is I like to use a roofing nail

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.909 
to do is I like to use a roofing nail
it's<00:05:11.860> got<00:05:11.979> a<00:05:12.010> big<00:05:12.280> head<00:05:12.490> it's<00:05:13.240> galvanized<00:05:13.919> you

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
it's got a big head it's galvanized you

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.850 
it's got a big head it's galvanized you
can<00:05:15.040> get<00:05:15.250> a<00:05:15.280> good<00:05:15.639> fit<00:05:16.000> and<00:05:16.570> the<00:05:17.470> pneumatic

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
can get a good fit and the pneumatic

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.710 
can get a good fit and the pneumatic
pressure<00:05:18.250> is<00:05:18.580> not<00:05:18.729> jostling<00:05:19.330> your<00:05:19.450> window

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
pressure is not jostling your window

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.600 
pressure is not jostling your window
around<00:05:19.990> or<00:05:20.290> crimping<00:05:20.950> the<00:05:21.070> flange<00:05:21.310> or

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610

around or crimping the flange or
anything<00:05:21.820> like<00:05:22.180> that<00:05:22.210> so<00:05:22.780> typically<00:05:23.770> if<00:05:23.979> we're

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
anything like that so typically if we're

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.440 
anything like that so typically if we're
set<00:05:24.340> in<00:05:24.430> a<00:05:24.460> window<00:05:24.760> and<00:05:24.790> inside<00:05:25.150> a<00:05:25.180> square

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
set in a window and inside a square

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.600 
set in a window and inside a square
we'll<00:05:25.810> start<00:05:26.050> at<00:05:26.169> one<00:05:26.320> corner<00:05:26.350> and<00:05:26.919> then<00:05:27.430> work

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
we'll start at one corner and then work

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.850 
we'll start at one corner and then work
our<00:05:27.790> way<00:05:27.820> to<00:05:28.270> where<00:05:28.389> we<00:05:28.600> need<00:05:28.780> to<00:05:28.810> be<00:05:29.050> in<00:05:29.260> this

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
our way to where we need to be in this

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.860 
our way to where we need to be in this
case<00:05:30.130> everything's<00:05:30.910> perfect<00:05:31.360> so<00:05:31.600> what<00:05:31.720> we're

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
case everything's perfect so what we're

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:32.670 
case everything's perfect so what we're
going<00:05:31.960> to<00:05:32.020> do<00:05:32.140> is<00:05:32.229> we're<00:05:32.320> going<00:05:32.350> to<00:05:32.470> go<00:05:32.620> ahead

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
going to do is we're going to go ahead

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.380 
going to do is we're going to go ahead
and<00:05:32.860> start<00:05:33.010> right<00:05:33.220> here<00:05:33.430> and<00:05:33.580> throw<00:05:34.090> it<00:05:34.240> in<00:05:34.330> the

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
and start right here and throw it in the

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.070 
and start right here and throw it in the
bottom<00:05:34.750> to<00:05:35.110> stabilize<00:05:35.560> that<00:05:35.800> go<00:05:36.280> ahead<00:05:36.430> -<00:05:37.080> and

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
bottom to stabilize that go ahead - and

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.150 
bottom to stabilize that go ahead - and
then<00:05:38.200> after<00:05:38.350> we<00:05:38.590> throw<00:05:38.770> that<00:05:38.919> one<00:05:39.039> on<00:05:39.100> the

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 
then after we throw that one on the

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.290 
then after we throw that one on the
bottom<00:05:39.340> you<00:05:39.580> normally<00:05:39.910> go<00:05:40.030> in<00:05:40.150> and

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
bottom you normally go in and

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.430 
bottom you normally go in and
double-check<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:40.840> laser<00:05:41.020> to<00:05:41.200> make<00:05:41.320> sure

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
double-check the laser to make sure

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.620 
double-check the laser to make sure
everything's<00:05:41.770> still<00:05:42.580> intact<00:05:42.910> we'll<00:05:43.210> do<00:05:43.419> that

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
everything's still intact we'll do that

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.380 
everything's still intact we'll do that
if<00:05:44.220> you<00:05:45.220> know<00:05:45.370> sometimes<00:05:45.850> windows<00:05:46.270> are

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
if you know sometimes windows are

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.080 
if you know sometimes windows are
problematic<00:05:46.840> sometimes<00:05:47.350> or<00:05:47.800> not<00:05:47.950> so<00:05:48.700> far<00:05:48.940> all

now what we're doing is coming back with

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.000 
now what we're doing is coming back with
our<00:06:12.130> straight<00:06:12.400> flash<00:06:12.639> and<00:06:13.600> of<00:06:13.990> course<00:06:14.229> we<00:06:14.860> do

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
our straight flash and of course we do

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.240 
our straight flash and of course we do
our<00:06:15.130> legs<00:06:15.340> first<00:06:16.169> both<00:06:17.169> sides<00:06:17.440> and<00:06:18.010> then<00:06:18.160> we

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
our legs first both sides and then we

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.129 
our legs first both sides and then we
come<00:06:18.430> across<00:06:18.550> over<00:06:19.330> the<00:06:19.450> top<00:06:19.630> of<00:06:19.780> our<00:06:19.870> legs

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 
come across over the top of our legs

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.650 
come across over the top of our legs
with<00:06:20.770> our<00:06:20.919> headpiece<00:06:21.310> and<00:06:21.580> that's<00:06:22.240> below<00:06:22.510> our

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
with our headpiece and that's below our

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.490 
with our headpiece and that's below our
Tyvek<00:06:23.080> over<00:06:24.070> the<00:06:24.160> top<00:06:24.370> of<00:06:24.490> our<00:06:24.610> flashing<00:06:25.120> and

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
Tyvek over the top of our flashing and

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.940 
Tyvek over the top of our flashing and
then<00:06:26.500> our<00:06:26.650> Tabak<00:06:27.010> will<00:06:27.160> come<00:06:27.370> down<00:06:27.580> and<00:06:28.950> lap

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
then our Tabak will come down and lap

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.740 
then our Tabak will come down and lap
over<00:06:30.220> the<00:06:30.460> top<00:06:30.700> of<00:06:30.729> the<00:06:30.910> straight<00:06:31.150> fly<00:06:31.360> and

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
over the top of the straight fly and

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.010 
over the top of the straight fly and
then<00:06:32.560> we<00:06:32.680> will<00:06:32.830> tie<00:06:33.010> Vic<00:06:33.250> tape<00:06:33.490> the<00:06:34.030> 45<00:06:34.450> slices

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020 
then we will tie Vic tape the 45 slices

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.529 
then we will tie Vic tape the 45 slices
in<00:06:35.320> the<00:06:35.770> Tyvek

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
in the Tyvek

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:40.230 
in the Tyvek
we<00:06:37.539> like<00:06:37.690> to<00:06:37.840> use<00:06:37.990> this<00:06:38.169> roller<00:06:38.669> get<00:06:39.669> a<00:06:39.909> good

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
we like to use this roller get a good

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.950 
we like to use this roller get a good
solid<00:06:40.539> ball

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
solid ball

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.029 
solid ball
on<00:06:42.569> because<00:06:43.569> this<00:06:43.690> is<00:06:43.900> what's<00:06:44.139> making<00:06:44.440> our

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 
on because this is what's making our

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:47.850 
on because this is what's making our
bond<00:06:45.340> here<00:06:45.840> and<00:06:46.840> we<00:06:47.080> just<00:06:47.259> roll<00:06:47.410> this<00:06:47.590> straight

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
bond here and we just roll this straight

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.059 
bond here and we just roll this straight
flash<00:06:48.100> on<00:06:48.340> down<00:06:48.639> and<00:06:49.000> the<00:06:49.960> bottom<00:06:50.319> does<00:06:50.860> not

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:51.069 
flash on down and the bottom does not

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:55.890 
flash on down and the bottom does not
get<00:06:51.430> done<00:06:51.960> we<00:06:52.960> leave<00:06:53.139> that<00:06:53.289> open<00:06:53.530> and<00:06:54.840> this<00:06:55.840> is

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
get done we leave that open and this is

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.080 
get done we leave that open and this is
the<00:06:56.139> proper<00:06:56.470> way<00:06:56.620> of<00:06:56.650> setting<00:06:57.400> a<00:06:57.460> window<00:06:57.789> and

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:58.090 
the proper way of setting a window and

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.450 
the proper way of setting a window and
flashing<00:06:58.690> it<00:06:58.810> correctly<00:06:59.229> and<00:06:59.590> ensuring<00:07:00.430> that

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:00.460 
flashing it correctly and ensuring that

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.430 
flashing it correctly and ensuring that
you<00:07:00.699> don't<00:07:00.880> get<00:07:01.000> any<00:07:01.210> water<00:07:01.270> infiltration<00:07:01.780> and

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.440 
you don't get any water infiltration and

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.360 
you don't get any water infiltration and
if<00:07:02.620> you<00:07:02.860> do<00:07:03.160> it's<00:07:04.000> got<00:07:04.210> a<00:07:04.240> means<00:07:04.539> to<00:07:04.720> escape<00:07:05.370> and

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:06.370 
if you do it's got a means to escape and
