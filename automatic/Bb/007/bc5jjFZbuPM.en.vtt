through the steps here and that's how

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.660 
through the steps here and that's how
you<00:01:02.250> would<00:01:02.489> do<00:01:02.610> that<00:01:03.920> exporting<00:01:04.920> allows<00:01:05.339> you

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
to do the opposite of that you export

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.999 
to do the opposite of that you export
your<00:01:08.729> website<00:01:09.509> out<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.170> then<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.770> download

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009
