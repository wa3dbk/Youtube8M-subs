00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
first so we at the shallow symmetry and

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.400 
first so we at the shallow symmetry and
we<00:00:38.480> got<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:39.719> free<00:00:40.969> I<00:00:42.020> don't<00:00:43.020> know<00:00:43.079> may<00:00:43.200> get

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
a Shelley limestone and they rate it

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.190 
a Shelley limestone and they rate it
it's<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:21.750> 40<00:01:22.650> million<00:01:23.010> years<00:01:23.250> old<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.200> it's

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
it's like 40 million years old so it's

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:35.990
