00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.000 
an on-road on steroids if we look at it
it<00:00:20.789> takes<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.090> lot<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.449> on-road<00:00:21.869> DNA<00:00:22.320> but

gore-tex<00:00:38.430> replaces<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.210> rock-solid

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
gore-tex replaces it rock-solid

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.840 
gore-tex replaces it rock-solid
guaranteed<00:00:40.379> forever<00:00:40.559> but<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.250> beauty<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.640> it

is<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.600> going<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.780> be<00:00:42.870> completely

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
is it's going to be completely

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.779 
is it's going to be completely
waterproof<00:00:43.770> but<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.129> might<00:00:44.250> say<00:00:44.399> well<00:00:44.760> a

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
waterproof but you might say well a

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.220 
waterproof but you might say well a
trash<00:00:45.059> bag<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.360> completely<00:00:45.450> waterproof<00:00:45.899> just

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
trash bag is completely waterproof just

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.420 
trash bag is completely waterproof just
stick<00:00:46.350> your<00:00:46.440> foot<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.739> trash<00:00:46.920> bag<00:00:47.100> the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.370 
and adventure touring even into the dual
sport<00:01:29.700> realm<00:01:29.939> where<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.479> think<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.990> comes<00:01:31.200> up

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
sport realm where I think it comes up

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.810 
sport realm where I think it comes up
and<00:01:31.530> one<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.860> real<00:01:32.040> reasons<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.700> would

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
and one of the real reasons it would

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.670 
and one of the real reasons it would
shine<00:01:33.060> at<00:01:33.299> around<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.720> 400<00:01:34.200> dollar<00:01:34.320> mark<00:01:34.560> is

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
shine at around that 400 dollar mark is

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.590 
shine at around that 400 dollar mark is
it's<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.159> convertible<00:01:35.670> boot<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.390> what<00:01:36.509> you're

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
it's a convertible boot so what you're

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.539 
it's a convertible boot so what you're
going<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.780> see<00:01:36.900> me<00:01:36.990> do<00:01:37.140> here<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.560> I'm<00:01:38.280> going<00:01:38.490> to

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
going to see me do here is I'm going to

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.249 
going to see me do here is I'm going to
open<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.970> up<00:01:39.030> I'm<00:01:39.360> going<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.780> drop<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.229> down

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
open this up I'm going to drop it down

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.109 
open this up I'm going to drop it down
so<00:01:40.770> what<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.009> see<00:01:41.220> when<00:01:41.340> that's<00:01:41.520> open<00:01:41.970> is

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
so what you see when that's open is

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.600 
so what you see when that's open is
basically<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.560> trim<00:01:43.829> down<00:01:43.979> version<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.520> if

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
basically the trim down version so if

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.010 
basically the trim down version so if
you're<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:44.880> doing<00:01:45.000> some<00:01:45.240> basic<00:01:45.329> touring<00:01:45.899> or

you're just doing some basic touring or

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.210 
you're just doing some basic touring or
if<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.350> want<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.649> make<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.860> more<00:01:47.009> lightweight

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
if you want to make it more lightweight

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.639 
if you want to make it more lightweight
what<00:01:47.790> happens<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.270> these<00:01:48.509> panels<00:01:48.990> pop<00:01:49.170> off<00:01:49.380> and

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
what happens is these panels pop off and

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
then there's a base plate cover that

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.600 
then there's a base plate cover that
comes<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> box<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.189> completely

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
to nitpick here as well having this

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.080 
to nitpick here as well having this

back here it's not able to be waterproof

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.220 
back here it's not able to be waterproof
so<00:04:12.760> that<00:04:12.880> gore-tex<00:04:13.269> liner<00:04:13.510> stops<00:04:13.900> with<00:04:14.109> this

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230

sleeve that I've showed you open a

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:15.670 
sleeve that I've showed you open a
couple<00:06:14.719> times<00:06:14.930> and<00:06:15.080> then<00:06:15.169> there's<00:06:15.620> a

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
couple times and then there's a

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.529 
couple times and then there's a
baseplate<00:06:16.159> here<00:06:16.669> that<00:06:17.000> would<00:06:17.150> just<00:06:17.300> pop<00:06:17.509> right

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:17.539 
baseplate here that would just pop right

00:06:17.539 --> 00:06:19.420 
baseplate here that would just pop right
on<00:06:17.930> cover<00:06:18.289> that<00:06:18.440> screw<00:06:18.710> hole<00:06:18.889> so<00:06:19.219> you're<00:06:19.310> going

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
on cover that screw hole so you're going

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.249 
on cover that screw hole so you're going
to<00:06:19.460> see<00:06:19.849> it<00:06:19.940> and<00:06:20.090> it<00:06:20.449> would<00:06:20.630> look<00:06:20.780> finished

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:21.259 
to see it and it would look finished

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:23.020 
to see it and it would look finished
that's<00:06:21.500> the<00:06:21.710> big<00:06:21.889> thing<00:06:22.099> in<00:06:22.219> my<00:06:22.250> mind<00:06:22.610> is<00:06:22.849> when

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
that's the big thing in my mind is when

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.370 
that's the big thing in my mind is when
you're<00:06:23.180> not<00:06:23.330> using<00:06:23.659> the<00:06:23.840> extra<00:06:24.229> protection

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
you're not using the extra protection

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.219 
you're not using the extra protection
factor<00:06:25.099> on<00:06:25.250> this<00:06:25.610> convertible<00:06:26.030> boot<00:06:26.389> does<00:06:27.080> it

factor on this convertible boot does it

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:28.450 
factor on this convertible boot does it
look<00:06:27.380> finished<00:06:27.740> and<00:06:27.830> the<00:06:27.949> answer<00:06:28.190> is<00:06:28.310> yes

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
look finished and the answer is yes

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.770 
look finished and the answer is yes
because<00:06:28.639> it<00:06:28.880> comes<00:06:29.030> with<00:06:29.090> those<00:06:29.240> base<00:06:29.479> plates

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
because it comes with those base plates

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.540 
because it comes with those base plates
on<00:06:29.960> the<00:06:30.710> back<00:06:30.889> you're<00:06:31.099> going<00:06:31.219> to<00:06:31.310> see<00:06:31.460> that
