have<00:01:33.399> off<00:01:33.639> the<00:01:33.819> grid<00:01:34.090> you're<00:01:34.509> going<00:01:34.659> to<00:01:34.719> be

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
have off the grid you're going to be

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.809 
have off the grid you're going to be
able<00:01:34.869> to<00:01:35.259> spot<00:01:35.530> them<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:35.979> see<00:01:36.159> their<00:01:36.310> position

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
able to spot them and see their position

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:39.059 
able to spot them and see their position
so<00:01:37.420> this<00:01:37.780> is<00:01:37.899> a<00:01:37.929> really<00:01:38.079> good<00:01:38.319> perk<00:01:38.560> so<00:01:38.799> if<00:01:38.950> you

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
so this is a really good perk so if you

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:40.559 
so this is a really good perk so if you
are<00:01:39.249> especially<00:01:39.459> the<00:01:39.909> kind<00:01:40.030> of<00:01:40.149> person<00:01:40.450> who's

into the spawn you kill one person it's

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.580 
into the spawn you kill one person it's
literally<00:01:49.329> going<00:01:49.420> to<00:01:49.509> be<00:01:49.600> tagging<00:01:50.079> everyone

that I want to talk to you guys about
there<00:01:54.069> are<00:01:54.100> two<00:01:54.310> pricks<00:01:54.520> are<00:01:54.670> going<00:01:54.789> to<00:01:54.850> cover

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
there are two pricks are going to cover

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.569 
there are two pricks are going to cover
in<00:01:55.119> this<00:01:55.149> video<00:01:55.389> is<00:01:55.689> called<00:01:56.170> wiretap<00:01:57.069> now

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
in this video is called wiretap now

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.399 
in this video is called wiretap now
wiretap<00:01:58.240> is<00:01:58.389> a<00:01:58.420> perk<00:01:58.689> that<00:01:58.810> allows<00:01:59.079> you<00:01:59.229> to

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
wiretap is a perk that allows you to

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.260 
wiretap is a perk that allows you to
take<00:01:59.560> advantage<00:02:00.039> of<00:02:00.159> any<00:02:00.340> satcoms<00:02:00.999> at<00:02:01.179> the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
take advantage of any satcoms at the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.440 
take advantage of any satcoms at the
enemy<00:02:01.630> places<00:02:02.049> down<00:02:02.259> so<00:02:02.889> if<00:02:03.219> the<00:02:03.429> enemy<00:02:03.789> say<00:02:04.240> is

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
enemy places down so if the enemy say is

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.300 
enemy places down so if the enemy say is
completely<00:02:05.139> dominating<00:02:05.709> your<00:02:05.799> team<00:02:06.009> so<00:02:06.219> you

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
completely dominating your team so you

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.279 
completely dominating your team so you
got<00:02:06.429> a<00:02:06.459> really<00:02:06.700> bad<00:02:06.999> team<00:02:07.299> I'm<00:02:07.689> just<00:02:08.050> getting

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
got a really bad team I'm just getting

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.559 
got a really bad team I'm just getting
constant<00:02:08.770> satcoms<00:02:09.459> on<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.819> well<00:02:10.270> you<00:02:10.420> can

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
constant satcoms on you well you can

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.330 
constant satcoms on you well you can
actually<00:02:10.929> take<00:02:11.170> advantage<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.709> that<00:02:11.770> and<00:02:12.010> make

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
actually take advantage of that and make

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.370 
actually take advantage of that and make
that<00:02:12.370> negative<00:02:13.120> into<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.420> positive<00:02:13.510> by<00:02:14.140> using

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
that negative into a positive by using

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.220 
that negative into a positive by using
wiretap<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:15.610> when<00:02:16.180> you<00:02:16.270> use<00:02:16.480> wiretap<00:02:17.050> you

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
wiretap so when you use wiretap you

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.080 
wiretap so when you use wiretap you
actually<00:02:17.710> have<00:02:17.860> access<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.550> their

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
actually have access to their

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.180 
actually have access to their
that<00:02:19.209> comes<00:02:19.540> in<00:02:19.810> combination<00:02:20.680> with<00:02:20.709> your<00:02:20.980> own

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
that comes in combination with your own

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.190 
that comes in combination with your own
so<00:02:21.670> if<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.879> put<00:02:22.120> one<00:02:22.269> down<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.810> enemy

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
so if you put one down and the enemy

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.270 
so if you put one down and the enemy
gets<00:02:23.379> too<00:02:23.620> because<00:02:23.830> they're<00:02:23.950> doing<00:02:24.040> really

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
gets too because they're doing really

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.530 
gets too because they're doing really
good<00:02:24.489> against<00:02:24.819> your<00:02:24.849> team<00:02:25.090> it's<00:02:25.269> going<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.450> be

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
good against your team it's going to be

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.479 
good against your team it's going to be
technically<00:02:25.989> like<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.379> have<00:02:26.530> three<00:02:26.890> satcoms

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
technically like you have three satcoms

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.820 
technically like you have three satcoms
for<00:02:27.760> yourself<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:28.450> eventually<00:02:29.440> after<00:02:29.590> you

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
for yourself and eventually after you

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.380 
for yourself and eventually after you
get<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.069> few<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.519> them<00:02:30.640> from<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:30.910> enemy<00:02:31.090> and

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
get a few of them from the enemy and

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.300 
get a few of them from the enemy and
years<00:02:31.629> you're<00:02:32.080> going<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.290> have<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.680> advanced

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
years you're going to have a advanced

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.890 
years you're going to have a advanced
UAV<00:02:33.580> type<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.209> fact<00:02:34.450> where<00:02:34.629> you<00:02:34.660> see<00:02:34.750> the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
UAV type of fact where you see the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.600 
UAV type of fact where you see the
position<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.560> enemy<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.280> see<00:02:36.489> what

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
position of the enemy you see what

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.830 
position of the enemy you see what
direction<00:02:36.730> they're<00:02:37.090> looking<00:02:37.480> at<00:02:37.599> and

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
direction they're looking at and

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.140 
direction they're looking at and
although<00:02:38.590> it's<00:02:38.769> not<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:39.010> constant<00:02:39.519> wave<00:02:39.760> you

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
although it's not a constant wave you

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.089 
although it's not a constant wave you
can<00:02:40.299> actually<00:02:40.599> get<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.900> as<00:02:41.049> a<00:02:41.080> constant<00:02:41.830> kind

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
can actually get it as a constant kind

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.949 
can actually get it as a constant kind
of<00:02:42.220> positioning<00:02:43.120> if<00:02:43.239> you<00:02:43.330> get<00:02:43.480> even<00:02:43.780> more

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
of positioning if you get even more

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.990 
of positioning if you get even more
satcoms<00:02:44.530> which<00:02:44.769> is<00:02:44.920> really<00:02:45.160> easy<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.610> use<00:02:45.640> if

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
satcoms which is really easy to use if

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.240 
satcoms which is really easy to use if
you're<00:02:46.180> using<00:02:46.390> wiretaps<00:02:46.750> so<00:02:47.230> in<00:02:47.500> combination

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
you're using wiretaps so in combination

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.979 
you're using wiretaps so in combination
using<00:02:48.459> both<00:02:48.790> of<00:02:48.940> these<00:02:49.000> together<00:02:49.180> ping<00:02:49.720> and

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
using both of these together ping and

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.930 
using both of these together ping and
wiretap<00:02:50.709> you're<00:02:51.130> basically<00:02:51.370> going<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.849> be

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
wiretap you're basically going to be

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.640 
wiretap you're basically going to be
able<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.390> tell<00:02:52.599> where<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.870> enemy<00:02:53.230> is<00:02:53.260> at<00:02:53.530> all

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
able to tell where the enemy is at all

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.680 
able to tell where the enemy is at all
times<00:02:53.680> especially<00:02:54.430> if<00:02:55.150> you're<00:02:55.329> the<00:02:55.450> kind<00:02:55.569> of

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
times especially if you're the kind of

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.390 
times especially if you're the kind of
person<00:02:55.750> who<00:02:56.140> likes<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.470> rush<00:02:56.650> around<00:02:56.680> us<00:02:57.160> the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
person who likes to rush around us the
