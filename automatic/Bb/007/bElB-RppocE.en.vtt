 diop people it 's gone 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.420
 found for my very first video 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.840
 commented today we find ourselves 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:52.040
 so to visit this house 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:56.980
 so it's a half-timbered house or 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.960
 that a little worth so it's gone 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.079
 not enter 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.579
 Here the efs and brick quark 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.290
 we 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.590
 in dark wood board 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.100
 So here we are we live 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.250
 in the dining room with such 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.040
 hockey design 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.610
 then a little library like that 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.060
 to fill 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.750
 there the sofa 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.890
 then 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.010
 We have 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.780
 the kitchen 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.730
 here is the little trick 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.210
 two items sites would be required 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:40.549
 trg the American fridge 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.549
 well then we'll go upstairs 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.340
 from here to count them here they are 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.060
 then site 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.570
 it's the bathroom 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.820
 with a city will be pity 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.480
 so there ben here 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.480
 trick with 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.240
 for 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.210

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.210
 here washbasins to 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.170
 then book the latter restored under the 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.500
 roof 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.500
 I did 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:20.090
 there a shelf here 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.260
 it's a pool table there with the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.129
 panels 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.950
 adjusted to putting rugs over 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:31.830
 is here is the bed the room 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.690
 overlooking the 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.600
 so we will go down 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.520
 and we will see them outside 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.560

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.580

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.650
 we will go out in full 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.750

 in front of the bay window 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.310
 it gives little space because it's 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.770
