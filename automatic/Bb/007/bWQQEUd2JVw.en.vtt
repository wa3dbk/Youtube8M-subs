so<00:00:13.590> anyways<00:00:14.309> so<00:00:14.610> let's<00:00:14.639> say<00:00:14.910> here<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.179> a

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
so anyways so let's say here is a

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:27.890 
so anyways so let's say here is a
macrophage<00:00:19.279> so<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.490> macrophage

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.010 

this<00:00:28.900> macrophage<00:00:29.560> just<00:00:30.460> saw<00:00:30.880> on<00:00:31.480> this<00:00:31.720> side

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
this macrophage just saw on this side

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.220 
this macrophage just saw on this side
and<00:00:32.349> he<00:00:32.560> is<00:00:32.680> really<00:00:32.980> really<00:00:33.370> happy<00:00:33.960> he<00:00:34.960> saw

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
and he is really really happy he saw

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.420 
and he is really really happy he saw
that<00:00:35.830> there<00:00:36.010> is<00:00:36.160> a<00:00:36.190> cell<00:00:36.550> near<00:00:37.270> it<00:00:37.480> and

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
that there is a cell near it and

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:54.600 
that there is a cell near it and
macrophage<00:00:39.430> also<00:00:39.910> has<00:00:40.210> a<00:00:47.970> CD<00:00:48.970> 31<00:00:49.450> on<00:00:49.600> it<00:00:53.580> do<00:00:54.580> not

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
macrophage also has a CD 31 on it do not

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.060 
macrophage also has a CD 31 on it do not
forget<00:00:54.820> this<00:00:55.450> concept<00:00:55.960> pay<00:00:56.500> attention<00:00:56.980> to

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.100 
forget this concept pay attention to
this<00:00:57.190> concept<00:00:57.640> it's<00:00:57.879> not<00:00:57.970> written<00:00:58.360> everywhere

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
this concept it's not written everywhere

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.170 
this concept it's not written everywhere
I<00:00:59.140> had<00:00:59.590> to<00:00:59.710> really<00:01:00.250> dig<00:01:00.430> up<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:00.700> neutrophils

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
I had to really dig up the neutrophils

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.790 
I had to really dig up the neutrophils
and<00:01:01.360> macrophages<00:01:01.660> to<00:01:02.079> go<00:01:02.200> figure<00:01:02.410> this<00:01:02.530> out

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
and macrophages to go figure this out

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.780 
and macrophages to go figure this out
but<00:01:03.370> very<00:01:03.880> very<00:01:04.089> important<00:01:04.570> thing<00:01:05.790> macrophage

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
but very very important thing macrophage

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.440 
but very very important thing macrophage
has<00:01:07.240> a<00:01:07.270> CD<00:01:07.630> 31<00:01:08.020> on<00:01:08.170> it<00:01:08.490> neutrophil<00:01:09.490> has<00:01:09.640> a<00:01:09.670> CD<00:01:10.000> 31

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
has a CD 31 on it neutrophil has a CD 31

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.310 
has a CD 31 on it neutrophil has a CD 31
on<00:01:10.600> it<00:01:10.750> this<00:01:11.170> is<00:01:11.320> like<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:12.700> have<00:01:13.320> handshaking

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
on it this is like we have handshaking

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.499 
on it this is like we have handshaking
so<00:01:14.920> we<00:01:15.070> have<00:01:15.220> limbs<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:15.670> hands<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.270> do<00:01:16.390> the

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
so we have limbs and hands to do the

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.690 
so we have limbs and hands to do the
handshakes<00:01:16.960> hopefully<00:01:17.800> we<00:01:17.979> who<00:01:18.250> do<00:01:18.430> many<00:01:18.580> of

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
handshakes hopefully we who do many of

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.130 
handshakes hopefully we who do many of
the<00:01:18.790> things<00:01:18.940> with<00:01:19.149> them<00:01:19.270> but<00:01:19.300> handshake<00:01:20.020> is

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
the things with them but handshake is

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.400 
the things with them but handshake is
one<00:01:20.290> of<00:01:20.380> them<00:01:20.560> CD<00:01:21.369> 31<00:01:21.880> is<00:01:22.360> a<00:01:22.509> handshake<00:01:23.229> between

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
one of them CD 31 is a handshake between

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.760 
one of them CD 31 is a handshake between
a<00:01:23.619> macrophage<00:01:24.040> and<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.460> neutrophil<00:01:25.770> what

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
a macrophage and a neutrophil what

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.889 
a macrophage and a neutrophil what
happens<00:01:27.220> is<00:01:27.430> when<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.330> neutrophil<00:01:28.780> is

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
happens is when the neutrophil is

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.290 
happens is when the neutrophil is
passing<00:01:29.380> by<00:01:29.649> in<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.130> tissue<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.520> having<00:01:31.060> fun

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
passing by in the tissue and having fun

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.789 
passing by in the tissue and having fun
and<00:01:31.659> saying<00:01:31.840> okay<00:01:32.110> I'm<00:01:32.170> going<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.409> go<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:32.710> do

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.500 
and saying okay I'm going to go and do
something<00:01:33.070> with<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.460> and<00:01:33.700> defender<00:01:34.270> body

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
so now macrophage CD 31 and neutrophil

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.430 
so now macrophage CD 31 and neutrophil
CD<00:01:43.720> 31<00:01:44.110> they<00:01:44.260> both<00:01:44.500> engage<00:01:45.460> with<00:01:45.670> each<00:01:45.790> other

receptors those surface receptor then

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.050 
receptors those surface receptor then
have<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.290> second<00:03:07.650> messenger<00:03:07.920> system<00:03:08.459> which

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
have the second messenger system which

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
have the second messenger system which
go<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.660> nucleus<00:03:10.489> act<00:03:11.489> there<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.269> then

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
go to the nucleus act there and then

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.940 
go to the nucleus act there and then
nucleus<00:03:13.709> word<00:03:14.040> send<00:03:15.410> proteins<00:03:16.410> which<00:03:16.769> would

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
nucleus word send proteins which would

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.160 
nucleus word send proteins which would
help<00:03:17.250> CD<00:03:17.670> 31<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.330> disengage<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:20.870> you<00:03:21.870> know<00:03:21.989> how

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
help CD 31 to disengage and you know how

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.780 
help CD 31 to disengage and you know how
would<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.410> happen<00:03:22.650> so<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.400> cellular

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
would that happen so the cellular

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.550 
would that happen so the cellular
proteins<00:03:24.150> then<00:03:24.390> would<00:03:24.569> become<00:03:24.690> activated<00:03:25.230> and

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
proteins then would become activated and

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.759 
proteins then would become activated and
finally<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:26.580> CD<00:03:26.970> 31<00:03:27.569> would<00:03:28.470> become

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
finally this CD 31 would become

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.460 
finally this CD 31 would become
disengaged

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470

right<00:03:37.530> hey<00:03:38.099> I<00:03:38.549> could<00:03:38.819> tell<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.299> macrophage

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
right hey I could tell the macrophage

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.479 
right hey I could tell the macrophage
I'm<00:03:39.870> all<00:03:40.049> set<00:03:40.260> I'm<00:03:40.410> doing<00:03:40.920> my<00:03:41.010> function<00:03:41.340> leave

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
I'm all set I'm doing my function leave

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.319 
I'm all set I'm doing my function leave
me<00:03:41.640> alone<00:03:42.170> if<00:03:43.170> this<00:03:44.010> chemical<00:03:44.609> substance<00:03:45.150> is

me alone if this chemical substance is
not<00:03:45.690> produced<00:03:46.230> by<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.500> neutrophil<00:03:47.070> and<00:03:47.489> think

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
not produced by the neutrophil and think

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.039 
not produced by the neutrophil and think
about<00:03:47.940> it<00:03:48.120> it's<00:03:48.269> illogical

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
about it it's illogical

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.099 
about it it's illogical
why<00:03:49.739> will<00:03:50.010> it<00:03:50.100> not<00:03:50.160> be<00:03:50.370> produced<00:03:50.790> because<00:03:51.720> the

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
why will it not be produced because the

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.870 
why will it not be produced because the
neutrophil<00:03:52.590> is<00:03:52.709> not<00:03:52.859> functioning<00:03:53.340> correctly

neutrophil is not functioning correctly

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.520 
neutrophil is not functioning correctly
when<00:03:54.329> will<00:03:54.510> neutrophil<00:03:55.019> not<00:03:55.170> function

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
when will neutrophil not function

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.470 
when will neutrophil not function
correctly<00:03:55.560> when<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.519> has<00:03:56.730> exhausted<00:03:57.120> its

damaged by bacterias viruses fungi or
just<00:04:24.419> simple<00:04:24.780> so<00:04:25.200> inflammation<00:04:25.860> is<00:04:25.979> happening

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
just simple so inflammation is happening

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.040 
just simple so inflammation is happening
repair<00:04:26.789> is<00:04:26.940> happening<00:04:27.389> and<00:04:27.539> what's<00:04:27.690> happening

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
repair is happening and what's happening

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.840 
repair is happening and what's happening
is<00:04:28.229> that<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.919> neutrophil<00:04:29.340> is<00:04:29.460> sitting<00:04:29.729> in

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
is that the neutrophil is sitting in

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.659 
is that the neutrophil is sitting in
there<00:04:30.169> it<00:04:31.169> has<00:04:31.350> less<00:04:31.560> oxygen<00:04:31.770> so<00:04:32.340> all<00:04:32.520> the

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
there it has less oxygen so all the

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.550 
there it has less oxygen so all the
neutrophil<00:04:33.180> can<00:04:33.330> work<00:04:33.510> with<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.810> with<00:04:34.410> the

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
neutrophil can work with the with the

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.890 
neutrophil can work with the with the
glycogen<00:04:35.510> in<00:04:36.510> low<00:04:36.720> oxygen<00:04:37.970> times<00:04:38.970> as<00:04:39.180> well<00:04:39.360> but

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
glycogen in low oxygen times as well but

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.980 
glycogen in low oxygen times as well but
usually<00:04:40.530> so<00:04:41.190> don't<00:04:41.400> forget<00:04:41.490> this<00:04:41.990> usually

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
usually so don't forget this usually

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.330 
usually so don't forget this usually
when<00:04:43.229> a<00:04:43.350> neutrophil<00:04:43.710> has<00:04:44.039> killed<00:04:44.370> 4<00:04:44.880> to<00:04:45.419> 20

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
when a neutrophil has killed 4 to 20

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.620 
when a neutrophil has killed 4 to 20
bacteria<00:04:48.860> it<00:04:49.860> has<00:04:50.280> become<00:04:50.789> old

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
bacteria it has become old

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.040 
bacteria it has become old
right<00:04:53.630> so<00:04:54.080> neutrophils<00:04:54.590> life<00:04:55.240> is<00:04:56.240> counted<00:04:56.810> in

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
right so neutrophils life is counted in

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.450 
right so neutrophils life is counted in
terms<00:04:57.650> of<00:04:57.890> how<00:04:58.190> many<00:04:58.370> bacteria<00:04:58.910> it<00:04:59.060> has<00:04:59.270> killed

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
terms of how many bacteria it has killed

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.010 
terms of how many bacteria it has killed
so<00:05:01.460> from<00:05:01.640> four<00:05:01.850> to<00:05:02.000> twenty<00:05:02.330> bacteria<00:05:02.750> when<00:05:02.900> it

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
so from four to twenty bacteria when it

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.960 
so from four to twenty bacteria when it
has<00:05:03.140> killed<00:05:03.350> them<00:05:03.530> this<00:05:04.010> job<00:05:04.400> is<00:05:04.580> done

these chemical substance it is too tired
to<00:05:16.190> show<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.580> identity<00:05:19.030> unfortunately<00:05:20.030> it<00:05:20.450> is

to show the identity unfortunately it is

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.110 
to show the identity unfortunately it is
too<00:05:20.810> tired<00:05:21.140> to<00:05:22.070> tell<00:05:22.280> the<00:05:22.430> macrophage<00:05:22.910> that

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
too tired to tell the macrophage that

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.780 
too tired to tell the macrophage that
hey<00:05:23.360> you<00:05:23.810> know<00:05:23.840> what<00:05:24.110> I'm<00:05:24.350> on<00:05:24.500> your<00:05:24.680> side<00:05:24.860> so

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
hey you know what I'm on your side so

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.390 
hey you know what I'm on your side so
it's<00:05:25.940> all<00:05:26.210> sleepy<00:05:26.750> and<00:05:26.960> it<00:05:27.080> says<00:05:27.320> well<00:05:27.620> and

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
it's all sleepy and it says well and

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.910 
it's all sleepy and it says well and
shake<00:05:29.090> but<00:05:29.870> it<00:05:30.020> doesn't<00:05:30.290> give<00:05:30.410> the<00:05:30.530> chemical

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
shake but it doesn't give the chemical

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.690 
shake but it doesn't give the chemical
substance<00:05:31.340> and<00:05:31.610> when<00:05:31.940> this<00:05:32.300> doesn't<00:05:32.720> come

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
substance and when this doesn't come

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.840 
substance and when this doesn't come
this<00:05:34.700> trigger<00:05:35.180> is<00:05:35.480> the<00:05:35.510> macrophage<00:05:36.850> to

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
this trigger is the macrophage to

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.490 
this trigger is the macrophage to
phagocytose<00:05:38.840> the<00:05:39.140> neutrophil<00:05:39.650> and<00:05:39.860> kill<00:05:40.100> it

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
phagocytose the neutrophil and kill it

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.290 
phagocytose the neutrophil and kill it
so<00:05:42.500> that<00:05:42.680> is<00:05:42.860> how<00:05:43.070> neutrophils<00:05:43.760> which<00:05:43.850> go<00:05:44.240> to

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
so that is how neutrophils which go to

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.560 
so that is how neutrophils which go to
the<00:05:44.510> battlefield<00:05:45.110> are<00:05:45.500> taken<00:05:45.920> care<00:05:46.130> of<00:05:46.570> they

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
the battlefield are taken care of they

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.410 
the battlefield are taken care of they
are<00:05:47.630> removed<00:05:47.960> by<00:05:48.320> macrophages<00:05:49.000> there<00:05:50.000> is<00:05:50.180> one

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
are removed by macrophages there is one

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.010 
are removed by macrophages there is one
important<00:05:50.900> thing<00:05:50.930> this<00:05:52.480> how<00:05:53.480> many<00:05:53.660> books<00:05:53.840> I

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
important thing this how many books I

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.170 
important thing this how many books I
went<00:05:54.200> through<00:05:54.580> one<00:05:55.580> important<00:05:56.030> thing

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
went through one important thing

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.420 
went through one important thing
whenever<00:05:56.890> macrophages<00:05:57.890> do<00:05:58.250> phagocytosis

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
whenever macrophages do phagocytosis

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.370 
whenever macrophages do phagocytosis
normally<00:06:01.430> as<00:06:01.550> part<00:06:01.910> of<00:06:02.090> phagocytosis<00:06:02.750> they

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
normally as part of phagocytosis they

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.880 
normally as part of phagocytosis they
release<00:06:03.740> chemical<00:06:04.400> mediators<00:06:04.690> which<00:06:05.690> are<00:06:06.200> for
