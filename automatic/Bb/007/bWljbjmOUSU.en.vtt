a<00:00:11.750> folding<00:00:12.750> toast<00:00:13.049> oh<00:00:13.259> this<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.559> my<00:00:13.710> first

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
a folding toast oh this is my first

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.439 
a folding toast oh this is my first
prototype<00:00:15.109> was<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> little<00:00:16.350> bit<00:00:16.440> too<00:00:16.590> big<00:00:20.449> with

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
prototype was a little bit too big with

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.599 
prototype was a little bit too big with
a<00:00:21.510> piece<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.689> bread<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.320> little<00:00:23.070> bit<00:00:23.189> too<00:00:23.369> wide

a piece of bread a little bit too wide

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.970 
a piece of bread a little bit too wide
so<00:00:24.029> I've<00:00:24.119> got<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.390> make<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> smaller<00:00:25.380> one<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.830> bit

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
so I've got to make a smaller one a bit

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.390 
so I've got to make a smaller one a bit
narrower<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:27.060> hold<00:00:27.269> hold<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.810> bread<00:00:28.019> steady

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
narrower to hold hold the bread steady

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.759 
narrower to hold hold the bread steady
what<00:00:29.400> I'm<00:00:29.490> using<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.939> make<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.769> swivel

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
like that what I want to do is bend

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.710 
like that what I want to do is bend
these<00:02:51.990> legs<00:02:52.320> Ram<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.910> I'm<00:02:54.060> just<00:02:54.210> using<00:02:54.450> a

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
these legs Ram and I'm just using a

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:11.949 
these legs Ram and I'm just using a
piece<00:02:54.900> of<00:02:54.930> Dale<00:02:55.850> to<00:02:56.850> make<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.300> Bing

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.979 

there's<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.319> beginning<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:14.069> the<00:03:14.190> stirrup<00:03:14.989> but

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
there's the beginning of the stirrup but

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.690 
there's the beginning of the stirrup but
the<00:03:16.849> bread<00:03:17.849> will<00:03:18.060> fall<00:03:18.239> into<00:03:19.519> now<00:03:20.519> I've

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
the bread will fall into now I've

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.400 
the bread will fall into now I've
followed<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.300> two<00:03:21.569> bottom<00:03:21.930> parts<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.349> the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
followed the two bottom parts of the

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.949 
followed the two bottom parts of the
legs<00:03:22.530> obviously<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:24.060> looks<00:03:24.209> a<00:03:24.330> bit<00:03:24.360> dagi<00:03:24.750> at

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
legs obviously it looks a bit dagi at

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.440 
legs obviously it looks a bit dagi at
the<00:03:25.080> moment<00:03:25.470> but<00:03:25.800> once<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.190> trim<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.610> up<00:03:26.730> the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
the moment but once I trim it up the

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.330 
the moment but once I trim it up the
bread<00:03:27.890> will<00:03:28.890> just<00:03:29.250> sit<00:03:29.630> inside<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.780> stirrup

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
bread will just sit inside the stirrup

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.229 
bread will just sit inside the stirrup
like<00:03:32.340> that<00:03:34.459> okay<00:03:35.459> what<00:03:35.580> I'm<00:03:35.700> doing<00:03:35.970> now<00:03:36.090> is

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
like that okay what I'm doing now is

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.420 
like that okay what I'm doing now is
just<00:03:36.269> cutting<00:03:36.950> with<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:37.980> pair<00:03:38.190> of<00:03:38.220> side<00:03:38.400> cutters

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
just cutting with a pair of side cutters

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.490 
just cutting with a pair of side cutters
the<00:03:39.000> wire<00:03:41.480> make<00:03:42.480> it<00:03:42.599> a<00:03:42.629> little<00:03:42.750> bit<00:03:42.870> easier<00:03:43.260> to

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
the wire make it a little bit easier to

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.740 
the wire make it a little bit easier to
bend<00:03:43.650> in<00:03:43.769> the<00:03:43.830> final<00:03:44.190> piece<00:03:47.269> now<00:03:48.269> I'm<00:03:48.420> going<00:03:48.630> to

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
bend in the final piece now I'm going to

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.890 
bend in the final piece now I'm going to
fold<00:03:49.140> these<00:03:49.440> end<00:03:50.250> pieces<00:03:50.489> of<00:03:50.790> wire<00:03:51.030> back<00:03:51.690> on

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
fold these end pieces of wire back on

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.530 
fold these end pieces of wire back on
themselves<00:03:52.319> get<00:03:52.890> rid<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.069> the<00:03:53.160> sharp<00:03:53.400> edges

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
themselves get rid of the sharp edges

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.789 
themselves get rid of the sharp edges
but<00:03:54.540> first<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:54.930> all<00:03:54.989> I'm<00:03:55.140> just<00:03:55.290> marking<00:03:55.470> the

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
but first of all I'm just marking the

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.470 
but first of all I'm just marking the
top<00:03:55.980> of<00:03:56.099> the<00:03:56.190> bracket<00:03:56.519> here<00:03:58.970> then<00:03:59.970> I'll<00:04:00.120> cut

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
top of the bracket here then I'll cut

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.539 
top of the bracket here then I'll cut
and<00:04:00.780> fold<00:04:01.170> this<00:04:01.319> one<00:04:01.470> over<00:04:01.620> just<00:04:02.190> back<00:04:02.370> this

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
and fold this one over just back this

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:13.160 
and fold this one over just back this
one<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:09.030> I'll<00:04:09.239> just<00:04:09.390> leave<00:04:10.260> approximately<00:04:12.170> 12

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
one and I'll just leave approximately 12

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:31.610 
one and I'll just leave approximately 12
mil<00:04:20.150> without<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.180> pair<00:04:21.450> of<00:04:21.479> pliers

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:48.350 

it's<00:04:32.460> the<00:04:32.610> first<00:04:32.820> one<00:04:46.670> there's<00:04:47.670> the<00:04:48.030> second

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
it's the first one there's the second

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.960 
it's the first one there's the second
one<00:04:51.020> now<00:04:52.020> here's<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.500> final<00:04:53.130> product<00:04:53.520> with<00:04:53.940> a

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
one now here's the final product with a

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.200 
one now here's the final product with a
piece<00:04:54.660> of<00:04:54.740> bread<00:04:55.740> in<00:04:55.770> there<00:04:56.180> sitting<00:04:57.180> there

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
piece of bread in there sitting there

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.650 
piece of bread in there sitting there
nicely<00:04:58.130> so<00:04:59.130> we<00:04:59.340> will<00:04:59.550> cook<00:04:59.820> that<00:05:00.060> side<00:05:00.330> first

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
nicely so we will cook that side first

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.470 
nicely so we will cook that side first
then<00:05:01.520> without<00:05:02.520> touching<00:05:02.790> the<00:05:03.000> piece<00:05:03.180> of<00:05:03.330> bread

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
then without touching the piece of bread

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.170 
then without touching the piece of bread
we'll<00:05:03.720> just<00:05:03.900> flip<00:05:04.080> it<00:05:04.170> over<00:05:04.320> and<00:05:05.000> cook<00:05:06.000> the

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
we'll just flip it over and cook the

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.750 
we'll just flip it over and cook the
other<00:05:06.210> side<00:05:06.830> now<00:05:07.830> for<00:05:08.070> the<00:05:08.130> purpose<00:05:08.460> of<00:05:08.640> the

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
other side now for the purpose of the

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.640 
other side now for the purpose of the
demonstration<00:05:09.110> I'm<00:05:10.110> just<00:05:10.170> going<00:05:10.410> to<00:05:10.440> use<00:05:10.620> a

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
demonstration I'm just going to use a

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.980
