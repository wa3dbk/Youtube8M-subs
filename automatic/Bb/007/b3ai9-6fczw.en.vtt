00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
trying to look for that color

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.430 
trying to look for that color
combination<00:00:38.640> online<00:00:39.629> on<00:00:39.840> YouTube<00:00:40.140> videos

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
combination online on YouTube videos

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.350 
combination online on YouTube videos
couldn't<00:00:41.340> find<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.820> kind<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.120> had<00:00:42.239> to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
couldn't find it so I kind of had to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.490 
couldn't find it so I kind of had to
guess<00:00:42.570> as<00:00:42.840> far<00:00:42.870> as<00:00:43.789> how<00:00:44.789> good<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.180> would<00:00:45.270> look

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
guess as far as how good it would look

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.600 
guess as far as how good it would look
but<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.530> thought<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.829> would<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> good<00:00:47.190> combo

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
but I thought it would be a good combo

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.060 
but I thought it would be a good combo
so<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:48.420> know<00:00:48.510> blue<00:00:49.260> green<00:00:49.680> they're<00:00:49.890> both

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
so you know blue green they're both

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.850 
so you know blue green they're both
light<00:00:50.820> side<00:00:51.090> colors<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.379> went<00:00:52.620> ahead<00:00:52.680> and

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
light side colors so I went ahead and

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.160 
light side colors so I went ahead and
went<00:00:53.010> with<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.780> I'll<00:00:54.780> go<00:00:54.870> ahead<00:00:54.899> and

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
went with it so I'll go ahead and

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.709
