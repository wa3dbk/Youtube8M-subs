00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.400
 friends today we are going to teach them to 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.519
 make these big flowers in 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.080
 fabric we already made on tape in this 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.540
 opportunity for those girls who 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.810
 they have fabrics these are fabrics genres 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.480
 can use heels can use 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.410
 the rings 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.680
 you can use the fabric of the 10 or the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:37.740
 indicated they are very nice 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:41.670
 let's cut here I have are 3 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.960
 petal sizes here I have the mold 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.490
 quoted from each one is for you 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.310
 take note the biggest this is 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:53.130
 you are going to cut a little piece of 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:56.940
 five centimeters by five centimeters 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.670
 on each side the largest petals 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.200
 let's make ten petals 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.960
 for 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.290
 the next petal are going to cut a 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:14.180
 5 cm carton 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.580
 wide and 4.5 centimeters long that 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.090
 are these petals that we have here and 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.110
 let's elaborate 8 petals and the most 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.440
 tiny 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.990
 5 centimeters wide 4 centimeters 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.440
 long are these petals and we are going to 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.400
 make 6 petals for flowers 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.130
 after you already have 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.369
 cut 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.619
 the pieces of cardboard to make it them 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:44.500
 mold to make these flowers you 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:47.420
 fold the cartoncito with a scissors that 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.070
 to cut paper so they do not go to 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.710
 use the ones in the tapes or the one in 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.039
 because they are going to hurt you 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.610
 they are going to cut to make a diagonal cut 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:03.860
 to take out what the mold is and they start 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:06.380
 to give the rounded shape to the cardboard 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.899
 so that the molds are landmarks of 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.450
 the flowers here have already been 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.110
 molds do the same with each of 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.880
 the cartons fold in half and 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.210
 there they will be what they are 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.520
 Petals cut to run out and they'll 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.520
 start to give the round shape 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:31.260
 to each of the cardboard we're going 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.290
 to place on top of the fabric 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.769
 here we already have for when you 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.750
 are going to cut a several fold several 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.420
 times the fabric the amount that you 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.069
 want they can cut their scissors 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:50.090
 they stick it with a pin and start 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.090
 cut out the petals 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.290
 how are we doing here? 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.910
 scissors that are made of cloth and ribbons 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.970
 use them only for that when 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.519
 was to cut paper use other than not 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.830
 have so much edge that they are only for 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.260
 paper in this way is never going to 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.540
 damaging your work scissors here already 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.390
 we have then cut are going to be like this 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.540
 with each one of the petals we already said 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.860
 ten large six medium eight and eight medium 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.530
 six small 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.290
 good girls here I already have ahead 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.200
 the flowers here we have the flower 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.870
 large that are 10 petals 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.230
 passed needle and thread to each of the 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.050
 petals shirked not so much so that I 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.810
 circle in the center so that 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.849
 Do not keep the petals so tight and 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.370
 when I closed it I placed a 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.340
 reinforcement in the back a circle 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.440
 of felt can be an intern the same 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.590
 I have made with the average flower or is 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.049
 here I am going to combine it equal of the same 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.989
 way I have placed a booster and the 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:03.580
 we are placing to go forming our 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:06.329
 access here we go we have already placed 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.760
 placed four petals on needle and thread 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:12.010
 and we are going to place two more so that 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.829
 minus the small flower and so power 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.989
 assemble our accessory a stitch 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:20.680
 normal you use the needle and thread 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.780
 the same tone as those of the fabric 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.350
 to fit properly completed their 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.350
 accessories 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:33.150
 with this would already be six petals for the 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.150
 smaller flower 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.800
 let's close it normally 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.770
 we organize the little flower 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.470
 if you want they can put you 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.680
 reinforcement so that they are well stuck 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:15.620
 it is to your liking it is not necessary 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.960
 but here already the habit we do it like this 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.330
 then you will have the 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.529
 flowers all three sizes for 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:27.009
 join simply you stick 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:30.139
 silicone hot cold silicone in the 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:32.810
 inside or on the fabric and go 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:35.409
 placing the florets one on top of 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.409
 the other 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.710
 these very simple flowers are left 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.710
 very beautiful 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.330
 to be encouraged to do the girls 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.460
 Look, there's a big flower left 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.600
 If you want to make it in various sizes 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.510
 they can do it 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.200
 to finish you can decorate it 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:59.710
 with buttons covered with appliques like 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.860
 you want that and that's what you 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:06.360
 have on hand what they can get 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.360
 hot silicone on the wall 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:11.910
 a wall lamp that combines with the 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.860
 colors of flowers or fabrics 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:18.220
 our little flower has finished here 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.500
 they can stick it on a bullet that they apply 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.600
 good silicone and they have a 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.530
 very easy accessory very nice so that 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.910
 they can make it, they can sell it as 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.980

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:33.810
