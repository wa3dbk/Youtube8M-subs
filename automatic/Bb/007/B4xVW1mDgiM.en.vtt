part two building a car pace this is

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.940 
part two building a car pace this is
called<00:00:05.310> ramming<00:00:05.700> tires<00:00:05.910> so<00:00:06.570> we<00:00:07.110> put<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.590> couple

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
called ramming tires so we put a couple

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.840 
called ramming tires so we put a couple
of<00:00:08.099> shovels<00:00:08.310> and<00:00:08.910> soil<00:00:09.360> into<00:00:09.930> these<00:00:10.460> tires

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:11.850 
of shovels and soil into these tires

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.610

I'm<00:00:12.330> taking<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.840> lump<00:00:12.990> hammer<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.470> we're

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
I'm taking a lump hammer and we're

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.909 
I'm taking a lump hammer and we're
rubbing<00:00:13.890> the<00:00:14.519> soil<00:00:14.790> around<00:00:15.499> the<00:00:16.499> inside<00:00:16.769> of

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:16.919 
rubbing the soil around the inside of

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:19.669 
rubbing the soil around the inside of
the<00:00:17.009> tire<00:00:17.669> to<00:00:18.390> begin<00:00:18.659> with<00:00:18.900> we<00:00:19.199> just<00:00:19.380> put<00:00:19.529> loads

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:19.679 
the tire to begin with we just put loads

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:26.239 
the tire to begin with we just put loads
of<00:00:19.829> soil<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.310> just<00:00:20.400> hammering<00:00:21.089> it<00:00:25.249> pushing

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:26.249 
of soil in and just hammering it pushing

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:40.569 
of soil in and just hammering it pushing
it<00:00:30.439> you<00:00:36.980> can<00:00:37.980> open<00:00:38.399> them<00:00:38.820> so<00:00:39.030> more<00:00:39.420> than

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
it you can open them so more than

00:00:40.579 --> 00:01:28.060 
it you can open them so more than
pushing<00:00:43.100> this<00:00:46.070> into<00:00:47.070> the<00:01:22.760> experience<00:01:23.760> grows

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:49.000 

the<00:01:29.070> top

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:58.750 

I'd<00:01:49.580> take<00:01:49.820> out<00:01:50.000> any<00:01:50.950> roots<00:01:52.000> dandelion<00:01:53.000> roots

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.070 

large<00:01:59.760> stones<00:02:01.040> piece<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.280> wood<00:02:02.810> may<00:02:03.810> break

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
large stones piece of wood may break

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:21.420 
large stones piece of wood may break
down

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:03:18.150 

I<00:02:26.129> do<00:02:27.129> one<00:02:27.489> side<00:02:27.819> first

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.630 

they're<00:03:19.160> gonna<00:03:19.280> put<00:03:19.520> glass<00:03:19.850> on<00:03:20.390> top<00:03:21.640> broken

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
they're gonna put glass on top broken

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.280 
they're gonna put glass on top broken
glass

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
glass

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.610 
glass
and<00:03:24.290> that's<00:03:25.250> gonna<00:03:25.490> stop<00:03:25.959> and<00:03:26.959> eat<00:03:27.140> them<00:03:27.410> in

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
and that's gonna stop and eat them in

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:37.809 
and that's gonna stop and eat them in
rodents<00:03:28.280> mice<00:03:36.160> then<00:03:37.160> you<00:03:37.250> get<00:03:37.340> a<00:03:37.370> con<00:03:37.550> right<00:03:37.700> at

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
rodents mice then you get a con right at

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:50.050 
rodents mice then you get a con right at
the<00:03:37.880> top<00:03:38.030> of<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.209> cob<00:03:38.989> street<00:03:48.430> I<00:03:49.430> keep

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
the top of the cob street I keep

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.170 
the top of the cob street I keep
pressing<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:51.890> top<00:03:51.920> of<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.310> tire<00:03:52.519> and<00:03:52.970> won't

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
pressing the top of the tire and won't

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:21.770 
pressing the top of the tire and won't
pushes<00:03:53.540> down<00:03:53.690> obviously

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.280 

we're<00:04:22.530> copying<00:04:22.770> straight<00:04:23.310> on<00:04:23.430> top<00:04:23.610> of<00:04:23.760> tires

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
we're copying straight on top of tires

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.920 
we're copying straight on top of tires
because<00:04:25.290> stone<00:04:25.800> and<00:04:26.670> that's<00:04:27.060> going<00:04:27.420> to<00:04:27.480> be

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
because stone and that's going to be

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.590 
because stone and that's going to be
what<00:04:28.170> our<00:04:28.290> stones<00:04:28.620> would<00:04:28.830> have<00:04:28.920> been<00:04:29.300> doing

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:48.430 

have<00:04:33.600> you<00:04:33.630> got<00:04:33.810> some<00:04:34.500> reason

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.739 

because<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.560> recyclability

00:04:52.739 --> 00:04:52.749 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:57.129 

we<00:04:53.749> actually<00:04:53.900> was<00:04:55.059> paid<00:04:56.059> to<00:04:56.360> take<00:04:56.719> these<00:04:56.869> times

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
we actually was paid to take these times

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.200 
we actually was paid to take these times
whereas<00:04:57.409> if<00:04:57.499> you<00:04:57.589> go<00:04:57.740> to<00:04:57.800> a<00:04:57.919> type<00:04:58.219> you<00:04:59.059> know<00:04:59.180> a

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
whereas if you go to a type you know a

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.850 
whereas if you go to a type you know a
toy<00:04:59.539> fitting<00:04:59.930> place<00:05:01.059> we<00:05:02.059> took<00:05:02.439> four<00:05:03.439> G<00:05:03.649> tires

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
toy fitting place we took four G tires

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.579 
toy fitting place we took four G tires
and<00:05:04.360> they<00:05:05.360> actually<00:05:05.719> paid<00:05:05.899> me<00:05:06.110> 20<00:05:06.469> pounds

00:05:06.579 --> 00:05:06.589 
and they actually paid me 20 pounds

and they actually paid me 20 pounds
taken<00:05:06.919> away<00:05:07.189> which<00:05:07.399> was<00:05:07.580> pretty<00:05:07.999> awesome

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.289 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:18.999 

what<00:05:18.289> do<00:05:18.349> you<00:05:18.409> do<00:05:18.469> with<00:05:18.529> the<00:05:18.619> middle<00:05:18.740> bit<00:05:18.889> you

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:19.009 
what do you do with the middle bit you

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:29.649 
what do you do with the middle bit you
