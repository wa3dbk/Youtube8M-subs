movie<00:01:27.550> tropes<00:01:27.880> to<00:01:28.720> use<00:01:28.929> in<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.170> scenario

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
movie tropes to use in the scenario

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.139 
movie tropes to use in the scenario
we're<00:01:30.369> going<00:01:30.459> to<00:01:30.550> go<00:01:30.610> with<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.819> broken-down

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
color yeah now that actually works

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.919 
color yeah now that actually works
because<00:01:33.910> they<00:01:34.060> are<00:01:34.209> in<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.539> middle<00:01:34.720> of<00:01:34.869> the

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
because they are in the middle of the

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.199 
because they are in the middle of the
purge<00:01:35.410> and<00:01:35.740> it<00:01:36.250> is<00:01:36.399> the<00:01:36.550> middle<00:01:36.789> of<00:01:36.880> purge

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:37.209 
purge and it is the middle of purge

car<00:01:40.360> breaks<00:01:40.390> down<00:01:40.599> that's<00:01:40.929> that's<00:01:41.410> cool<00:01:41.890> I

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
car breaks down that's that's cool I

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.440 
car breaks down that's that's cool I
guess<00:01:42.310> I<00:01:42.520> mean<00:01:42.759> you<00:01:42.940> know<00:01:43.030> you're<00:01:43.270> in<00:01:43.360> the

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
guess I mean you know you're in the

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.820 
guess I mean you know you're in the
middle<00:01:43.630> of<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.840> action<00:01:43.959> immediately<00:01:44.380> in<00:01:44.770> the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
middle of the action immediately in the

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.790 
middle of the action immediately in the
movie<00:01:45.130> but<00:01:45.819> at<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.030> same<00:01:46.240> time<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:47.259> kind<00:01:47.619> of

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
movie but at the same time it kind of

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.710 
movie but at the same time it kind of
makes<00:01:47.950> your<00:01:48.130> characters<00:01:48.580> look<00:01:48.700> really<00:01:49.300> stupid

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
makes your characters look really stupid

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.419 
makes your characters look really stupid
hey<00:01:50.410> how<00:01:50.500> do<00:01:50.560> you<00:01:50.709> think<00:01:50.830> we<00:01:50.920> should<00:01:51.009> get<00:01:51.280> some

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
hey how do you think we should get some

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:54.150 
hey how do you think we should get some
gas<00:01:51.700> before<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.209> purge<00:01:52.450> no<00:01:53.170> it'll<00:01:54.039> be<00:01:54.069> fine

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
gas before the purge no it'll be fine

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.979 
gas before the purge no it'll be fine
now<00:01:54.849> they<00:01:54.970> might<00:01:55.119> play<00:01:55.360> it<00:01:55.509> differently<00:01:55.630> in

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:55.989 
now they might play it differently in

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:58.169 
now they might play it differently in
the<00:01:56.050> movie<00:01:56.349> and<00:01:56.470> I<00:01:56.560> I<00:01:56.739> really<00:01:57.280> hope<00:01:57.880> they<00:01:58.119> do

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
the movie and I I really hope they do

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.630

enough<00:02:40.720> money<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:40.989> it<00:02:41.349> would<00:02:41.470> just<00:02:41.620> grab<00:02:41.950> the

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
enough money that it would just grab the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.399 
enough money that it would just grab the
people's<00:02:42.549> attention<00:02:43.060> who<00:02:43.690> watched<00:02:43.989> it<00:02:44.230> the

thing so stupid i feel like this movie

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.119 
thing so stupid i feel like this movie
is<00:03:40.389> just<00:03:40.629> a<00:03:40.810> big<00:03:40.989> cash<00:03:41.260> grab<00:03:41.590> they're<00:03:41.829> trying

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:42.129 
is just a big cash grab they're trying

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.759 
is just a big cash grab they're trying
to<00:03:42.310> market<00:03:42.519> it<00:03:42.790> as<00:03:42.940> look<00:03:43.720> we're<00:03:44.169> doing<00:03:44.470> what<00:03:44.620> we

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
to market it as look we're doing what we

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.740 
to market it as look we're doing what we
could<00:03:44.980> have<00:03:45.010> done<00:03:45.129> in<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.489> first<00:03:45.519> one<00:03:46.000> but<00:03:46.599> the

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
could have done in the first one but the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.300 
could have done in the first one but the
point<00:03:46.989> is<00:03:47.109> you<00:03:47.319> should<00:03:47.590> have<00:03:47.709> done<00:03:47.739> it<00:03:48.129> in<00:03:48.280> the

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
point is you should have done it in the

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.759 
point is you should have done it in the
first<00:03:48.459> one<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.150> now<00:03:49.329> that<00:03:49.660> we<00:03:49.780> know<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:50.379> the

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
first one and now that we know that the

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.800 
first one and now that we know that the
first<00:03:50.980> one<00:03:51.250> was<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:51.430> bad<00:03:51.699> movie<00:03:52.090> I<00:03:52.120> mean<00:03:52.419> that

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
first one was a bad movie I mean that

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.619 
first one was a bad movie I mean that
kind<00:03:53.049> of<00:03:53.199> doesn't<00:03:53.379> give<00:03:53.620> you<00:03:53.739> good<00:03:54.040> I<00:03:54.400> hope<00:03:55.000> for

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
kind of doesn't give you good I hope for

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.420
