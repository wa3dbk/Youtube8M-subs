00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
Jacksonville last week there was no less

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.870

than<00:03:48.299> nine<00:03:48.540> teams<00:03:49.440> that<00:03:49.830> are<00:03:49.920> unprepared<00:03:50.340> both

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
than nine teams that are unprepared both

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.289 
than nine teams that are unprepared both
mentally<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.510> physically<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.440> play<00:03:52.620> football

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
mentally and physically to play football

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.910 
mentally and physically to play football
including<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.420> Buffalo<00:03:54.840> Bills<00:03:54.870> this<00:03:55.680> is<00:03:55.799> the

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
including the Buffalo Bills this is the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.620 
including the Buffalo Bills this is the
time<00:03:56.130> of<00:03:56.160> year<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.430> think<00:03:56.790> it's<00:03:56.910> really<00:03:57.209> hard<00:03:57.510> to

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
time of year I think it's really hard to

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.180 
time of year I think it's really hard to
handicap<00:03:58.049> because<00:03:58.200> you<00:03:58.440> might<00:03:58.620> end<00:03:58.799> up<00:03:58.950> with

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
handicap because you might end up with

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.460 
handicap because you might end up with
an<00:03:59.340> NBA<00:03:59.519> game<00:03:59.970> where<00:04:00.810> you're<00:04:00.930> really<00:04:01.260> not<00:04:01.410> sure

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
an NBA game where you're really not sure

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.590 
an NBA game where you're really not sure
who's<00:04:01.890> going<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:02.190> show<00:04:02.370> up<00:04:02.489> and<00:04:02.670> play<00:04:02.700> although

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600
