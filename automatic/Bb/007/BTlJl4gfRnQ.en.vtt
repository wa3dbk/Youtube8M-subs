00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
because why would I because I'm not I'd

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.140 
because why would I because I'm not I'd
have<00:03:06.620> to<00:03:06.770> subtract<00:03:07.220> that<00:03:07.400> from<00:03:07.460> my<00:03:07.730> main<00:03:07.910> kill

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150
