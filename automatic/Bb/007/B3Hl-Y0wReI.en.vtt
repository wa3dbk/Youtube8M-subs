00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.220
 hello good to all yes yes as before 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.200
 people let's talk today about multiplayer 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.210
 of black ops 3 of the classes of 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.189
 specialists there are and the skills 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.619
 who have each are two skills 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.320
 for each one of the specialists there 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.170
 up to nine kinds of specialists but 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.239
 in this pre alpha there was only up 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.879
 six enabled we could not see the 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.280
 rest of the three because they were not 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:42.440
 they were unlocked still then 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.590
 let's start talking about those that do 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.110
 they were unlocked here in the e3 well 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.510
 look first to tell you that each 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.940
 specialist has two skills one 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.390
 it would be a special weapon and the other would be 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.520
 Well, some way to have 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.489
 first tell you that each specialist 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.820
 has two abilities the first one would be 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.460
 one special weapon and the other would be some 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.210
 kind of agility for example running more 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.560
 Quick to have a field of vision more 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.259
 broad jump much higher or more 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.300
 fast left or right faster 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.390
 also depending on what characters 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.970
 they are worth then knowing those two 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.890
 skills that each specialist has 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.619
 we have to know also that we can not 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.990
 have both skills at the moment 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.690
 activated at the same time we will have to choose 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.450
 which one we want to take from each one of those 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.780
 skills or the weapon or that agility 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.910
 it's worth knowing all this already 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.190
 let's start to see each of the 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.960
 characters what skill does the 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.970
 first class specialist is called 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.920
 wretch I can choose from his weapon 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.720
 special that are that kind of 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.450
 banderillas that when nailing them in the 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.630
 ground 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.329
 expansive and busting everything that 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.009
 have around Cuyo after that 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.259
 same character has the ability to 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.440
 run faster still for about 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.230
 seconds that skill along with all 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.720
 those of the other specialists has a 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.360
 time and it will go recharging then a 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.680
 Once I flee to the worn out as you 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.900
 go killing and go doing 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.880
 score in the game then for 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.400
 recharge as before and you can get 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.170
 fabric again or you will only have one 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.510
 opportunity to use it but 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.280
 Normally if you make a good game 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.590
 you will have several times to be able 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.709
 use that character's ability 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.540
 owner then the next would be the 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.880
 woman that has the gun that is a 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.459
 special weapon that gun kills from a 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.380
 worth shot can kill apparently until 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.410
 three people at a time with our same 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.989
 bullet and then it's that same woman 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.560
 has the skill seems to be jumping 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.079
 higher you have to have more advantages to 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.079
 the time to jump after the next 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.910
 it would be the archer who has in that arc 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.770
 as a special weapon 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.640
 and the skill you have as if it were 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:10.030
 a kind of eye which it 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.730
 they will be able to see more and they will have more field 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.740
 vision or you will have the best you can see 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.350
 through the walls maybe you can 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.380
 have more sensitivity at the time of seeing 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.980
 on the contrary after we have to repair 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.840
 that would be that kind of robot not that the 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.300
 special weapon because it is that weapon that 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.860
 comes out of the arm and the movement that 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.230
 I would have the skill that I would have 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.170
 special would be then turns left and 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.070
 right faster in what seems to be 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.870
 that you see here I have not used it but 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.640
 it looks like it could be that and then 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.960
 would be the last two of which 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.250
 of which one is known to be 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.160
 teleport yourself or imagine yourself 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.350
 you're running not because of the game and of 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.600
 soon you want to go back in the 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.070
 time then the one that comes behind you 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.410
 I'm running to kill you 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.960
 you can give it back in time and 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.740
 you appear behind him and you can kill him 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.340
 Well, very easily 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.260
 and then the last one that would be the weapon 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.170
 special that he has that is a weapon of 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.570
 good rays, so you shoot if you 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.190
 give a discharge that burst and 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.950
 well, this is what is known 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.750
 now there is a little bit more to know 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.130
 there are three characters left to know and 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.840
 some other skill that has 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.730
 missed when the beta arrives and 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.980
 we can know more about all this 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.870
 the friends be attentive to the channel because 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.940
 everything that we will follow in return 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.600
 give the like to subscribe and until the 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.600
