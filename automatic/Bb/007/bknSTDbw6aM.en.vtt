me that shadow of Mordor is drawing a
lot<00:01:10.240> of<00:01:10.360> inspiration<00:01:10.659> from<00:01:11.380> games<00:01:11.710> that<00:01:11.920> were

lot of inspiration from games that were

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.430 
lot of inspiration from games that were
very<00:01:12.070> familiar<00:01:12.790> with<00:01:12.820> like<00:01:13.360> Assassin's<00:01:14.110> Creed

very familiar with like Assassin's Creed
an<00:01:14.909> example<00:01:15.909> of<00:01:16.090> this<00:01:16.150> is<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.600> ability<00:01:17.080> to

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
an example of this is the ability to

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.680 
an example of this is the ability to
climb<00:01:17.979> buildings<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.880> gain<00:01:19.120> a<00:01:19.299> tactical

climb buildings to gain a tactical

advantage<00:01:20.760> it<00:01:21.760> also<00:01:21.970> seems<00:01:22.420> like<00:01:22.659> its<00:01:22.900> combat

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
advantage it also seems like its combat

advantage it also seems like its combat
system<00:01:23.740> very<00:01:23.979> stylized<00:01:24.640> is<00:01:25.000> drawing

seems<00:01:30.070> to<00:01:30.159> be<00:01:30.340> centered<00:01:30.549> around<00:01:30.850> hunting<00:01:31.630> down

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869

though<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:38.020> game<00:01:38.229> does<00:01:38.530> seem<00:01:38.770> to<00:01:38.799> be

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
though the game does seem to be

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.520 
though the game does seem to be
borrowing<00:01:39.430> things<00:01:39.790> from<00:01:39.970> other<00:01:40.420> games<00:01:40.780> the

to be exactly the same whereas in one

to be exactly the same whereas in one
game<00:01:51.460> a<00:01:51.700> orc<00:01:52.180> might<00:01:52.420> rise<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:53.049> top<00:01:53.259> and<00:01:53.500> the

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
let some of the other orcs get a little

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.619 
let some of the other orcs get a little
more<00:02:24.920> powerful<00:02:25.430> they<00:02:25.879> could<00:02:26.090> potentially

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
more powerful they could potentially

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.559 
more powerful they could potentially
drop<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:27.140> rune<00:02:27.859> that<00:02:28.370> will<00:02:28.519> allow<00:02:28.760> you<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:29.209> I

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
drop a rune that will allow you to I

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.750 
drop a rune that will allow you to I
don't<00:02:30.109> know<00:02:30.200> be<00:02:30.439> super<00:02:30.769> powerful<00:02:31.069> something

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
don't know be super powerful something

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.910 
don't know be super powerful something
cool<00:02:31.909> like<00:02:31.939> that<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.989> way<00:02:33.170> your<00:02:33.349> Ranger<00:02:33.769> was

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
cool like that the way your Ranger was

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.679 
cool like that the way your Ranger was
brought<00:02:34.219> back<00:02:34.549> makes<00:02:34.969> him<00:02:35.180> essentially

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
brought back makes him essentially

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.470 
brought back makes him essentially
unkillable<00:02:36.609> arranger<00:02:37.609> seems<00:02:37.879> to<00:02:38.030> be<00:02:38.150> able<00:02:38.239> to

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
unkillable arranger seems to be able to

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.869 
unkillable arranger seems to be able to
die<00:02:38.900> but<00:02:39.409> that<00:02:39.590> simply<00:02:39.859> only<00:02:40.340> moves<00:02:40.579> time

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
die but that simply only moves time

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.630 
die but that simply only moves time
forward<00:02:41.390> so<00:02:41.870> if<00:02:42.109> a<00:02:42.319> orc<00:02:42.590> essentially<00:02:43.370> kills

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
forward so if a orc essentially kills

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.880 
forward so if a orc essentially kills
you<00:02:43.909> he<00:02:44.390> actually<00:02:44.569> goes<00:02:44.900> up<00:02:45.200> in<00:02:45.349> the<00:02:45.439> ranks

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
you he actually goes up in the ranks

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.770 
you he actually goes up in the ranks
because<00:02:46.280> he's<00:02:46.790> like<00:02:47.000> killed<00:02:47.299> this<00:02:47.480> big

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
because he's like killed this big

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.929 
because he's like killed this big
villain<00:02:48.230> but<00:02:48.560> then<00:02:48.769> again<00:02:48.889> you<00:02:49.340> can<00:02:49.700> encounter

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
villain but then again you can encounter

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.149 
villain but then again you can encounter
him<00:02:50.239> again<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:50.689> he'll<00:02:50.900> remember<00:02:51.230> that<00:02:51.590> this

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
him again and he'll remember that this

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.789 
him again and he'll remember that this
is<00:02:52.219> a<00:02:52.370> cool<00:02:52.549> mechanic<00:02:52.849> you<00:02:53.750> also<00:02:54.139> seem<00:02:54.409> to<00:02:54.439> have

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
is a cool mechanic you also seem to have

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.129 
is a cool mechanic you also seem to have
the<00:02:55.010> ability<00:02:55.099> to<00:02:55.459> see<00:02:56.030> into<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.599> Wraith<00:02:56.810> world

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.139 
the ability to see into the Wraith world

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.589 
the ability to see into the Wraith world
which<00:02:57.409> will<00:02:57.620> allow<00:02:57.799> you<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.129> track<00:02:58.970> down<00:02:59.180> clues

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
which will allow you to track down clues

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.780 
which will allow you to track down clues
and<00:02:59.930> potentially<00:03:00.739> help<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.129> accomplish<00:03:01.519> your

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
and potentially help you accomplish your

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
objective one of the things I thought

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.909 
objective one of the things I thought
was<00:03:04.909> cool<00:03:05.180> about<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.750> Wraith<00:03:05.930> ability<00:03:06.439> is<00:03:06.650> if

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:06.919 
was cool about the Wraith ability is if

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.920 
was cool about the Wraith ability is if
you're<00:03:07.129> exploring<00:03:07.579> ruins<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.540> go<00:03:08.689> into
