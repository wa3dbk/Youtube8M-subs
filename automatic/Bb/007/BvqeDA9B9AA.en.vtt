00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.780 

very<00:02:26.120> sharp<00:02:26.450> knife<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:27.080> sharp<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:28.070> month<00:02:28.310> with<00:02:28.760> a

because<00:02:43.210> all<00:02:44.210> knives<00:02:44.510> skip<00:02:44.930> on<00:02:45.110> blunt<00:02:46.040> blade

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
because all knives skip on blunt blade

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.850 
because all knives skip on blunt blade
nothing<00:02:47.150> on<00:02:47.210> this<00:02:47.420> one<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:48.410> high<00:02:48.590> carbon

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
nothing on this one the high carbon

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.580 
nothing on this one the high carbon
blades<00:02:49.280> keep<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:50.030> edge<00:02:50.240> much<00:02:50.930> longer<00:02:51.410> and

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
blades keep the edge much longer and

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.730 
blades keep the edge much longer and
they<00:02:52.010> sharpen<00:02:52.490> a<00:02:52.580> lot<00:02:52.700> easier<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:54.290> higher

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
they sharpen a lot easier and the higher

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.050 
they sharpen a lot easier and the higher
quality<00:02:55.250> steel<00:02:55.520> stainless<00:02:56.480> knives<00:02:58.060> they

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
as good as quality knives of this but

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.520
