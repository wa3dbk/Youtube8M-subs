 Scalpel Knife An all around holes too 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.950

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.389
 Now I would like to have one again 

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:43.999
 bit these leather bags exactly 

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:47.149
 imagine 

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:49.289
 Once we have this luxury model 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.920
 made entirely of leather 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:56.299
 we have a stable leather floor 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.310
 And the top is made of leather 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.799
 I 'll also show you two different ones 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.590
 methods like the carriers on the bag 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.570
 You can fix it yourself once in the 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.800
 pick up the carriers 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:15.280
 or alternatively , where you really are here 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.800
 just when to bring the rent yet 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.440
 it's a bit too much leather and you 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.900
 just make a bag with leather details 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.569
 we want this model 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.430
 there we have a leather floor 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:32.349
 The upper part of the bag is made of fabric 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.099
 all bags have the same 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.290
 lining 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:40.989
 This is also a lining made of fabric 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:45.069
 but in addition we have one more 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.569
 inside pocket with zipper the whole 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.930
 in practice it is somehow things 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:54.519
 you can find in the course material 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.760
 you also find this document there 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:01.030
 you have some information about the accessories 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.739
 and also the pattern itself 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.470
 that we will be here ourselves 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.849

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.220
 to sew bags 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:13.630

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.340
