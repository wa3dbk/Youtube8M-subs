Fridays<00:01:26.800> we<00:01:26.950> have<00:01:27.160> clinical<00:01:28.030> reasoning

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480 
Fridays we have clinical reasoning

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.420 
Fridays we have clinical reasoning
seminar<00:01:28.840> where<00:01:29.050> we<00:01:29.680> break<00:01:29.890> off<00:01:30.100> into

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
seminar where we break off into

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.100

different<00:01:30.700> tables<00:01:31.240> different<00:01:31.630> teams<00:01:31.840> and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
different tables different teams and

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.320 
different tables different teams and
actually<00:01:32.380> go<00:01:32.890> through<00:01:33.100> a<00:01:33.160> case<00:01:33.640> and<00:01:34.240> it's

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
actually go through a case and it's
