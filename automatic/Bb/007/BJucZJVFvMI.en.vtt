00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.780
 Hello people here and after the cool 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.880
 features finish rather in the background 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.950
 Let's start with today's topic and 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.770
 this is top five weapons in black ops 2 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.990
 but not my five favorite weapon eg 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.700
 the fvl i think the fl is the best 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.960
 choice for black ops 2 but it can 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.029
 just a lot of people are not with her 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.369
 Bypass and therefore she comes today in the 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.689
 top-5 countdown not at all but 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.460
 We're about to start right now 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.630
 but you can see that at the end of the 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.230
 Of course, videos in the comments 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.690
 write 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.680
 what your favorite weapons are but that 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.630
 whole here is really only 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.280
 basically seen for all players 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.170
 In any case, we'll start now 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.660
 times with place five and that occupies the 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.730
 scorpions evo 3d scorpion i where is three 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.289
 just a beast in the melee at first 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.239
 She was not so good at black ops 2 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.579
 but through the whole pages are the 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.680
 others are getting worse and the 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.660
 scorpion evo 3 got better and better 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.730
 she is also the weapon with the highest 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.559
 fire wheel in black ops 2 so i would 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.480
 advise it well with your ammunition 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.519
 bypasses and maybe with the magazine 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.809
 Extension plays for the normal clip 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.820
 maybe enough for one or two 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.250
 opponents and also there it can be scarce 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.200
 and that in turn means you often 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.759
 have to reload and the big problem 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.890
 When loading is that you really 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.869
 stay with the scorpion i election campaign 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.670
 the problem is but if you are close to fight 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.619
 after somehow invite you 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.900
 get her and in the spot of those 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.880
 Since then and the discover it is over 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.740
 with you so the opponents 141 tries 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.869
 to turn off because the melee had 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.500
 with the scorpion i where 3m a big one 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.630
 advantage 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.840
 Now we come to place four and therewith 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.340
 from the gsr 50 a sniper occupies me 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.170
 think a sniper must also in the canton 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.909
 because sniper rifles are that 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.350
 really strong because you mostly with 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.450
 a ball can cool 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.950
 But she is only in fourth place because of the 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.810
 ball must really sit in the 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.790
 background counted just sitting with me 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.590
 the balls are almost always there 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.450
 is it really practical with one 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.159
 to play sniper and then you can 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.390
 really very strong and maybe even 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.979
 be overboard 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.110
 a few of you are wondering now too 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.000
 determines why exactly they are tsr 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.740
 why not outwit I can do to you 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.180
 also easy to answer 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.399
 with it is then you have namely 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.659
 really hit the upper body and that 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.460
 It can be hard at times 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.260
 and if you are as a sniper 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.700
 he too is behind and not 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.350
 really soaking around if you still 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.480
 not to be experienced then you should 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.640
 really take the dsr because of this 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.290
 speed to the user at list then has 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.290
 Not really necessary 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.819
 really uses the dsr and if you 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.980
 I could also play well with you 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.569
 much higher on consumption only 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.250
 Of course, many people can not do that 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.109
 but now we come to third place 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.870
 and in third place we have one 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:36.340
 assault rifle and namely the m8 1 gm 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.840
 Do as I call her is even 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.730
 my personal favorite color 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.230
 I think that's really cool that you look 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.239
 do not focus on the recoil 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.340
 that's what makes it all alone 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.799
 the weapon is a brush means 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.659
 automatically fills in many ointments 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.090
 Players think it's three balls as well 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.010
 all other stock exchange weapons in call of 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.019
 duty until now but that's not true they 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.370
 namely shoots four balls and order can 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.709
 in my opinion they are in close combat 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.510
 also quite effective use as it 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.069
 just in the background also looks up 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.480
 But I want to say every case, too 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.340
 if it's my personal favorite weapon 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.840
 many players can not do that 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.400
 and that's why she is too 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.290
 only landed in third place 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.730
 Another important point is also 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.260
 the essays because in my opinion 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.269
 you can go without the red dot here 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.099
 almost do not play with the m 8 1 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.659
 really becomes a terrible standard 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.819
 visor and that's why I really would like you 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.799
 Guess if you tried the weapon 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.239
 you have to necessarily with the road points 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.949
 here but I would say play 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.470
 we are already coming to place 2 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:32.889
 from our account and that will be from the 1 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.419
 94 occupies the 94 was at the beginning 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.680
 actually not so well known 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:37.659
 they do not have too many people 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.310
 played but then it was always 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:40.659
 again patched exactly because she 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.489
 actually not played that often 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.870
 is and I'm not sure if that 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.120
 really a good decision is because 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.579
 right now play really right 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.720
 many people with the 1 94 and i think 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.489
 she will really be down again 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.530
 patched the next patch because they 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.970
 You can say something too strong 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.979
 but in any case she is out 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.930
 close distance is good at a distance 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:01.299
 Of course, good is a storm rifle 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.769
 so perfect for black ops 2 if 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.900
 you can also use them in close combat 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.040
 and besides that is fully automatic and 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.540
 most look at two players 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.280
 can use fully automatic weapons 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.590
 just play a lot better and if 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.169
 why do not you ask skh or the m27? 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.380
 now well all have their quirks, the 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:19.150
 For example, m27 does too little harm and damage 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.220
 the ska has a really fat 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.110
 recoil so I am there is all 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.509
 simply the perfect all-rounder and 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.889
 That's why I'm in second place and me 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.260
 would say we come now already 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.510
 to place one our winner and that is 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.200
 the ms mmc the msm one 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.820
 submachine gun and it so too 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.520
 also dollars and that does a lot of harm 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:39.350
 has a good kickback a relative 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.930
 big magazine and besides that is 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.730
 Feeling of the ms mmc just super that 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.490
 is such a simple weapon and somehow 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.890
 reminds me of the ak 47 or the 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.590
 ak 74 the machine gun from call of 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.390
 Duty 4 and black ops and just like at 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.430
 the two cast I just called 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.680
 I just think that tsmc is so popular 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.190
 is because she is such a simple and simple 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.470
 weapon 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.150
 unlike the pbb now not at all 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.970
 But I was able to do that in countdown 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.220
 also initially explain black ops 2 there 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.630
 the pw became quite famous and that's why 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.610
 Now she thought she was fine , too 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.750
 but I find this a very bad one 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.090
 already become a weapon 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.710
 through the many patches has it easy 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.420
 much to the rebound you get 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.840
 to the left sometimes to the right sometimes to 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.850
 above 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.500
 I think that's funny and that's why 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.640
 I think the ms is now the 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.800
 best weapon in the game 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.000
 apart from things like the evl to 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.780
 but for example a completely different one 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.880
 history 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.920
 But there is another reason why the 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.870
 msm has now made the first place 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.700
 and that's just the game black ops 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.470
 2 in itself the game is easy for 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.660
 made machine guns and many 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.400
 People can distance the distance 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.410
 one for storm rifles simply needs 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.420
 can not build with the smc you can 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.830
 Just live in and run a few 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.300
 make kilos that always works 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.790
 Also, black ops 2 is on 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.740
 action packed game with small apps and 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.090
 there are machine guns just almost 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.680
 always in the advantage 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.090
 that 's it for now from the video 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.530
 I hope I liked the video 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.850
 If you liked it then I'm fine 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.170
 but a thumbs up and me 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.120
 I would be very happy if you more 10 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.710
 comments write your top five 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.090
 Weapons are I do not want either 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.800
 Write a comment then mine could 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.510
 top five also see if you are 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.800
 has new and you like my videos 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.150
 then subscribe me and look 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.920
 maybe even a canal over 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.840
 I would be very happy in any case 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.340
 But first I say that leads to what 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.150
 from me and see you soon 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.150
 in the next video
