00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.559
 hello welcome to scandals I know 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.329
 that you will be laughing folder I do not have 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.449
 I stole this subway 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:19.509
 I'm playing a video of the train 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:22.750
 It seems to me that simulator 2014 has taken place 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:26.019
 towards the antigent of Christmas on steam 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.429
 had a paltry cost 567 euros a 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:32.980
 zero stuff is a game all in all that 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.170
 it relaxes you at least that is basically me 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.370
 I had taken to relax to pilot 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:42.490
 always at a frantic pace, it reduced me 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.110
 also life so I said but why 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.640
 we don't take a nice video game of 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.860
 let's just relax 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.200
 on the train and we go around and that's all 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.360
 added a sort of simulator now 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.850
 clearly this is a place I make you 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.550
 see some scenes from the game is 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.320
 a game that actually starts and ends 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.970
 think it can be relaxing in 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.490
 actually there is a lot of signals from 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.190
 respect a lot of things to do a 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.290
 lots of stops to be able to catch 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.880
 points because clearly if you play like 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.360
 a fool then the speech at the end 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.640
 you realize that you have a lot of 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.030
 penalties and then we evolve 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.590
 absolutely like as levels though it is 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.780
 all in all very interesting a lot 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.840
 nice I wanted to show some 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:30.780
 extracted from the gameplay is a 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.590
 quite complex in its entirety though 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.290
 however, a game that you can touch 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.360
 to a problem only that we say that 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.090
 in its standard of the version that you 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.430
 go and buy substantially vi 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.840
 it is cheap but also gives little because a 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.510
 what they are 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.460
 it seems to me around the 45 locomotives and one 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.979
 dozens of scenarios no more 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.500
 after which you have to buy dlc ed 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.540
 offenses cost as I have 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.759
 tried on steam and take a look at 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.280
 how much the sum of the dlc can stand e 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.920
 look for something back in the 165 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.450
 black euro like that then 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.200
 basically it should be taken for what it is 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.980
 it's one it takes you to play if you like it 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.220
 unlocks alternative locomotives 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.570
 or the scenarios you want to integrate 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.970
 inside the videogame 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.670
 otherwise it tends to standard model ones 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.770
 mac and I use them a little to carry on 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.680
 behind people and do some levels 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.620
 to unlock something new but everything 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.250
 added let's say it's a game that tends to 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.920
 boring those who are at 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.170
 search for stronger emotions though 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.320
 maybe you may like those you love 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.560
 what the simulations are and done 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.299
 very well in detail very well kept has 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.340
 a graphics all in all nice too 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.390
 if the models of the people who walk 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.700
 they seem to walk every now and then but 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.320
 see the strollers some are 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.110
 something seems to have the 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.780
 his skates were coming out of ice 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:11.160
 however it is interesting because it has a 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:13.590
 lots of scenarios that can be 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.150
 very intriguing but above all because 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.989
 this game can be interpreted in 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.720
 arcade mode or even simulative 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.269
 because then you will have access to the inside 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.290
 of the cabin clearly to almost all 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.370
 commands and the levers that are there and therefore 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.380
 disabling the panel 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.930
 arcade you see that I always use 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.460
 at the bottom of the screen 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.160
 you can also play a model 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.030
 simulative who has had to deal with 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.250
 play the flight simulator model as well 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.230
 will surely know what I'm talking about 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.880
 but then this video game must be dedicated 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.210
 in my opinion to all those who were 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.330
 the big fans of trains under christmas 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:59.580
 they mounted type of tracks as large as 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:03.480
 your own home and that we tell a 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:07.349
 basically what love is for 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.890
 simulator the simulation aspect of 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.200
 these trains 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.650
 in his favor he will certainly have the fact 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.450
 which has a nice graphic engine is a 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.220
 little pesantino also for the cards 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.170
 graphics let's say we are in 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.640
 trade now 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.370
 therefore it will sometimes redeem you 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.980
 quite normal all in all also 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.570
 looking at the steam forum and so on 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.090
 engaging scenarios and vi 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.390
 you will surely come back to pass 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.970
 mezz'oretta 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.290
 to drive your train in total 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.450
 looseness 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.860
 on the other hand it has the fact that to have more 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.600
 locomotive scenario etc. and so on 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.750
 you have to spend a boat of money but 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.350
 however the business is also given by 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.640
 so always look at me at 6 and then 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.880
 see you next time 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.880
 Hello
