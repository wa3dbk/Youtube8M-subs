of an issue for me that's one of the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.990 
of an issue for me that's one of the
main<00:02:58.540> reasons<00:02:58.960> I<00:02:59.320> am<00:02:59.800> considering<00:03:00.490> growing<00:03:00.820> it

main reasons I am considering growing it

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.030 
main reasons I am considering growing it
out<00:03:01.240> just<00:03:01.750> because<00:03:02.110> of<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.410> because<00:03:02.620> I<00:03:02.710> hate

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
out just because of that because I hate

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.340 
out just because of that because I hate
wearing<00:03:03.310> makeup<00:03:03.520> I<00:03:03.900> usually<00:03:04.900> just<00:03:05.020> go<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.230> a

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
wearing makeup I usually just go to a

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.530 
wearing makeup I usually just go to a
natural<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:06.150> lately<00:03:07.150> I've<00:03:07.240> been<00:03:07.360> wearing

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
natural and lately I've been wearing

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.910 
natural and lately I've been wearing
makeup<00:03:07.720> every<00:03:08.080> day<00:03:08.110> because<00:03:08.560> I'm<00:03:08.620> trying<00:03:08.860> to

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
makeup every day because I'm trying to

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.370 
makeup every day because I'm trying to
compensate<00:03:09.220> for<00:03:09.610> feeling<00:03:09.970> less<00:03:10.180> feminine<00:03:10.810> but

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
compensate for feeling less feminine but

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.320 
compensate for feeling less feminine but
I<00:03:11.440> mean<00:03:11.740> if<00:03:11.980> you<00:03:12.160> have<00:03:12.370> a<00:03:12.400> very<00:03:12.760> feminine<00:03:13.120> face

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
I mean if you have a very feminine face

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.420 
I mean if you have a very feminine face
and<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:14.110> or<00:03:14.380> if<00:03:14.650> you<00:03:14.680> love<00:03:14.950> wearing<00:03:15.250> makeup

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
and you or if you love wearing makeup

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.770 
and you or if you love wearing makeup
then<00:03:15.760> I<00:03:15.880> don't<00:03:16.120> think<00:03:16.300> that's<00:03:16.450> really<00:03:16.690> an

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
then I don't think that's really an

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.650 
then I don't think that's really an
issue<00:03:16.930> for<00:03:17.260> anyone<00:03:17.470> personally<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:19.390> only
