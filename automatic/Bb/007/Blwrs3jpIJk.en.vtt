 Welcome to Metabolism TV your source of correct information on the metabolism 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.620
 and health. Is your hair falling out? Do you know that this has to do with obesity? 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.430
 I'm Frank Suarez specialist in obesity and metabolism. 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.430
 I want to talk to you today about what it is or what relationship it has, the one that is falling down 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.449
 the hair with the difficulty to lose weight or with the famous slow metabolism. This is 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:45.079
 Metabolism TV, here we are dedicated to give you correct information about the metabolism 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.269
 and about health and we want you to have this information correct but we also want 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:54.680
 that you tell us, that you let us know what topic would you like us to cover? 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.059
 Let us know your opinions on the different topics we are covering, including 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.739
 If we have something to improve, let us know, then let's talk a little bit about what 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.100
 You have to see this when you comb your hair, especially if you're a woman and you comb your hair, and you 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.010
 that there is a lot of hair, that is falling, that is in the brush or you are going to bathe and notes 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.939
 that after bathing the bathtub, the base of the bathtub is full of hairs. Sepas 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.350
 that has to do with your slow metabolism or your difficulty in losing weight. We start 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.240
 to explain that, notice, the metabolism is controlled here is a gland that is 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.159
 here in the neck, which is called the thyroid gland, this gland controls two things, 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.329
 a the metabolism and also controls the temperature of the body in previous episodes 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:49.320
 we've talked about how a person can measure how well their thyroid is only using 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.670
 a thermometer to measure the temperature of your body, that is also explaining in 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.850
 the book, in my book The Power of Metabolism so you can monitor, how well 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.009
 or how bad is your thyroid, unfortunately the laboratory tests and I repeat again 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:12.819
 this, the laboratory tests for the thyroid are not accurate more than half of the tests 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.450
 of the laboratory that are given for the thyroid do not detect the so-called "slow metabolism" 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.000
 but it's what they call "subclinical hypothyroidism" that is, there are many people, 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.620
 especially women who have slow metabolism problems that are getting fat, which 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.420
 they can not lose weight, they get depressed, they lose their hair, they have insomnia, 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.860
 who suffer from constipation, who have cold on their hands and feet, that the skin 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:46.040
 is dry, they feel tired, weak, they can not concentrate, all these are manifestations 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.290
 of hypothyroidism of an affected thyroid, however when they are sent to make a 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.900
 laboratory test for the thyroid, everything goes well. The TCH goes well, the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.500
 T4, T3 goes well and that does not explain why she feels so bad, because she is fat, 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.049
 because it is without energy, because it has dry skin, because it has a cold body, 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.709
 because he has insomnia, the reality is that there are many people who suffer from hypothyroidism 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:20.680
 subclinical, it is called subclinical because it is not detected in the laboratory test but 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.950
 returning to the subject, if you notice that you are combing your hair and you fall a lot of hair, that means 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.819
 that your thyroid is affected, if the hair is falling down little by little it can be simple 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.709
 and simply a hereditary aspect but if you notice that when combing you there is a lot of hair 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.750
 in the brush or you bathe and there is a lot of hair in the bathtub, especially in the case of 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.129
 women who are often seen, they see the skull or you see that the 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:53.159
 hair is ralito, that had that hair morusa, that mane of hair and all that leafy 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.122
 It has been disappearing that means that the thyroid is affected. And if that goes to 

00:03:58.122 --> 00:04:04.959
 accompanied by a difficulty to lose weight, each time the clothes tighter and each 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:09.120
 more difficulty to exercise, to have energy, because it means that the thyroid 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.060
 is affected, why? Because the thyroid produces hormones T4 and T3, which especially 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:24.030
 T3 is the cause of growth in the body, the hair can not grow unless there is enough 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.410
 hormone T3, when the person has hypothyroidism problems there is little T3, when there is 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:36.479
 little T3, there is little growth, there is little cell division is what is called, then the hair 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:42.050
 it grows little and falls a lot, if you are having hair fall problems or when you comb your hair, 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.540
 or when you bathe, you notice that there is a lot of hair, you can suspect that you have a metabolism 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.199
 slow, the way to find out is, as we explained in the book The Power of Metabolism is to measure you 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:57.210
 the temperature under the tongue with a thermometer for 3 minutes, 3 or 4 times at 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.650
 day, the averages and you know if you really have a thyroid problem, you can not 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:09.150
 solve a problem that you do not even know you have, and I tell you that because the truth 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.700
 always triumphs, see you on a next occasion.
