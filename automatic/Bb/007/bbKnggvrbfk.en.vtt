00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
most use for these in your blitz games

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.500 
most use for these in your blitz games
if<00:00:52.030> you<00:00:52.090> play<00:00:52.510> these<00:00:53.160> traps<00:00:54.160> in<00:00:54.579> standard

if you play these traps in standard
matches<00:00:55.960> where<00:00:56.140> you<00:00:56.350> have<00:00:56.530> a<00:00:56.559> lot<00:00:56.980> of<00:00:57.100> time<00:00:57.340> to

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
matches where you have a lot of time to

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.069 
matches where you have a lot of time to
look<00:00:57.730> at<00:00:57.850> positions<00:00:58.300> in<00:00:58.450> your<00:00:58.600> opponent<00:00:58.960> has<00:00:59.050> a

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
lot of time to look at positions they're

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.810 
lot of time to look at positions they're
less<00:01:01.180> likely<00:01:01.210> to<00:01:01.840> succeed<00:01:02.230> for<00:01:02.530> sure<00:01:02.700> but<00:01:03.700> this

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
less likely to succeed for sure but this

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.359 
less likely to succeed for sure but this
definitely<00:01:04.149> has<00:01:04.449> has<00:01:05.170> some<00:01:05.409> merit<00:01:05.770> in<00:01:05.920> it<00:01:06.039> and

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
definitely has has some merit in it and

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.630 
definitely has has some merit in it and
the<00:01:06.880> reason<00:01:07.149> is<00:01:07.299> because<00:01:08.280> generally<00:01:09.280> in<00:01:09.369> blitz

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
the reason is because generally in blitz

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.429 
the reason is because generally in blitz
matches<00:01:10.149> if<00:01:10.420> you're<00:01:10.630> playing<00:01:10.810> under<00:01:11.110> really

matches if you're playing under really
tight<00:01:12.130> time<00:01:12.340> controls<00:01:12.960> people<00:01:13.960> don't<00:01:14.140> take<00:01:14.380> a

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
tight time controls people don't take a

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.960 
tight time controls people don't take a
long<00:01:14.830> time<00:01:15.130> to<00:01:15.310> look<00:01:15.430> at<00:01:15.580> certain<00:01:15.729> positions

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
long time to look at certain positions

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.880 
long time to look at certain positions
and<00:01:16.510> if<00:01:16.900> they're<00:01:17.049> unfamiliar<00:01:17.650> with<00:01:17.740> the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
much more likely to make mistakes or

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.840 
much more likely to make mistakes or

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.170 
two choices white can push the King to
e2<00:03:01.319> but<00:03:01.799> unfortunately<00:03:02.400> after<00:03:02.579> the<00:03:02.849> Queen

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180

for<00:03:30.480> white<00:03:30.810> this<00:03:31.019> Bishop<00:03:31.440> here<00:03:31.680> on<00:03:31.859> c5<00:03:32.519> is

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
for white this Bishop here on c5 is

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.240 
for white this Bishop here on c5 is
creating<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.870> very<00:03:34.049> big<00:03:34.500> problem<00:03:34.769> for<00:03:34.950> white

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
creating a very big problem for white

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.940 
creating a very big problem for white
it's<00:03:35.459> basically<00:03:35.790> going<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.090> make<00:03:36.150> white

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
it's basically going to make white

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.410 
it's basically going to make white
incapable<00:03:37.950> of<00:03:38.100> capturing<00:03:38.549> this<00:03:39.000> Queen<00:03:39.269> by

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730
