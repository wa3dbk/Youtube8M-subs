00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.189
 the meeting begins timidly with a 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.570
 first incursion of Persian but with 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:20.050
 a good olive stock corre the 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.169
 guardian 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.550
 the team ii we have to wait for the first 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.140
 quarter of an hour for Saint Brice break 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.829
 the game and create themselves the first 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.300
 opportunities 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.220
 here we see a shift on the left side 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.309
 followed a strike unfortunately not 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.750
 squared in the 19th minute on a long 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.699
 release of saint-brice against attack 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.309
 lightning with a good grip avoid this 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.030
 face to face in front of the goalkeeper 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.550
 unfortunately the finish is not 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.900
 still not at the rendezvous you perceive 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.420
 also approaches the goal of saint-brice 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.970
 by long strikes still not enough 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.199
 dangerous 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.760
 the dominance of services become of 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.710
 more and more important over the 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.589
 rare times we see more actions 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.320
 built more licked unfortunately 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:02.739
 is still and always the finish is 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.510
 not at the appointment and attention because 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.280
 all these lost opportunities have 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:12.430
 tendency to frustrate the greens that 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:15.550
 gets upset more and more we go into 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.500
 second half time where the same profile of 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.720
 match continues with 102 pushing 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.720
 but who is and clumsy in front of the goal 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.300
 doubt begins to settle in the 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.360
 green people head benefit 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.820
 to get the head out of the water and music 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.890
 have either nice actions on the 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.750
 first opportunity secret cages and 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.910
 the opening of the score 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.040
 on an unstoppable face-to-face for the 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.600
 caretaker can not do anything 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.930
 piercing opens the scoring on his first 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.430
 opportunity and against the course of the game very 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.250
 hard to cash for saint-brice so we 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.560
 well sees the shift beautiful action on 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.880
 one one two three and the player of 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.530
 people who are under all alone 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.290
 face six meters and the just the gadin 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.810
 quietly without pressure will have to 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.850
 react for the greens the reaction is 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.010
 snapshot and two minutes later a 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.110
 head that crashed against the pole 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:12.040
 where they have a hunter who has stretched to 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.720
 this summer and despite anyone taking 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.500
 trust is there a beautiful cross 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.480
 this is the turn of the match 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.100
 if ever there is this second holy purpose 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.900
 brice and does not go crazy troops or pu 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.680
 return to the exception of olive tree body 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.959
 but hey it's still 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.220
 transversal that saves saint brice 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:31.620
 another corner there is no longer believed 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.090
 too much and loses without sowing brand unfurled 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.680
 so to see there are many people 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.940
 in the surface two people who we 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.720
 all but one goal but there was a 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.299
 offside position goodbye to 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.519
 idle so yes she certainly has to 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.360
 there is but it was right and thankfully 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.269
 that there is no purpose 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.670
 but good this goal denied to donate 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.580
 wake up the greens that are recovering there 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.769
 believe and put forward a 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.410
 beautiful action of eight hundred disease that 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.060
 is full of beautiful parades of the keeper 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.770
 it's once again a turning point of 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.780
 match the real time of the match so the 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.780
 kind of person who cable beautiful who is 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.890
 does a little charcuter despite all the bid 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.420
 who was two meters from the action 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.560
 decide that there is no foot know them 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.580
 created a little controversy 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.430
 Saint-Brice goes on a direct attack 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.470
 right side it's babacar gaye kg and 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.390
 a meteoric acceleration and 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.120
 cud mowed at the entrance to the surface 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.030
 repair but that so far blow 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.840
 franc 1 indisputable yellow card followed 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.040
 a yellow card and redouane belarbi is going 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.310
 take charge of the free kick 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.120
 so we can see that the goalkeeper is on 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.280
 the right side of his goal and that makes 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.470
 fly and reda mehrabi equalizes for 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.420
 Saint Brice on a free kick 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.280
 cleverly shot because there was 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.960
 my little guy placing the wall or 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.740
 anything in any case there was a 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:57.520
 breach and radouane laprise and that makes 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:00.720
 the equalization for saint brice it remains 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.720
 a quarter of an hour to play 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.840
 in the 88th minute the greens grow 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.590
 push and want to snatch this score 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.330
 so they put themselves forward 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.879
 shift a nice strike and that's the 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.220
 parade of paradise grains of Persian which 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.959
 keeps the score makes it 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.930
 game more than the stops chants 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.479
 to rush to the attacked people 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.780
 trying to contain it anyway 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.729
 off as it can but it returns it 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.500
 come back as fast 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:37.410
 we change sides we go right side the 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.760
 shift right a well-adjusted center 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.490
 of reverse glass and the king of arabia 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.760
 mark the second goal of saint brice and 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.160
 tommy lee three stops is good 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.199
 it's a goal synonymous with victory 2 goals 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.440
 to 1 for saint brice beneficial 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:59.229
 we will see in slow motion this center and 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:02.440
 this radouane head so we can see 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:04.750
 in surface 3 to the three green 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.210
 and ee is free water balloon which 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.710
 bounces but radwane that happens when 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.250
 even to master her head and she 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.450
 just put it in all the transverse and 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.160
 maintenance these people who 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.800
 push to tear the equalizer 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.330
 if the 4th minute stops play he sees 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.800
 there they are in the surface they are trying 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.690
 strikes against the defense of 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.470
 Saint-Brice resists well and blow of 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.080
 final whistle 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.610
 Ben final victory match 2 goals to 1 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.620
 for saint brice a victory at 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.420
 the snatch and we'll go we'll listen 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.320
 the comments of the players for 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:39.260
 know the post-match reactions 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.330
 difficult we took a goal a little against 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.440
 the course of the game by cons compared to 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.790
 last season what's good it's 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.580
 that when we are led to the score we arrive 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.410
 to react here on the other hand we still have 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.890
 missed a lot of chances in front of goal 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.360
 otherwise good state of mind 

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:56.270
 the investment of each of each of 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.490
 players and then a good result at the 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.610
 house against a pretty beefy team 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.540
 even if they were misclassified 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.570
 she was 3 defeats I think we 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.890
 still had a lot of discussion 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.930
 thirteen performance finally we are happy 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.130
 of the result and we had to win at 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.340
 home after a draw 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.720
 here against cergy here is so beautiful 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.770
 benefit everyone misses a little 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.840
 finishing before it takes a lot 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.630
 opportunity to score goals but 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.010
 here is on the whole pretty satisfied 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.590
 it's when we played against Saint Brice 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.960
 the reserve a pretty difficult game I 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.280
 found but we had in football from the beginning of 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.020
 match and some cohesion of 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.050
 teams but all in France 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.030
 would see it was hard a little bit hard 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.860
 to resist when we die we led 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:40.190
 to the score and we got back 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.410
 catch up on saint brice taboo c is a 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.419
 deserved to win I find is safe 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.550
 on the whole match if I found 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:49.220
 that the arbitration was not good enough 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.110
 because on an error it penalized us 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.060
 behind one is pure France and taken a 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.740
 goal and we took the water behind he also 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.820
 must be said we must be must be 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.010
 honest this a real it was a good 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.840
 team and I hope that in the return match we 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.919
 will do a little bit will prove more than 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.919
 cohesion we will beat them
