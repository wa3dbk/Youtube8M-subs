me<00:01:15.420> from<00:01:16.490> modding<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.729> car<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.900> price

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
me from modding this car is the price

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.160 
me from modding this car is the price
because<00:01:20.189> if<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.460> went<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.759> eBay<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.780> will<00:01:21.960> see

because if you went on eBay you will see

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.620 
because if you went on eBay you will see
that<00:01:22.350> these<00:01:22.590> cars<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.580> go<00:01:23.729> anywhere<00:01:24.240> from

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
that these cars can go anywhere from

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.960 
that these cars can go anywhere from
dirty<00:01:25.580> to<00:01:27.049> $100<00:01:28.049> based<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:29.070> their<00:01:29.369> condition

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
dirty to $100 based on their condition

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.149 
dirty to $100 based on their condition
now<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.750> condition<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.290> mine<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.950> in

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
now in the condition that mine is in

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.039 
now in the condition that mine is in
with<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> fact<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.420> doesn't<00:01:33.840> have<00:01:34.020> a

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
with the fact that it doesn't have a

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.969 
with the fact that it doesn't have a
controller<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.900> door<00:01:37.290> handle<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.799> broken

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
controller and the door handle is broken

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.200 
controller and the door handle is broken
and<00:01:39.350> I<00:01:40.350> don't<00:01:41.100> know<00:01:41.250> what<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> was<00:01:41.640> wrong<00:01:42.000> with

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
and I don't know what I was wrong with

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.600 
and I don't know what I was wrong with
it<00:01:42.390> it's<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.750> couple<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.320> other<00:01:43.560> things<00:01:43.860> small

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
it it's a couple of other things small

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.679 
it it's a couple of other things small
things<00:01:44.990> mine<00:01:45.990> would<00:01:46.259> probably<00:01:46.290> go<00:01:46.829> for<00:01:47.250> about

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
things mine would probably go for about

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.840 
things mine would probably go for about
maybe<00:01:48.689> thirty<00:01:49.350> forty<00:01:49.829> dollars<00:01:50.220> but<00:01:50.579> when<00:01:50.729> you

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
maybe thirty forty dollars but when you

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.359 
maybe thirty forty dollars but when you
add<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.540> raggedy<00:01:52.140> controller<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:53.250> I

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
add on this raggedy controller that I

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.399 
add on this raggedy controller that I
have<00:01:53.579> built<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.840> price<00:01:55.110> would

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
have built for it the price would

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.780 
have built for it the price would
probably<00:01:55.799> go<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.460> maybe<00:01:56.700> 50<00:01:57.420> now<00:01:58.140> $50<00:01:59.040> it

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
probably go up to maybe 50 now $50 it

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.789 
probably go up to maybe 50 now $50 it
seems<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> lot<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.630> could<00:02:00.960> do<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> lot<00:02:01.350> for<00:02:01.380> my

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
seems like a lot I could do a lot for my

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.109 
seems like a lot I could do a lot for my
slash<00:02:02.130> 4x4<00:02:02.939> one<00:02:03.509> for<00:02:03.689> $50<00:02:04.439> but<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
slash 4x4 one for $50 but that is the

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.490 
slash 4x4 one for $50 but that is the
only<00:02:06.420> thing<00:02:06.810> holding<00:02:07.649> me<00:02:07.950> back<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.840> think<00:02:09.840> that

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
only thing holding me back I think that

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.589 
only thing holding me back I think that
I'm<00:02:10.619> going<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.069> go<00:02:11.250> ahead<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.970> start<00:02:12.360> working

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
I'm going to go ahead and start working

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.350 
I'm going to go ahead and start working
on<00:02:12.959> it

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
on it

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.640 
on it
the<00:02:13.510> first<00:02:13.780> thing<00:02:13.960> that<00:02:14.080> I'm<00:02:14.170> probably<00:02:14.440> going

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
the first thing that I'm probably going

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.890 
the first thing that I'm probably going
to<00:02:14.890> do<00:02:15.160> is<00:02:15.550> get<00:02:15.820> rid<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.030> these<00:02:16.330> stickers

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
to do is get rid of these stickers

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.620 
to do is get rid of these stickers
because<00:02:17.830> they<00:02:18.160> make<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.490> thing<00:02:18.730> look<00:02:18.760> very

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
because they make the thing look very

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.430 
because they make the thing look very

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
will have it up at an angle so it looks

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
will have it up at an angle so it looks
like

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
like that that's for some reason I

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.060 
like that that's for some reason I
really<00:06:15.420> like<00:06:15.540> it<00:06:15.840> when<00:06:15.930> cars<00:06:16.230> have<00:06:16.590> the<00:06:16.830> Sun

the<00:06:46.560> under<00:06:46.980> glow<00:06:47.250> I<00:06:47.580> might<00:06:48.210> tap<00:06:48.540> into<00:06:49.140> the

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
the under glow I might tap into the

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.640 
the under glow I might tap into the
car's<00:06:50.420> headlights<00:06:51.420> and<00:06:51.870> put<00:06:52.410> those

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
car's headlights and put those

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.050 
car's headlights and put those
underneath<00:06:53.190> have<00:06:54.180> those<00:06:54.450> wired<00:06:54.780> up<00:06:55.080> and<00:06:56.060> see

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.500 

that's<00:07:03.240> pretty<00:07:03.780> much<00:07:04.200> it<00:07:04.560> because<00:07:05.400> I<00:07:06.030> think

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:06.510 
that's pretty much it because I think

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.750 
that's pretty much it because I think
with<00:07:06.900> all<00:07:07.080> those<00:07:07.200> few<00:07:07.500> modifications<00:07:07.830> if<00:07:08.610> I

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:08.760 
with all those few modifications if I

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.580 
with all those few modifications if I
pull<00:07:09.030> them<00:07:09.240> off<00:07:09.390> right<00:07:09.690> this<00:07:10.110> car<00:07:10.350> will<00:07:10.560> be

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
pull them off right this car will be

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.710 
pull them off right this car will be
worth<00:07:11.010> a<00:07:11.190> lot<00:07:11.370> more<00:07:11.430> money<00:07:11.820> than<00:07:12.150> it<00:07:12.330> is<00:07:12.510> right

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 
worth a lot more money than it is right

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.020 
worth a lot more money than it is right
now<00:07:12.780> however<00:07:13.620> if<00:07:13.920> I<00:07:14.040> pull<00:07:14.310> them<00:07:14.430> off<00:07:14.670> wrong

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:15.030 
now however if I pull them off wrong

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.200 
now however if I pull them off wrong
well<00:07:15.690> the<00:07:16.620> car's<00:07:16.860> value<00:07:17.010> will<00:07:17.520> probably<00:07:18.000> go
