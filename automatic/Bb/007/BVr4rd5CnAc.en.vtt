00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.259
 and 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.330
 hello everyone how is today 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.400
 I hope you are very welcome 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.770
 once again to my channel I am also 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.720
 man and today we are going to talk about a topic 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.239
 which for many is a problem and 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.710
 it's definitely the frizz those 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.419
 dangers that of the more stopping 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.730
 slowly when we have the hair 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.739
 loose when we do not have a good tail 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.270
 that we are going to fight today then where 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.219
 come together I hope you like it very much 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.079
 this video remember that you can 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.079
 follow on my social networks on facebook 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.490
 and instagram and obviously that can 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.410
 visit my blog www some point of 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.800
 Puntocom fashion compass let's go to 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.760
 start first and most important 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.010
 It is definitely to use a protector 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.680
 of heat I know that many of us 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.810
 we use plates of the world with clamp 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.520
 to make curls and the truth is that 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.890
 this is not very good for our 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.470
 hair but it's definitely a bad 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.900
 necessary then always before using 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.440
 These products use protective 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.660
 hot 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.180
 the second thing is that if for you it is very 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:14.300
 important painting tries to do it 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.160
 with paintings that do not have ammonia and if 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.220
 you are going to do a discoloration 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.750
 I will try coloring is very natural to 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.060
 this because these products 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.830
 chemicals produce many breaks in the 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.020
 hair fibers and are the main 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.020
 cause of price production in several 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.300
 videos I've told you about oil 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.390
 Argan this is good for eyebrows for 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.270
 the eyelashes for the skin and today we're going to 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.429
 talk about the third use here in this video 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.409
 about hair care then the 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.090
 Alan oil is great because 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.579
 allows all hair fibers 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.079
 from javi closes very well and that 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.270
 in addition it also becomes a 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.880
 heat protector then the idea is 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.829
 use it before and if possible after 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.929
 to do as a hairstyle we use 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.880
 implements that contain heat that 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.219
 can burst a lot of the fibers of the 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.380
 hair and try that if we do not go to 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:06.170
 use these implements without using 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.149
 more or less day with half a small 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.039
 droplets of argan oil and apply it 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.310
 very well in all the hair so that 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.349
 be much brighter and with more life 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.110
 the fourth style is that roughly two 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.120
 times a week three flowers the leather 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.739
 scalp then how do we make a 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.019
 population of the game must 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.519
 brush several times a day to 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.319
 that all the cells that the 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.200
 brush let's eliminate the dead cells 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.239
 you have in your hair and also not 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.220
 only remove crisis but that is also going to 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.900
 allow user to look much more 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.150
 bright that is much faster 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.670
 because obviously the wave stimulates 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.260
 constantly and it will be very helpful 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.080
 so that the hair looks very much 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.540
 brightest the next advice very 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.549
 important is when we go to buy the 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.040
 conditioner shampoo the theme for 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.290
 combing of all these products that we 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.970
 offers the market look very well that the 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.269
 base of these products advertise 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.760
 alcohols or subscribed shoes this 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.290
 it can not sound very weird very outlandish 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.909
 but really in the back 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.519
 you can find all those 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.840
 ingredients these products can not 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.079
 be very good because they have a 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.459
 Minisuper good in hair promises 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.159
 that will create much brighter what 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.780
 that is a thousand things but really these 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.790
 ingredients the cyclical of them is 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.400
 weaken a bit and obviously it will be 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.379
 much harder in exchange for this 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.959
 try to use accessories and products 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:29.329
 of beauty that are made of bases 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.829
 natural and that also contain a 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.720
 good amount of double vera because 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.909
 really this is great for the 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.950
 head and finally before you start 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.750
 talking about hair masks is very 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.750
 important that they try to cut the 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.489
 hair every six or eight weeks because 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.620
 that's going to allow the cells of the 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:47.590
 hair is regenerated physical also grow 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.900
 much more beautiful 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.410
 it's super easy the only thing we're going to 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.989
 need is half avocado and one 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.900
 spoonful of mayonnaise then let's 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.730
 marinate well the placated we can 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.650
 illustrate with mayonnaise until 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.030
 let's have a homogeneous mixture 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.040
 You have to practice selling them to tips 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:13.049
 we can do this at night and what 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.049
 we leave applied to the other soul 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.970
 for the next mask you're going to 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.640
 you need ripe banana you're going to 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:25.480
 macerate very well and you will mix it with 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:28.690
 sunflower oil you will also add 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.240
 lemon juice and this mask you're going to 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.940
 apply from means to points you will 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.800
 leave applied for 40 minutes and if 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.170
 you want you can wrap your hair in 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.200
 a towel so that it penetrates better the 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.270
 mix to finish two tips milestones 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.340
 fast the first is that when you see 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.890
 that your hair is very fluffy 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.080
 you just wash it normally but at 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:53.020
 final the last game is going to do with 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.330
 This beer is rich in malt and hops 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.470
 that contain proteins that are created 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.470
 repair damaged hair 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.020
 Finally, if you are one of those who let it dry 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.510
 Natural hair I recommend you 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.940
 that you use a cream to comb and that 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.980
 after that apply a little water 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.810
 with gas in your hair is to eliminate the 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.470
 prix and it will make your hair look a lot 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.470
 more appeased 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.060
