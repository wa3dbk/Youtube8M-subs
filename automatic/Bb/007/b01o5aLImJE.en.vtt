and<00:01:13.869> some<00:01:14.869> of<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.020> little<00:01:15.229> details<00:01:15.920> is<00:01:16.340> still

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
and some of the little details is still

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.899 
and some of the little details is still
on<00:01:16.759> it<00:01:16.909> it's<00:01:17.060> a<00:01:17.150> little<00:01:17.710> red<00:01:18.740> I<00:01:19.070> know<00:01:19.700> it's

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
on it it's a little red I know it's

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.600 
on it it's a little red I know it's
anodized<00:01:20.390> or<00:01:20.600> whatever<00:01:20.979> they<00:01:21.979> did<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.610> vent

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
anodized or whatever they did the vent

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.429 
anodized or whatever they did the vent
they<00:01:25.610> also<00:01:25.820> did<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:27.259> choke<00:01:27.670> and<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:29.030> fuel<00:01:29.439> and

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
they also did the choke and the fuel and

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.270 
they also did the choke and the fuel and
even<00:01:30.890> inside<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.759> little<00:01:31.939> pull<00:01:32.180> handle<00:01:33.250> so<00:01:34.250> I

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
even inside the little pull handle so I

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.160 
even inside the little pull handle so I
thought<00:01:34.490> that<00:01:34.640> was<00:01:34.729> kind<00:01:34.970> of<00:01:35.030> unique<00:01:35.180> and<00:01:35.630> this

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
thought that was kind of unique and this

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.100 
thought that was kind of unique and this
outboard<00:01:37.040> here<00:01:37.460> also<00:01:38.920> has<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:39.950> little<00:01:41.110> cable

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
outboard here also has a little cable

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.889 
outboard here also has a little cable
instead<00:01:42.860> of<00:01:42.920> a<00:01:43.220> rope<00:01:44.149> pulled<00:01:44.420> or<00:01:44.540> whatever

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
instead of a rope pulled or whatever

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.069 
instead of a rope pulled or whatever
seems<00:01:45.200> like<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.560> lasts<00:01:45.799> a<00:01:45.920> lot<00:01:46.040> longer

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
seems like it lasts a lot longer

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.950 
seems like it lasts a lot longer
so<00:01:48.079> it's<00:01:49.070> a<00:01:49.189> very<00:01:49.430> nice<00:01:49.610> little<00:01:49.939> Mercury<00:01:50.719> Comet

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
so it's a very nice little Mercury Comet

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.139 
so it's a very nice little Mercury Comet
and<00:01:53.320> we're<00:01:54.320> going<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.680> try<00:01:55.399> to<00:01:55.460> start<00:01:55.850> it<00:01:55.939> like

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
and we're going to try to start it like

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.050

slot<00:02:46.230> in<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.939> that<00:02:47.939> thing<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.329> should<00:02:48.540> be

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
slot in it that thing that should be

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.659 
slot in it that thing that should be
access<00:02:49.230> from<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.500> outside<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.250> panel

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:50.669 
access from the outside of the panel

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:53.300 
access from the outside of the panel
very<00:02:50.849> hard<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.239> get<00:02:51.389> to<00:02:51.599> and<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.769> lower<00:02:52.950> one<00:02:53.069> is

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
very hard to get to and the lower one is

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.210 
very hard to get to and the lower one is
right<00:02:53.609> there<00:02:53.849> at<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.060> high<00:02:54.209> speed<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.950> see<00:02:55.980> it

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
right there at the high speed you see it

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.800 
right there at the high speed you see it
at<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.370> bottom<00:02:56.609> of<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:56.879> pictures<00:02:57.269> those<00:02:57.450> do

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
at the bottom of the pictures those do

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.360 
at the bottom of the pictures those do
need<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.139> be<00:02:58.260> adjusted<00:02:59.209> really<00:03:00.209> nice<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:01.370> if

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
need to be adjusted really nice and if

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.159 
need to be adjusted really nice and if
you<00:03:02.579> don't<00:03:02.849> that<00:03:03.120> you<00:03:03.180> can<00:03:03.569> be<00:03:03.750> adjusted<00:03:04.079> with

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:04.169 
you don't that you can be adjusted with

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:05.750 
you don't that you can be adjusted with
the<00:03:04.200> cover<00:03:04.500> on<00:03:04.620> but<00:03:04.919> it's<00:03:05.040> pretty<00:03:05.159> hard<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.579> do

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the cover on but it's pretty hard to do

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.659 
the cover on but it's pretty hard to do
so<00:03:06.500> there's<00:03:07.500> another<00:03:07.590> little<00:03:08.010> feature<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.459> I

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:08.669 
so there's another little feature that I

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.720 
so there's another little feature that I
have<00:03:08.790> never<00:03:08.969> seen<00:03:09.299> on<00:03:09.480> any<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.930> outboards

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
have never seen on any of the outboards

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.569 
have never seen on any of the outboards
little<00:03:11.730> mercury<00:03:11.939> has<00:03:12.269> a<00:03:12.500> little<00:03:13.500> rubber<00:03:14.340> seal

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
little mercury has a little rubber seal

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.059 
little mercury has a little rubber seal
around<00:03:14.879> the<00:03:15.150> spark<00:03:16.079> plug<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.590> a<00:03:16.680> boat<00:03:16.829> and

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
around the spark plug and a boat and

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.719 
around the spark plug and a boat and
this<00:03:17.189> boot<00:03:17.400> snaps<00:03:17.909> into<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.479> seal<00:03:19.400> so<00:03:20.400> this<00:03:20.579> is

00:03:20.719 --> 00:03:20.729 
this boot snaps into the seal so this is

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:22.759 
this boot snaps into the seal so this is
completely<00:03:21.560> waterproofed

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
completely waterproofed

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.390 
completely waterproofed
so<00:03:23.959> you<00:03:24.959> see<00:03:25.109> this<00:03:25.290> little<00:03:25.349> this<00:03:26.340> little

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
so you see this little this little

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.069 
so you see this little this little
outboard<00:03:27.260> the<00:03:28.260> agent<00:03:28.739> hasn't<00:03:29.190> been<00:03:29.310> painted

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
outboard the agent hasn't been painted

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.509 
outboard the agent hasn't been painted
just<00:03:31.079> been<00:03:31.290> cleaned<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:31.859> it's<00:03:32.069> very<00:03:32.939> low<00:03:33.359> our

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
just been cleaned so it's very low our

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.569 
just been cleaned so it's very low our
little<00:03:35.519> motor<00:03:35.699> and<00:03:36.569> I'm<00:03:36.810> gonna<00:03:36.989> go<00:03:37.169> ahead<00:03:37.260> and

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
little motor and I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.710 
little motor and I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
and then we'll run it for a little bit

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.429 
and then we'll run it for a little bit
all<00:03:45.930> right

all right

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.969 
all right
mercury<00:03:47.400> put<00:03:47.579> back<00:03:47.729> together<00:03:48.590> then<00:03:49.590> open<00:03:49.919> the

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.330 

seems<00:04:23.920> like<00:04:24.070> inside

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:26.909 

it

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.820 

all<00:05:27.919> right<00:05:28.900> now<00:05:29.900> we're<00:05:30.169> gonna<00:05:30.259> go<00:05:30.530> ahead<00:05:30.620> and

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
all right now we're gonna go ahead and

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.059 
all right now we're gonna go ahead and
run<00:05:31.009> it<00:05:31.039> out<00:05:31.310> of<00:05:31.520> gas<00:05:32.330> so<00:05:33.020> the<00:05:33.199> fuel<00:05:33.770> won't<00:05:33.919> be

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:34.069 
run it out of gas so the fuel won't be

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:37.089 
run it out of gas so the fuel won't be
in<00:05:34.250> the<00:05:34.990> and<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.110> carburetor<00:05:36.410> when<00:05:36.710> we<00:05:36.830> store

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
in the and the carburetor when we store

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:38.559 
in the and the carburetor when we store
it<00:05:37.250> so<00:05:37.490> we're<00:05:37.610> gonna<00:05:37.699> go<00:05:37.789> ahead<00:05:37.970> and<00:05:38.180> close<00:05:38.389> the

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:38.569 
it so we're gonna go ahead and close the

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:46.089 
it so we're gonna go ahead and close the
fuel<00:05:38.750> close<00:05:39.560> the<00:05:39.710> vent<00:05:42.009> like<00:05:43.009> so<00:05:44.949> I'll<00:05:45.949> go

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:46.099 
fuel close the vent like so I'll go

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:53.210 
fuel close the vent like so I'll go
ahead<00:05:46.130> and<00:05:46.430> put<00:05:46.520> her<00:05:46.610> in<00:05:46.729> start<00:05:47.060> again<00:05:47.360> and

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.530 

I'm<00:05:53.280> gonna<00:05:53.430> go<00:05:53.610> ahead<00:05:53.760> and<00:05:53.850> run<00:05:53.970> the<00:05:54.090> fuel<00:05:54.270> out

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
I'm gonna go ahead and run the fuel out

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.910 
I'm gonna go ahead and run the fuel out
of<00:05:54.630> the<00:05:54.690> car

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.780 

is<00:05:56.980> a<00:05:57.160> good<00:05:57.340> idea<00:05:57.520> on<00:05:57.910> most<00:05:58.180> engines<00:05:58.600> because

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:08.960 

filled<00:06:02.390> up<00:06:02.540> in<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:02.720> carburetor

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:14.639 

barking<00:06:09.600> right<00:06:09.750> for<00:06:10.020> a<00:06:10.050> second
