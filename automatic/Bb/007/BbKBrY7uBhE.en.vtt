00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.929
 of course click here 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:23.369
 the burnt offering is so 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.369
 without presenting a credit risk 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.979
 I do not understand that the study brings a year without power is an end 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.520
 We're trying to take advantage of anyone's entrance. 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.860
 Marcos 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.929
 and got 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:44.490
 another point we should make 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.490
 7 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.530
 another complaint is good 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.570
 what is missing after disagreeing in this even higher form of the podium 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.010
 one of the missions 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.040
 click here 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.550
 no one can deny 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.590
 still more at a time when it goes beyond this 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.390
 I gave the people help bridle 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.460
 before the maneuvers 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.740
 the other man 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.050
 earlier this month 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.460
 we lost 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.950
 the referee scored a penalty 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.350
 ready to get more details on the case 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.970
 at the end of the year 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.970
 I'm not going ahead. 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.040
 we have better 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.480
 My son, we're getting better. 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.480
 the ousted president 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.740
 mixed teams guess what country this is on the bottom of the table does not 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.320
 I know how he did not report on the latest action may 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.520
 rescue or kill anyone
