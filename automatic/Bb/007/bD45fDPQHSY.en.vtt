00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:03.280 
hi today I'm going to teach you how to

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.230 
hi today I'm going to teach you how to
replace<00:00:03.580> chain<00:00:04.540> on<00:00:04.810> a<00:00:04.870> bicycle<00:00:06.060> first<00:00:07.060> thing

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.240 
replace chain on a bicycle first thing

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.910 
replace chain on a bicycle first thing
we<00:00:07.330> need<00:00:07.450> to<00:00:07.479> check<00:00:07.720> if<00:00:08.050> the<00:00:08.109> chain<00:00:08.680> is

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:08.920 
we need to check if the chain is

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.470 
we need to check if the chain is
stretched<00:00:09.160> or<00:00:09.460> not<00:00:09.580> do<00:00:09.880> we<00:00:10.000> need<00:00:10.120> to<00:00:10.210> replace

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
stretched or not do we need to replace

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.380 
stretched or not do we need to replace
this<00:00:10.690> chain<00:00:10.960> I'm<00:00:11.830> going<00:00:12.280> to<00:00:12.340> use<00:00:12.490> a<00:00:13.000> quick

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:13.390 
this chain I'm going to use a quick

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.980 
this chain I'm going to use a quick
check<00:00:13.690> to<00:00:13.840> do<00:00:13.960> this<00:00:15.090> so<00:00:16.090> put<00:00:16.390> it<00:00:16.480> into<00:00:16.720> a<00:00:16.750> roller

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
check to do this so put it into a roller

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.470 
check to do this so put it into a roller
like<00:00:17.230> this<00:00:17.439> and<00:00:17.740> if<00:00:18.519> it<00:00:18.609> drops<00:00:18.849> through<00:00:18.970> the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
like this and if it drops through the

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.970 
like this and if it drops through the
other<00:00:19.630> roller<00:00:19.900> that<00:00:20.289> means<00:00:20.499> your<00:00:20.650> chain<00:00:20.859> is

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
other roller that means your chain is

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.980 
other roller that means your chain is
stretched<00:00:21.160> I'm<00:00:22.150> going<00:00:22.660> to<00:00:22.720> double<00:00:22.960> check

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
stretched I'm going to double check

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.810 
stretched I'm going to double check
though<00:00:23.349> with<00:00:23.529> a<00:00:23.560> digital<00:00:24.039> checker<00:00:24.369> just<00:00:24.730> to

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
though with a digital checker just to

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.329 
though with a digital checker just to
make<00:00:24.970> sure<00:00:24.999> so<00:00:25.919> squeeze<00:00:26.919> your<00:00:27.070> digital

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:27.339 
make sure so squeeze your digital

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:31.259 
make sure so squeeze your digital
checker<00:00:28.109> press<00:00:29.109> zero<00:00:29.730> while<00:00:30.730> you're<00:00:30.939> still

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
checker press zero while you're still

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.069 
checker press zero while you're still
holding<00:00:31.509> it<00:00:31.890> put<00:00:32.890> it<00:00:32.980> into<00:00:33.280> a<00:00:33.310> roller<00:00:33.579> and<00:00:34.079> then

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
holding it put it into a roller and then

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.220 
holding it put it into a roller and then
drop<00:00:35.350> it<00:00:35.500> in<00:00:35.940> now<00:00:36.940> it<00:00:37.120> says<00:00:37.359> that<00:00:37.390> it's<00:00:37.750> over

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
drop it in now it says that it's over

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.509 
drop it in now it says that it's over
point<00:00:38.500> eight<00:00:38.620> which<00:00:38.770> means<00:00:38.829> that<00:00:39.219> we<00:00:39.280> need<00:00:39.399> to

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
point eight which means that we need to

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:41.729 
point eight which means that we need to
replace<00:00:39.789> this<00:00:40.030> chain<00:00:40.329> so<00:00:40.600> I<00:00:40.989> need<00:00:41.289> to<00:00:41.410> find<00:00:41.620> it

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
replace this chain so I need to find it

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:48.990 
replace this chain so I need to find it
first<00:00:41.980> find<00:00:42.280> my<00:00:42.430> missing<00:00:42.640> link<00:00:43.030> and<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.879> is

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
first find my missing link and this is

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.880 
first find my missing link and this is
what<00:00:49.120> we<00:00:49.210> need<00:00:49.359> to<00:00:49.449> take<00:00:49.629> out<00:00:49.809> here<00:00:49.989> so<00:00:50.590> first

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
what we need to take out here so first

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.049 
what we need to take out here so first
you<00:00:51.039> can<00:00:51.160> use<00:00:51.190> any<00:00:51.460> piece<00:00:51.670> of<00:00:51.820> wire<00:00:52.030> that's

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
you can use any piece of wire that's

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:58.020 
you can use any piece of wire that's
just<00:00:52.570> bent<00:00:52.809> up<00:00:55.140> put<00:00:56.140> it<00:00:56.230> into<00:00:56.469> a<00:00:56.500> link<00:00:56.800> and<00:00:57.039> then

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
just bent up put it into a link and then

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.360 
just bent up put it into a link and then
stretch<00:00:58.359> it<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:59.440> you<00:00:59.499> can<00:00:59.710> see<00:00:59.920> that<00:01:00.070> we've<00:01:00.190> got

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
stretch it so you can see that we've got

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.040 
stretch it so you can see that we've got
some<00:01:00.429> slack<00:01:00.940> here<00:01:01.210> it's<00:01:01.480> easier<00:01:01.780> to<00:01:01.870> work<00:01:01.989> with

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
some slack here it's easier to work with

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.100 
some slack here it's easier to work with
the<00:01:02.379> link<00:01:02.859> that<00:01:03.070> way

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the link that way

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.359 
the link that way
take<00:01:05.110> your<00:01:05.670> opening<00:01:06.670> pliers<00:01:08.100> put<00:01:09.100> them<00:01:09.220> into

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
take your opening pliers put them into

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.569 
take your opening pliers put them into
the<00:01:09.579> chain<00:01:10.350> squeeze<00:01:11.350> both<00:01:11.619> sides<00:01:11.979> so<00:01:12.549> you

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
the chain squeeze both sides so you

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:15.090 
the chain squeeze both sides so you
don't<00:01:12.790> damage<00:01:13.000> it<00:01:13.299> and<00:01:13.509> then<00:01:14.110> squeeze

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
don't damage it and then squeeze

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.850 
don't damage it and then squeeze
together

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.780 

then<00:01:19.400> I<00:01:19.520> can<00:01:19.700> take<00:01:19.880> apart<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.270> missing<00:01:20.570> link

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
then I can take apart the missing link

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.040 
then I can take apart the missing link
then<00:01:22.790> remove<00:01:23.180> your<00:01:23.210> missing<00:01:23.600> link<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:23.960> we<00:01:24.020> can

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
then remove your missing link and we can

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.390 
then remove your missing link and we can
get<00:01:24.290> rid<00:01:24.410> of<00:01:24.470> this<00:01:24.590> one<00:01:24.770> because<00:01:25.100> you<00:01:25.220> should

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
get rid of this one because you should

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.590 
get rid of this one because you should
always<00:01:25.520> use<00:01:25.640> a<00:01:25.790> new<00:01:25.880> missing<00:01:26.270> link<00:01:26.450> within

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
always use a new missing link within

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.830 
always use a new missing link within
your<00:01:26.720> chain<00:01:27.340> now<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.400> release<00:01:28.850> your<00:01:29.300> tensioner

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
your chain now to release your tensioner

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.800 
your chain now to release your tensioner
just<00:01:30.590> hold<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.490> rear<00:01:31.910> derailleur<00:01:32.090> put<00:01:32.780> a

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
just hold the rear derailleur put a

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.420 
just hold the rear derailleur put a
little<00:01:32.990> pressure<00:01:33.200> on<00:01:33.410> it<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:33.770> it'll<00:01:34.220> fall<00:01:34.370> off

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
little pressure on it and it'll fall off

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.520 
little pressure on it and it'll fall off
be<00:01:35.390> careful<00:01:35.780> when<00:01:35.900> you<00:01:35.990> pull<00:01:36.170> up<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.410> rear

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
be careful when you pull up the rear

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.870 
be careful when you pull up the rear
derailleur<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.160> your<00:01:37.280> chain<00:01:37.490> doesn't<00:01:37.760> come

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
derailleur so your chain doesn't come

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.380 
derailleur so your chain doesn't come
off<00:01:38.000> too<00:01:38.180> quickly<00:01:38.420> now<00:01:42.160> to<00:01:43.160> remove<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.820> chain

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
off too quickly now to remove the chain

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.510 
off too quickly now to remove the chain
take<00:01:45.170> it<00:01:45.290> off<00:01:45.380> from<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.680> back<00:01:45.860> it's<00:01:46.250> easiest

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
take it off from the back it's easiest

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.550 
take it off from the back it's easiest
that<00:01:46.729> way<00:01:46.940> and<00:01:47.150> make<00:01:47.750> sure<00:01:47.900> to<00:01:48.020> hold<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.350> chain

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
that way and make sure to hold the chain

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.960 
that way and make sure to hold the chain
up<00:01:48.710> because<00:01:48.979> you<00:01:49.070> don't<00:01:49.100> want<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.400> ruin<00:01:49.550> your

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
up because you don't want to ruin your

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.719 
up because you don't want to ruin your
rear<00:01:50.450> chain<00:01:50.720> stay<00:01:54.040> now<00:01:55.040> we<00:01:55.100> need<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.430> make<00:01:55.580> sure

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
rear chain stay now we need to make sure

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.350 
rear chain stay now we need to make sure
that<00:01:55.880> our<00:01:56.030> new<00:01:56.150> chain<00:01:56.450> is<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:58.280> same<00:01:58.610> length<00:01:59.150> as

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
that our new chain is the same length as

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:08.949 
that our new chain is the same length as
our<00:01:59.509> old<00:01:59.660> chain<00:02:00.280> so<00:02:01.360> we'll<00:02:02.360> hold<00:02:02.509> both<00:02:02.690> up<00:02:07.959> and

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
our old chain so we'll hold both up and

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.180 
our old chain so we'll hold both up and
it<00:02:09.020> looks<00:02:09.200> like<00:02:09.259> our<00:02:09.440> new<00:02:09.590> chains<00:02:09.860> a<00:02:09.979> little

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
it looks like our new chains a little

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.610 
it looks like our new chains a little
bit<00:02:10.340> longer<00:02:10.550> so<00:02:10.880> we<00:02:11.090> need<00:02:11.239> to<00:02:11.330> cut<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:12.050> new

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
bit longer so we need to cut the new

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.590 
bit longer so we need to cut the new
chain<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:13.459> fit<00:02:15.700> first<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:16.940> need<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.120> make<00:02:17.239> sure

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
chain to fit first you need to make sure

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.570 
chain to fit first you need to make sure
that<00:02:17.810> your<00:02:17.989> Riveter<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:18.680> your<00:02:19.040> locking<00:02:19.400> nut

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
that your Riveter and your locking nut

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:27.300

are<00:02:19.820> both<00:02:19.970> out

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.210 

with<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.430> chain<00:02:28.640> in

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.760 

then<00:02:33.780> tighten<00:02:34.780> your<00:02:34.990> locking<00:02:35.320> nut

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.470
