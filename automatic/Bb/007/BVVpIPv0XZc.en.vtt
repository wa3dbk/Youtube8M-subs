so<00:01:12.930> basically<00:01:13.290> GM<00:01:14.040> at<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:15.180> point<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.689> 2014

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
so basically GM at this point in 2014

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.350 
so basically GM at this point in 2014
has<00:01:16.770> 29<00:01:17.580> recalls<00:01:19.580> this<00:01:20.580> year<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.210> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
this year so that was like paying a

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.300 
this year so that was like paying a
parking<00:02:03.000> fine<00:02:03.210> as<00:02:03.479> one<00:02:03.689> lawmaker<00:02:04.049> put<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.530> and

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
parking fine as one lawmaker put it and

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.809 
parking fine as one lawmaker put it and
the<00:02:05.700> issue<00:02:05.909> was<00:02:06.360> over<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:07.469> ignition<00:02:08.399> switch

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
the issue was over this ignition switch

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.830 
the issue was over this ignition switch
flaw<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.660> apparently<00:02:10.349> the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
flaw and apparently the

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.559 
flaw and apparently the
new<00:02:11.110> of<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.620> ignition<00:02:12.069> switch<00:02:12.220> flaw<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.940> decade

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
new of the ignition switch flaw a decade

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.920 
new of the ignition switch flaw a decade
prior<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.530> actually<00:02:15.420> acknowledging<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.540> right

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
prior to actually acknowledging it right

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.530 
prior to actually acknowledging it right
and<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:17.739> they<00:02:18.130> didn't<00:02:18.489> do<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.610> recall<00:02:19.060> when<00:02:19.420> they

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
and so they didn't do a recall when they

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.089 
and so they didn't do a recall when they
found<00:02:19.750> out<00:02:19.870> that<00:02:19.989> this<00:02:20.110> flaw<00:02:20.380> happened<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:21.010> as

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
found out that this flaw happened and as

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.760 
found out that this flaw happened and as
a<00:02:21.160> result<00:02:21.580> there<00:02:22.300> were<00:02:22.420> 13<00:02:22.900> deaths<00:02:23.200> the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
a result there were 13 deaths the

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.589 
a result there were 13 deaths the
ignition<00:02:24.130> would<00:02:24.280> switch<00:02:24.550> off<00:02:24.730> which<00:02:25.300> meant

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
ignition would switch off which meant

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.270 
ignition would switch off which meant
that<00:02:25.690> their<00:02:26.110> power<00:02:26.349> steering<00:02:26.860> would<00:02:26.980> go<00:02:27.130> out

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
that their power steering would go out

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.770 
that their power steering would go out
their<00:02:27.519> brakes<00:02:27.760> would<00:02:27.940> go<00:02:28.120> out<00:02:28.300> airbags

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
their brakes would go out airbags

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.970 
their brakes would go out airbags
wouldn't<00:02:29.080> work<00:02:29.230> when<00:02:29.410> they<00:02:29.500> crashed<00:02:29.769> their

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
wouldn't work when they crashed their

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.440 
wouldn't work when they crashed their
airbags<00:02:30.400> wouldn't<00:02:30.730> work<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:31.090> mean<00:02:31.239> that's<00:02:31.390> a

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
airbags wouldn't work I mean that's a

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.940 
airbags wouldn't work I mean that's a
complete<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:31.930> utter<00:02:31.959> disaster<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.739> for<00:02:32.920> a

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
complete and utter disaster and for a

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.589 
complete and utter disaster and for a
company<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.580> know<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:33.940> this<00:02:34.030> was<00:02:34.209> going<00:02:34.450> on

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
company to know that this was going on

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.350 
company to know that this was going on
for<00:02:34.870> ten<00:02:35.290> years<00:02:36.069> and<00:02:36.340> they<00:02:36.760> didn't<00:02:37.120> do<00:02:37.209> the

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
for ten years and they didn't do the

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.809 
for ten years and they didn't do the
recall<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:38.019> absolutely<00:02:38.709> egregious<00:02:39.280> and<00:02:39.459> then

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
recall is absolutely egregious and then

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.360 
recall is absolutely egregious and then

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.540 
we see what the result success is every
company<00:05:18.379> this<00:05:18.560> is<00:05:18.680> not<00:05:18.860> just<00:05:19.159> germane<00:05:19.520> to

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
company this is not just germane to

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.010 
company this is not just germane to
General<00:05:20.120> Motors<00:05:20.240> it<00:05:20.599> might<00:05:20.750> just<00:05:20.930> be

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
General Motors it might just be

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.570 
General Motors it might just be
happening<00:05:21.469> a<00:05:21.560> little<00:05:21.680> harder<00:05:22.129> at<00:05:22.250> General

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
happening a little harder at General

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.040 
happening a little harder at General
Motors<00:05:22.699> because<00:05:23.389> they<00:05:23.539> were<00:05:23.629> under<00:05:23.779> such

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
Motors because they were under such

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.409 
Motors because they were under such
pressure<00:05:24.080> to<00:05:24.529> be<00:05:24.710> profitable<00:05:25.340> at<00:05:25.819> that<00:05:26.150> time

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
pressure to be profitable at that time

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:27.909 
pressure to be profitable at that time
because<00:05:26.719> they<00:05:26.900> were<00:05:26.960> bankrupt<00:05:27.590> they<00:05:27.710> were

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
because they were bankrupt they were

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.860 
because they were bankrupt they were
getting<00:05:28.129> so<00:05:28.219> maybe<00:05:28.460> but<00:05:28.879> you<00:05:29.060> know<00:05:29.180> the<00:05:29.389> Toyota

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
getting so maybe but you know the Toyota

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.300 
getting so maybe but you know the Toyota
just<00:05:30.229> had<00:05:30.349> the<00:05:30.440> same<00:05:30.680> thing<00:05:30.919> they<00:05:31.129> weren't

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
just had the same thing they weren't

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.749 
just had the same thing they weren't
recalling<00:05:31.879> they<00:05:32.259> they<00:05:33.259> had<00:05:33.759> accelerators

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 
recalling they they had accelerators

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:36.820 
recalling they they had accelerators
that<00:05:34.909> would<00:05:35.029> stick<00:05:35.300> right<00:05:35.599> and<00:05:35.960> all<00:05:36.110> about<00:05:36.379> so

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:36.830

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.680 
that would stick right and all about so
I<00:05:36.860> mean<00:05:37.190> it<00:05:37.310> this<00:05:37.490> isn't<00:05:37.879> just<00:05:38.210> this<00:05:38.449> is

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690
