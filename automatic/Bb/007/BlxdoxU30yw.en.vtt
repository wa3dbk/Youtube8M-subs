00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:22.970 
without stru from the drum department
I'm<00:00:02.879> going<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.060> show<00:00:03.210> you<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.330> groove<00:00:03.570> here<00:00:21.980> so

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
I'm going to show you a groove here so

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.340 
I'm going to show you a groove here so
the<00:00:23.160> groove<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.150> based<00:00:24.390> around<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.869> inverted

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
the groove is based around the inverted

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.290 
the groove is based around the inverted
double<00:00:25.650> for<00:00:25.949> events<00:00:26.340> just<00:00:28.130> it's<00:00:29.130> not<00:00:29.580> exactly

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
double for events just it's not exactly

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.939 
double for events just it's not exactly
what<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:30.599> but<00:00:30.779> based<00:00:31.380> around<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.800> whole

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
what I do but based around the whole

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.250 
what I do but based around the whole
idea<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:33.090> basically<00:00:33.450> two<00:00:33.690> parts<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
idea it's basically two parts and the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.650 
idea it's basically two parts and the
first<00:00:34.290> part<00:00:34.620> uses<00:00:35.280> an<00:00:35.489> inverted<00:00:36.360> double

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
first part uses an inverted double

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.069 
first part uses an inverted double
between<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.230> kick<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.820> hi-hat<00:00:39.079> and

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
between the kick and the hi-hat and

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:55.549 
between the kick and the hi-hat and
sounds<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:53.930> second<00:00:54.930> part<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.320> is

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
sounds like this second part of it is

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:27.530 
sounds like this second part of it is
triple<00:00:56.370> a<00:01:23.420> we<00:01:24.420> talk<00:01:25.380> about<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.119> playing<00:01:27.119> the
