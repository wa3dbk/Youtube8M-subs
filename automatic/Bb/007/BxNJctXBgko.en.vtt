00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.200
 ferry hello 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.519
 hello in 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.570
 my doctor 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.109
 open ground hide and seek but cover them 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.980
 nonwoven we put the arc 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.770
 parthenocarpic take varieties 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.810
 but I just can not remember and understand 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:34.129
 how to form a whip 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:36.899
 you could skate a little bit well 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:41.789
 plant what parthenocarpic in 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.860
 principle for open field it can 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.989
 to be not so relevant after all in 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.000
 I recommended more outdoors 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.280
 would plant hybrids but still 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.960
 bee pollinated why because 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.540
 bee pollinated all the same in my opinion 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.370
 they seem to be somewhat tastier and they 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.329
 pass normally and pollination by insects 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.850
 and tie cucumbers more like 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.899
 the correct form of ashta when to plant 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.210
 parthenocarpic so of course it is good 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:15.000
 eat insects or not you'll always be 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.469
 with the harvest but not infrequently 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.560
 twisted cucumbers it means somewhere 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:25.619
 insects worked and turned out not like 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.670
 would be dusting itself processing by insects and 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:33.240
 sometimes there are not exactly smooth fruits 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.229
 so general, well, maybe better 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.659
 all the same 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.909
 cucumbers that are pee-pollinated though 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.279
 parthenocarpic too good because 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:46.369
 they give a guaranteed yield when 

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:49.049
 shoulder care but it is important that apparently 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.389
 gardener who called rather 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.149
 she puts down a little thick 

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:57.169
 in general I would recommend cucumbers in 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.380
 open ground as follows 

00:01:57.169 --> 00:02:04.289
 cucumbers too, like any pumpkin 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.360
 cultures they love good 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:10.149
 top dressing they love good nutrition 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.760
 and they are very good unlike for example from 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.620
 the same tomato pepper eggplant applies 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.040
 to the same at the university 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:23.470
 if the bed is well manured but 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:25.600
 usually one square meter one 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.420
 cucumber manure bucket 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.650
 it will do well even sometimes 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.660
 so you plant cucumbers and the surface 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.709
 mulch manure well, either well or 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.990
 hay but 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.630
 dung is still better because this 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.510
 organic in this case cucumber well 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:48.010
 develops and gives a much larger 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.380
 the harvest than he will give without it for 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.810
 cucumber is very important of course organic 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.540
 much more important than for tomatoes and 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.260
 other crops it should be a gardener 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:03.490
 take into account and in no case thicken 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:07.750
 plants that is necessary to leave 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:10.810
 Well , somewhere planted at 30-40 centimeters 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.530
 one plant about another if 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.640
 a gardener puts seeds in better then 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:22.240
 We put the hole on 3 seeds 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:25.930
 leave then two if planting seedlings 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.870
 tab a1 one pot at a distance 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.060
 about 40 but you can 60 centimeters 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.700
 Again, you need to know depending on what 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.550
 varieties are fighting for how she does 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.650
 gut forces this very and on bed this 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.720
 very good decision in the morning forces 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.000
 they are well developed which 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.920
 advantage of nonwovens 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.710
 nonwovens 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:50.830
 keep warm at the same time protect 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:54.310
 plants do not burn from excessive sun 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.370
 and nonwovens let water through then 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.520
 there is if it rains the cucumber is good 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.310
 water is well developed extra 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.590
 water does not evaporate persists on 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.090
 plants I usually give cucumbers good 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.340
 the harvest therefore 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.790
 the gardener who called in general she 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.480
 doing right but need to watch out for 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.940
 plant density and not allow cucumber 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.100
 outgrowing us called that 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.970
 Parthenocarpic planting means and there 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:28.350
 about 40 50 centimeters are needed 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.300
 all ovaries clean up and only after 40 50 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.780
 centimeters to allow plants 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.930
 develop further 3 extra clean up 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.420
 lateral on the lateral shoulders leave 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.100
 some small amount of herds this 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.190
 same clean but again this is regulated 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.170
 depending on how the plants 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.200
 looks on the garden this is a gardener in 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.170
 in general 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.360
 must decide which one is better and which one 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.700
 volume of cucumbers to grow again 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.730
 she gets them directly on the ground 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.550
 either on and get warm and lets in then on 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.100
 arc after the plant develops 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.930
 it also depends on it and if you let 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.190
 on the arc, you can have a few more 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.290
 thicken because the plant is besides 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:14.180
 the square of which on the ridge takes 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.580
 the area of which depends on top too 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.530
 what city and make aisle 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.600
 the aisle should also be pretty 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.020
 wide to serve normally 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.020
 garden bed
