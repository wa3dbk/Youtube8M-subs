00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.120 

ok<00:01:28.250> so<00:01:28.310> this<00:01:28.640> example<00:01:29.120> contains<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:30.260> little<00:01:31.040> bit

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
ok so this example contains a little bit

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.010 
ok so this example contains a little bit
of<00:01:31.220> an<00:01:31.310> interesting<00:01:31.640> thing<00:01:32.150> is<00:01:32.330> because<00:01:32.810> we

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
of an interesting thing is because we

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.680 
of an interesting thing is because we
have<00:01:33.200> a<00:01:33.310> in<00:01:34.310> some<00:01:34.670> ways<00:01:34.880> like<00:01:35.030> a<00:01:35.090> constant

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
have a in some ways like a constant

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.520 
have a in some ways like a constant
shape<00:01:36.080> that<00:01:36.800> moves<00:01:37.130> up<00:01:37.540> up<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:38.810> guitar<00:01:38.990> and

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
shape that moves up up the guitar and

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.800 
shape that moves up up the guitar and
starts<00:01:40.040> on<00:01:40.190> the<00:01:40.280> bottom<00:01:40.610> two<00:01:40.820> strings<00:01:41.240> right

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
starts on the bottom two strings right

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:50.980 
starts on the bottom two strings right
and<00:01:42.110> your<00:01:42.440> basic<00:01:42.920> shape<00:01:43.220> is<00:01:43.490> this<00:01:49.870> this<00:01:50.870> is

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
and your basic shape is this this is

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.030 
and your basic shape is this this is
what<00:01:51.140> we<00:01:51.230> got<00:01:51.380> going<00:01:51.740> I<00:01:56.410> am<00:01:57.410> starting<00:01:57.920> this

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
what we got going I am starting this

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.640 
what we got going I am starting this
riff<00:01:58.340> with<00:01:58.580> a<00:01:58.640> pool<00:01:58.940> off<00:02:01.990> as<00:02:02.990> you<00:02:03.110> can<00:02:03.290> see<00:02:03.500> the

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
riff with a pool off as you can see the

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.770 
riff with a pool off as you can see the
rest<00:02:03.800> notes<00:02:04.160> are<00:02:04.310> picked<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:05.119> with<00:02:05.300> just<00:02:05.330> the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
rest notes are picked so with just the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:14.620 
rest notes are picked so with just the
first<00:02:06.110> notes<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:10.729> then<00:02:11.150> I<00:02:11.240> pick<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.630> rest

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.020 

I<00:02:16.270> moved<00:02:17.270> the<00:02:17.420> same<00:02:17.750> exact<00:02:18.410> shape<00:02:19.130> up<00:02:19.430> two

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
I moved the same exact shape up two

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.770 
I moved the same exact shape up two
frets<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.690> do<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.020> same<00:02:21.290> exact<00:02:22.070> thing<00:02:25.720> so<00:02:26.720> you

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
frets and do the same exact thing so you

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.740 
frets and do the same exact thing so you
got

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.620 

and<00:02:31.440> then<00:02:32.310> we'll<00:02:32.430> move<00:02:32.550> up<00:02:32.730> into<00:02:32.940> C<00:02:33.240> sharp<00:02:33.480> and

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
and then we'll move up into C sharp and

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
and then we'll move up into C sharp and
italic<00:02:34.050> shapes<00:02:34.490> here's<00:02:35.490> your<00:02:35.550> first<00:02:35.850> one<00:02:39.650> as

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
italic shapes here's your first one as

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.100 
italic shapes here's your first one as
you<00:02:40.800> can<00:02:40.980> see<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.400> same<00:02:41.670> exact<00:02:42.150> motif<00:02:42.690> but

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
you can see is the same exact motif but

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.160 
you can see is the same exact motif but
between<00:02:43.380> strings<00:02:43.950> five<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.520> four<00:02:44.990> will<00:02:45.990> move

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
between strings five and four will move

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:53.240 
between strings five and four will move
it<00:02:46.410> up<00:02:46.560> a<00:02:46.800> set<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.370> strings<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:51.860> then<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:53.070> keep

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
it up a set of strings and then to keep

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.510 
it up a set of strings and then to keep
it<00:02:53.400> in<00:02:53.520> key<00:02:53.820> we<00:02:54.450> kind<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.780> expand<00:02:55.590> instead<00:02:56.490> of

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
it in key we kind of expand instead of

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.120 
it in key we kind of expand instead of
using<00:02:56.820> your<00:02:57.150> third<00:02:57.450> finger<00:02:57.750> we<00:02:58.530> move<00:02:58.770> up<00:02:58.950> the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
using your third finger we move up the

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:06.040 
using your third finger we move up the
shape<00:02:59.400> up<00:02:59.640> to<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.750> pinkie<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.410> we<00:03:01.740> have<00:03:01.920> this

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.840 

okay<00:03:07.050> so<00:03:07.500> this<00:03:07.800> whole<00:03:08.010> little<00:03:08.190> C<00:03:08.550> sharp

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
okay so this whole little C sharp

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:36.219 
there's a tendency of kind of forgetting

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:38.009 
there's a tendency of kind of forgetting
about<00:03:36.280> your<00:03:36.430> last<00:03:36.730> note<00:03:37.030> and<00:03:37.209> jump<00:03:37.689> into<00:03:37.840> the

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
about your last note and jump into the

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.250 
about your last note and jump into the
next<00:03:38.319> position<00:03:39.150> this<00:03:40.150> last<00:03:40.450> rib<00:03:40.689> that<00:03:40.900> we<00:03:41.019> did

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
next position this last rib that we did

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.589 
next position this last rib that we did
in<00:03:41.439> c-sharp<00:03:41.920> minor<00:03:42.430> pentatonic<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:43.359> whole

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 
in c-sharp minor pentatonic the whole

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.720 
in c-sharp minor pentatonic the whole
section<00:03:43.930> could<00:03:44.379> also<00:03:44.829> be<00:03:45.099> thought<00:03:45.340> as<00:03:45.579> AE

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
section could also be thought as AE

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.080 
section could also be thought as AE
major<00:03:46.239> pentatonic<00:03:47.489> both<00:03:48.489> scales<00:03:48.849> have

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
major pentatonic both scales have

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.449 
major pentatonic both scales have
exactly<00:03:49.599> the<00:03:49.689> same<00:03:49.840> notes<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.530> are<00:03:51.040> closely

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
exactly the same notes and are closely

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.020 
exactly the same notes and are closely
related<00:03:52.200> okay<00:03:53.200> for<00:03:53.590> the<00:03:53.709> next<00:03:53.760> example<00:03:54.760> I<00:03:55.000> have

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
related okay for the next example I have

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.780 
related okay for the next example I have
something<00:03:55.420> slightly<00:03:55.840> more<00:03:56.049> challenging<00:03:56.790> week

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
something slightly more challenging week

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.569 
something slightly more challenging week
on<00:03:58.000> this<00:03:58.480> riff<00:03:58.930> contains<00:03:59.530> alternate<00:04:00.340> picking

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
on this riff contains alternate picking

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.780 
down really slow piece by piece the
first<00:04:45.390> section<00:04:46.050> of<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:46.740> riff<00:04:46.950> is<00:04:47.190> an<00:04:47.340> E<00:04:47.580> minor

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
first section of the riff is an E minor

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.840

notes<00:04:51.600> that<00:04:52.140> happen<00:04:52.470> to<00:04:52.650> basically<00:04:53.250> be<00:04:53.490> almost

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
notes that happen to basically be almost

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:03.020 
notes that happen to basically be almost
like<00:04:53.790> chromatics<00:05:01.730> that's<00:05:02.730> the<00:05:02.850> little

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
like chromatics that's the little

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:11.600 
like chromatics that's the little
section<00:05:05.660> very<00:05:06.660> bluesy<00:05:07.020> sounding<00:05:07.530> thing<00:05:10.610> okay

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
that's all there is to it we'll move to

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.610 
that's all there is to it we'll move to
the<00:05:14.340> next<00:05:14.610> section<00:05:15.180> which<00:05:15.420> is<00:05:15.570> an<00:05:15.720> e<00:05:15.990> Phrygian

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
the next section which is an e Phrygian

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.110 
the next section which is an e Phrygian
minor<00:05:17.400> and<00:05:17.870> this<00:05:18.870> contains<00:05:19.470> a<00:05:19.880> motif<00:05:20.880> that

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
minor and this contains a motif that

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.270 
minor and this contains a motif that
goes<00:05:21.300> like<00:05:21.390> this<00:05:24.350> you're<00:05:25.350> basically<00:05:25.590> picking

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
goes like this you're basically picking

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.190 
goes like this you're basically picking
the<00:05:26.580> first<00:05:26.850> note<00:05:27.150> in<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.450> sequence<00:05:27.930> and

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
the first note in the sequence and

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.990 
the first note in the sequence and
you're<00:05:28.350> pulling<00:05:28.740> it<00:05:28.890> off<00:05:31.490> you<00:05:32.490> repeat<00:05:32.850> this

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
you're pulling it off you repeat this

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.310 
you're pulling it off you repeat this
first<00:05:33.300> one<00:05:33.510> twice<00:05:35.540> and<00:05:36.540> you<00:05:36.690> move<00:05:36.840> it<00:05:36.990> down<00:05:37.140> in

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
first one twice and you move it down in

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.560 
first one twice and you move it down in
scale<00:05:37.620> between<00:05:37.950> the<00:05:38.340> strengths<00:05:39.150> three<00:05:39.390> and

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
scale between the strengths three and

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:46.630 
scale between the strengths three and
four<00:05:42.140> okay<00:05:43.140> so<00:05:43.410> you<00:05:43.500> got<00:05:43.590> something<00:05:43.980> like<00:05:44.130> this

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.000 

and<00:05:47.640> you<00:05:48.420> change<00:05:48.690> position<00:05:49.260> for<00:05:49.650> the<00:05:49.740> last

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
and you change position for the last

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.840 
and you change position for the last
part<00:05:50.340> which<00:05:50.790> is<00:05:50.940> between<00:05:51.120> frets<00:05:52.100> 13<00:05:53.100> 12<00:05:53.490> and<00:05:53.760> 10

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
part which is between frets 13 12 and 10

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.880 
part which is between frets 13 12 and 10
so<00:05:56.850> it's<00:05:57.000> actually<00:05:57.360> easy<00:05:57.870> thing<00:05:58.230> to<00:05:58.380> memorize

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
so it's actually easy thing to memorize

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.970 
so it's actually easy thing to memorize
because<00:05:59.190> the<00:05:59.730> fingerings<00:06:00.330> are<00:06:00.510> very

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 
because the fingerings are very

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.320 
because the fingerings are very
symmetrical<00:06:01.980> but<00:06:02.460> it's<00:06:02.610> not<00:06:02.760> as<00:06:02.910> easy<00:06:03.150> to

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
symmetrical but it's not as easy to

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.840 
symmetrical but it's not as easy to
execute<00:06:03.780> cleanly<00:06:04.560> because<00:06:04.890> this<00:06:05.370> riff<00:06:05.610> ends

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
execute cleanly because this riff ends

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.730 
execute cleanly because this riff ends
up<00:06:05.970> being<00:06:06.150> fast<00:06:09.140> okay<00:06:10.140> so<00:06:10.200> you're<00:06:10.470> looking<00:06:10.530> for

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
up being fast okay so you're looking for

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.570 
up being fast okay so you're looking for
fluidity<00:06:11.370> and<00:06:11.670> you<00:06:11.970> want<00:06:12.150> to<00:06:12.270> hear<00:06:12.510> every<00:06:12.900> note

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:13.580 
fluidity and you want to hear every note

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.100 
fluidity and you want to hear every note
okay<00:06:14.580> the<00:06:14.790> second<00:06:15.180> section<00:06:15.450> of<00:06:15.750> the<00:06:15.900> riff

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
okay the second section of the riff
