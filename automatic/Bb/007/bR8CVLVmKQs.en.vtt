cutting and cutting and cutting and I

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.350 
cutting and cutting and cutting and I
think<00:01:16.009> expectations<00:01:16.640> for<00:01:16.759> sales<00:01:16.970> a<00:01:17.149> longhorn

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
think expectations for sales a longhorn

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.460 
think expectations for sales a longhorn
are<00:01:17.659> getting<00:01:17.899> less<00:01:18.050> and<00:01:18.080> less<00:01:18.259> so<00:01:19.899> but<00:01:20.899> that's

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
are getting less and less so but that's

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.190 
are getting less and less so but that's
an<00:01:21.680> example<00:01:21.950> of<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.550> clear<00:01:23.180> something<00:01:23.960> that

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
an example of a clear something that

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.440 
an example of a clear something that
would<00:01:24.290> clearly<00:01:24.590> be<00:01:24.710> valuable<00:01:25.250> to<00:01:25.450> customers

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
would clearly be valuable to customers

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.359 
would clearly be valuable to customers
would<00:01:26.720> solve<00:01:26.930> problems<00:01:27.470> for<00:01:27.770> our<00:01:27.860> customers

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
would solve problems for our customers

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.969 
would solve problems for our customers
it<00:01:28.580> would<00:01:29.049> globally<00:01:30.049> reduce<00:01:30.409> everybody

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
it would globally reduce everybody

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.070 
it would globally reduce everybody

incredibly hard to architect things at

incredibly hard to architect things at
the<00:04:29.220> beginning<00:04:29.340> so<00:04:29.850> that<00:04:29.880> you<00:04:30.090> can<00:04:30.270> distribute

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
the beginning so that you can distribute

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.270 
the beginning so that you can distribute
all<00:04:30.900> of<00:04:31.020> your<00:04:31.140> functionality<00:04:31.830> on<00:04:32.010> all<00:04:32.160> of

all of your functionality on all of

all of your functionality on all of
these<00:04:32.400> different<00:04:32.580> processing<00:04:33.330> units<00:04:33.690> this

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
these different processing units this

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.080 
these different processing units this
was<00:04:34.740> not<00:04:34.919> a<00:04:34.950> problem<00:04:35.280> that<00:04:35.640> we<00:04:35.730> were<00:04:35.850> lying

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
was not a problem that we were lying

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.909 
was not a problem that we were lying
awake<00:04:36.300> late<00:04:36.630> at<00:04:36.780> night<00:04:36.960> saying<00:04:37.290> oh<00:04:37.470> we<00:04:37.770> would

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
awake late at night saying oh we would

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.500 
awake late at night saying oh we would
really<00:04:38.100> like<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.340> take<00:04:38.640> this<00:04:38.820> on<00:04:39.030> right<00:04:39.270> now

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
really like to take this on right now

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.420 
really like to take this on right now
you<00:04:40.110> know<00:04:40.230> we<00:04:40.410> were<00:04:40.530> worried<00:04:40.800> about<00:04:40.860> little

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
you know we were worried about little

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.850 
you know we were worried about little
things<00:04:41.640> like<00:04:41.850> billing<00:04:42.419> and<00:04:42.780> forums<00:04:43.320> and

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
things like billing and forums and

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.490 
things like billing and forums and
wiki's<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:44.820> things<00:04:45.419> like<00:04:45.630> that<00:04:45.690> right<00:04:46.200> I

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
wiki's and things like that right I

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.260 
wiki's and things like that right I
totally<00:04:46.919> see<00:04:47.100> why<00:04:47.250> Sony<00:04:47.490> wants<00:04:47.880> people<00:04:48.030> to

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
totally see why Sony wants people to

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.630 
totally see why Sony wants people to
write<00:04:48.419> code<00:04:48.600> that<00:04:48.660> runs<00:04:49.080> on<00:04:49.320> 7sp<00:04:49.890> ES<00:04:50.310> and<00:04:50.520> a

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
write code that runs on 7sp ES and a

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.640 
write code that runs on 7sp ES and a
central<00:04:50.940> processing<00:04:51.360> unit<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:52.290> second<00:04:52.530> code

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
central processing unit the second code

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.470 
central processing unit the second code
is<00:04:52.740> never<00:04:52.980> going<00:04:53.160> to<00:04:53.250> run<00:04:53.430> well<00:04:53.669> anywhere<00:04:54.210> else

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
is never going to run well anywhere else

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.500 
is never going to run well anywhere else
right<00:04:55.290> they're<00:04:55.590> saying<00:04:56.030> you<00:04:57.030> know<00:04:57.060> make<00:04:57.360> your

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
right they're saying you know make your

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.960 
right they're saying you know make your
code<00:04:57.720> let<00:04:58.230> not<00:04:58.590> run<00:04:58.890> on<00:04:59.070> anything<00:04:59.430> other<00:04:59.820> than

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
code let not run on anything other than

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.180 
code let not run on anything other than
one<00:05:00.690> of<00:05:00.810> ours<00:05:00.960> and<00:05:01.320> we're<00:05:01.590> betting<00:05:01.770> that<00:05:02.040> we'll

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
one of ours and we're betting that we'll

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.830 
one of ours and we're betting that we'll
have<00:05:02.340> market<00:05:03.180> share<00:05:03.360> that's<00:05:03.570> so<00:05:03.810> high<00:05:04.050> that

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
have market share that's so high that

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.820 
have market share that's so high that
everybody<00:05:06.840> will<00:05:07.020> have<00:05:07.169> to<00:05:07.410> write<00:05:07.560> code<00:05:07.590> for

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
everybody will have to write code for

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.210 
everybody will have to write code for
our<00:05:08.130> platform

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
our platform

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.070 
our platform
and<00:05:09.310> other<00:05:09.760> people<00:05:09.970> will<00:05:10.240> just<00:05:10.390> you<00:05:10.930> know

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
and other people will just you know

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.580 
and other people will just you know
we'll<00:05:11.710> just<00:05:11.740> starve<00:05:12.750> the<00:05:13.750> air<00:05:13.930> from<00:05:14.320> the<00:05:14.470> other

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
we'll just starve the air from the other

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.470 
we'll just starve the air from the other
platforms<00:05:15.190> by<00:05:15.400> soaking<00:05:15.730> by<00:05:16.120> absorbing

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
platforms by soaking by absorbing

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.390 
platforms by soaking by absorbing
everybody's<00:05:17.080> R&amp;D<00:05:17.470> budget<00:05:17.830> and<00:05:17.980> making<00:05:18.130> their

everybody's R&amp;D budget and making their

customers together and things like that
I<00:05:38.740> would<00:05:39.220> think<00:05:39.820> that<00:05:39.970> for<00:05:40.240> a<00:05:40.270> lot<00:05:40.390> of

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
I would think that for a lot of

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.540 
I would think that for a lot of
developers<00:05:40.990> things<00:05:41.530> like<00:05:41.830> Steam<00:05:42.160> are<00:05:42.370> going

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
developers things like Steam are going

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.240 
developers things like Steam are going
to<00:05:42.610> be<00:05:43.510> more<00:05:43.780> interesting<00:05:44.470> and<00:05:44.800> solve<00:05:45.010> more

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
to be more interesting and solve more

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.890 
to be more interesting and solve more
problems<00:05:45.310> to<00:05:45.820> them<00:05:46.090> than<00:05:46.330> this<00:05:46.480> next

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
problems to them than this next

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.320

hardware that would make help you make

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.930 
hardware that would make help you make
the<00:06:04.420> ultimate<00:06:04.620> sprite<00:06:05.620> oriented<00:06:06.340> game<00:06:06.550> and

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
the ultimate sprite oriented game and

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.870 
the ultimate sprite oriented game and
Sony<00:06:07.780> came<00:06:07.990> along<00:06:08.260> and<00:06:08.500> said<00:06:08.710> no<00:06:08.740> no<00:06:09.280> it's<00:06:09.640> not

a<00:06:09.910> sprite<00:06:10.450> problem<00:06:10.930> anymore<00:06:11.170> it's<00:06:11.470> a<00:06:11.560> 3d

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:11.920 
a sprite problem anymore it's a 3d

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.590 
a sprite problem anymore it's a 3d
graphics<00:06:12.370> problem<00:06:12.760> I<00:06:12.970> think<00:06:13.030> that<00:06:13.210> a<00:06:13.330> lot<00:06:13.510> of

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
graphics problem I think that a lot of

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.630 
graphics problem I think that a lot of
developers<00:06:14.050> gonna<00:06:14.260> say<00:06:14.440> you<00:06:14.710> know<00:06:14.740> that's

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:15.640 
developers gonna say you know that's

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.670 
developers gonna say you know that's
that's<00:06:16.000> not<00:06:16.300> the<00:06:16.600> problem<00:06:16.870> that's<00:06:17.290> another

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
that's not the problem that's another

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.560 
that's not the problem that's another
