00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.060
 Amen 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.420
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.850
 video today we are with an unboxing or 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.970
 unpacking an android accessory 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.930
 We were looking forward to trying a smart 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.689
 watch the lgg watch a smart watch 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.970
 with android wear as they put on their own 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.130
 box the operating system version of 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.040
 google for best and bless devices 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.860
 opposable or the eggs as we want 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.140
 say that this device is this 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.190
 It is a clock that communicates with our 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.840
 mobile with android 4.3 or higher to 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.030
 through an application called android 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.160
 web can be downloaded for free from 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.420
 google play store and in this case only 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.890
 We are going to do the unpacking as 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.109
 You see when we open the box first 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.539
 that we found the phone we can 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:58.359
 take out the piece let's see now what 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.359
 has and the clock itself 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.030
 it's quite heavy we have to have it 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.269
 into account 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.940
 has a rubber on a rubber strap that 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.560
 we can change because it 's universal is 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.990
 so we can put in the case of the lg 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.280
 played the one we want we have not yet 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.170
 removed of course the plastic you have to 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.700
 remove it these charging connectors 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.490
 now we will see the charger does not have 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.140
 no physical button and the truth is that 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.479
 it's a little big but it's not 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.450
 especially that he does not have the dolls 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.940
 let's say too big and here we can 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.160
 see it the size with a bracelet 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.710
 quantification a flex affidavit in this 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.899
 case and it's not particularly eye-catching we 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.990
 Since the engine or the motorcycle the model goes 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:41.030
 360 is going to be quite bigger but 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.550
 well we'll see it in due course 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.429
 to see also what it is that brings the box 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.490
 a usb cable here let's see how 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.770
 Take it out of your usb micro usb plastic and 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.009
 this is a detail because for now the 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.470
 legal regulation does not require 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.300
 manufacturers that smart watches have 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.649
 this type of charger but we 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.780
 Glad a lot because we can 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.890
 use the same for the watch and for the 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.830
 phone for example 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.160
 we also have the wall charger 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.680
 we open also 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.290
 very simple very normal like all 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.450
 standard chargers for android except 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.220
 some tablets that as we say no 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.870
 they had the obligation to have a charger 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.810
 micro usb pro we are glad that lg 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.550
 have opted for this and we have the manual 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.390
 Instructions 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.770
 exceptionally small but clear 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.990
 taking account size of the box brings 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.160
 a little could do much more in this 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.450
 yes yes that is appreciated because there 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.610
 some details like the theme of the 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.740
 charge on where is the microphone 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.280
 how it is handled that it would be fine 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.680
 that he read the manual and the last the 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.800
 last part as you can see is the charger 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.580
 magnetic this piece is where it 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.790
 hook the microusb cable we put it in 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.740
 this side as you see and that's it and here 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.060
 over with this charging connector 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:01.070
 we put the clock is magnetized and as 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.720
 You see, we can take it so it's not going to 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.940
 drop so we made sure that it is 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.410
 loading correctly is very comfortable 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.090
 because we always leave it on top of the 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.489
 table for example I have supported 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.050
 is something non-slip is not a 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.879
 a lot but it helps that this 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.700
 grip and simply putting the clock 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.019
 over it will load and there will be 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.400
 see the battery let's analyze it by 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.650
 of course we are going to talk about applications 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.620
 let's talk about many aspects of the lg 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.049
 watch and any questions you have 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.410
