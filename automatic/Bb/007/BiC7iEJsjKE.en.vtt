00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
friend and I we would have to go turn on

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.429 
friend and I we would have to go turn on
the<00:01:32.850> power<00:01:33.119> actually<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.549> then<00:01:35.549> um<00:01:36.290> take<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
the power actually and then um take the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.050 
the power actually and then um take the
elevator<00:01:37.829> back<00:01:38.009> up<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.430> put<00:01:38.700> all<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.939> pieces

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
together that was just a pain this is so

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.190 
together that was just a pain this is so
much<00:01:41.430> easier<00:01:41.490> now<00:01:42.090> there's<00:01:42.570> another<00:01:42.720> way<00:01:43.020> that

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
much easier now there's another way that

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.530 
much easier now there's another way that
I<00:01:43.229> did<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.560> actually<00:01:43.770> before<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.610> brought<00:01:45.270> my

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
I did it actually before I brought my

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.020 
I did it actually before I brought my
piece<00:01:45.869> down<00:01:46.140> all<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:47.220> way<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.520> bottom<00:01:47.670> I

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
piece down all the way to the bottom I

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.560
