00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
hi guys okay yeah so I just wanted to do

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.110 
hi guys okay yeah so I just wanted to do
a<00:00:06.930> really<00:00:07.379> quick<00:00:07.470> video<00:00:07.890> over<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.940> last

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
a really quick video over the last

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.430 
a really quick video over the last
couple<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.480> days<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:10.019> have<00:00:10.920> started<00:00:11.670> using

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
couple of days I have started using

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.790 
couple of days I have started using
screen<00:00:13.440> locations<00:00:14.719> or<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:16.260> have<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.529> screen

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
screen locations or you have the screen

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.330 
screen locations or you have the screen
location<00:00:17.310> hotkeys<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.760> guess<00:00:18.350> to<00:00:19.350> improve<00:00:20.100> my

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
location hotkeys I guess to improve my

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.730 
location hotkeys I guess to improve my
actions<00:00:20.670> per<00:00:20.820> minute<00:00:21.170> try<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.230> improve<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
actions per minute try to improve the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.189 
actions per minute try to improve the
speed<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.160> I'm<00:00:23.310> using<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.390> try<00:00:25.140> to

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
speed that I'm using that I try to

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.640 
speed that I'm using that I try to
improve<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.769> speed<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.539> my<00:00:27.539> gameplay<00:00:28.140> you

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
improve the speed of my gameplay you

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.410 
improve the speed of my gameplay you
know<00:00:28.740> getting<00:00:28.920> around<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.279> map<00:00:29.460> bouncing

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
know getting around the map bouncing

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.420 
know getting around the map bouncing
around<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.689> different<00:00:30.840> parts<00:00:31.320> getting<00:00:32.309> into

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
around to different parts getting into

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.750 
around to different parts getting into
the<00:00:32.669> action<00:00:33.079> wherever<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.170> may<00:00:34.290> be<00:00:34.760> rather

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
the action wherever it may be rather

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.729 
the action wherever it may be rather
than<00:00:35.940> just<00:00:36.090> scrolling<00:00:36.390> around<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.809> map<00:00:36.960> which

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
than just scrolling around the map which

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.600 
than just scrolling around the map which
is<00:00:37.890> really<00:00:38.070> slow<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:39.110> not<00:00:40.110> very<00:00:40.260> efficient<00:00:40.860> so

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
is really slow and not very efficient so

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.959 
is really slow and not very efficient so
what<00:00:42.300> I'm<00:00:42.390> talking<00:00:42.750> what<00:00:42.899> am<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.050> talking<00:00:43.110> about

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
what I'm talking what am I talking about

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.619 
what I'm talking what am I talking about
under<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.360> hot<00:00:45.960> key<00:00:46.140> section<00:00:47.420> under<00:00:48.420> global

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
under the hot key section under global

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.110 
under the hot key section under global
you<00:00:49.020> can<00:00:49.140> see<00:00:49.260> I've<00:00:49.350> got<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.500> modified<00:00:50.120> hotkey

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
you can see I've got a modified hotkey

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.270 
you can see I've got a modified hotkey
profile<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.780> there's<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.590> couple<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.920> unbound

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
profile here there's a couple of unbound

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.799 
profile here there's a couple of unbound
keys<00:00:53.579> what<00:00:53.879> I<00:00:53.910> don't<00:00:54.120> really<00:00:54.270> use<00:00:54.510> them<00:00:54.660> too

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
keys what I don't really use them too

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.540 
keys what I don't really use them too
much<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.320> basically<00:00:56.010> what<00:00:56.190> i<00:00:56.250> want<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.489> show

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
much but basically what i want to show

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.410 
much but basically what i want to show
you<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:56.969> under<00:00:57.480> cameras<00:00:58.280> under<00:00:59.420> create

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
you is that under cameras under create

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.479 
you is that under cameras under create
location<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.890> where<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.340> actually

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
location this is where you can actually

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.590 
location this is where you can actually
create<00:01:02.820> location<00:01:03.600> hotkeys<00:01:04.760> so<00:01:05.760> you're<00:01:06.420> all

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
create location hotkeys so you're all

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.570 
create location hotkeys so you're all
familiar<00:01:06.780> with<00:01:07.369> the<00:01:10.490> unit<00:01:11.490> group<00:01:12.500> hotkeys

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
familiar with the unit group hotkeys

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.859 
familiar with the unit group hotkeys
like<00:01:14.580> control<00:01:14.939> one<00:01:15.119> control<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.689> control

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
like control one control to control

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.410 
like control one control to control
three<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.770> I've<00:01:18.380> been<00:01:19.380> doing<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:21.000> hotkeys

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
three so on I've been doing the hotkeys

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.530 
three so on I've been doing the hotkeys
for<00:01:21.450> create<00:01:21.960> locations<00:01:22.500> which<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:23.540> really

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
for create locations which is really

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.289 
for create locations which is really
useful<00:01:25.460> let's<00:01:26.460> just<00:01:26.610> fire<00:01:26.790> up<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.970> quick<00:01:27.119> game

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
useful let's just fire up a quick game

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.760 
useful let's just fire up a quick game
here<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.750> see<00:01:28.710> if<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:30.530> try<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.590> demonstrate

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
here and see if I can try to demonstrate

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.940 
here and see if I can try to demonstrate
what<00:01:32.220> I'm<00:01:32.310> on<00:01:32.430> about<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:33.500> don't<00:01:34.500> think<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.770> lot<00:01:34.920> of

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
what I'm on about I don't think a lot of

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.410 
what I'm on about I don't think a lot of
brawn<00:01:35.189> League<00:01:35.369> bronze<00:01:35.759> league<00:01:35.970> players

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
brawn League bronze league players

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.030 
brawn League bronze league players
actually<00:01:36.600> do<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.409> mean<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.650> lot<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.860> higher

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
actually do this I mean a lot of higher

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.240 
actually do this I mean a lot of higher
level<00:01:38.430> players<00:01:39.350> will<00:01:40.350> definitely<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:40.979> doing

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
level players will definitely be doing

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.889 
level players will definitely be doing
this<00:01:41.400> but<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:42.150> not<00:01:42.360> something<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.720> I've

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
this but it's not something that I've

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.420 
this but it's not something that I've
generally<00:01:43.290> been<00:01:43.439> doing<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:43.860> since<00:01:44.280> I've

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
generally been doing but since I've

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.950 
generally been doing but since I've
started<00:01:44.549> doing<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.720> definitely

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
started doing it it's definitely

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.990 
started doing it it's definitely
improved<00:01:46.649> my<00:01:47.960> win-loss<00:01:48.960> ratio<00:01:49.470> for<00:01:49.770> sure<00:01:50.000> I've

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
improved my win-loss ratio for sure I've

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.840 
improved my win-loss ratio for sure I've
been<00:01:51.180> winning<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.630> lot<00:01:51.780> more<00:01:51.899> games<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.850> it's

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
been winning a lot more games and it's

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.050 
been winning a lot more games and it's
just<00:01:54.149> quicker<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:55.490> get<00:01:56.490> everything<00:01:56.729> done<00:01:56.880> that

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
just quicker to get everything done that

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.510 
just quicker to get everything done that
I<00:01:57.270> need<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.509> get<00:01:57.630> done<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.079> can<00:01:59.040> move<00:01:59.159> around<00:01:59.310> a

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
I need to get done I can move around a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.880 
I need to get done I can move around a
lot<00:01:59.610> quicker<00:01:59.820> too<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.530> it's<00:02:01.530> definitely

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
lot quicker too so it's definitely

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.600 
lot quicker too so it's definitely
helping<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:02.880> want<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:04.130> share<00:02:05.130> what<00:02:05.490> I've

started<00:02:06.180> doing<00:02:06.570> with<00:02:06.750> with<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.649> guys

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
started doing with with you guys

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.730 
started doing with with you guys
hopefully<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.489> might<00:02:08.640> help

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.200 

okay<00:02:13.740> so<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:14.010> start<00:02:14.220> off<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.340> game<00:02:14.580> as<00:02:14.760> normal

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
okay so you start off a game as normal

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.390 
okay so you start off a game as normal
you<00:02:15.240> start<00:02:15.660> getting<00:02:15.810> your<00:02:16.110> work<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.070> happening

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
you start getting your work is happening

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
but you're all familiar with control

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.200 
but you're all familiar with control
groups<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.240> can<00:02:21.630> assign<00:02:21.900> these<00:02:22.140> units<00:02:22.620> to

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
groups so you can assign these units to

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.820 
groups so you can assign these units to
group<00:02:24.210> 11<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.930> can<00:02:24.990> sit<00:02:25.260> down<00:02:25.380> here<00:02:25.620> we've<00:02:25.800> got

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
group 11 you can sit down here we've got

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.510 
group 11 you can sit down here we've got
the<00:02:25.980> units<00:02:26.880> on<00:02:27.030> group<00:02:27.210> 1<00:02:27.420> if<00:02:27.960> I<00:02:28.380> click<00:02:28.680> off<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:29.190> 10

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
the units on group 1 if I click off a 10

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.940 
the units on group 1 if I click off a 10
i<00:02:29.610> press<00:02:29.820> one<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:30.330> get<00:02:30.600> my<00:02:30.720> units<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.650> can<00:02:31.680> apply

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
i press one I get my units you can apply

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.390 
i press one I get my units you can apply
the<00:02:32.070> same<00:02:32.460> logic<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.660> screen<00:02:34.320> locations<00:02:34.920> so<00:02:35.190> if

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
the same logic to screen locations so if

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.760 
the same logic to screen locations so if
i<00:02:35.630> use<00:02:36.630> my<00:02:36.810> hot<00:02:36.990> keys<00:02:37.200> that<00:02:37.380> i<00:02:37.440> set<00:02:37.680> up<00:02:39.380> shift<00:02:40.380> f1

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
i use my hot keys that i set up shift f1

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.850 
i use my hot keys that i set up shift f1
is<00:02:41.070> this<00:02:41.400> location<00:02:42.000> 1<00:02:42.180> my<00:02:42.630> location<00:02:43.170> 2<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.590> here

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
is this location 1 my location 2 is here

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.190 
is this location 1 my location 2 is here
say<00:02:44.580> my<00:02:44.790> enemy<00:02:45.090> base<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.540> up<00:02:45.690> here<00:02:45.960> and<00:02:46.050> i<00:02:46.080> want

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
say my enemy base is up here and i want

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.190 
say my enemy base is up here and i want
to<00:02:46.320> take<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> location<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.460> that<00:02:47.550> it's<00:02:48.150> shift<00:02:48.810> f3

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
to take a location of that it's shift f3

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.890 
to take a location of that it's shift f3
so<00:02:49.920> now<00:02:50.070> that<00:02:50.250> I've<00:02:50.340> allocated<00:02:51.060> those<00:02:51.270> screen

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
so now that I've allocated those screen

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.020 
so now that I've allocated those screen
locations<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.620> hot<00:02:52.800> keys<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.280> can<00:02:53.820> bounce

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
locations to hot keys I can bounce

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.360 
locations to hot keys I can bounce
between<00:02:54.270> them<00:02:54.600> by<00:02:54.720> hitting<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.110> f1<00:02:55.470> f2<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.450> f3

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
between them by hitting the f1 f2 and f3

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.830 
between them by hitting the f1 f2 and f3
locations<00:02:59.370> just<00:03:00.060> like<00:03:00.210> that<00:03:00.390> rather<00:03:00.720> than

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
locations just like that rather than

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.110 
locations just like that rather than
having<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.170> click<00:03:01.380> around<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.830> map<00:03:02.120> scroll

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
having to click around the map scroll

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.760 
having to click around the map scroll
around<00:03:03.300> like<00:03:03.660> this<00:03:03.870> if<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.410> want<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.650> go<00:03:04.740> check

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
around like this if I want to go check

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.110 
around like this if I want to go check
out<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.130> enemy<00:03:05.520> I<00:03:05.550> don't<00:03:05.730> have<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:05.910> click<00:03:06.090> the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
out the enemy I don't have to click the

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.320 
out the enemy I don't have to click the
mini-map<00:03:06.570> I<00:03:06.840> can<00:03:07.350> just<00:03:07.500> bounce<00:03:07.680> between<00:03:07.950> f1<00:03:08.330> f2

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
mini-map I can just bounce between f1 f2

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:17.270 
mini-map I can just bounce between f1 f2
f3<00:03:12.830> much<00:03:13.830> quicker<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:15.239> get<00:03:15.390> around<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:17.130> its

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
f3 much quicker to get around and its

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.880 
f3 much quicker to get around and its
really<00:03:17.550> helped<00:03:17.850> me<00:03:18.530> again<00:03:19.530> if<00:03:19.709> you're<00:03:19.830> not

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
really helped me again if you're not

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.410 
really helped me again if you're not
really<00:03:20.070> sure<00:03:20.310> where<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.520> find<00:03:20.790> that<00:03:21.000> it's<00:03:21.270> this

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
really sure where to find that it's this

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.199 
really sure where to find that it's this
under<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.810> hotkeys<00:03:22.200> section<00:03:23.030> under<00:03:24.030> global

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
under the hotkeys section under global

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.500 
under the hotkeys section under global
and<00:03:25.070> then<00:03:26.070> expand<00:03:26.520> out<00:03:26.640> camera<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:27.300> you've

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
and then expand out camera and you've

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.410 
and then expand out camera and you've
got<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:27.780> create<00:03:28.440> location<00:03:29.150> hotkeys<00:03:30.150> there

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
got the create location hotkeys there

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.910 
got the create location hotkeys there
just<00:03:30.690> assign<00:03:30.959> them<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.290> whatever<00:03:31.560> you're<00:03:31.739> most

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
just assign them to whatever you're most

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.610 
just assign them to whatever you're most
comfortable<00:03:32.130> with<00:03:32.450> I<00:03:33.450> think<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.020> default<00:03:34.440> is

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
comfortable with I think the default is

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.840 
comfortable with I think the default is
ctrl<00:03:35.070> f5<00:03:35.520> f6<00:03:36.239> f7<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:37.140> so<00:03:37.290> on<00:03:37.410> I<00:03:37.440> just<00:03:37.850> started

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
ctrl f5 f6 f7 and so on I just started

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.690 
ctrl f5 f6 f7 and so on I just started
using<00:03:39.000> shift<00:03:39.739> me<00:03:40.739> personally<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.310> think<00:03:41.400> it's

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
using shift me personally I think it's

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.120 
using shift me personally I think it's
easier<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.090> reach<00:03:43.019> shift<00:03:43.380> F<00:03:43.590> 1<00:03:43.800> instead<00:03:44.040> of

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
easier to reach shift F 1 instead of

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.130 
easier to reach shift F 1 instead of
control<00:03:44.459> if<00:03:44.610> one<00:03:44.790> it's<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:45.030> bit<00:03:45.150> of<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.390> stretch

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
control if one it's a bit of a stretch

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.820 
control if one it's a bit of a stretch
getting<00:03:46.560> control<00:03:46.860> left<00:03:47.220> groups<00:03:48.030> but<00:03:48.720> shift<00:03:49.470> f1

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
getting control left groups but shift f1

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.940

everyone has been using unit groups that

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.830 
everyone has been using unit groups that
I'm<00:03:59.459> aware<00:03:59.670> of<00:03:59.730> in<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.150> bronze<00:04:00.390> league<00:04:00.570> but
