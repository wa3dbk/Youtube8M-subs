perfectly<00:01:11.460> for<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> mobile<00:01:11.880> device<00:01:12.950> let's<00:01:13.950> jump

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
perfectly for a mobile device let's jump

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.469 
perfectly for a mobile device let's jump
around<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.549> another<00:01:14.729> site<00:01:15.000> maybe<00:01:15.180> we'll<00:01:15.299> jump

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
around to another site maybe we'll jump

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.510 
around to another site maybe we'll jump
to<00:01:15.600> yahoo<00:01:15.840> here

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520
