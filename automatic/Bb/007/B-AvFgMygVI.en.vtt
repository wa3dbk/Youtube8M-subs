00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 acceptance my name is emily sharp and in this 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.879
 and girls give a couple of tips on how 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.859
 beautifully prepared on the photos I 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.540
 I think that this topic is now important 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.309
 because we all have with you 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.650
 social networking pages we all have 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.969
 you have instagram and we all want to go there 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.770
 post photos on which 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.180
 naturally we will be beautiful and not 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.859
 hearsay know that we often 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.590
 we get just disgusting on 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.939
 photographs and to fix it all i 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.230
 I'll give you a couple of tips 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.449
 so if you're interested then 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.130
 stay with me and we are the first advice 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.480
 is that you just have to 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.189
 love yourself 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.719
 because until you love yourself you 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.000
 don't get well started on 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.649
 photos and everything will seem to you 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.570
 what are you learning terrible here him 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.210
 big demolition here you have small eyes 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.370
 thousand oblique and in general so therefore you 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.500
 must be completely confident and 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.750
 I know personally about one year 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.640
 two or three ago I just loved myself very much 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.739
 outwardly it might seem that it is not scary and 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.170
 very strong and really work 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.030
 photos in my opinion just awful 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.420
 and yes today I want to show you too 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.730
 these pictures which was before just for 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.439
 comparisons say so remember to 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.000
 the first rule is to love yourself 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.040
 the second rule that can you 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.630
 advise it must be 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.250
 smile in photographs that is not 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.320
 be afraid to do this and it does not matter 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.650
 you smile with your teeth or smile without 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.509
 of teeth 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.250
 you will still be prettier 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.869
 because the smile goes for absolutely everyone 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.790
 The third rule is that it is necessary 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.820
 try to curl up in front of the mirror 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.740
 that is, find that facial expression that 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.259
 you most goes that is you just 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.729
 you can stand waking and and 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.210
 surely something that you too can somehow 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.950
 to help 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.750
 at least I did because of so 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.030
 fourth rule be relaxed 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.119
 on camera because very often when 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.100
 people take pictures they start to sit and 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.570
 somehow someone starts to build himself 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.610
 to be very intense in general 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.020
 all this only worsens the situation therefore 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.570
 just relax and be like that 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.079
 what you are and the fifth thing I want you 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.329
 say this is what remember the camera hd 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.189
 or which don't go generally it doesn't matter 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.220
 the camera always adds a couple extra 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.260
 kilograms and output 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.630
 look thicker on her just for any 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.770
 scenario, so I think that in this 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.360
 plan can learn to use 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.100
 Photoshop to a little bit of yourself 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.410
 adjust because really 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.460
 Cameron makes us bigger 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.200
 Here and if you do not like 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.850
 used photoshop and sixth tip 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.650
 who can give you this try 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.200
 find yourself some advantages that is 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.730
 suppose you have very beautiful eyes 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.250
 try to focus on photos 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.650
 it is on them that your shortcomings are acceptable 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.180
 suppose you have very small lips i 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.860
 I do not consider that something a flaw but if 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.420
 you believe that it your fault you 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.760
 try the opposite somehow not 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.050
 focus on them 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.850
 stress on your merits i 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.440
 I think dragon it was all my advice 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.000
 today on the action that they can be 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.740
 little help you discover for yourself 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.570
 anything new and write to 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.080
 comments get plums well on 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.970
 snapshots 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.350
 or not and if you have any 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.910
 advice then you can who is this 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.250
 comment i think it will be interesting 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.170
 read not only me but also the audience 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.500
