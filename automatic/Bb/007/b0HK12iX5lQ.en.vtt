00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.049
 good evening and welcome to 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.970
 a new issue of philosophy at 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.740
 the ferry 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.290
 last night ran at rtl one 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.320
 Reportage, so to speak, the burger king 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.619
 reportage in the context of a new series 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.980
 which team wallraff calls it was about 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.609
 the states in a burger king 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.609
 branch 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.210
 So the team reported on the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.309
 catastrophic conditions in the kitchen 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.809
 about the catastrophic conditions in 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.239
 hygiene and about the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.789
 catastrophic handling of the staff 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.350
 This had a reporter as 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.250
 employees and there 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.250
 worked undercover 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.649
 the conditions were as said 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.719
 catastrophic 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.579
 but I have with this whole 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.730
 history certain difficulties me 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.109
 also wants to explain why rtl markets 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.940
 and sells the whole thing over the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.680
 So sensation seemed about the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.369
 catastrophic conditions he found 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.820
 were 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.970
 that means the editorial team 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.290
 Wallraff is almost obligated 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.119
 as sensationally bad as possible 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.500
 Find 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.960
 so the question to you is here 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.140
 not the danger that eventual 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.119
 positive findings in such 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.770
 branch in this case just maybe 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.540
 could fall under the table 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.369
 that means that you are only on the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.119
 Negative only focused on that 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.820
 negative reports then next point 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.280
 the whole thing is a series and so 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.439
 a series works that means too 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.549
 In the future quote, she must be in the 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.860
 increase the principle 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.920
 that means in the next issue 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.590
 the wallraff team has to work in principle 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.520
 even worse, even more dramatic 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.049
 For states and even that is not 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.180
 in your opinion maybe difficult 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.730
 that you just get up here 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.650
 that you become blinded, so to speak 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.750
 But I'm not just with it 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.210
 difficulties but if you look 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.479
 The reporting now time today to 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:13.240
 looks and sounds and you see it works 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.550
 about catastrophic conditions in burger 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.500
 Not about the states in the king 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.600
 branches where research was done 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.730
 but the whole thing is generalized 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.530
 that is, the principle works now 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.910
 assumed that everywhere 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.810
 burger king the same bad 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.820
 conditions prevail 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.680
 that does not have this reportage 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.330
 delivered it was determined the 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.070
 Branches of a particular franchise 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.810
 entrepreneur 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.459
 there these conditions were determined 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.010
 if we have another one somewhere now 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.810
 branch have the exemplary with the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.520
 food bypasses the model 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.020
 hygiene and the exemplary with the 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.750
 bypasses employees 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.239
 she has no chance because the gone 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.250
 is with caught is hung with 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.370
 that means they are now exactly like that 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.800
 flat rate like the same 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.030
 branches where it was so bad that 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.709
 is also a point that I am 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.650
 see this whole thing just critical 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.360
 that is generalized here and 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.940
 Of course, the guy is doing it now 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.130
 corresponding shitstorm that is 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.110
 So all the slogans scream 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.680
 now on facebook times properly 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.480
 watson and her two- liners are up 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.700
 the facebook page of burger king 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.739
 leave the two-line in those 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.630
 not very nice but a lot of fecal language in it 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.680
 occurs all this accompaniment 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.630
 Of course we have too 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.730
 So you said what you think your opinion 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.260
 you from the whole story go that 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.650
 everything alright so reported again 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.480
 has been 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.120
 or maybe I have mine 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.000
 small thoughts right your comments 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.040
 below in the video description I am 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.299
 over there and wish you a nice 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.299
 until evening Zschau then
