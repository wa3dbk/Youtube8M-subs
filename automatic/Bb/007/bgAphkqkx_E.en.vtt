somewhere<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.880> there<00:01:48.150> I<00:01:48.360> think<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.840> don't<00:01:48.960> know

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
somewhere in there I think I don't know

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.630 
somewhere in there I think I don't know
how<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.320> got<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.680> there<00:01:49.710> because<00:01:50.010> I<00:01:50.220> can't<00:01:50.490> I

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
how it got in there because I can't I

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.730 
how it got in there because I can't I
don't<00:01:50.760> know<00:01:50.850> how<00:01:50.940> to<00:01:51.030> even<00:01:51.210> take<00:01:51.330> it<00:01:51.600> apart<00:01:51.930> but

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
don't know how to even take it apart but

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.859 
don't know how to even take it apart but
I<00:01:52.799> think<00:01:53.130> there's<00:01:53.729> some<00:01:53.970> dumpsters<00:01:54.510> across

I think there's some dumpsters across

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.480 
I think there's some dumpsters across
the<00:01:55.020> street<00:01:55.290> from<00:01:55.409> where<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.650> store<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.190> cart

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
the street from where I store the cart

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.429 
the street from where I store the cart
and<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.729> think<00:01:57.030> maybe<00:01:57.270> one<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.630> them<00:01:57.810> came<00:01:58.049> over

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
and I think maybe one of them came over

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.160 
and I think maybe one of them came over
and<00:01:58.560> somehow<00:01:58.860> got<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.240> into<00:02:00.510> the<00:02:00.540> into<00:02:01.049> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
and somehow got up and into the into the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.080 
and somehow got up and into the into the
machine<00:02:01.740> into<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.100> cart<00:02:02.400> so<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.729> actually
