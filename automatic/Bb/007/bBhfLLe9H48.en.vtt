00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.450
 and my people are left as they have been, I am 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.030
 ryder here with other languages and this time 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.280
 Well, we're going to click , I know I've 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.170
 tried a bit to bring them videos of 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.330
 minecraft but good is because you already know and 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.430
 all that but let's make it possible 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.160
 to always find time and bring them 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.080
 good videos this time I bring you a 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.759
 list of how to double diamonds though 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.509
 this can also be done with some 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:34.240
 gold or byron letters ok is a right 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.920
 pretty new just out or just 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.960
 they just discovered and so I 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.880
 I found out there and here I bring them 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.700
 so that you begin to duplicate 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.260
 diamonds in surf worlds various good 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.970
 what we are going to do is get us 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.830
 first I know that this is difficult 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.590
 the first thing is difficult is to get 10 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.090
 air blocks since you have to look 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.770
 a lot first they are playing like 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.440
 creative if not then they grab it from the 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.320
 creative I do not know but good the case is that 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.870
 it's a survival we can get 10 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.420
 diamond blocks and now what are we going 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.150
 to do is to go eat and fill it 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.640
 of any kind of 'peter' I do not know of 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.310
 a stone or whatever the thing that 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.430
 you have to fill all this 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.270
 I have it or with those of 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.979
 trees filling all the inventory and 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.930
 we leave a space like this one that 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.430
 I have here at the same place where are the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.890
 diamond blocks we leave the space 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.960
 free that we have left in this way that 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.640
 Now, we're just going to 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.340
 a table about a love that is the table 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.439
 this trunk and we can not over on the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.710
 table ok or they put it that way like what 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.110
 I have here what we are going to do now 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.450
 they will see it's pretty simple what 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.479
 let's do is you can enter and 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.179
 tell us where the diamonds are 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.020
 and convert the diamond blocks to 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:54.600
 pebbles and then do the opposite 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.979
 we turn the stones into diamonds or 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.119
 that we have to learn this 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:03.119
 movement 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:08.119
 block diamond and so we start let's 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.119
 give it now the block 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:16.700
 remember I have to start with 10 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.700
 diamond blocks 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:30.150
 as you can see I already have 11 blocks 11 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.680
 diamond blocks 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.680
 we will continue to give you with others 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:43.840
 I have 12 eggs although I give them 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.510
 I recommend that when they reach 12 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.239
 we remove two blocks and continue and follow 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.640
 with this one with the ten because sometimes 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.580
 he removes them again ok then right now 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.819
 I'm 12 then I'm going to remove all this 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.099
 that I have here those 13 I've got 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.920
 with this gray I remove these 2 and I continue with 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.360
 10 ok like that, we do not lose 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.230
 nothing 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.510
 we learn is what we are winning 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:15.049
 we continue 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.049
 giving it the same diamond shape 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.400
 I liked it very much and wanted to share 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:27.879
 just for you to start at 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:30.840
 double your diamonds people already gave me 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.840
 another I already have 11 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.230
 I already have 12 as you can see it's pretty 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.950
 fast the truth does not take much 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.080
 time and we're talking about 9 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.220
 diamonds so the truth is a lot 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.220
 let's continue giving 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.530
 it's easier it 's easier to do it with 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.260
 a cross because if they do it with the 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.970
 then you can pass it already had 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.350
 I have 11 again as you can see it is 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.420
 pretty fast the sun 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.700
 josh you have to get the 10 diamonds 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.060
 first that is the diamond blocks is 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.400
 quite difficult they have to look a lot 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.780
 but it's worth it as 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.650
 can see later what can they recover 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.480
 the doom I have 12 again and so 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.739
 good as you could see I do not know how much 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.050
 time has passed already 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.510
 I have already obtained six of six blocks of 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.270
 diamond with this click can see is a 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.860
 survival module and nothing people hope that 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.930
 this gray you liked the truth 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.520
 it's pretty good to leave your likes 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.760
 because the truth 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.380
 It's worth doing ok as you already 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.129
 I mentioned earlier this can be done with 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.819
 a gold 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:47.499
 iron or emeralds this is all 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:47.499
 people i am ryder and until next time
