00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
that food to eat to not only build up

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.400 
that food to eat to not only build up
his<00:03:53.250> armor<00:03:53.790> but<00:03:54.209> get<00:03:54.360> that<00:03:54.540> evolved<00:03:54.900> energy<00:03:55.290> up

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
his armor but get that evolved energy up

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.260 
his armor but get that evolved energy up
as<00:03:55.560> well<00:03:55.739> so<00:03:55.770> he<00:03:56.070> can<00:03:56.190> get<00:03:56.280> up<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.430> stage<00:03:56.790> 2<00:03:57.060> and

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
as well so he can get up to stage 2 and

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.420 
as well so he can get up to stage 2 and
then<00:03:57.360> eventually<00:03:57.630> stage<00:03:58.110> 3<00:03:58.470> does<00:03:59.010> startle

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
then eventually stage 3 does startle

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.670 
then eventually stage 3 does startle
