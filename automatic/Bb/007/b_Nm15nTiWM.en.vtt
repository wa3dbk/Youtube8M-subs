00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.670
 good day to your strength to the box time 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.670
 looking for homes and talismans 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:14.130
 Well, friends are strong, these figures 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.890
 will be called silicone if the icon 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.980
 it will be a kind of combination 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.900
 bait on a predator 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.480
 the fact that we are today these cover 6 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.720
 every day different 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.210
 industrial night we will talk 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.769
 commercial enterprise and 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.300
 government releases kinda 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.210
 silicone bait 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.010
 if such that shine , in this on 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.829
 all sorts of straight balls that unscrewed on 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.530
 glow with water and very comfortable that is it 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.570
 how the drive types and is visible there or 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.140
 somehow I do not know what it is so golden 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.000
 with light 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.559
 it works but of course I am very happy 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.770
 of course to fix and because 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.930
 attracts all the same ultraviolet always 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.239
 You can check this bait and 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.890
 lit it glows attire glows and how 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.100
 I react to be a fish, too, show 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.040
 practice itself but there are different kinds 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.710
 Japanese goal , too, will say no 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.510
 glows but it works well email 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.630
 already ponirali yes I including me 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.810
 a lot of this phone you don't say 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.049
 sealed than on new packages he still 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.310
 the worker also wants to somehow attract and 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:29.790
 lure a little bit I upgrade 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.729
 added to the silicone rare 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.299
 acted and others just 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.590
 got a firefly like a tiger did 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.590
 I'll show you and tell you now 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.940
 here is writing on the table me 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.620
 all sorts of nicknames 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.160
 silicone already prepared fishing 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.840
 see this is on catfish lies with me 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.990
 silicone is such a silicone 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.460
 thyristor and in it below if you drew 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.040
 attention is firefly 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.080
 and when it is impossible to go fishing on 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.080
 not enough just pull out the icon 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.040
 edict density is good because if 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.740
 you will easily bullshit ceiling see 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.650
 I break it and send it back to it 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.510
 the same way it turns all silicone 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.700
 bait she glows 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.040
 because there is a firefly inside 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.580
 This is one of the major ones. I just showed that 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.210
 more species but the thing is what teaches this 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.950
 a fact. 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.760
 flowers are different because and 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.340
 Silicone in April when you have to dig and all 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.020
 Rezinochki our respectively different 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.900
 here I put the risks on zander 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.390
 didn't put the hot silicone somewhere 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.870
 cut set believe the same thing 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.870
 is understood 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.620
 you break it again you insert it back and 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.930
 hiding, too, shine itself silicone and 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.110
 thus attracting the fish to the same 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:17.250
 most do and worm started yet 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:21.020
 then of course the firefly stood 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.310
 so here's a little too like trying 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.390
 glow red very comfortable very 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:32.220
 beautiful and worm singer and union 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:34.620
 child with the pointer here is the same with 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.170
 such kasperovskoy in response his 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.140
 made here if the hook 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.620
 break it 4 light so pretty and 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.020
 very much when you lead and it glows well 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.270
 and thus attracting that is necessary 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.910
 move the hook at every important when 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.250
 small fish if tip and japan 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.630
 Accordingly, your firefly can 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.760
 put a candle can put 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.830
 more this is your imagination like you 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.830
 will do want to show more 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:08.200
 besides what can be used 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:10.870
 wore chickens our spectator court glasses 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.640
 They come in contact with these here are 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.670
 I buy only the smallest 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.260
 which I showed are worms 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.570
 here are the smallest hearts there 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:24.420
 these are the smallest axes I love 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.420
 use on these covers 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.260
 intermediaries here these games like this 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.720
 done on your eyes now show 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.240
 to see it more accessible and 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.050
 then I'll show you how I make a fly with these with 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.760
 these notes for fun to 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.710
 to catch 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.110
 here we open on a pack we take this 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.030
 goes two sat down the tip of our eyes and hook 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:50.890
 such small and goes to them 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:53.890
 directly two tubes see what 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:56.170
 we do choose choose one 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.910
 directly all some mockery 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.850
 silicone well let's say you see this 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.890
 me on the table are different liza chains i 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.290
 for example take and bad hook 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.870
 respectively, under him pick up and 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.640
 put it a straw or so we ate 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.920
 such that it doesn't matter what purpose he is 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.530
 will choose for you to pick up keys 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.190
 to for this dress and flax probably 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:25.060
 fireflies on the hook is very simple this 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:26.650
 tube inserted camping hook does not break 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.900
 nothing just leave prepare for 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.400
 fishing 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.350
 we take the hook well, let's say discouraged here 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:38.050
 this jump and skip his bag 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:41.250
 we start it we pierce we bring to 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.250
 end and unfold 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:51.410
 and you get such a plan believe 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:00.870
 or you can put it in them like this 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.910
 what will happen next do this example i 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.130
 so what for what do i put on 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.790
 him silicone 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:11.780
 Here I have about I will not 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:14.700
 keeps your rome i will show you how i am 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.640
 how can we use well let's say we 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.500
 They are taken in this thread for fly 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.660
 do or with feathers somehow somehow 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.060
 way in the Athenian they did 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:29.550
 Th catch fire if he had a spark Vaeth 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:32.340
 you fly your feathers, respectively 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.730
 closes and poke in this way and 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:38.280
 Here is good and on time already on the predator 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:40.230
 you whether it will be about the culture of this yet 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.010
 whether it will be used here 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:46.020
 can already put here cheburashka 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:49.440
 any other weight can be 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:52.350
 bring the ball that is, it already depends on 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.300
 you what imagination you will have what 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.030
 your creativity approach to this business 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:00.210
 what do you do how do i combine 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:03.030
 I use different hooks different 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:06.720
 silicones different seeds also 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:09.840
 use heirs soldered by predators 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:13.860
 very comfortable and very practical not all 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:16.620
 silicone gum that glow 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.990
 If you had for me as you can 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.820
 use fishing and it will be no worse 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.500
 than the one that shines checking 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:27.380
 here the bass will only depend on 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.380
 your game from your approach is already on the water 

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:34.770
 directly choose alice 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:39.000
 choose pens choose coil pro 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:41.850
 vodka and then fishing accordingly 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.840
 will smile at you as they say with good 

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:46.110
 the result of couples or 

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.650
 but see for yourself what I had was a cake 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.419
 taking advantage of 

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.729
 today with you today 

00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:52.530
 shared with you today was victor 

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:54.539
 Good luck on the fishing box 

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:57.020
 if anyone likes to use everything 

00:07:54.539 --> 00:07:57.020
 good
