discharge it some more so all right so
here's<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.790> batteries<00:02:31.150> um<00:02:32.280> I'll<00:02:33.280> actually

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
here's the batteries um I'll actually

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.390 
here's the batteries um I'll actually
really<00:02:33.819> light<00:02:34.440> tell<00:02:35.440> me<00:02:35.530> milliamp<00:02:35.860> these<00:02:36.130> are

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
really light tell me milliamp these are

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.300 
really light tell me milliamp these are
these<00:02:37.000> are<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.300> do<00:02:38.170> these<00:02:38.620> are<00:02:38.769> the<00:02:38.890> new<00:02:39.040> ones

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
these are the do these are the new ones

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.680 
these are the do these are the new ones
I<00:02:39.550> think<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:40.060> don't<00:02:40.630> know

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.640 

it<00:02:45.260> says<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:46.960> 60,000<00:02:47.960> the<00:02:48.020> lamps<00:02:48.290> but<00:02:48.440> it<00:02:48.500> also

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
it says to 60,000 the lamps but it also

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.170 
it says to 60,000 the lamps but it also
says<00:02:48.920> nineteen<00:02:49.250> hundred<00:02:49.520> millions<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:50.000> don't

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
says nineteen hundred millions I don't

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.450 
says nineteen hundred millions I don't
know<00:02:50.270> which<00:02:50.390> one<00:02:50.570> page<00:02:50.840> I<00:02:51.220> don't<00:02:52.220> know<00:02:52.310> which

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
know which one page I don't know which

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.120 
know which one page I don't know which
battery<00:02:52.730> this<00:02:52.970> is<00:02:53.180> but<00:02:53.510> it<00:02:53.930> says<00:02:54.140> type<00:02:54.380> 2<00:02:54.590> but<00:02:55.100> I

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
battery this is but it says type 2 but I

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.410 
battery this is but it says type 2 but I
guess<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.460> is<00:02:55.490> the<00:02:55.790> newer<00:02:56.330> version<00:02:56.750> hopefully

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
guess it is the newer version hopefully

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.200 
guess it is the newer version hopefully
because<00:02:59.420> newer<00:02:59.690> versions<00:03:00.080> are<00:03:00.260> better<00:03:01.210> and

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
because newer versions are better and

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.230 
because newer versions are better and
then<00:03:02.420> here's<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:03.610> eight-pack<00:03:04.610> will<00:03:04.850> dig<00:03:05.090> into

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
then here's the eight-pack will dig into

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:20.710 
then here's the eight-pack will dig into
drinking<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:17.620> see<00:03:18.620> if<00:03:18.770> Lisa<00:03:19.360> save<00:03:20.360> me<00:03:20.510> there

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
drinking and see if Lisa save me there

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:30.580 
drinking and see if Lisa save me there

right here we are hope pack of sanyo

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.500 
right here we are hope pack of sanyo
eneloop<00:03:34.070> this<00:03:34.580> one<00:03:34.760> seems<00:03:35.060> to<00:03:35.150> be<00:03:35.240> taped

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
eneloop this one seems to be taped

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:44.800 
eneloop this one seems to be taped
together<00:03:36.610> by<00:03:37.780> invisible<00:03:40.450> tape<00:03:41.450> own<00:03:43.720> there's<00:03:44.720> a

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
together by invisible tape own there's a

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.360 
together by invisible tape own there's a
strip<00:03:45.080> of<00:03:45.110> tape<00:03:45.380> at<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.770> back<00:03:45.920> I<00:03:46.070> thought<00:03:46.250> it

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
strip of tape at the back I thought it

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.390 
strip of tape at the back I thought it
was<00:03:46.430> like<00:03:46.580> the<00:03:46.700> whole<00:03:46.820> thing<00:03:47.260> so<00:03:48.310> it's<00:03:49.310> a

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
was like the whole thing so it's a

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.190 
was like the whole thing so it's a
little<00:03:49.760> strip<00:03:50.090> of<00:03:50.120> tape<00:03:50.330> back<00:03:50.540> here<00:03:50.750> holding

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
little strip of tape back here holding

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.130 
little strip of tape back here holding
these<00:03:51.380> together<00:03:52.510> guess<00:03:53.510> so<00:03:53.660> they<00:03:53.780> don't<00:03:53.930> fall

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
these together guess so they don't fall

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.610 
these together guess so they don't fall
out<00:03:54.200> of<00:03:54.410> place<00:03:54.590> in<00:03:54.800> that<00:03:54.830> box<00:03:56.200> bots<00:03:57.200> on<00:03:57.440> the

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
out of place in that box bots on the

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.970 
out of place in that box bots on the
display<00:03:57.950> or<00:03:58.220> whatever<00:03:59.440> right<00:04:00.440> so<00:04:00.620> here<00:04:00.770> we<00:04:00.860> are

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.260

rubber<00:04:25.570> actually<00:04:25.990> keeps<00:04:26.200> the<00:04:26.260> batteries<00:04:26.620> from

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
rubber actually keeps the batteries from

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.000 
rubber actually keeps the batteries from
rolling<00:04:27.220> around<00:04:27.340> too<00:04:27.700> so<00:04:28.060> that's<00:04:28.389> pretty<00:04:28.720> cool

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010
