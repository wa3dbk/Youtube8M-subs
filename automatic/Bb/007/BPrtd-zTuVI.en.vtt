00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.730
 how are we all have new question 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:35.450
 every time I change my routine 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:36.080
 let's go to each when I have to change 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.870
 routines 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.809
 another excellent note question from a 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:46.070
 subscriber that tells us if every when 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:49.400
 I must change the routine and why very 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.680
 well already when we have our base 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.900
 defined first of all is to define your 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.530
 phase I am in phase of volume phase of 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.510
 definition phase maintenance 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.940
 then we are going to choose some of 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:06.050
 these three or in which we are now 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.530
 let's proceed to our routine that 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.780
 We'll keep an eye on her routine 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.289
 pay attention I do not want that after 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.470
 today is injured now me my routine is going to 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.470
 be 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.820
 two 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.990
 the routine should be changed every three 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.289
 months nothing more every three months nothing of 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.000
 that a week I'm going to do this to the 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.000
 next week now I'm going to add 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.409
 When you go to when you fuck, you'll know 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.259
 that you're stuck or that you're 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.960
 really evolving are you loading 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.820
 more weight in Cetarsa ​​you 'll never know if 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.899
 you 're really doing a fucking potpourri 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.970
 of exercises then to see if 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.130
 we are increasing our forces and 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.840
 see if we are increasing the disks that 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.409
 we put a certain device to a certain 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.850
 machine we do more repetitions go 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.369
 that the prick supplement is 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.819
 working we have to maintain a 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.810
 routine three months more than three months a 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.200
 same routine 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.630
 there yes I do not analyze what you are 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.690
 alert because because after three 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.910
 months your body and will know will know 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.400
 that you're going to start some with chest the 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.989
 Tuesday you will give visas and so on 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.480
 Wednesday leg etc. Etcetera 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.090
 etcetera then it will not be 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.349
 working the same way there will not be 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.300
 hypertrophy in muscle will no longer see the 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.599
 work that was at the beginning at 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.900
 better not even to feel 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:43.180
 sore the famous soreness and so on 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.400
 etcetera etcetera then but one 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.360
 routine if you have to keep it three 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.850
 months does not matter in which phase you are or 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.830
 be maintenance volume definition 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.489
 you have to keep that routine for 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.970
 three months to see how the changes go see 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:04.120
 how much weight you are already increasing in those 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.810
 three months see if you raise more and 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.290
 you lift less you can not see an advance 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.900
 neither physically nor in the gym 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.349
 and every 15 days you are changing the routine 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.629
 you can not do that no no no no 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:22.359
 can you do that then what 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:25.090
 It is advisable that you stay with that 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:28.269
 routine three months after those three 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.629
 Months removed add to the best a 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.870
 Exercise does not go with you, you can remove it 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.310
 because it hurts you feel 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.060
 pulls to the best that causes you a 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.189
 injury and you change it 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:46.569
 completely the routine is different with 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:49.780
 emphasis on biceps for example if you see 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.730
 some shoulder more strongly with more 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.250
 volume that the other is going to be with emphasis 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.090
 on the shoulder et cetera et cetera et cetera 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:01.150
 but if you establish a routine during 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.579
 three months for three months see the 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.400
 advances that the physicist has had to see the 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.950
 breakthroughs you've had when lifting that 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.840
 weight and so see 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.650
 self to say is is that I am 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.169
 advanced because if you're continually 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.169
 changing your routine you will never see a 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.730
 really advance your body will be 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.220
 just like the sun will be like this now 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:28.180
 this asshole that is going to put me to do and 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:32.259
 is going to really be like this 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:35.650
 is when all this stagnated I do not go up 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:37.479
 of weight or no longer lifted the post 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.840
 Carrón stops changing the routine of 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:44.229
 fraser for now I'm going to do the chest 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.199
 leg and gluteus and panama mamés good 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:50.050
 be so little or really a routine 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.570
 keep defining the times that what 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.000
 I need Tuesday this Wednesday this or 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.520
 Wednesday I rest because this Friday 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.639
 these Saturday this or rest and so on 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:05.500
 etcetera etcetera will already depend on 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:09.099
 which the routine 15 of you many times the 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.259
 that bastard's routine works very well 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:13.300
 good to him but one is not going to 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:16.570
 work also going to be very 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.150
 light is going to be training or very 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.009
 strong very externally for one or 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.099
 really light that is this bastard 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.870
 trains like that but that routine works 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:29.289
 very well to him then we have to 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:32.020
 we see who routine 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:34.210
 you feel that there are changes and you feel that 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.559
 they work very well in your body that's 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:41.379
 another very very important point then 

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:45.779
 that's the time every time you change your 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:45.779
 Question routine answered 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.790
