welcome<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.250> my<00:00:02.370> first<00:00:02.760> tutorial<00:00:02.879> video<00:00:03.659> this

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
welcome to my first tutorial video this

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.369 
welcome to my first tutorial video this
this<00:00:04.529> Oriole<00:00:04.799> video<00:00:05.040> will<00:00:05.430> be<00:00:06.049> how<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.080> make

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
this Oriole video will be how to make

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.169 
this Oriole video will be how to make
the<00:00:07.589> cobblestone<00:00:08.160> generator<00:00:08.189> from<00:00:08.820> my<00:00:08.970> first

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
the cobblestone generator from my first

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.990 
the cobblestone generator from my first
servitor<00:00:09.690> video<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:10.349> had<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.740> question<00:00:11.250> from<00:00:11.519> a

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
servitor video I had a question from a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.600 
servitor video I had a question from a
member<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.080> minecraft<00:00:13.559> forums<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:14.190> the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
member of the minecraft forums in the

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.000 
member of the minecraft forums in the
red<00:00:14.849> power<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.450> thread<00:00:15.870> on<00:00:16.139> how<00:00:16.949> the

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
red power to thread on how the

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.429 
red power to thread on how the
interaction<00:00:17.760> between<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.750> redstone<00:00:19.230> torch

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
interaction between the redstone torch

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.599 
interaction between the redstone torch
and<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.520> cobblestone<00:00:21.769> how<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:23.010> functioned

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
and the cobblestone how that functioned

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.130 
and the cobblestone how that functioned
so<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.330> thought<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.630> would<00:00:24.750> just<00:00:24.960> make<00:00:25.109> a

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
so I thought I would just make a

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.400 
so I thought I would just make a
tutorial<00:00:25.350> on<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.949> entire<00:00:26.310> generator<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.449> to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
tutorial on the entire generator so to

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.330 
tutorial on the entire generator so to
start<00:00:28.680> off<00:00:28.800> you'll<00:00:29.099> need<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.340> dig<00:00:29.519> down<00:00:29.670> 1<00:00:30.090> 1<00:00:30.869> 2

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
start off you'll need to dig down 1 1 2

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.580 
start off you'll need to dig down 1 1 2
1<00:00:32.340> 2<00:00:32.579> 3<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.840> then<00:00:34.200> one<00:00:34.700> in<00:00:36.170> addition<00:00:37.170> you're

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
1 2 3 and then one in addition you're

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.040 
1 2 3 and then one in addition you're
going<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.800> need<00:00:37.950> one<00:00:38.879> here<00:00:40.309> to<00:00:41.309> hear<00:00:42.050> your

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
going to need one here to hear your

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.229 
going to need one here to hear your
chest<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.829> going<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.219> go<00:00:44.309> here<00:00:45.350> your<00:00:46.350> breaker

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
chest is going to go here your breaker

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.740 
chest is going to go here your breaker
is<00:00:48.239> going<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.690> up<00:00:48.840> here<00:00:50.210> your<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> redstone

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
is going to up here your a redstone

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.830 
is going to up here your a redstone
torch<00:00:52.309> will<00:00:53.309> go<00:00:53.430> against<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.120> right<00:00:54.570> there

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
torch will go against that right there

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.420 
torch will go against that right there
make<00:00:55.110> sure<00:00:55.140> not<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.620> place<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:56.010> directly<00:00:56.129> down

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
make sure not to place it directly down

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.810 
make sure not to place it directly down
it<00:00:56.910> has<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.329> be<00:00:57.449> against<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.809> wall<00:00:58.489> ok<00:00:59.489> your

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
it has to be against the wall ok your

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.100 
it has to be against the wall ok your
water<00:01:00.090> which<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:01.789> somehow<00:01:02.789> do<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:03.120> have<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.809> my

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
water which I somehow do not have in my

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.190 
water which I somehow do not have in my
inventory<00:01:05.810> will<00:01:06.810> go<00:01:06.930> here<00:01:08.150> your<00:01:09.150> lava<00:01:09.330> will<00:01:10.049> go

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
inventory will go here your lava will go

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.399 
inventory will go here your lava will go
here<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:12.110> it<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.260> already<00:01:13.530> functioning<00:01:15.409> as

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
here and it is already functioning as

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.070 
here and it is already functioning as
you<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.860> see<00:01:17.070> what<00:01:17.790> happens<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.659> redstone

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
you can see what happens is the redstone

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.969 
you can see what happens is the redstone
torch<00:01:19.460> will<00:01:20.460> pass<00:01:20.700> power<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.500> to<00:01:22.500> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
torch will pass power in to the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.310 
torch will pass power in to the
cobblestone<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:23.970> created<00:01:24.540> by<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.020> lava

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
cobblestone that is created by the lava

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.340 
cobblestone that is created by the lava
and<00:01:25.439> water<00:01:25.740> mixing<00:01:26.509> directly<00:01:27.509> which<00:01:27.900> will

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
and water mixing directly which will

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.980 
and water mixing directly which will
indirectly<00:01:29.000> power<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:31.049> breaker<00:01:32.030> now<00:01:33.030> there

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
indirectly power the breaker now there

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.590 
indirectly power the breaker now there
is<00:01:34.170> one<00:01:34.409> flaw<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.979> design<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.329> is

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
is one flaw to this design and that is

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.039 
is one flaw to this design and that is
that<00:01:36.950> occasionally<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.700> will<00:01:38.939> jam<00:01:39.420> up<00:01:39.630> if<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
that occasionally it will jam up if the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.780 
that occasionally it will jam up if the
cobblestone<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.619> generated<00:01:41.100> too<00:01:41.220> quickly

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
cobblestone is generated too quickly

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.940 
cobblestone is generated too quickly
and<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> solution<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.380> place<00:01:43.680> 1

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and the solution to that is to place 1

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.670 
and the solution to that is to place 1
redstone<00:01:44.159> right<00:01:44.670> here<00:01:45.049> what<00:01:46.049> will<00:01:46.170> happen<00:01:46.530> is

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
redstone right here what will happen is

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.910 
redstone right here what will happen is
while<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.850> cobblestone<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.479> there<00:01:48.920> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
while the cobblestone is there the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.690 
while the cobblestone is there the
combination<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.060> redstone<00:01:51.540> torch<00:01:51.899> with

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
combination of this redstone torch with

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.330 
combination of this redstone torch with
this<00:01:53.990> redstone<00:01:54.990> dust<00:01:55.229> will<00:01:56.040> cause<00:01:56.219> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
this redstone dust will cause the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.819 
this redstone dust will cause the
redstone<00:01:56.700> dust<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.969> pulse<00:01:57.350> passing<00:01:58.350> power<00:01:58.530> on

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
redstone dust a pulse passing power on

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.120 
redstone dust a pulse passing power on
and<00:01:59.040> off<00:01:59.390> through<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.869> cobblestone<00:02:01.439> into<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
and off through the cobblestone into the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.219 
and off through the cobblestone into the
breaker<00:02:02.369> allowing<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.270> power<00:02:03.509> off<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
breaker allowing it to power off and

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.690 
breaker allowing it to power off and
then<00:02:04.469> back<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:04.680> clearing<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.670> jam<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.469> that

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
then back on clearing the jam and that

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.860 
then back on clearing the jam and that
is<00:02:08.619> my<00:02:09.619> single<00:02:10.039> o'clock<00:02:10.610> less<00:02:10.870> cobblestone
