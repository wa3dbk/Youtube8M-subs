doing for breakfast so some people that

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.339 
doing for breakfast so some people that
aren't<00:00:09.090> in<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.240> program<00:00:09.750> were<00:00:09.960> worried<00:00:10.320> about

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
aren't in the program were worried about

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.379 
aren't in the program were worried about
the<00:00:10.620> complexity<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.670> I<00:00:11.759> want<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.030> just<00:00:12.210> give

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
the complexity and I want to just give

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.240 
the complexity and I want to just give
you<00:00:12.420> an<00:00:12.599> idea<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.019> how<00:00:13.259> simple<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:13.860> program

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
you an idea of how simple this program

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.310 
you an idea of how simple this program
is<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.969> is<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.269> nutrition<00:00:15.719> plan<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:16.109> comes

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
is this is the nutrition plan that comes

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.060 
is this is the nutrition plan that comes
with<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.500> p90x<00:00:16.980> program<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:18.029> in<00:00:18.570> here<00:00:19.070> this

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
with a p90x program and in here this

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.070 
with a p90x program and in here this
looks<00:00:20.310> pretty<00:00:20.580> complete<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:21.630> gives<00:00:21.840> you

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
looks pretty complete it gives you

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.950 
looks pretty complete it gives you
different<00:00:22.680> phases<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.939> can<00:00:24.180> be<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> part

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
different phases that you can be a part

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.839 
different phases that you can be a part
of<00:00:25.050> there's<00:00:25.320> phase<00:00:25.529> one<00:00:25.830> which<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.670> fat

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
of there's phase one which is fat

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.490 
of there's phase one which is fat
shredder<00:00:27.240> or<00:00:27.480> phase<00:00:27.689> 2<00:00:27.960> which<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.289> energy

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
shredder or phase 2 which is energy

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.679 
shredder or phase 2 which is energy
booster<00:00:28.980> or<00:00:29.189> phase<00:00:29.519> 3<00:00:29.880> which<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.150> endurance

Maximizer<00:00:31.260> which<00:00:31.650> unless<00:00:32.460> you're<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:32.759> a

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
Maximizer which unless you're like a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.549 
Maximizer which unless you're like a
professional<00:00:33.719> athlete<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.170> probably<00:00:34.410> aren't

professional athlete you probably aren't

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.470 
professional athlete you probably aren't
going<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.770> be<00:00:34.860> touching<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.280> one<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.210> it

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
going to be touching that one so it

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.500 
going to be touching that one so it
tells<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.870> then<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.649> can<00:00:37.920> do<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.640> portion

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510
