on into the sand

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.340 
on into the sand
this<00:01:50.939> causes<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.360> large<00:01:51.720> pillars<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.229> her

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
this causes the large pillars of her

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.170 
this causes the large pillars of her
surrounding<00:01:52.860> area<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.130> rise<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.909> because

surrounding area to rise and because

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.670 
surrounding area to rise and because
they're<00:01:54.360> attached<00:01:54.720> by<00:01:54.960> chains<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.500> will

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
they're attached by chains this will

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.350 
they're attached by chains this will
lift<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.040> large<00:01:56.310> black<00:01:56.640> stone<00:01:56.939> out<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
lift a large black stone out of the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.210 
lift a large black stone out of the
ground<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:58.229> along<00:01:58.500> with<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.710> platform<00:01:58.920> that

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
ground and along with a platform that

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.289 
ground and along with a platform that
comes<00:01:59.369> out<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.640> sand<00:01:59.880> as<00:01:59.970> well

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
comes out of the sand as well

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.849 
comes out of the sand as well
so<00:02:00.780> these<00:02:00.840> will<00:02:01.020> come<00:02:01.109> important<00:02:01.590> here<00:02:01.740> in

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:01.859 
so these will come important here in

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:03.200 
so these will come important here in
just<00:02:02.039> a<00:02:02.130> moment<00:02:02.250> we'll<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.549> able<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.820> use<00:02:03.000> them

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
just a moment we'll be able to use them

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.569 
just a moment we'll be able to use them
so<00:02:03.960> now<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.170> we<00:02:04.289> have<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.619> war<00:02:05.039> portal<00:02:05.399> for

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
so now that we have the war portal for

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.520 
so now that we have the war portal for
this<00:02:05.729> location<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.659> actually<00:02:06.840> warp<00:02:07.350> back

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
this location we can actually warp back

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.889 
this location we can actually warp back
here<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.009> return<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.640> boss<00:02:09.539> chamber

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.969 
here and return to the boss chamber
where<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.140> fought<00:02:10.319> style<00:02:10.649> Lord

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
where we fought style Lord

him<00:05:37.050> anyway<00:05:37.349> so<00:05:38.280> now<00:05:38.610> they<00:05:38.729> have<00:05:38.880> to<00:05:38.970> do

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
him anyway so now they have to do

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.670 
him anyway so now they have to do
something<00:05:39.389> really<00:05:39.570> quick<00:05:39.750> so<00:05:40.110> they<00:05:40.320> use<00:05:40.530> the

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
something really quick so they use the

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.260 
something really quick so they use the
evil<00:05:40.949> power<00:05:41.130> of<00:05:41.340> the<00:05:41.490> mirror<00:05:41.699> of<00:05:41.759> Twilight<00:05:41.880> as

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
evil power of the mirror of Twilight as

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.120 
evil power of the mirror of Twilight as
a<00:05:42.300> last<00:05:42.539> resort<00:05:42.690> to<00:05:43.259> seal<00:05:43.500> Ganondorf<00:05:43.949> away

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
a last resort to seal Ganondorf away

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.320 
a last resort to seal Ganondorf away
within<00:05:44.400> the<00:05:44.580> land<00:05:44.759> of<00:05:44.880> the<00:05:44.940> Twilight

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
within the land of the Twilight

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.180 
within the land of the Twilight
previously<00:05:46.020> known<00:05:46.199> as<00:05:46.229> the<00:05:46.500> dark<00:05:46.680> interlopers

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
previously known as the dark interlopers

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.890 
previously known as the dark interlopers
so<00:05:47.729> the<00:05:47.849> process<00:05:48.240> the<00:05:48.330> sword<00:05:48.570> of<00:05:48.630> the<00:05:48.690> sages

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
so the process the sword of the sages

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.140 
so the process the sword of the sages
gets<00:05:49.650> sucked<00:05:49.889> into<00:05:50.039> the<00:05:50.400> Twilight<00:05:50.880> Realm<00:05:50.909> as

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
gets sucked into the Twilight Realm as

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.719 
gets sucked into the Twilight Realm as
well<00:05:51.330> so<00:05:51.659> that's<00:05:51.840> lame<00:05:52.219> so<00:05:53.219> this<00:05:53.340> will<00:05:53.520> seal

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
well so that's lame so this will seal

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:55.399 
well so that's lame so this will seal
get<00:05:53.909> it<00:05:54.030> over<00:05:54.180> way<00:05:54.449> for<00:05:54.599> our<00:05:54.690> time<00:05:54.900> but<00:05:55.169> as<00:05:55.349> you

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 
get it over way for our time but as you

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:57.110 
get it over way for our time but as you
can<00:05:55.650> already<00:05:55.800> tell<00:05:55.889> this<00:05:56.070> is<00:05:56.460> not<00:05:56.880> going<00:05:56.969> to<00:05:57.060> be

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
can already tell this is not going to be

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.210 
can already tell this is not going to be

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
the last were ever to see of him

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.070 
the last were ever to see of him
now<00:05:59.790> in<00:05:59.910> previous<00:06:00.060> solo<00:06:00.420> titles<00:06:00.840> there<00:06:00.990> have

now in previous solo titles there have

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.330 
now in previous solo titles there have
been<00:06:01.200> other<00:06:01.440> sages<00:06:01.710> who<00:06:01.950> have<00:06:02.040> died<00:06:02.190> as<00:06:02.310> well

like this making this the first elven

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:06.980 
like this making this the first elven
game<00:06:05.940> where<00:06:06.120> we<00:06:06.210> have<00:06:06.330> actually<00:06:06.600> seen<00:06:06.840> the

the<00:06:09.180> only<00:06:09.360> salt<00:06:09.660> title<00:06:10.050> where<00:06:10.230> the<00:06:10.380> sages<00:06:10.590> had

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:10.920 
the only salt title where the sages had

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.560 
the only salt title where the sages had
such<00:06:11.100> an<00:06:11.190> odd<00:06:11.340> appearance<00:06:11.460> in<00:06:11.970> past<00:06:12.360> titles

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
such an odd appearance in past titles

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:13.610 
such an odd appearance in past titles
they<00:06:12.810> have<00:06:12.900> looked<00:06:13.050> more<00:06:13.170> like<00:06:13.230> regular

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620

people
but<00:06:14.220> in<00:06:14.280> this<00:06:14.370> one<00:06:14.550> they're<00:06:14.730> all<00:06:14.850> disconnected

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
but in this one they're all disconnected

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.820 
but in this one they're all disconnected
from<00:06:15.510> their<00:06:15.690> body<00:06:15.840> parts<00:06:16.110> and<00:06:16.290> all<00:06:16.380> glowy<00:06:16.650> and

with that history lesson out of the way
our<00:06:20.700> perspective<00:06:21.150> changes<00:06:21.480> back<00:06:21.630> to<00:06:21.690> the

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
our perspective changes back to the

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.600 
our perspective changes back to the
present<00:06:22.260> where<00:06:22.620> the<00:06:22.680> sages<00:06:23.010> are<00:06:23.130> explaining

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
present where the sages are explaining

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.860 
present where the sages are explaining
that<00:06:23.730> they<00:06:23.850> pursued<00:06:24.180> the<00:06:24.300> evil<00:06:24.570> power<00:06:24.750> that

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:24.870 
that they pursued the evil power that

that they pursued the evil power that
Zant<00:06:25.200> now<00:06:25.320> possesses<00:06:25.770> is<00:06:25.950> actually<00:06:26.310> that<00:06:26.430> of

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
Zant now possesses is actually that of

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.950 
Zant now possesses is actually that of
Ganondorf<00:06:27.000> which<00:06:27.390> makes<00:06:27.600> him<00:06:27.720> a<00:06:27.810> very

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
Ganondorf which makes him a very

Ganondorf which makes him a very

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
he got his power from at this point

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.520 
he got his power from at this point
because<00:06:32.910> it's<00:06:33.090> too<00:06:33.210> late<00:06:33.330> to<00:06:33.450> stop<00:06:33.660> it<00:06:33.840> say

ruler of the Twilight can break the

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
mirror Twilight for good this is because

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.370 
mirror Twilight for good this is because
the<00:06:39.150> mirror<00:06:39.360> was<00:06:39.450> probably<00:06:39.750> created<00:06:40.260> by<00:06:40.320> the

the mirror was probably created by the

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.020 
the mirror was probably created by the
rulers<00:06:40.770> of<00:06:40.890> the<00:06:40.980> Twilight<00:06:41.370> or<00:06:41.490> rather<00:06:41.790> the

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
dark universe in ancient times because

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.130 
dark universe in ancient times because
of<00:06:44.550> this<00:06:44.760> Zant<00:06:45.120> can<00:06:45.300> only<00:06:45.450> break<00:06:45.750> up<00:06:45.990> the

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.140 
of this Zant can only break up the

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.420 
of this Zant can only break up the
mirror<00:06:46.350> of<00:06:46.410> Twilight<00:06:46.500> into<00:06:46.830> pieces<00:06:47.250> and

mirror of Twilight into pieces and

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.670 
mirror of Twilight into pieces and
scatter<00:06:47.940> them<00:06:48.150> across<00:06:48.360> Hyrule<00:06:48.810> essentially

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 
scatter them across Hyrule essentially

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.810 
scatter them across Hyrule essentially
this<00:06:49.830> means<00:06:49.980> we<00:06:50.160> have<00:06:50.250> a<00:06:50.280> few<00:06:50.490> more<00:06:50.610> dungeons

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:50.820 
this means we have a few more dungeons

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.180 
this means we have a few more dungeons
before<00:06:51.210> we<00:06:51.300> can<00:06:51.420> actually<00:06:51.510> face<00:06:51.870> and<00:06:52.200> the

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.190 
before we can actually face and the

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.100 
before we can actually face and the
sages<00:06:53.460> also<00:06:53.730> vaguely<00:06:54.180> know<00:06:54.450> the<00:06:54.570> locations<00:06:54.990> of
