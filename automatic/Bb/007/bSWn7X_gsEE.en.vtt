00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.859
 today we see the score &amp; lt values ​​of the main nights 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.029
 first of all 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:08.519
 the score 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.649
 if there are percussions especially only one element 

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:15.789
 usually the simply perfect monolith is used 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.460
 the battery is not a musical instrument 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.609
 what a fat 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.759
 of the blacks of the nights there are days ago sol I give you 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.149
 matera simply has 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.149
 a presentation on his mind is required 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.180
 as I said before in the t3 case a single element on the monolith TVs 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.820
 instead with the battery since it is uncovered 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.280
 talking about how many items on TV at the same time. alternating 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.110
 if you are ibiza the usual pentagrammati is also used with other instruments 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.940
 and lost time 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.180
 define 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.560
 and positions 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.630
 kideo every imposition is attributed therefore it is an element 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.180
 for now we will only use one position to get used to the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.100
 pentagram but at the same time 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.770
 don't get too confused 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.440
 the position we take will in fact be that 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.760
 from the ibm enzo valley, therefore, the square rises to descend 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.320
 ebay corresponding to the island 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.950
 alano alano rates 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.090
 this position 'I declare myself 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.450
 the rhythm to play on our moment 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.280
 - to you who went to introduce now 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.860
 are 3 types 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.310
 the four-quarter one that consists 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.030
 an empty ball 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.830
 the one from two quarters 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.600
 which consists 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.800
 d an empty dot with a barline pointing down an upwards 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.649
 the one with a quarter that corresponds has a full ball 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.740
 plastik the plug 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.740
 down I lost the top 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.340
 this night that year value 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.300
 these notes take on a certain value 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.770
 based on the hourglass time 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.139
 and based on speed and they were beautiful Vasto 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:15.649
 the speed of execution you see the beats per minute 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:19.069
 so if it is 60 beats per minute 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:21.210
 a culp 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.499
 or a quarter 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:28.119
 then every second there is 60 culture cults in our minute 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:34.489
 if instead we will have a time of 120 you can tell us every half second corresponds to 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.040
 a quarter and so on, while increasing the speed, moves away, 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:45.189
 if instead we go to see the teeth present in the score the times 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.329
 main who wants to produce only four quarters 

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:51.769
 the three quarters your current 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.059
 and four classic time matches found 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:58.139
 the simplest ingredients 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.609
 d any song 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:06.799
 the patty picture is made up of a guide to beats that contain the words of the 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.769
 time four quarters or I can totò wave 4 nights by a quarter 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.569
 2 nights from two quarters of a moon 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.679
 a night of four quarters and various combinations however the regular one 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:22.779
 within each bar 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:26.889
 the sum in the value of the notes must be 4square 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.289
 three quarters to the analogous motorcycle 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:32.479
 he said it's called that quarter 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.059
 it will take 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:35.940
 quarter night 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.189
 the joke 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:38.099
 or 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.369
 one from two quarters 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:41.169
 1 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.109
 a down down 4 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.029
 in the case of your neighborhood photo or video 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:47.409
 one night from 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:48.529
 a quarter 

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:52.239
 and once again from a quarter I also have a single note 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.379
 from the value of 200 Dante dalvalorede your heart 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:59.189
 these carrots 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.389
 consist 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.250
 lg capable of first approach 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.450
 to what are the values ​​of the notes and their richness 

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:10.379
 in fact the following magnitudes 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.599
 I will do 2 exercises 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.120
 that healthy for all made up only of these 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.930
 tretre
