00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.440 

glitter<00:01:33.659> chunks<00:01:34.229> basically<00:01:35.189> ignore<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.180> I

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
glitter chunks basically ignore this I

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.730 
glitter chunks basically ignore this I
will<00:01:36.600> explain<00:01:36.630> why<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.110> snails<00:01:37.380> chipping

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
will explain why the snails chipping

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.600 
will explain why the snails chipping
later<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.520> um<00:01:39.500> they're<00:01:40.500> very<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.250> can

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
later but um they're very in so you can

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.359 
later but um they're very in so you can
wear<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.270> its<00:01:42.299> own<00:01:42.509> /<00:01:42.990> click<00:01:43.290> over<00:01:43.590> nothing

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
wear it on its own / click over nothing

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.940 
wear it on its own / click over nothing
and<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:45.540> would<00:01:45.720> look<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.320> if<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.770> did

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and it would look like this if you did

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.469 
and it would look like this if you did
that<00:01:47.689> basically<00:01:49.009> however<00:01:50.009> it's<00:01:50.490> designed<00:01:51.000> to

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
that basically however it's designed to

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.139 
that basically however it's designed to
be<00:01:51.810> particularly<00:01:52.770> pretty<00:01:53.250> when<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.700> layer<00:01:53.909> it

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
be particularly pretty when you layer it

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.679 
be particularly pretty when you layer it
over<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:56.490> pastel<00:01:57.060> shades<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.420> are<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.600> this

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
over the pastel shades that are in this

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.030 
over the pastel shades that are in this
collection<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.380> will<00:01:58.530> show<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.920> at

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
collection and I will show you that at

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.709 
collection and I will show you that at
the<00:01:59.100> very<00:01:59.130> end<00:01:59.430> it's<00:02:00.060> very<00:02:00.119> unique<00:02:00.540> it's

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
the very end it's very unique it's
