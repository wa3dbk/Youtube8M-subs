00:00:02.643 --> 00:00:07.555
 We need people to interact with other people 

00:00:08.063 --> 00:00:12.150
 he is as passionate as what they are creating. 

00:00:13.678 --> 00:00:18.634
 That creates an atmosphere and defines what we do and what we are as a company. 

00:00:19.764 --> 00:00:22.854
 Something that would stand out from working here is our culture. 

00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:26.804
 It is pure motivation. It is quality first of all. 

00:00:26.964 --> 00:00:31.031
 It is all that is recorded next to the orc, in the main courtyard. 

00:00:33.028 --> 00:00:36.040
 Each element of the games is the fruit of our passion. 

00:00:37.095 --> 00:00:41.000
 When you surround yourself with people who also seek perfection 

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:45.922
 everyone makes content better and better ... It's wonderful. 

00:00:46.982 --> 00:00:51.100
 We are looking for people who try to fill a vacuum continuously 

00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:56.380
 and to say: "This is great but I want to do it even better". 

00:00:58.873 --> 00:01:00.793
 Blizzard is a very special place. 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.252
 We have the resources of a publicly traded company 

00:01:04.437 --> 00:01:07.826
 but we also maintain a level of commitment 

00:01:08.203 --> 00:01:10.858
 which is only seen in small companies. 

00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:14.609
 Although we have grown a lot and we have this campus 

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:18.381
 I still feel that we are all here to make great games. 

00:01:19.075 --> 00:01:22.726
 We want to offer an amazing gaming experience. 

00:01:22.886 --> 00:01:25.999
 Because we want the same for us. 

00:01:31.313 --> 00:01:34.217
 It's like a work of art that you enjoy admiring 

00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:37.132
 and at the same time you contribute to it. 

00:01:38.388 --> 00:01:41.543
 In such an environment, creative people give their best. 

00:01:42.072 --> 00:01:46.340
 And our creativity is not limited to artists and musicians 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.509
 all departments help in the development. 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.262
 Although I do not participate directly in the development 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.888
 I am very linked to the game during its creation. 

00:01:58.236 --> 00:02:00.206
 Everyone can contribute their ideas 

00:02:00.366 --> 00:02:03.809
 and maybe the best does not come from the development team. 

00:02:04.116 --> 00:02:05.390
 That is the best. 

00:02:09.675 --> 00:02:13.924
 Motivates a lot to work in a place where they want to hear your opinion. 

00:02:14.688 --> 00:02:16.983
 In the credits of our games it says: 

00:02:17.143 --> 00:02:20.261
 "Designed by Blizzard Entertainment" and it is. 

00:02:21.063 --> 00:02:23.036
 We are looking for people who want to collaborate. 

00:02:23.196 --> 00:02:28.008
 If you help someone to improve something, it will help you with something else. 

00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:29.985
 And, together, we improve the game. 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:34.764
 We not only create experiences, we also create relationships. 

00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:39.095
 The reason is that we tell stories or create gaming experiences 

00:02:39.314 --> 00:02:42.402
 They speak a language that everyone understands. 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.649
 The ability to bring people together with a common passion is incredible. 

00:02:49.398 --> 00:02:51.965
 It's very rewarding to create something 

00:02:52.263 --> 00:02:56.379
 who love and share so many people around the world. 

00:02:56.655 --> 00:02:58.559
 This is where dreams are created. 

00:03:02.447 --> 00:03:07.934
 Blizzard has always believed in supporting talented people 

00:03:08.202 --> 00:03:12.795
 making them talk to each other Let them learn and grow together ... 

00:03:12.956 --> 00:03:15.533
 All employees have a great opportunity 

00:03:15.693 --> 00:03:18.843
 to train, that includes: classes on various topics 

00:03:19.003 --> 00:03:23.108
 specific programs, time management, processes ... 

00:03:23.767 --> 00:03:26.880
 Blizzard Academy is unique in the video game industry. 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.407
 It is our responsibility to help employees evolve and change 

00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:35.695
 constantly to create the best games. 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.255
 Our employees are our most important resource 

00:03:39.415 --> 00:03:42.015
 and we try to support them in everything we can. 

00:03:43.011 --> 00:03:46.294
 We always maximize all our activities. 

00:03:47.902 --> 00:03:50.971
 People enjoy knowing that they can experience 

00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:53.090
 without fear, try new things ... 

00:03:53.707 --> 00:03:57.380
 We have a wonderful community within our company. 

00:03:58.324 --> 00:04:00.590
 We are ... a lot of geeks. 

00:04:01.398 --> 00:04:05.564
 I can be myself in the office. 

00:04:06.296 --> 00:04:07.865
 I can have a life here. 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.207
 I think I can talk to anyone here, whether I know it or not 

00:04:12.367 --> 00:04:14.661
 and have a connection instantly. 

00:04:15.278 --> 00:04:19.770
 I feel that, when I come to work, I am spending time with my friends. 

00:04:20.167 --> 00:04:25.117
 It's great to work with who you appreciate inside and outside of work. 

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:28.090
 We have an incredible mix. 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.888
 We are a great company, with very successful products. It's very exciting. 

00:04:38.173 --> 00:04:42.330
 Because the work we do sees it and many people appreciate it. 

00:04:42.756 --> 00:04:45.690
 But many people also analyze it in detail. 

00:04:46.223 --> 00:04:49.898
 When you play a game with your friends, you try to beat them 

00:04:50.058 --> 00:04:52.506
 playing within a series of rules. 

00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:55.143
 We compete with other developers. 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.446
 What kind of company do we want to be? In what world do we want to live? 

00:05:00.013 --> 00:05:02.908
 One thing is to work for one of the best companies 

00:05:03.073 --> 00:05:06.485
 and another to find a leading company that also 

00:05:06.645 --> 00:05:09.024
 have such a deep ethical sense. 

00:05:09.558 --> 00:05:13.393
 I do not do it just because I love it: I really believe in what we do. 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.235
 Why Blizzard? It's like asking: why do you want to work in the 

00:05:18.395 --> 00:05:21.491
 Apollo space program or in the Enterprise? 

00:05:22.256 --> 00:05:27.109
 Sometimes I wonder if we will intimidate people from outside the company. 

00:05:27.784 --> 00:05:30.654
 We all had a lot to learn at the beginning. 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.007
 If we have achieved some degree of excellence, it will have been 

00:05:35.299 --> 00:05:40.258
 because we invest in each other, and we have decided to take that path 

00:05:40.739 --> 00:05:42.819
 as a culture ... as friends. 

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:46.189
 And I think that sums it up.
