 is the specialized epic comp it is in the 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.700
 a a light bike these tips well 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.470
 it is a mishmash of parts 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.020
 rider we come from for bella 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.120
 the switching system is from from for find 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.100
 you a rockshox fork

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.190
 to detect the brain part or 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.870
 a power from below comes therefore one 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.060
 bump or that you prepare us for 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.520
 above that takes power off the bike 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.650
 only exercises at the bottom 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.030
 opportunity force the suspension will respond 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.890
 so if you are so hard on the stairs 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.570
