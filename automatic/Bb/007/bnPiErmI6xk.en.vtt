00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.289
 looks and the exercise itself 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:25.590
 maximum will sag poetic 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:30.960
 thoracic spine and maximally 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.829
 gets caught up on the belly that is 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.090
 it will be a vacuum effect 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.989
 exercise has a pronounced 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.989
 cleansing effect 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:01:00.220

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.450
 pelvic and abdominal cavity 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.470
 participate as much as possible in the process 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.790
 self-massage and what seems to be important 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:19.240
 you have this spine to draw the stomach in but 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:22.229
 there is a load on the lateral muscles and 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.750
 after this exercise significantly 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.390
 decreases waist do not believe spend 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.710
 test measure your waist before exercise and 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.700
 after its execution 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.590
 if the waist volume has decreased it says 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.670
 about the fact that the exercises are done with high quality 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.420
 we act on peristalsis 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.080
 intestinal kidney they are also exposed 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.530
 massage 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.180
 cheese you what load accordingly 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.210
 urinary system works 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.060
 much better with this exercise 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.720
 the whole body works many active hands 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.350
 actively neck head tedious abdominal cell 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.440
 pelvic cavity every section 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.690
 bodies work well 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.460
 by the way here is invaluable help mentor 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.040
 these exercises bring results only 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.280
 then when done correctly people are not 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.420
 notice how even many are drawn 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.750
 bend over 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.150
 fingering have them not as 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.720
 need examples of the body falls down 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.730
 or before downward is meant either back 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.620
 any god by these signs 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.150
 the instructor can determine which 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.430
 human health problems 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.320
 the work is difficult because the instructor 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.120
 only works with small groups not 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.120
 more than five people spine 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:50.000
 starts today 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.330
 he stretches him we restor 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.830
 disagrees and accordingly we 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:00.860
 stretch the vertebrae 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:03.800
 and the vertebrae are trying to sit down krimoza 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.890
 so if you notice i constantly 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.390
 heading to do this exercise is not 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.980
 I just know it for myself 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.980
 and even harder to do it right 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.670
 Venus is correcting then this person 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.670
 which yourself
