 the house of the sun he proposes to work 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:21.650
 is in the sense of not taking care of 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:24.410
 need more people than to try 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.760
 to develop within their 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.789
 capacity is believed to be a 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.680
 children and young adults do not 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.300
 have the possibility to develop 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.300
 mother together 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.970
 so call a boy who meets 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:51.660
 people with special needs 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:54.540
 there started in 1986 from 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.030
 medical professionals 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.970
 we have several very complicated situations 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.250
 even so to the point that you shut up 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.710
 now the house is closing is by situation 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.870
 financial same from 2000s 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.369
 we started working 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:13.260
 systematically with the training a 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:16.670
 process of professionalization does not 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.700
 has the title pt tropia with this has 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.410
 a legitimacy and even before the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.300
 public bodies and does not have 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.890
 benefits others all 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.930
 in short, what does it mean that people 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.930
 have to turn around with what advice 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.200
 already aa 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.829
 if the pedagogical part in general 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.189
 that the service to them the attendance to 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.960
 they are that in my point of view it is 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.930
 complete and perfect 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.820
 the group needed more than one 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.110
 speech therapist 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.509
 I introduced myself and then a year later I 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.630
 I was invited to be a teacher. 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:11.030
 with time everything happened and 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.590
 I ended up picking up the speech of small non 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.620
 have a child care service 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.200
 more serious from the functional point of view 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:25.480
 hotel people do different and activities 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.530
 of handicrafts on the skin 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.299
 from the beginning I've done several 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:36.650
 activities in blacksmith sealing paper 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:38.959
 recycled candle work in clay as 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.120
 activities are all in the life of a 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:46.030
 kid 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:49.510
 development is preparing them for 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.430
 any extra school activity is 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.620
 essential that they learn here 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.409
 some learn more easily and 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.569
 another with one with less possibilities 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:01.390
 that sometimes has a thing that 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.560
 seems so silly played mac so easy 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.560
 great for them, right? 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.010
 chin 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.610
 we see that day by day with them 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.520
 them if he wants to be culturally 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.550
 that we try is to make each 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.640
 one to develop the most possible their 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.540
 potential is to show the world 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.880
 that the specials are not different from 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.610
 normal children who only need to 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.960
 bound by all in them is well 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.850
 It's interesting to see that we 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.470
 people who spend the day here making bread 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.610
 with us at least open to me 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:49.060
 deep and leaves people like me 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.480
 I said after the game but more 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:59.260
 dependent for military purposes which 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:01.720
 happens here realize that how 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.760
 beautiful to see the result of the work 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.910
 gratifying 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.590
 seeing the students progressing and even 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.490
 their deficiencies, how do they 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:17.770
 can still be included in the company 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:21.220
 it is worth keeping who can give too 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:24.540
 your support and any order I went to 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.540
