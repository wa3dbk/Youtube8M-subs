00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
get into the solo because it's it's a

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.589 
get into the solo because it's it's a
hot<00:00:25.650> mess<00:00:25.920> that's<00:00:26.279> for<00:00:26.490> sure<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:29.390> here's<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
hot mess that's for sure so here's the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:50.819 
hot mess that's for sure so here's the
rift

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.490 

um<00:00:51.829> basically<00:00:52.579> something<00:00:53.089> like<00:00:53.359> that<00:00:53.600> pretty

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
um basically something like that pretty

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.740 
um basically something like that pretty
close<00:00:54.710> I<00:00:54.949> mean<00:00:55.100> that's<00:00:55.190> a<00:00:55.750> rough

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
close I mean that's a rough

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.520 
close I mean that's a rough
approximation<00:00:56.870> of<00:00:57.829> the<00:00:58.010> riff<00:00:58.430> so<00:00:59.120> it<00:00:59.930> starts

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
approximation of the riff so it starts

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.899 
approximation of the riff so it starts
