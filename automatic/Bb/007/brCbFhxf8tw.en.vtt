00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.319 
world that's that's harder than that I
mean<00:03:19.650> if<00:03:19.739> they're<00:03:20.190> all<00:03:20.340> hard<00:03:20.670> when<00:03:21.030> I<00:03:21.060> write

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
mean if they're all hard when I write

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.490 
mean if they're all hard when I write
when<00:03:21.569> I<00:03:21.630> get<00:03:21.810> there<00:03:21.989> because<00:03:22.049> I've<00:03:22.260> never<00:03:22.349> been

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
when I get there because I've never been

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.100 
when I get there because I've never been
there<00:03:22.709> before<00:03:22.829> but<00:03:23.069> like<00:03:23.400> Burnside<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.480> do<00:03:24.720> to

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
there before but like Burnside to do to

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.740 
there before but like Burnside to do to
skate<00:03:25.410> Burnside<00:03:25.920> correctly<00:03:26.579> it's<00:03:27.420> very

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
skate Burnside correctly it's very

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.910 
skate Burnside correctly it's very
difficult<00:03:28.200> like<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:28.500> can<00:03:28.620> go<00:03:28.739> there<00:03:28.890> and

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
difficult like you can go there and

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.620 
difficult like you can go there and
skate<00:03:29.220> Burnside<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:29.819> go<00:03:29.940> there<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.209> push<00:03:30.450> and

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
skate Burnside and go there and push and

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.900 
skate Burnside and go there and push and
film<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.930> trick<00:03:31.140> but<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.440> actually<00:03:31.590> like<00:03:31.920> get

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
film a trick but to actually like get

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.000 
film a trick but to actually like get
lines<00:03:33.239> at<00:03:33.569> Burnside<00:03:33.840> without<00:03:34.349> pushing<00:03:34.650> and

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
lines at Burnside without pushing and

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.130 
lines at Burnside without pushing and
actually<00:03:35.400> using<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.849> park<00:03:36.090> properly<00:03:36.690> that's

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
actually using the park properly that's

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.750 
actually using the park properly that's
definitely<00:03:37.739> I<00:03:37.829> would<00:03:37.950> say<00:03:38.069> Burnside<00:03:38.730> is

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
definitely I would say Burnside is

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.340 
definitely I would say Burnside is
harder<00:03:39.090> because<00:03:39.209> it's<00:03:39.420> more<00:03:39.569> spread<00:03:39.959> out<00:03:39.989> with

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
harder because it's more spread out with

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.170 
harder because it's more spread out with
less<00:03:40.650> little<00:03:40.950> area<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.430> catch<00:03:41.579> speed<00:03:41.970> off<00:03:42.150> of

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
less little area to catch speed off of

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.289 
less little area to catch speed off of
sure<00:03:42.959> so<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:43.859> would<00:03:44.100> say<00:03:44.280> Burnside's<00:03:44.819> gnarlier

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
sure so I would say Burnside's gnarlier

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.289 
sure so I would say Burnside's gnarlier
really<00:03:45.720> yeah<00:03:46.170> just<00:03:47.069> like<00:03:47.250> just<00:03:47.579> because<00:03:47.880> the

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
really yeah just like just because the

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:06.049 
know I thought I had something wrong
with<00:05:04.649> me<00:05:04.889> when<00:05:05.039> I<00:05:05.129> was<00:05:05.219> a<00:05:05.279> kid<00:05:05.459> it<00:05:05.639> made<00:05:05.759> me<00:05:05.879> feel

00:05:06.049 --> 00:05:06.059 
with me when I was a kid it made me feel

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:07.399 
with me when I was a kid it made me feel
like<00:05:06.239> an<00:05:06.359> alien<00:05:06.479> and<00:05:06.989> then<00:05:07.079> I<00:05:07.229> was

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409 
like an alien and then I was

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:09.229 
like an alien and then I was
home-schooled<00:05:07.619> on<00:05:08.009> top<00:05:08.249> of<00:05:08.399> that<00:05:08.519> and<00:05:08.909> I<00:05:09.119> was

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:09.239 
home-schooled on top of that and I was

00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:11.179 
home-schooled on top of that and I was
an<00:05:09.329> only<00:05:09.479> child<00:05:09.569> on<00:05:09.989> top<00:05:10.229> of<00:05:10.379> that<00:05:10.529> so<00:05:10.919> I<00:05:10.949> had

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:11.189 
an only child on top of that so I had

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:13.989 
an only child on top of that so I had
like<00:05:11.479> kind<00:05:12.479> of<00:05:12.569> just<00:05:12.629> like<00:05:12.989> a<00:05:13.019> weird<00:05:13.289> you<00:05:13.739> know

00:05:13.989 --> 00:05:13.999 
like kind of just like a weird you know

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:16.399 
like kind of just like a weird you know
complex<00:05:14.999> like<00:05:15.359> where<00:05:15.569> I<00:05:15.599> just<00:05:15.689> felt<00:05:15.989> a<00:05:16.259> little

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
complex like where I just felt a little

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:18.229 
complex like where I just felt a little
different<00:05:16.649> and<00:05:17.069> I<00:05:17.399> and<00:05:17.579> I<00:05:17.639> still<00:05:17.969> may<00:05:18.059> be<00:05:18.089> you

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:18.239 
different and I and I still may be you

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:19.399 
different and I and I still may be you
are<00:05:18.269> a<00:05:18.419> little<00:05:18.629> different<00:05:18.959> but<00:05:19.019> those<00:05:19.169> of<00:05:19.319> you

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:19.409 
are a little different but those of you

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:21.109 
are a little different but those of you
have<00:05:19.559> a<00:05:19.799> spur<00:05:20.189> that's<00:05:20.489> the<00:05:20.639> thing<00:05:20.819> I<00:05:20.849> don't

00:05:21.109 --> 00:05:21.119 
have a spur that's the thing I don't

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:23.179 
have a spur that's the thing I don't
think<00:05:21.299> it<00:05:21.539> means<00:05:21.959> that<00:05:22.199> and<00:05:22.589> if<00:05:22.679> it<00:05:22.829> does<00:05:23.009> then

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:23.189 
think it means that and if it does then

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:25.609 
think it means that and if it does then
maybe<00:05:23.369> it's<00:05:23.549> something<00:05:23.759> good<00:05:24.089> but<00:05:25.049> I<00:05:25.379> still

00:05:25.609 --> 00:05:25.619 
maybe it's something good but I still

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:27.079 
maybe it's something good but I still
think<00:05:26.249> that<00:05:26.399> it's<00:05:26.519> just<00:05:26.609> an<00:05:26.849> armchair

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:27.089 
think that it's just an armchair

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:30.019 
think that it's just an armchair
diagnosis<00:05:27.899> because<00:05:28.259> I<00:05:28.589> don't<00:05:29.099> you<00:05:29.699> know<00:05:29.819> I

00:05:30.019 --> 00:05:30.029 
diagnosis because I don't you know I

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:32.569 
diagnosis because I don't you know I
don't<00:05:30.209> feel<00:05:30.949> like<00:05:31.949> there's<00:05:32.159> anything<00:05:32.369> really

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:32.579 
don't feel like there's anything really

00:05:32.579 --> 00:05:33.889 
don't feel like there's anything really
different<00:05:33.149> with<00:05:33.239> me<00:05:33.359> and<00:05:33.479> I'm<00:05:33.539> not<00:05:33.659> really

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:33.899 
different with me and I'm not really

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:35.599 
different with me and I'm not really
Rain<00:05:34.169> Man<00:05:34.199> I<00:05:34.469> can't<00:05:34.829> go<00:05:34.949> to<00:05:35.009> the<00:05:35.129> casino<00:05:35.579> and
