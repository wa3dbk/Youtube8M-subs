00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.240
 can offer you today we are going to 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.200
 be testing 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.200
 what is a goal 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.690
 it's relatively simple 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.890
 of 1.8 horsepower that says 1.8 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.310
 of liters 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.500
 and more or less with 115 horsepower 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.710
 what attract that car is that it has a 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.169
 turbocharger 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.990
 of line and apart from the tube of 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:37.380
 turbocharger 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:39.840
 has a transverse engine 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.160
 that is, it gives the push in a way 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.420
 cross 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.420
 then they give it a little 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.130
 Well, if we did not even get to the room 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.130
 of mile 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.260
 pointing to what 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.010
 120 approximately 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.729
 the test we did right now was in 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.729
 seconds 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.170
 and it was from the first hour we're going to do 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:38.430
 the test at second to see how 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.430
 answer the same as we are right now 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.240
 front right now 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.040
 we give ourselves the third one and it arrived like this 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.600
 have good suspension that pulls well 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.600
 Well the truth is if I recommend you a lot 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.159
 It is worth mentioning that it is a 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.629
 hatchback and they buy the version that has 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.999
 the little tail back to be heavier and 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.540
 therefore going they have less acceleration 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:47.680
 but this version is much recommend 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.680
 Good until next time
