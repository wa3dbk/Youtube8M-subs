00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.580 
actually comes off and I'll see if I can
gingerly<00:00:18.150> open<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.690> up<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.050> pop<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.289> open

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
gingerly open this up and pop it open

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.740 
gingerly open this up and pop it open
for<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.220> can<00:00:20.340> see<00:00:20.580> there<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> safety

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
for you so you can see there is a safety

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.090 
for you so you can see there is a safety
so<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.050> takes<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.410> little<00:00:22.560> bit<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.769> elbow<00:00:23.070> grease

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
so it takes a little bit of elbow grease

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.259 
so it takes a little bit of elbow grease
but<00:00:23.519> there<00:00:23.640> we<00:00:23.730> go<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:24.689> piece<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.199> can<00:00:25.650> wear

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
but there we go that piece you can wear

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.000 
but there we go that piece you can wear
separately<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> collar<00:00:27.810> if<00:00:28.410> you'd<00:00:28.560> like<00:00:28.740> to
