00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
yeah and it's a little early there's not

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.770

a lot of plants in here right you know I

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.000 
a lot of plants in here right you know I
think<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.170> one<00:02:19.350> thing<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.709> wanted<00:02:19.950> to

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
think the one thing that I wanted to

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.370 
think the one thing that I wanted to
show<00:02:20.250> it's<00:02:20.459> kind<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.760> how<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.000> think<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:22.260> if

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
show it's kind of a how to think that if

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.640 
show it's kind of a how to think that if
people<00:02:22.410> wanted<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.220> have<00:02:23.459> a<00:02:23.520> water<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:25.470> call

here
where's<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.890> pond<00:02:37.890> shade<00:02:38.340> called<00:02:38.760> black<00:02:39.180> veil

and it actually keeps the Sun from
getting<00:02:43.680> in<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.010> make<00:02:44.280> letting<00:02:44.760> algae<00:02:45.209> grow

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.449 
all season or do you have to add any
more<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.910> dissipates<00:02:57.570> you<00:02:58.230> can't<00:02:58.590> add<00:02:58.799> more<00:02:59.070> or

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
more it dissipates you can't add more or

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.020 
more it dissipates you can't add more or
I<00:02:59.850> let<00:03:00.810> it<00:03:00.989> stay<00:03:01.830> like<00:03:02.040> this<00:03:02.070> for<00:03:02.519> just<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:02.820> while

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
I let it stay like this for just a while

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.850 
I let it stay like this for just a while
and<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.480> balances<00:03:03.989> out<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.530> don't<00:03:04.769> really

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
and it balances out so I don't really

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.740 
and it balances out so I don't really
need<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.220> add<00:03:05.340> more<00:03:05.640> once<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.239> plant<00:03:06.540> gets

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
need to add more once the plant gets

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.990 
need to add more once the plant gets
growing<00:03:07.110> but<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.320> does<00:03:07.530> stay<00:03:07.769> clear<00:03:08.220> yeah

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000
