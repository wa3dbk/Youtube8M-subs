00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
attention just by touching with a finger

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.920 
attention just by touching with a finger
you<00:01:25.780> can<00:01:25.930> also<00:01:26.080> erase<00:01:27.510> so<00:01:28.510> change<00:01:28.780> the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
you can also erase so change the

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.350 
you can also erase so change the
thickness<00:01:29.110> here<00:01:29.680> then<00:01:30.640> maybe<00:01:30.909> we'll<00:01:31.119> want<00:01:31.299> to

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
thickness here then maybe we'll want to

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.210 
thickness here then maybe we'll want to
show<00:01:31.540> something<00:01:32.020> that<00:01:32.049> it's<00:01:32.320> not<00:01:32.680> inside<00:01:33.040> the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
show something that it's not inside the

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.460 
show something that it's not inside the
device<00:01:33.520> so<00:01:34.509> we<00:01:34.630> go<00:01:34.780> into<00:01:34.930> the<00:01:35.140> visual

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
device so we go into the visual

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.760 
device so we go into the visual
presenter<00:01:35.979> and<00:01:36.899> we<00:01:37.899> will<00:01:38.080> show<00:01:38.350> what<00:01:38.649> the

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
presenter and we will show what the

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.680 
presenter and we will show what the
camera<00:01:39.100> sees<00:01:39.190> immediately<00:01:39.729> without<00:01:40.210> having

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
camera sees immediately without having

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.520 
camera sees immediately without having
to<00:01:40.869> record<00:01:41.229> anything<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:43.540> make<00:01:43.810> it<00:01:43.840> bigger<00:01:44.140> we

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
to record anything so make it bigger we

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.670 
to record anything so make it bigger we
can<00:01:44.710> line<00:01:44.860> it<00:01:44.890> up<00:01:45.100> with<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.340> flash<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:47.229> we<00:01:47.470> can

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
can line it up with a flash so we can

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.800 
can line it up with a flash so we can
see<00:01:47.950> what<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:48.970> camera<00:01:49.119> is<00:01:49.300> saying<00:01:49.660> without

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
see what the camera is saying without

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.190 
see what the camera is saying without
having<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.619> record<00:01:51.009> anything<00:01:51.630> maybe<00:01:52.630> we<00:01:53.080> want

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
having to record anything maybe we want

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.660 
having to record anything maybe we want
to<00:01:53.320> show<00:01:53.470> a<00:01:53.500> brother<00:01:53.800> do<00:01:54.009> something<00:01:54.399> to<00:01:54.550> our

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
to show a brother do something to our

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.870 
to show a brother do something to our
audience<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:56.320> that's<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:57.369> good<00:01:57.490> device<00:01:57.850> for

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
audience so that's the good device for

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.520 
audience so that's the good device for
it<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:03.100> stays<00:02:03.460> three<00:02:03.729> hours<00:02:04.090> with<00:02:04.960> full<00:02:05.200> charge

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
it it stays three hours with full charge

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.310 
it it stays three hours with full charge
just<00:02:06.039> projecting<00:02:06.670> without<00:02:07.390> it<00:02:07.570> you<00:02:07.929> can<00:02:08.110> say

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
just projecting without it you can say

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.410 
just projecting without it you can say
longer<00:02:08.649> live<00:02:08.890> like<00:02:09.070> that's<00:02:09.429> pretty<00:02:09.580> good

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
longer live like that's pretty good

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.220 
longer live like that's pretty good
then<00:02:12.110> maybe<00:02:13.240> I'm<00:02:14.240> going<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.540> show<00:02:14.750> you<00:02:14.780> like

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
then maybe I'm going to show you like

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.890 
then maybe I'm going to show you like
the<00:02:15.470> movie<00:02:15.830> so<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.280> can<00:02:16.580> see<00:02:17.110> factor<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:18.260> out

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
the movie so you can see factor it out

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.470 
the movie so you can see factor it out
if<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:21.050> happens<00:02:21.530> we<00:02:21.860> just<00:02:22.069> have<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.400> put<00:02:23.360> it

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
if that happens we just have to put it

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.180 
if that happens we just have to put it
on<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.660> side<00:02:23.870> if<00:02:24.050> it<00:02:24.530> goes<00:02:24.709> into<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.069> right

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
on the side if it goes into the right

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.680 
on the side if it goes into the right
position
