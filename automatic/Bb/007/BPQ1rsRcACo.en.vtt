00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.070
 very good guys here we are in others 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.930
 gta languages 5 like who this cases 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.580
 I bring a cool trick as you see this 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.900
 here inside my garage and very handsome 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.580
 As you know, it does a lot of 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.320
 time ago before Christmas 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.419
 last year a trick came out in which 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.039
 We could drive cars through the garage 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.019
 no politicians seems to be that to rockstar 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.400
 in this new use they are there is 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.080
 He has fared a little hands so 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.609
 say it and there is one thing that they have got into 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.960
 this new use which if the 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.910
 we do then we can drive the cars 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.140
 for the garage it's worth it and very kids, because 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.640
 requirements are that there must be 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.619
 someone in our party some 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.240
 minimum person to be able to do it and that 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.590
 They are have already had to explain why 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.730
 It is worth as you see here I am with all the 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.680
 subscribers is the room full of 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.170
 sound guests all over the world in a 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.800
 moment and well then communicated 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.149
 basically what we have to do is 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.260
 the next thing is worth now we will invite 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.910
 all the subscribers and I'll put you for 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.170
 that so that the mics are heard 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.430
 see how they react when they see this 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.870
 ok and well what I have to do 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.180
 basically riding in a car worth 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.039
 that you want to move and we have to do 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.079
 so it's ok we go here we open the mobile 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.180
 and we give quick activity worth it 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.309
 We give you join to random and here 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.780
 will put with friends and asogas and here then 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.429
 it's been easy, we give it back and now 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.899
 we can move around the garage like 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.540
 you are seeing a boy the truth the 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.190
 only putada is that no 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.900
 forward that is the only one pointed by 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.900
 so to say but as you see back 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.330
 Well, we can not, as you can see here 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.920
 tried to close and we can not the car 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.090
 I hope you worked and as I say 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.760
 this can only be done by leaving the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.770
 menu that puts with friends and alone 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.850
 with that less open because we can already 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.340
 do this trick now that is pretty 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.320
 pretty young so let's do here 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.790
 of the car and we close this and we're 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.830
 giving for the truth is that the same is 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.150

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.220
