00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
crime and corruption a lot of kind of

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.090 
crime and corruption a lot of kind of
stuff<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.899> he<00:01:04.199> doesn't<00:01:04.350> want<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.650> create<00:01:04.830> more

orphan<00:01:05.640> kids<00:01:05.939> obviously<00:01:06.570> because<00:01:06.930> there's<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
orphan kids obviously because there's a

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.410 
orphan kids obviously because there's a
chance<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.740> if<00:01:08.100> he<00:01:08.189> does<00:01:08.400> kill<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:09.090> could<00:01:09.270> be

chance that if he does kill it could be

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.940 
chance that if he does kill it could be
a<00:01:09.630> problem<00:01:09.840> because<00:01:10.020> you'll<00:01:10.350> create<00:01:10.680> more

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
a problem because you'll create more

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.280 
a problem because you'll create more
copycat<00:01:11.580> Batman<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.330> stuff<00:01:12.689> like<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:13.080> and

it's<00:01:21.659> something<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.290> Nolan<00:01:22.710> films

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
actually touched on a lot and it reminds

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.410

me of that that he can actually bleed

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.990 
me of that that he can actually bleed
and<00:01:27.780> he<00:01:28.020> has<00:01:28.229> he's<00:01:28.680> more<00:01:28.950> green<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> guess<00:01:29.759> than

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and he has he's more green I guess than

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.999 
and he has he's more green I guess than
the<00:01:30.119> main<00:01:30.299> continuity<00:01:30.720> version<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.500> him<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.890> I

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
the main continuity version of him and I

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.560 
the main continuity version of him and I
also<00:01:32.130> really<00:01:32.460> love<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.640> fact<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.180> we<00:01:33.360> can

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
also really love the fact that we can

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.569 
also really love the fact that we can
see<00:01:33.810> his<00:01:33.960> eyes<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.650> this<00:01:34.740> version<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.159> Batman

realization I guess that corrupt
officials<00:02:13.490> among<00:02:13.850> them<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:14.240> very<00:02:14.540> real<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:15.080> in

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
officials among them is very real and in

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.960 
officials among them is very real and in
many<00:02:15.500> ways<00:02:15.590> that<00:02:15.890> paralleled<00:02:16.340> real-life

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
many ways that paralleled real-life

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.940 
many ways that paralleled real-life
events<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.600> how<00:02:17.690> cities<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.350> media<00:02:18.650> deal

he's smart but he has no problem killing

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.350 
he's smart but he has no problem killing
people<00:02:27.530> because<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:28.010> him<00:02:28.069> it's<00:02:28.280> fun<00:02:28.550> it<00:02:28.880> allows
