a reverse push down with cables on the
triceps<00:02:11.020> we<00:02:11.560> went<00:02:11.740> high<00:02:11.980> reps<00:02:12.280> on<00:02:12.490> this<00:02:12.700> one

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
triceps we went high reps on this one

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.540 
triceps we went high reps on this one
looking<00:02:13.810> at<00:02:13.960> like<00:02:14.800> almost<00:02:14.980> like<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.280> pyramid

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550

reps<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:20.470> forth<00:02:20.770> per<00:02:21.220> each<00:02:21.940> set<00:02:22.450> that<00:02:22.720> we

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
reps and so forth per each set that we

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.020 
reps and so forth per each set that we
did<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.260> then<00:02:23.890> we<00:02:23.980> super<00:02:24.340> setted<00:02:24.640> this<00:02:24.820> with

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
did and then we super setted this with

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.560 
did and then we super setted this with
the<00:02:25.210> reverse<00:02:26.820> barbell<00:02:27.820> curl<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.420> know

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
the reverse barbell curl you know

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.220 
the reverse barbell curl you know
working<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.930> forearms<00:02:30.450> again<00:02:31.450> high<00:02:31.690> reps<00:02:32.020> as

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
working the forearms again high reps as

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.630 
working the forearms again high reps as
well<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:36.010> this<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.340> going<00:02:36.490> to<00:02:36.580> be<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.270> second

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
well and this is going to be the second

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.940 
well and this is going to be the second
exercise<00:02:39.780> combination<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:40.870> we<00:02:40.990> did<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.500> on

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
exercise combination that we did and on

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.620 
exercise combination that we did and on
the<00:02:42.070> third<00:02:42.250> part<00:02:42.610> we<00:02:42.940> actually<00:02:43.360> went<00:02:43.510> ahead

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
the third part we actually went ahead

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.440 
the third part we actually went ahead
and<00:02:44.670> separated<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:47.790> triceps<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.060> bicep

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
and separated the triceps and the bicep

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.090 
and separated the triceps and the bicep
movements<00:02:49.930> which<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.260> will<00:02:50.380> see<00:02:50.410> so<00:02:50.770> we<00:02:50.920> did

this

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:04:09.339 

got<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.060> problem

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.570 

alright<00:04:10.349> and<00:04:10.560> this<00:04:10.680> is<00:04:10.860> the<00:04:10.980> last<00:04:11.130> tricep

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
alright and this is the last tricep

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.729 
alright and this is the last tricep
movement<00:04:11.940> that<00:04:12.000> we<00:04:12.090> did<00:04:12.300> I<00:04:12.840> didn't<00:04:13.620> know

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
movement that we did I didn't know

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.039 
movement that we did I didn't know
exactly<00:04:14.370> what<00:04:14.580> to<00:04:14.790> call<00:04:14.970> this<00:04:15.120> overhead<00:04:15.690> easy

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
exactly what to call this overhead easy

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.590 
exactly what to call this overhead easy
bar<00:04:16.440> extension<00:04:18.350> sounds<00:04:19.350> like<00:04:19.410> a<00:04:19.530> good<00:04:19.680> name

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
bar extension sounds like a good name

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.940 
bar extension sounds like a good name
but<00:04:21.600> with<00:04:21.810> this<00:04:21.959> we<00:04:22.169> just<00:04:22.380> kind<00:04:22.560> of<00:04:22.620> did<00:04:22.770> like<00:04:22.800> a

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
but with this we just kind of did like a

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.060 
but with this we just kind of did like a
pyramid<00:04:23.930> started<00:04:24.930> with<00:04:25.020> 15<00:04:25.380> reps<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.919> there's

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
pyramid started with 15 reps and there's

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.280 
pyramid started with 15 reps and there's
kind<00:04:26.250> of<00:04:26.310> worked<00:04:26.520> my<00:04:26.880> way<00:04:26.910> up<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:27.290> heavier

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
kind of worked my way up to heavier

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.379 
kind of worked my way up to heavier
weight<00:04:28.560> until<00:04:28.830> I<00:04:29.010> got<00:04:29.220> to<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.430> solid<00:04:29.760> like<00:04:30.150> say

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
weight until I got to a solid like say

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.570 
weight until I got to a solid like say
10<00:04:30.630> reps<00:04:30.870> or<00:04:31.050> so<00:04:31.230> I<00:04:31.530> was<00:04:32.070> really<00:04:32.190> just<00:04:32.340> trying

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
10 reps or so I was really just trying

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.750 
10 reps or so I was really just trying
to<00:04:32.730> just<00:04:33.000> burn<00:04:33.180> out<00:04:33.419> and<00:04:34.340> get<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.430> most<00:04:35.550> out<00:04:35.730> of

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
to just burn out and get the most out of

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.490 
to just burn out and get the most out of
my<00:04:35.850> triceps<00:04:36.330> and<00:04:36.570> do<00:04:37.200> something<00:04:37.470> different

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
my triceps and do something different
