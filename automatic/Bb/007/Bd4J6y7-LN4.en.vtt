00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
really got to thinking about it I said

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.380 
really got to thinking about it I said
you<00:00:55.980> know<00:00:56.070> let's<00:00:56.100> go<00:00:56.309> back<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.610> my<00:00:56.850> roots<00:00:57.120> and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
you know let's go back to my roots and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.029 
you know let's go back to my roots and
this<00:00:57.510> time<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.109> good<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.620> schedule<00:00:59.010> is

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
this time it's for good this schedule is

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.250 
this time it's for good this schedule is
gonna<00:00:59.219> be<00:00:59.340> what<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.489> stay<00:00:59.789> with<00:00:59.899> what<00:01:00.899> does<00:01:01.140> that

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
gonna be what I stay with what does that

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.720 
gonna be what I stay with what does that
mean<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.469> could<00:01:01.739> potentially<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> Saturday

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
mean I could potentially have a Saturday

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.880 
mean I could potentially have a Saturday
they<00:01:02.879> get<00:01:03.030> skipped<00:01:03.390> down<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.780> road<00:01:03.960> yeah<00:01:04.650> it

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
they get skipped down the road yeah it

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.170 
they get skipped down the road yeah it
does<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.479> um<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.900> don't<00:01:07.890> think<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.189> likely<00:01:08.430> so

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
does but um I don't think it's likely so

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.120 
does but um I don't think it's likely so
for<00:01:09.360> anybody's<00:01:09.659> going<00:01:09.840> what<00:01:10.080> no<00:01:10.470> trust<00:01:11.070> me

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
for anybody's going what no trust me

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.460 
for anybody's going what no trust me
it's<00:01:11.340> not<00:01:11.400> likely<00:01:11.720> but<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.869> reason<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.200> did

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
it's not likely but the reason I did

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.800 
it's not likely but the reason I did
this<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.950> because<00:01:13.979> i<00:01:14.670> think<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.330> schedule<00:01:15.720> i

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
this is because i think the schedule i

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.960 
this is because i think the schedule i
chose<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.290> black<00:01:16.500> ops<00:01:16.770> 1<00:01:16.950> uploading<00:01:17.850> on

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
chose in black ops 1 uploading on

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.850 
chose in black ops 1 uploading on
saturdays<00:01:18.450> actually<00:01:19.170> fits<00:01:19.439> better<00:01:19.710> with

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
saturdays actually fits better with

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.560 
saturdays actually fits better with
keeping<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.369> channel<00:01:20.790> going<00:01:21.030> at<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.210> regular

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
keeping this channel going at a regular

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.320 
keeping this channel going at a regular
pace<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.710> then<00:01:23.130> when<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:23.880> really<00:01:24.119> thought

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
pace and then when I really thought

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.240 
pace and then when I really thought
about<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.900> answer<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.290> pretty<00:01:25.439> simple<00:01:25.590> by

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
about it the answer is pretty simple by

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.609 
about it the answer is pretty simple by
forcing<00:01:26.580> myself<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.180> upload<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.840> saturday<00:01:28.409> and

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
forcing myself to upload on saturday and

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.870 
forcing myself to upload on saturday and
i<00:01:28.829> know<00:01:28.890> you're<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.490> force<00:01:29.759> yourself

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
i know you're going you force yourself

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.080 
i know you're going you force yourself
not<00:01:30.270> by<00:01:31.020> making<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.470> upload<00:01:31.860> date<00:01:32.369> saturday

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
not by making the upload date saturday

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.480 
not by making the upload date saturday
what<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.810> means<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.200> most<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.280> my

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
what that means is that most of my

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.969 
what that means is that most of my
weekend<00:01:36.090> can<00:01:36.420> be<00:01:36.570> spent<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:36.990> developing<00:01:37.590> next

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
weekend can be spent on developing next

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.819 
weekend can be spent on developing next

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
you got out of work especially if it's a

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.980 
you got out of work especially if it's a
desk<00:01:59.189> job<00:01:59.460> you're<00:02:00.000> mentally<00:02:00.479> burnt<00:02:00.780> you're

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.950 
desk job you're mentally burnt you're
just<00:02:01.170> not<00:02:01.520> all<00:02:02.520> there<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.360> that's<00:02:03.540> when<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.780> was

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
just not all there and that's when I was

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.170 
just not all there and that's when I was
trying<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.290> do<00:02:04.380> my<00:02:04.500> writing<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.850> think<00:02:06.090> it

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
trying to do my writing and I think it

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.809 
trying to do my writing and I think it
really<00:02:06.210> slowed<00:02:06.630> me<00:02:06.810> down<00:02:07.280> so<00:02:08.280> what<00:02:08.700> I've<00:02:08.789> done

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
really slowed me down so what I've done

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.460 
really slowed me down so what I've done
is<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.270> by<00:02:09.420> making<00:02:09.569> us<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.020> weekends

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
is that by making us on the weekends

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.960 
is that by making us on the weekends
when<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.619> do<00:02:10.709> most<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.099> my<00:02:11.160> writing<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.760> think

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
when I do most of my writing I think

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.640 
when I do most of my writing I think
he's<00:02:12.060> gonna<00:02:12.180> help<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.480> channel
