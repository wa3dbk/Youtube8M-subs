all<00:00:57.370> that<00:00:57.730> excess<00:00:58.590> units<00:00:59.590> to<00:01:00.370> give<00:01:00.520> the<00:01:00.609> fifty

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
all that excess units to give the fifty

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.939 
all that excess units to give the fifty
percent<00:01:01.120> so<00:01:01.690> here<00:01:01.840> comes<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:02.109> balloons<00:01:02.469> they

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
percent so here comes the balloons they

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.710 
percent so here comes the balloons they
easily<00:01:03.190> take<00:01:03.520> out<00:01:03.670> the<00:01:03.820> town<00:01:04.059> hall<00:01:04.420> and

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
easily take out the town hall and

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.230 
easily take out the town hall and
they're<00:01:05.440> just<00:01:05.560> making<00:01:05.830> their<00:01:06.100> way<00:01:06.130> along<00:01:06.940> the

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
they're just making their way along the

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.389 
they're just making their way along the
side<00:01:07.479> of<00:01:07.509> the<00:01:07.660> base<00:01:07.869> there<00:01:08.259> in<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.770> southern

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
side of the base there in the southern

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.040 
side of the base there in the southern
part<00:01:09.430> of<00:01:09.789> the<00:01:09.880> base<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:10.360> they're<00:01:10.869> going<00:01:10.960> to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
part of the base and they're going to

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.749 
part of the base and they're going to
take<00:01:11.200> out<00:01:11.380> that<00:01:11.560> other<00:01:11.740> air<00:01:12.130> defense<00:01:12.520> that's

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
take out that other air defense that's

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.969 
take out that other air defense that's
going<00:01:12.940> to<00:01:13.000> be<00:01:13.090> enough<00:01:13.179> for<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.929> percentage<00:01:14.440> so

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
going to be enough for the percentage so

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.529 
going to be enough for the percentage so
look<00:01:15.220> at<00:01:15.310> that<00:01:15.490> without<00:01:15.759> all<00:01:15.970> those<00:01:16.149> with<00:01:16.360> all

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
look at that without all those with all

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:17.910 
look at that without all those with all
those<00:01:16.750> Archer<00:01:17.050> towers<00:01:17.320> in<00:01:17.440> that<00:01:17.530> big<00:01:17.710> line

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
those Archer towers in that big line

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.090 
those Archer towers in that big line
there's<00:01:18.190> actually<00:01:18.580> a<00:01:18.610> common<00:01:19.030> base<00:01:19.439> not<00:01:20.439> so<00:01:20.830> so

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
there's actually a common base not so so

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.950 
there's actually a common base not so so
much<00:01:21.310> anymore<00:01:21.549> because<00:01:21.909> of<00:01:22.180> this<00:01:22.299> reason<00:01:22.390> it's

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
much anymore because of this reason it's

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.780 
much anymore because of this reason it's
so<00:01:23.020> vulnerable<00:01:23.650> to<00:01:23.710> air<00:01:23.950> attacks<00:01:24.310> if<00:01:24.520> you<00:01:24.610> go

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
so vulnerable to air attacks if you go

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.179 
so vulnerable to air attacks if you go
on<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.390> opposite<00:01:25.869> side<00:01:26.140> of<00:01:26.170> all<00:01:26.560> those<00:01:26.799> Archer

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
on the opposite side of all those Archer

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:29.520 
on the opposite side of all those Archer
towers<00:01:27.549> so<00:01:28.180> you<00:01:28.240> can<00:01:28.420> see<00:01:28.600> DDJ<00:01:29.080> got<00:01:29.350> the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
towers so you can see DDJ got the

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.800 
towers so you can see DDJ got the
two-star<00:01:30.100> against<00:01:30.430> that<00:01:30.610> close<00:01:30.850> to<00:01:31.060> max<00:01:31.299> basin

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
two-star against that close to max basin

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.200 
two-star against that close to max basin
with<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:32.020> walls<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:32.610> he<00:01:33.610> didn't<00:01:33.880> even<00:01:33.970> need

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
with the walls and he didn't even need

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.810 
with the walls and he didn't even need
his<00:01:34.390> heroes<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.860> this<00:01:36.009> is<00:01:36.100> an<00:01:36.189> attack<00:01:36.430> that<00:01:36.490> I

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
his heroes so this is an attack that I

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.670 
his heroes so this is an attack that I

actually<00:03:26.950> sooner<00:03:27.280> rather<00:03:27.580> than<00:03:27.790> later<00:03:27.880> is

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
actually sooner rather than later is

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.300 
actually sooner rather than later is
actually<00:03:28.810> more<00:03:28.990> beneficial<00:03:29.050> due<00:03:29.740> to<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:29.980> dps

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
actually more beneficial due to the dps

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.220 
actually more beneficial due to the dps
that<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.910> units<00:03:31.300> can<00:03:31.570> that<00:03:31.780> they<00:03:31.810> spawned

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
that the units can that they spawned

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.530 
that the units can that they spawned
units<00:03:32.620> can<00:03:32.800> do<00:03:33.070> over<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:34.030> course<00:03:34.060> of<00:03:34.450> the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
units can do over the course of the

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.690 
units can do over the course of the
remaining<00:03:34.870> time<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:35.739> obviously<00:03:36.220> if<00:03:36.430> you<00:03:36.519> have

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
remaining time so obviously if you have

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.470 
remaining time so obviously if you have
for<00:03:36.910> example<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.600> know<00:03:37.989> six<00:03:38.380> archers<00:03:38.769> and<00:03:38.800> six

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
for example you know six archers and six

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.360 
for example you know six archers and six
barbarians<00:03:40.480> along<00:03:41.200> with<00:03:41.440> your<00:03:41.590> heroes<00:03:41.980> and

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
barbarians along with your heroes and

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.370 
barbarians along with your heroes and
you<00:03:42.400> pop<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.820> abilities<00:03:43.209> early<00:03:43.600> they're

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
you pop the abilities early they're

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.810 
you pop the abilities early they're
actually<00:03:44.680> going<00:03:44.800> to<00:03:44.890> do<00:03:45.040> more<00:03:45.220> damage<00:03:45.430> over

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
actually going to do more damage over

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.479 
actually going to do more damage over
time<00:03:45.850> and<00:03:46.239> now<00:03:46.360> of<00:03:46.480> course<00:03:46.540> that's<00:03:46.900> all<00:03:47.489> null

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
time and now of course that's all null

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.270 
time and now of course that's all null
and<00:03:48.519> void<00:03:48.820> if<00:03:49.510> you<00:03:49.690> are<00:03:49.989> if<00:03:50.440> they<00:03:50.620> if<00:03:50.920> they<00:03:51.070> died

due<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.580> splash<00:03:52.000> damage<00:03:52.269> so<00:03:52.540> keep<00:03:52.690> that<00:03:52.720> in

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840

mind to would say it's a thin line to to

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.020 
mind to would say it's a thin line to to
straddle<00:03:57.160> they're<00:03:57.280> so<00:03:57.459> here<00:03:57.640> comes<00:03:57.670> the

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
straddle they're so here comes the

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.090 
straddle they're so here comes the
Arctic<00:03:58.510> queen<00:03:58.690> she<00:03:59.230> picks<00:03:59.440> up<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.650> third<00:03:59.830> star

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
things were looking really nice as he

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.840 
things were looking really nice as he
only<00:05:21.380> has<00:05:21.560> that<00:05:21.710> one<00:05:22.010> Archer<00:05:22.340> tower<00:05:22.490> to<00:05:22.640> worry

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
only has that one Archer tower to worry

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.510 
only has that one Archer tower to worry
about<00:05:22.970> in<00:05:23.270> the<00:05:23.900> barbarian<00:05:24.680> king<00:05:25.040> who<00:05:25.280> has<00:05:25.400> the

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
about in the barbarian king who has the

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.000 
about in the barbarian king who has the
?<00:05:26.090> above<00:05:26.450> him<00:05:26.720> he's<00:05:27.170> probably<00:05:27.350> gonna<00:05:27.500> engage

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
? above him he's probably gonna engage

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.550 
? above him he's probably gonna engage
on<00:05:28.520> the<00:05:28.640> other<00:05:28.850> barbarian<00:05:29.600> king<00:05:29.810> but<00:05:30.320> it's<00:05:30.440> not

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
on the other barbarian king but it's not

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.510 
on the other barbarian king but it's not
going<00:05:30.680> to<00:05:30.770> matter<00:05:30.920> because<00:05:31.220> you<00:05:31.310> still<00:05:31.490> have

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
going to matter because you still have

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.490 
going to matter because you still have
both<00:05:31.820> abilities<00:05:32.330> in<00:05:32.480> forty-nine<00:05:32.900> percent<00:05:33.050> and

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
both abilities in forty-nine percent and

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.390 
both abilities in forty-nine percent and
look<00:05:34.310> at<00:05:34.430> that<00:05:34.610> does<00:05:34.850> he<00:05:34.940> engage<00:05:36.070> yes<00:05:37.070> it<00:05:37.280> does

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
look at that does he engage yes it does

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.980 
look at that does he engage yes it does
look<00:05:37.580> II<00:05:37.670> lucky<00:05:37.970> engages<00:05:38.420> then<00:05:38.570> he<00:05:38.660> runs<00:05:38.780> away

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
look II lucky engages then he runs away

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.990 
look II lucky engages then he runs away
so<00:05:39.830> it's<00:05:39.950> a<00:05:39.980> cat-and-mouse<00:05:40.160> game<00:05:40.610> there<00:05:40.820> but

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
so it's a cat-and-mouse game there but

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.430 
so it's a cat-and-mouse game there but
guess<00:05:41.270> what<00:05:41.390> it<00:05:41.510> doesn't<00:05:41.570> matter<00:05:41.960> he's

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
guess what it doesn't matter he's

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.870 
guess what it doesn't matter he's
already<00:05:42.650> pulled<00:05:42.950> off<00:05:43.070> the<00:05:43.190> two<00:05:43.340> star<00:05:43.610> attack
