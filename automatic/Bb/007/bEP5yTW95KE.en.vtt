so Jake let's start beginning whose
platform<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.350> who<00:00:16.800> do<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:16.980> help<00:00:17.160> sure

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
platform and who do you help sure

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.929 
platform and who do you help sure
platform<00:00:18.570> computing<00:00:19.080> is<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> brand<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.279> IBM

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
platform computing is a brand and IBM

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.349 
platform computing is a brand and IBM
and<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.480> actually<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:22.170> brand<00:00:22.890> under<00:00:23.189> IBM<00:00:23.939> system

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
and is actually a brand under IBM system

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.660 
and is actually a brand under IBM system
as<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.660> technology<00:00:25.289> group<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:26.189> platform

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
as a technology group so platform

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.080 
as a technology group so platform
provides<00:00:27.060> system<00:00:27.630> software<00:00:28.160> to<00:00:29.160> manage<00:00:29.609> the

jobs<00:02:17.800> very<00:02:18.800> cool<00:02:19.100> okay<00:02:19.460> so<00:02:19.520> I<00:02:19.970> understand<00:02:20.420> you

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.270 
jobs very cool okay so I understand you
have<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:20.630> demo<00:02:20.840> can<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.140> show<00:02:21.320> it<00:02:21.530> may<00:02:21.950> be<00:02:22.010> an

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
have a demo can you show it may be an

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.880 
obvious performance difference it's
almost<00:03:01.340> like<00:03:01.690> in<00:03:02.690> this<00:03:02.840> case<00:03:02.900> right<00:03:03.620> now<00:03:03.650> it's

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
almost like in this case right now it's

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.320 
almost like in this case right now it's

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
Xeon Phi coprocessor and I can also you

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
know like zoom in zoom out and then you

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.170 
know like zoom in zoom out and then you
can<00:03:14.209> see<00:03:14.330> how<00:03:14.510> fast<00:03:14.870> then<00:03:15.800> Phi<00:03:16.160> is<00:03:16.520> you<00:03:17.030> know

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
can see how fast then Phi is you know

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.479 
can see how fast then Phi is you know

then<00:03:19.880> you<00:03:20.450> can<00:03:20.600> see<00:03:20.810> also<00:03:21.170> if<00:03:21.350> i<00:03:21.470> make<00:03:21.770> you<00:03:22.070> know

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
then you can see also if i make you know

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.600 
then you can see also if i make you know
