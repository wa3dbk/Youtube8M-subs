very good for your body at all so if

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.560 
very good for your body at all so if
you've<00:02:05.320> got<00:02:05.350> a<00:02:05.530> nice<00:02:05.740> good<00:02:06.159> right<00:02:07.000> avocado

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
you've got a nice good right avocado

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.570 
you've got a nice good right avocado
like<00:02:07.869> this<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.649> should<00:02:08.950> be<00:02:09.160> able<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.460> just

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
like this you should be able to just

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.330 
like this you should be able to just
squeeze<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:11.290> flesh<00:02:11.590> will<00:02:11.860> come<00:02:12.070> out

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.680 

if<00:02:15.340> that<00:02:15.640> doesn't<00:02:15.910> work<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.510> tend<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.170> just

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
if that doesn't work I tend to just

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.320 
if that doesn't work I tend to just
