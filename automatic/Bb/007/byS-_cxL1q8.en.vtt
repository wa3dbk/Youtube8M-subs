00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
 today I'm showing you I'm going to you 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.560
 show the simplest way for me 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.859
 to install flash player on your 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.570
 smartphone or tablet android so already 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.370
 you will ask me what is the point 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.200
 to install flash player on my tablet 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.210
 we postpone times and I tell you 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.340
 simply we can watch videos 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.140
 on any site whatsoever 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.670
 do not decide very Catholic even 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.199
 other sites like channel + like game 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.330
 as I will show you by after 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.730
 so on this tablet 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.890
 the flash player is installed which you 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.050
 see also the setting of the flash 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.250
 player 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.190
 normally so now we're going to 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.790
 uninstall to do the manipulation 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.620
 normally when I go on the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.120
 uninstall you go a meeting 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.910
 setting go without lifting so you go 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.800
 in tablet settings of which 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.750
 application if you did what in fact 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.070
 I start to video my skin I have a 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.340
 so back to flash player 11 points 1 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:59.789
 click on it 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:01.379
 Uninstall were installed ok so 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.500
 uninstall adobe flash to 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.110
 do it ok once you're done 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.220
 return to the basic screen 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.100
 so here for now the flash 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.650
 player is and uninstall so we're going 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.869
 go to the browser 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.200
 and here I am on a page so the little 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.750
 channel log + normally it goes a 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.080
 20 passes started because the flash 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.280
 player 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.210
 but in high school a bit long because 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.280
 it's a pretty heavy site for tablets 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.990
 we will try to launch the video is 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.420
 from flash 1 to channel plus and you see 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.440
 you have that 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.060
 that is, you can not read 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.610
 the video simply because you 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.200
 do not have flash installed on it so 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.590
 Now you tell me what are we 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.920
 made 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.380
 so the application needed for this 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.540
 manipulation it's a scanner barcode 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.770
 So a qr code scanner I think 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.790
 everyone has one that is on 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.930
 smartphone or tablet 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.550
 or then you can download 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.010
 it's called barcode scanner 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.770
 I'd maybe the link in the 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.120
 video below the video but 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.100
 normally there are and both basins 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.010
 motion samsung galaxy s ii he installed 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.530
 basic so then you take this 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.840
 scanner is with one will scan a qr 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.700
 code that currently on my computer 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.390
 on the computer screen so have been worth 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.030
 to do right now 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.790
 besides the image this one and I 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.190
 I wanted to defer you would put 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.910
 now it will take a break so we 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.910
 will scan that 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.890
 that moment you 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.470
 on your scanner so what are you doing 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.540
 you click open browser 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.340
 so the basic thing and there normally 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.620
 he will finally install you 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.020
 download flash player simply 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.960
 so here is your basic application 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.740
 you come to the home screen is 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.810
 normally here goes back down title 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.230
 game download because he writes 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.360
 here you press it and there adobe 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.780

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.650
 install this installed application 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.650
 the installation is being done 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.160
 in case you are where you will have a 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.840
 message attention this thing comes from 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.420
 sources other than the flat story 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.920
 in fact it is a system put in place 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.230
 by google for that matter because it's the 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.910
 customer who are hungry for rice which consists 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.320
 to block applications coming 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.970
 on the other hand that the googleplex tour 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.410
 knowing that adobe flash that is not 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.230
 available on site all this 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.670
 manipulation is totally will not do anything 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.740
 on the phone do not worry or your 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.720
 mac your table reaches you could 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.950
 cochet coming from external sources in 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.270

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.650

 really look at his load 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.680
 so it will do a little bit of time of course 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.690
 because the flash is still 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:31.750
 quite heavy 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:32.980
 but it works well to be a little 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.150
 patient but hey if you want to watch 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:39.190
