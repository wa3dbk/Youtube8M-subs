don't<00:03:26.290> work<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:27.630> I<00:03:28.630> don't<00:03:29.170> think<00:03:29.380> the

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
don't work and I don't think the

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.720 
don't work and I don't think the
transmission<00:03:32.590> or<00:03:32.709> clutch<00:03:32.980> is<00:03:33.160> engaged<00:03:33.220> or

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
transmission or clutch is engaged or

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.710 
transmission or clutch is engaged or
something<00:03:34.530> but<00:03:35.530> we<00:03:35.650> haven't<00:03:35.800> even<00:03:35.980> tried<00:03:36.280> to

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
something but we haven't even tried to

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.930 
something but we haven't even tried to
tear<00:03:37.720> into<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:37.989> I<00:03:40.980> think<00:03:41.980> it<00:03:42.100> still<00:03:42.370> has<00:03:42.580> a

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
tear into that I think it still has a

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:58.119 
tear into that I think it still has a
real<00:03:43.860> odometer<00:03:44.860> there<00:03:48.030> get<00:03:49.030> them<00:03:49.500> in<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.560> back
