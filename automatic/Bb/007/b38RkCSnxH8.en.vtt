00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.710 

for<00:00:05.520> this<00:00:05.670> we're<00:00:05.910> going<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.089> be<00:00:06.150> testing

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
for this we're going to be testing

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.870 
for this we're going to be testing
whether<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.259> power<00:00:07.770> supply<00:00:08.280> is<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.460> reason

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
whether the power supply is the reason

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.499 
whether the power supply is the reason
we<00:00:09.000> have<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.240> yellow<00:00:09.360> line<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.809> death<00:00:11.330> as<00:00:12.330> you

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
we have the yellow line of death as you

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.709 
we have the yellow line of death as you
can<00:00:12.630> see<00:00:12.780> I've<00:00:12.929> removed<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.500> power<00:00:13.710> supply

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
can see I've removed the power supply

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.560 
can see I've removed the power supply
which<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.170> one<00:00:16.699> we<00:00:17.699> just<00:00:17.940> check<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.180> fuse

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
which is this one we just check the fuse

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.670 
which is this one we just check the fuse
on<00:00:19.880> good<00:00:21.680> now<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.830> order<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.390> test<00:00:24.390> whether<00:00:24.680> the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
on good now in order to test whether the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.250 
on good now in order to test whether the
power<00:00:25.920> supply<00:00:26.400> itself<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.119> faulty<00:00:27.840> somewhere

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
power supply itself is faulty somewhere

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.439 
power supply itself is faulty somewhere
you're<00:00:28.980> going<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.369> need<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> power<00:00:29.849> supply<00:00:30.090> out

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
you're going to need a power supply out

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.330 
you're going to need a power supply out
of<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.660> computer<00:00:33.320> this<00:00:34.320> one<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.739> not<00:00:34.920> powerful

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
of a computer this one is not powerful

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.389 
of a computer this one is not powerful
enough<00:00:36.290> which<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.469> why<00:00:37.649> I<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.190> other

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
enough which is why I have this other

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.470 
enough which is why I have this other
one<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.270> here<00:00:40.160> but<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:41.969> get<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.420> idea

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
one of in here but so you get the idea

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.069 
one of in here but so you get the idea
and<00:00:43.070> once<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.160> have<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.340> power<00:00:44.520> supply<00:00:45.079> you're

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
and once you have a power supply you're

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.049 
and once you have a power supply you're
going<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.320> need<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.710> find<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.309> trace<00:00:47.550> back<00:00:47.850> all

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
going to need to find and trace back all

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:59.029 
going to need to find and trace back all
these<00:00:48.329> wires<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> board<00:00:57.620> now<00:00:58.620> once<00:00:58.920> you

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
these wires to the board now once you

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.590 
these wires to the board now once you
trace<00:00:59.280> them<00:00:59.489> back<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.030> board<00:01:02.210> they<00:01:03.210> should

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
trace them back to the board they should

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.730 
trace them back to the board they should
be<00:01:03.840> all<00:01:04.260> labeled<00:01:04.979> on<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.369> board<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:06.740> this

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
be all labeled on the board like this

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.670 
be all labeled on the board like this
one<00:01:07.950> here<00:01:08.780> is<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.110> remote<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.710> turn<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:11.040> on

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
one here is the remote to turn it on

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.850 
one here is the remote to turn it on
then<00:01:13.680> we<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:14.040> negative<00:01:14.490> 12<00:01:14.939> volt<00:01:15.210> 5<00:01:15.810> volt<00:01:16.140> so

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
then we have negative 12 volt 5 volt so

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:26.270 
then we have negative 12 volt 5 volt so
on<00:01:21.470> now<00:01:24.259> you're<00:01:25.259> also<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.100> look

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
on now you're also going to have to look

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.920 
on now you're also going to have to look
up<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.580> model<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.119> your<00:01:27.710> power<00:01:28.710> supply<00:01:29.220> and

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
up the model of your power supply and

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:40.370 
up the model of your power supply and
locate<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.680> pin<00:01:32.250> out<00:01:38.000> which<00:01:39.000> are<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.930> voltage

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
locate the pin out which are the voltage

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.170 
locate the pin out which are the voltage
is<00:01:40.560> coming<00:01:40.799> out<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.100> these<00:01:41.520> pins<00:01:41.880> here

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
is coming out of these pins here

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.780 
is coming out of these pins here
now<00:01:42.479> online<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.869> have<00:01:43.170> four<00:01:43.590> there<00:01:44.490> was<00:01:44.610> also

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
now online I have four there was also

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.100 
now online I have four there was also
three<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.479> five

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
three and five

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.240 
three and five
I<00:01:47.600> found<00:01:48.600> out<00:01:48.869> I'll<00:01:49.380> post<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.770> link<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
I found out I'll post a link on the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.609 
I found out I'll post a link on the
bottom<00:01:52.640> then<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.000> one<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.780> five<00:01:55.259> volt

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
bottom then on this one I have five volt

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.030 
bottom then on this one I have five volt
ground<00:01:56.189> ground<00:01:56.700> five<00:01:57.360> volt<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:58.710> don't<00:01:58.890> need

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
ground ground five volt you don't need

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.620 
ground ground five volt you don't need
to<00:01:59.159> know<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.430> amps<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.479> make

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
to know the amps you just have to make

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.410 
to know the amps you just have to make
sure<00:02:00.890> that<00:02:01.890> whatever<00:02:02.369> power<00:02:02.820> supply<00:02:03.240> you're

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
sure that whatever power supply you're

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.589 
sure that whatever power supply you're
using<00:02:03.659> puts<00:02:04.079> out<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.500> nothing<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:08.209> 122<00:02:09.209> amps

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
using puts out and nothing this 122 amps

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.140 
using puts out and nothing this 122 amps
so<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:10.319> figured<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.709> would<00:02:10.950> be<00:02:11.099> plenty<00:02:12.620> and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
so I figured that would be plenty and

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.460 
so I figured that would be plenty and
then<00:02:15.150> both<00:02:15.390> these<00:02:15.569> plugs<00:02:15.989> that<00:02:16.110> are<00:02:16.200> plugged

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
then both these plugs that are plugged

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.110 
then both these plugs that are plugged
into<00:02:16.770> on<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.129> bottom<00:02:17.550> our<00:02:18.770> 12<00:02:19.770> volt<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.340> then

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
into on the bottom our 12 volt and then

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.320 
into on the bottom our 12 volt and then
ground<00:02:21.709> at<00:02:22.709> least<00:02:22.890> on<00:02:23.160> this<00:02:23.400> model<00:02:23.700> I'm<00:02:24.030> pretty

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
ground at least on this model I'm pretty

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.790 
ground at least on this model I'm pretty
sure<00:02:24.480> it's<00:02:24.629> like<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:24.959> on<00:02:25.110> all<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.440> them<00:02:25.620> you

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
sure it's like that on all of them you

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.830 
sure it's like that on all of them you
should<00:02:25.830> double<00:02:26.250> check<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:27.209> obviously<00:02:27.629> you'll

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
should double check and obviously you'll

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.420 
should double check and obviously you'll
have<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:28.080> know<00:02:28.200> which<00:02:28.410> one's<00:02:28.620> positive<00:02:28.890> and

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
have to know which one's positive and

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.600 
have to know which one's positive and
which<00:02:29.580> ones<00:02:29.790> negative<00:02:30.500> this<00:02:31.500> yellow<00:02:32.160> wire<00:02:32.430> I

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
which ones negative this yellow wire I

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.080 
which ones negative this yellow wire I
have<00:02:32.910> here<00:02:33.209> is<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.420> positive<00:02:33.629> ID<00:02:34.140> by<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:38.370> so

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
have here is the positive ID by and so

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.030 
have here is the positive ID by and so
I've<00:02:39.800> routed<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:42.480> wires<00:02:42.900> back<00:02:43.379> to<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.680> board

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
I've routed the wires back to the board

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.589 
I've routed the wires back to the board
in<00:02:44.160> here<00:02:44.400> found<00:02:44.970> out<00:02:45.209> what<00:02:45.480> values<00:02:45.959> they<00:02:46.140> are<00:02:46.170> I

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
in here found out what values they are I

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.740 
in here found out what values they are I
hooked<00:02:48.599> them<00:02:48.750> all<00:02:48.959> up<00:02:49.170> in<00:02:49.319> different<00:02:49.500> ports<00:02:50.750> by

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
hooked them all up in different ports by

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.699 
hooked them all up in different ports by
both<00:02:52.050> ground<00:02:52.680> ground<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:54.110> another<00:02:55.110> five<00:02:55.410> volt

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
both ground ground and another five volt

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.250 

and<00:03:01.720> then<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:01.900> have<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.800> other<00:03:02.830> 12<00:03:03.490> volts<00:03:03.880> and

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
and then I have the other 12 volts and

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.050 
and then I have the other 12 volts and
the<00:03:05.260> 12<00:03:05.530> volt<00:03:05.770> ground<00:03:06.870> -<00:03:07.870> here<00:03:08.230> now<00:03:08.850> in<00:03:09.850> order

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
the 12 volt ground - here now in order

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.180 
the 12 volt ground - here now in order
for<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.510> power<00:03:10.750> supply<00:03:10.960> to<00:03:11.200> turn<00:03:11.500> on<00:03:11.710> you're

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
for the power supply to turn on you're

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.840 
for the power supply to turn on you're
going<00:03:12.460> to<00:03:12.580> have<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.910> trick<00:03:13.180> it<00:03:13.500> there<00:03:14.500> is<00:03:14.800> a<00:03:14.850> PS

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
going to have to trick it there is a PS

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.960 
going to have to trick it there is a PS
on<00:03:16.120> or<00:03:16.480> remote<00:03:17.140> wire<00:03:17.800> in<00:03:18.130> here<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.670> it's<00:03:18.850> going

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
on or remote wire in here and it's going

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.170 
on or remote wire in here and it's going
to<00:03:19.030> be<00:03:19.150> located<00:03:19.360> on<00:03:19.780> this<00:03:19.930> big<00:03:20.230> clip<00:03:21.180> I've

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
to be located on this big clip I've

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.420 
to be located on this big clip I've
noticed<00:03:22.720> that<00:03:22.870> it's<00:03:23.080> normally<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:24.010> fourth

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
noticed that it's normally the fourth

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.270 
noticed that it's normally the fourth
one<00:03:24.670> down<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.660> it'll<00:03:26.290> be<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.650> only<00:03:26.830> one<00:03:27.130> of

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
one down and it'll be the only one of

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.320 
one down and it'll be the only one of
its<00:03:27.430> color<00:03:28.020> and<00:03:29.020> you<00:03:29.290> have<00:03:29.530> to<00:03:29.740> attach<00:03:30.370> it<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:31.300> a

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
its color and you have to attach it to a

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.170 
its color and you have to attach it to a
ground<00:03:31.980> which<00:03:32.980> is<00:03:33.010> normally<00:03:33.490> located<00:03:33.700> right

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
ground which is normally located right

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.170 
ground which is normally located right
below<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:35.230> that's<00:03:36.190> so<00:03:36.400> that<00:03:36.430> this<00:03:36.940> power

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
below and that's so that this power

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.640 
below and that's so that this power
supply<00:03:37.450> its<00:03:37.810> own<00:03:37.960> fault<00:03:38.200> or<00:03:38.380> not<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:40.090> also

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
supply its own fault or not and also

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.810 
supply its own fault or not and also
you're<00:03:41.650> going<00:03:41.830> to<00:03:41.950> need<00:03:42.160> to<00:03:42.370> attach<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:45.370> power

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
you're going to need to attach the power

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.020 
you're going to need to attach the power
supply<00:03:46.270> to<00:03:46.330> a<00:03:46.840> load<00:03:47.230> on<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:48.010> side<00:03:48.250> so<00:03:48.670> it's<00:03:48.850> not

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
supply to a load on the side so it's not

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.480 
supply to a load on the side so it's not
only<00:03:49.270> flowering<00:03:49.780> the<00:03:49.900> PlayStation<00:03:50.590> now<00:03:51.310> I've

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
only flowering the PlayStation now I've

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.780

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.940 
attached you here to some fans that I've
put<00:03:55.030> on<00:03:55.060> my<00:03:55.210> playstation<00:03:55.690> so<00:03:56.260> when<00:03:56.440> I<00:03:56.470> plug<00:03:56.800> it

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
put on my playstation so when I plug it

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.190 
put on my playstation so when I plug it
in<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.910> power<00:03:58.120> supply<00:03:58.480> will<00:03:58.660> also<00:03:58.930> be<00:03:59.050> running

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
in the power supply will also be running

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.340 
in the power supply will also be running
three<00:03:59.800> fans<00:04:00.070> I<00:04:00.280> have<00:04:00.430> online<00:04:02.430> so<00:04:04.020> now<00:04:05.020> they're

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
three fans I have online so now they're

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:20.789 
three fans I have online so now they're
all<00:04:05.380> hooked<00:04:05.680> up<00:04:05.920> and<00:04:06.190> ready<00:04:06.220> yeah<00:04:08.550> plug<00:04:09.550> it<00:04:09.730> in

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.659 

then<00:04:21.430> we<00:04:21.579> had<00:04:21.960> our<00:04:22.960> fans<00:04:23.440> running<00:04:24.449> all<00:04:25.449> three

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
then we had our fans running all three

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.230 
then we had our fans running all three
and<00:04:27.720> we<00:04:28.720> also<00:04:28.870> have<00:04:29.229> a<00:04:29.259> red<00:04:29.680> light<00:04:29.949> now<00:04:30.280> on<00:04:31.090> the

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
and we also have a red light now on the

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:39.300 
and we also have a red light now on the
PlayStation<00:04:33.389> now<00:04:35.370> if<00:04:36.370> I<00:04:36.729> turn<00:04:37.210> it<00:04:37.599> on<00:04:37.750> and<00:04:38.310> we

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
PlayStation now if I turn it on and we

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.980 
PlayStation now if I turn it on and we
still<00:04:39.550> have<00:04:39.759> the<00:04:39.879> yellow<00:04:40.090> light<00:04:40.419> then<00:04:40.780> the

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
still have the yellow light then the

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.680 
still have the yellow light then the
power<00:04:41.229> supply<00:04:41.680> is<00:04:42.009> most<00:04:42.789> likely<00:04:43.060> good<00:04:43.479> and

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
power supply is most likely good and

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.770 
power supply is most likely good and
that<00:04:44.139> it's<00:04:44.440> actually<00:04:44.879> the<00:04:45.879> processor<00:04:46.599> then

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
that it's actually the processor then

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.740 
that it's actually the processor then
may<00:04:47.289> need<00:04:47.500> to<00:04:47.620> be<00:04:47.770> revolved<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:52.240> we<00:04:52.479> still

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
may need to be revolved and we still

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.339 
may need to be revolved and we still
have<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.560> old<00:04:53.590> life<00:04:54.009> so<00:04:54.569> the<00:04:55.569> power<00:04:55.810> supply<00:04:55.930> is

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
have the old life so the power supply is

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.430 
have the old life so the power supply is
good<00:04:56.710> but<00:04:57.190> this<00:04:57.370> is<00:04:57.430> how<00:04:57.699> you<00:04:57.759> test<00:04:58.169> whether<00:04:59.169> it

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
good but this is how you test whether it

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.710 
good but this is how you test whether it
isn't
