quick video to show the features of the
0<00:00:06.540> 1<00:00:06.839> 3<00:00:07.109> release<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.630> logistics<00:00:09.630> pipes

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
0 1 3 release of logistics pipes

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.950 
0 1 3 release of logistics pipes
basically<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.660> have<00:00:13.170> only<00:00:13.380> added<00:00:13.710> two<00:00:14.160> features

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
basically I have only added two features

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.439 
basically I have only added two features
the<00:00:15.960> first<00:00:15.990> one<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:19.310> routing<00:00:20.310> /<00:00:20.699> teleport

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
the first one is the routing / teleport

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.900 
the first one is the routing / teleport
pipes<00:00:21.630> which<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.289> can<00:00:22.439> see<00:00:22.470> here<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:23.010> have<00:00:23.160> to

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
pipes which you can see here I have to

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.540 
pipes which you can see here I have to
teleport<00:00:24.240> pipes<00:00:24.720> connected<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:26.189> have<00:00:26.519> a

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
teleport pipes connected and I have a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.800 
teleport pipes connected and I have a
basic<00:00:27.210> pipe<00:00:27.420> requesting<00:00:28.349> dirt<00:00:28.849> so<00:00:29.849> if<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.480> throw

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
basic pipe requesting dirt so if I throw

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.000 
basic pipe requesting dirt so if I throw
some<00:00:30.990> dirt<00:00:31.199> into<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.679> obsidian<00:00:32.279> pipe<00:00:34.010> it

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
some dirt into this obsidian pipe it

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.709 
some dirt into this obsidian pipe it
will<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.579> routed<00:00:36.770> thus<00:00:38.270> this<00:00:39.270> feature<00:00:39.510> was

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
will be routed thus this feature was

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.860 
will be routed thus this feature was
included<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.440> special<00:00:40.800> version<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.280> 012<00:00:41.910> but

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
included in a special version of 012 but

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.560 
included in a special version of 012 but
I<00:00:43.230> didn't<00:00:43.620> make<00:00:43.860> any<00:00:44.250> major<00:00:45.030> public

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
first feature and the second feature is

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.660 
first feature and the second feature is
I<00:00:57.030> have<00:00:57.960> added<00:00:58.199> an<00:00:58.680> interface<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
I have added an interface to the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.319 
I have added an interface to the
provider<00:01:00.030> pipe<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:01.530> make<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.579> provide

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
provider pipe to make it provide

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.679 
provider pipe to make it provide
specific<00:01:04.019> items<00:01:04.409> only<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.240> case<00:01:06.450> you

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
can see it's providing dirt so if I

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.789 
can see it's providing dirt so if I
request<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.210> show<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.630> chest<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.380> have

taking<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> bit<00:01:42.329> easier<00:01:42.659> over<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
taking it a bit easier over the

legit over the holidays and i found a
feature<00:01:52.680> lacking<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:54.030> logistics<00:01:54.630> pipes<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:55.649> do

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
feature lacking in logistics pipes to do

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.800

but basically I wanted to to make a

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.410 
but basically I wanted to to make a
release<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.160> it<00:02:13.310> in<00:02:13.520> case<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.880> find<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.180> useful

you're interested in the rest of the
features<00:02:22.640> of<00:02:22.670> logistics<00:02:23.300> pipes<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:23.930> should

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
features of logistics pipes you should

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.080
