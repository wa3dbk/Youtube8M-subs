00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.110 
little note on this always check organic
things<00:04:23.110> if<00:04:23.410> you<00:04:23.560> like<00:04:23.770> to<00:04:23.920> eat<00:04:24.130> organic<00:04:24.340> things

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
things if you like to eat organic things

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.540 
things if you like to eat organic things
and<00:04:25.930> don't<00:04:26.320> just<00:04:26.710> assume<00:04:26.860> that<00:04:27.340> they're<00:04:27.520> going

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
and don't just assume that they're going

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.210 
and don't just assume that they're going
to<00:04:27.850> be<00:04:27.970> more<00:04:28.150> expensive<00:04:28.540> this<00:04:29.530> was<00:04:29.770> actually

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
to be more expensive this was actually

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.420 
to be more expensive this was actually
cheaper<00:04:30.490> than<00:04:31.090> a<00:04:31.270> regular<00:04:31.750> kind<00:04:31.960> so<00:04:32.410> you<00:04:32.710> just

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
cheaper than a regular kind so you just

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.220 
cheaper than a regular kind so you just
never<00:04:33.580> know<00:04:33.850> and<00:04:34.030> sometimes<00:04:34.420> it<00:04:34.630> really<00:04:34.840> isn't

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
never know and sometimes it really isn't

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.860 
never know and sometimes it really isn't
that<00:04:35.500> much<00:04:35.680> more<00:04:36.190> some<00:04:36.490> things<00:04:36.850> are<00:04:37.180> a<00:04:37.210> lot

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
that much more some things are a lot

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.400 
that much more some things are a lot
more<00:04:37.900> like<00:04:38.350> tomatoes<00:04:39.330> are<00:04:40.330> a<00:04:40.390> lot<00:04:40.750> more<00:04:40.780> at

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
more like tomatoes are a lot more at

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.610 
more like tomatoes are a lot more at
least<00:04:41.650> in<00:04:41.830> my<00:04:42.010> area<00:04:42.360> but<00:04:43.360> some<00:04:43.690> things<00:04:43.960> really

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
least in my area but some things really

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.040 
least in my area but some things really
aren't<00:04:45.070> or<00:04:45.490> they<00:04:45.730> might<00:04:45.970> even<00:04:46.180> be<00:04:46.450> cheaper<00:04:46.840> so

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
aren't or they might even be cheaper so

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.990 
aren't or they might even be cheaper so
definitely<00:04:47.470> check<00:04:47.530> if<00:04:47.920> you're<00:04:48.130> into<00:04:48.580> eating

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
definitely check if you're into eating

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.870 
definitely check if you're into eating
organic<00:04:49.210> food<00:04:49.780> so<00:04:50.470> that<00:04:50.800> is<00:04:50.980> everything<00:04:51.220> I

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
organic food so that is everything I

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.210 
organic food so that is everything I
