00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
shot power is great as well but I do see

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.700 
shot power is great as well but I do see
a<00:02:00.509> finishing<00:02:00.960> when<00:02:01.290> he<00:02:01.380> gets<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.680> chance

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
a finishing when he gets a chance

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.700 
a finishing when he gets a chance
because<00:02:02.520> he<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.090> very<00:02:03.420> inconsistent<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.500> find

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
because he is very inconsistent I find

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.740 
because he is very inconsistent I find
his<00:02:04.860> position<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.909> bloody<00:02:06.420> nuisance

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
his position and to be a bloody nuisance

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.380 
his position and to be a bloody nuisance
Annie's<00:02:07.500> movement<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.220> be<00:02:08.399> non-existent<00:02:08.879> at

Annie's movement to be non-existent at
times<00:02:09.660> hence<00:02:10.319> why<00:02:10.619> he<00:02:10.860> didn't<00:02:11.129> score<00:02:11.220> as<00:02:11.520> many

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730
