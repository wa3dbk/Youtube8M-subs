00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.540
 now we can be friends of youtube them 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.580
 I bring this 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.580
 new video of a new strategy of 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.210
 this new mystical force team here will 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.550
 I arrive 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.170
 a link in this video so that they go to 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.640
 see the first combat of forces 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.699
 mystical and good let's start 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.490
 is to choose action for the period as 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:31.560
 can see the vote that will be 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.590
 vest jump but what a 1.5 of 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.550
 special indigence 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.630
 and obligate it will be solid rock and I think that 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.110
 nothing else makes us 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.579
 with three quarters of the super attacks 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.199
 this assets 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.280
 and well the first 2 minutes was 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.240
 earthquake 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.700
 and I was in a movement 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.490
 well known with 100 of power and 100 of 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.579
 precision and that can reach double if 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.989
 they use 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.670
 as if I said digging digging under the 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.799
 earth and 2 to 0 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.680
 this is double but very rare that 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.500
 resists movement since I do not believe no 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.649
 I think or good for me is not a movement 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.110
 competitive so I do not know much in the 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:23.190
 competitive in no time be stoner 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.130
 ex what will it be 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.220
 sharp rock with 100 of power the center 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.300
 of precision with a king of a radius a 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:36.420
 high critical radio is our mega 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.980
 agreement with 120 of power and another of 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.550
 Pressure 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:44.370
 and the last moment will be iron what 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.980
 with 80 of power and without provision with 13 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.020
 percent of recoil in front and 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.150
 we hope that your techniques will be this 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.610
 king period 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:02:00.210
 the truth that in physics another one in the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.730
 first bridge or in the little macho that 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.860
 it's good that you're listening or that 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.670
 they say it's going to work because it's 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.120
 what yes the forwards young I think that nothing 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.840
 come out do not take out a situation for 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.239
 repeat would be great 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.700
 where and more where will they help you from your side 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.210
 extensible is true but that's why I do not know 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.900
 worry because today they are going to give you 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.900
 good 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.690
 sophisticated are 115 hp is in which 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.700
 of attack 130 in defense and 55 in attack 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.500
 Special 55 of the special classes 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.350
 tell of the circuit 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.990
 let's put 244 hp m 12 attack and 2 152 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.470
 a special defense 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.240
 the nature that can be firm and 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:54.310
 we will have one pokÃ©mon of the next 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:57.480
 way 432 of 850 attacks and which is 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.480
 Good attack 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.470
 the two types of attack 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.300
 and 400 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.930
 they have 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.330
 since I am interested also player 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:21.120
 defensive special 25 222 56 defense 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.790
 and from king 1 to chastity and 209 to 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:28.310
 special defense will tell us that it is a 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.310
 little but let's see with the calculator 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:39.300
 they are 209 special defense by 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:43.780
 1,5 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.940
 303 even more than physical defense and 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.280
 that the defense is very good but not 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.280
 we have increased nothing defensive side 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:57.140
 and well that and all friends can give 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.140
 by subscribing until next time
