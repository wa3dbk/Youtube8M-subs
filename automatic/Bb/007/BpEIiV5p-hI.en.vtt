00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
game my teammates involved I'm the 13

Louis<00:02:56.499> Campbell<00:02:56.920> point<00:02:57.459> guard<00:02:59.670> every<00:03:00.670> year<00:03:00.819> is

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
Louis Campbell point guard every year is

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.030 
Louis Campbell point guard every year is
important<00:03:01.359> for<00:03:01.450> me<00:03:01.629> you<00:03:02.049> know<00:03:02.170> usually<00:03:02.650> I'm<00:03:02.889> in

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
important for me you know usually I'm in

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.830 
important for me you know usually I'm in
that<00:03:03.159> position<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:03.849> this<00:03:04.150> is<00:03:04.359> no<00:03:04.659> different

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
that position so this is no different

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.270 
that position so this is no different
than<00:03:05.139> the<00:03:05.260> difference<00:03:05.590> for<00:03:05.650> me<00:03:05.859> is<00:03:06.010> that<00:03:06.159> I'm

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
than the difference for me is that I'm

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.839 
than the difference for me is that I'm
the<00:03:06.430> oldest<00:03:06.790> so<00:03:07.569> I<00:03:07.739> think<00:03:08.739> it's<00:03:09.250> going<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.430> be<00:03:09.519> a

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
the oldest so I think it's going to be a

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.539 
the oldest so I think it's going to be a
big<00:03:10.269> part<00:03:10.540> of<00:03:10.599> this<00:03:10.750> this<00:03:11.139> year's<00:03:11.549> season

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
big part of this this year's season

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.449 
big part of this this year's season

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.479 
because we're so young so I went out to
pay<00:03:15.760> attention<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.689> focus<00:03:17.409> on<00:03:17.769> being<00:03:18.099> more<00:03:18.400> of

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
pay attention and focus on being more of
