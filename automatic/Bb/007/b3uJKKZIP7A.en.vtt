Charlie II W dash 11 now I have had my
eye<00:00:10.920> on<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.250> knife<00:00:11.580> for<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.910> long<00:00:12.269> long<00:00:12.509> time

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
eye on this knife for a long long time

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.600 
eye on this knife for a long long time
but<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.559> know<00:00:13.679> due<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.009> its<00:00:14.099> high<00:00:14.250> price<00:00:14.549> for

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
but you know due to its high price for

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.250 
but you know due to its high price for
materials<00:00:15.269> I<00:00:15.360> just<00:00:15.540> couldn't<00:00:15.750> just<00:00:15.900> by<00:00:16.020> buying

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
materials I just couldn't just by buying

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.500 
materials I just couldn't just by buying
it<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.650> mean<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.460> average<00:00:17.730> online<00:00:17.940> price<00:00:18.330> of

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
it I mean the average online price of

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.769 
it I mean the average online price of
270<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.439> 296<00:00:20.400> US<00:00:20.730> dollars<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.630> is

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
270 to 296 US dollars so this is

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.689 
270 to 296 US dollars so this is
definitely<00:00:21.900> not<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.230> cheap<00:00:22.470> knife<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:23.519> you

Charlie has a four point one inch blade

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.660 
Charlie has a four point one inch blade
now<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.289> front<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.530> us<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.770> two<00:00:56.039> knives<00:00:56.250> here

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
now in front of us have two knives here

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.279 
now in front of us have two knives here
this<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> Spyderco<00:00:57.629> military<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.230> this

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
this is the Spyderco military and this

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.529 
this is the Spyderco military and this
is<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> benchmate<00:00:58.890> 760<00:00:59.520> both<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.239> these<00:01:00.359> are

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
is the benchmate 760 both of these are

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.029 
is the benchmate 760 both of these are
apt<00:01:00.690> eyes<00:01:00.899> before<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.500> place

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
apt eyes before in place

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.380 
apt eyes before in place
so<00:01:02.309> essentially<00:01:02.730> shorter<00:01:03.180> than<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
so essentially shorter than the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.299 
so essentially shorter than the
sharp-eyed<00:01:03.690> charlie<00:01:04.140> if<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.680> succeed<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.159> this

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
sharp-eyed charlie if I succeed in this

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.770 
sharp-eyed charlie if I succeed in this
comparison<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.390> little<00:01:06.659> misleading

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
comparison is a little misleading

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.020 
comparison is a little misleading
because<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.470> Charlie<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.159> clearly<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.640> tiny

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
because the Charlie is clearly a tiny

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.609 
because the Charlie is clearly a tiny
bit<00:01:09.180> shorter<00:01:09.600> than<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:09.990> other<00:01:10.229> two<00:01:10.439> knives

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
bit shorter than the other two knives

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.219 
bit shorter than the other two knives
again<00:01:11.610> not<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> huge<00:01:12.000> deal<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:13.080> want

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
again not a huge deal but I just want

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.480 
again not a huge deal but I just want
everybody<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.590> know<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:14.130> in<00:01:14.220> case<00:01:14.250> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490

bought this a knife and thought it was

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.170 
bought this a knife and thought it was
gonna<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> little<00:01:16.830> bit<00:01:17.009> larger<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.520> anyways

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
gonna be a little bit larger so anyways

reminiscent of the Microtech select-fire
series<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.659> mean<00:01:31.020> both<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.229> these<00:01:31.470> feature<00:01:31.740> a

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
series I mean both of these feature a

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.450 
series I mean both of these feature a
beautiful<00:01:33.000> sweeping<00:01:33.420> sharp<00:01:33.720> edge<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:35.310> one

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
beautiful sweeping sharp edge and one

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.890 
beautiful sweeping sharp edge and one
unique<00:01:35.700> thing<00:01:35.759> especially<00:01:36.329> when<00:01:36.570> compared<00:01:36.869> to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
unique thing especially when compared to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.210 
unique thing especially when compared to
almost<00:01:37.200> every<00:01:37.470> other<00:01:37.560> single<00:01:37.799> knife<00:01:38.040> out

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
almost every other single knife out

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.340 
almost every other single knife out
there<00:01:38.400> currently<00:01:38.820> it's<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.570> lack<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.780> wording

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
there currently it's a lack of wording

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.740 
there currently it's a lack of wording
on<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.680> face<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.009> blade<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:42.000> mean<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.600> is

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
on the face of the blade I mean this is

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.300 
on the face of the blade I mean this is
a<00:01:42.780> completely<00:01:43.140> sterile<00:01:43.439> blade<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.860> mean<00:01:44.130> it's

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
a completely sterile blade I mean it's

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.280 
a completely sterile blade I mean it's
the<00:01:44.460> void<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.759> branding<00:01:45.329> there's<00:01:45.899> no<00:01:45.990> steel

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the void of branding there's no steel

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.950 
the void of branding there's no steel
marking<00:01:46.770> no<00:01:46.950> serial<00:01:47.310> numbers<00:01:47.640> etc<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.360> mean

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
marking no serial numbers etc I mean

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.120 
marking no serial numbers etc I mean
personally<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.259> think<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:49.530> makes<00:01:49.799> for<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.979> much

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
personally I think this makes for a much

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.649 
personally I think this makes for a much
cleaner<00:01:50.369> looking<00:01:50.790> blade<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.270> really<00:01:51.540> like

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
cleaner looking blade and I really like

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.649 
cleaner looking blade and I really like
it<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.869> lot<00:01:52.790> now<00:01:53.790> there's<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.060> bit<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.299> jumping<00:01:54.479> on

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
it a lot now there's a bit of jumping on

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.569 
it a lot now there's a bit of jumping on
the<00:01:54.780> blade<00:01:54.990> spine<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:55.710> not<00:01:55.890> incredibly

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
the blade spine it's not incredibly

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.730 
the blade spine it's not incredibly
grippy<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.479> mean<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.840> think<00:01:57.869> I'm<00:01:58.200> pro<00:01:58.409> rated

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
grippy but I mean I think I'm pro rated

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.270 
grippy but I mean I think I'm pro rated
at<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:59.090> I'm<00:02:00.090> probably<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> b-minus<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.290> can't

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
at a I'm probably like a b-minus I can't

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.530 
at a I'm probably like a b-minus I can't
complain<00:02:02.549> because<00:02:02.759> at<00:02:03.090> least<00:02:03.240> there<00:02:03.420> is

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
complain because at least there is

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.109 
complain because at least there is
jimping<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.079> mean<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.380> Almar<00:02:04.740> scru<00:02:05.219> mm<00:02:05.939> could

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
jimping I mean the Almar scru mm could

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.570 
jimping I mean the Almar scru mm could
benefit<00:02:06.420> from<00:02:06.479> some<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.049> blade<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.220> three

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
benefit from some the blade is three

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.249 
benefit from some the blade is three
millimeters<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.209> thickness<00:02:09.239> that's<00:02:10.080> pretty

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
millimeters in thickness that's pretty

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.660 
millimeters in thickness that's pretty
good<00:02:10.410> because<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.830> handle<00:02:11.129> scales<00:02:11.370> are<00:02:11.550> only

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
good because the handle scales are only

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.460 
good because the handle scales are only
about<00:02:11.910> four<00:02:12.300> millimeters<00:02:12.780> in<00:02:12.959> thickness

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
about four millimeters in thickness

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.040 
about four millimeters in thickness
on<00:02:13.530> each<00:02:13.770> side<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.280> surefire<00:02:15.180> really<00:02:15.630> packed<00:02:15.900> a

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
on each side so surefire really packed a

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.160 
on each side so surefire really packed a
thick<00:02:16.290> plate<00:02:16.500> within<00:02:16.770> these<00:02:16.980> scales<00:02:18.170> all

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
thick plate within these scales all

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.290 
thick plate within these scales all
right<00:02:19.290> now<00:02:19.470> here<00:02:19.680> we<00:02:19.800> have<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:19.980> child<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.790> at

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
right now here we have a child and at

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.450 
right now here we have a child and at
this<00:02:21.540> Zelly<00:02:22.110> also<00:02:22.440> doubles<00:02:22.740> as<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.890> flipper

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
this Zelly also doubles as a flipper

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.820 
this Zelly also doubles as a flipper
it's<00:02:24.120> very<00:02:24.300> generously<00:02:24.780> sized<00:02:25.080> which<00:02:25.710> is

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
it's very generously sized which is

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.080 
it's very generously sized which is
great<00:02:26.040> but<00:02:26.310> I'm<00:02:26.460> you<00:02:26.610> know<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.760> one<00:02:26.940> thing<00:02:27.000> I

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
great but I'm you know the one thing I

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.490 
great but I'm you know the one thing I
wish<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.330> did<00:02:27.450> have<00:02:27.600> was<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.750> bit<00:02:27.960> jimping<00:02:28.320> could

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
wish it did have was a bit jimping could

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.860 
wish it did have was a bit jimping could

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
the details of the blade there's still

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.110 
the details of the blade there's still
one<00:02:52.290> very<00:02:52.500> important<00:02:52.920> thing<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.550> that<00:02:53.850> is<00:02:54.000> of

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
one very important thing and that is of

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.390 
one very important thing and that is of
course<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.360> sharpness<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.950> as<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.250> can<00:02:56.340> see

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
course the sharpness and as you can see

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.580 
course the sharpness and as you can see
here<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:57.180> definitely<00:02:57.510> indeed<00:02:58.050> very<00:02:58.230> sharp

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
here is definitely indeed very sharp

this mil spec type 3a hard coating on it
on<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.290> other<00:03:10.440> side<00:03:10.620> we<00:03:10.770> have<00:03:10.860> titanium<00:03:11.220> with

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
on the other side we have titanium with

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.420 
on the other side we have titanium with
this<00:03:12.120> beautiful<00:03:12.600> stonewash<00:03:13.080> finish<00:03:13.430> now

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
this beautiful stonewash finish now

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.800 
this beautiful stonewash finish now
first<00:03:14.670> off<00:03:14.850> have<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.150> say<00:03:15.360> if<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:15.780> are

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
first off have to say if you are

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.270 
first off have to say if you are
thinking<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.320> these<00:03:16.560> handles<00:03:16.920> look<00:03:17.010> very

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
thinking that these handles look very

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.860 
thinking that these handles look very
slippery<00:03:17.670> then<00:03:18.060> you'd<00:03:18.209> be<00:03:18.390> correct

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
slippery then you'd be correct

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.110 
slippery then you'd be correct
luckily<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:20.070> aluminum<00:03:20.580> side<00:03:20.790> had<00:03:20.970> these

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
luckily the aluminum side had these

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.120 
luckily the aluminum side had these
cutouts<00:03:21.660> that<00:03:22.110> provide<00:03:22.380> a<00:03:22.410> slight<00:03:22.800> bit<00:03:23.010> of

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
cutouts that provide a slight bit of

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.430 
cutouts that provide a slight bit of
grip<00:03:23.340> but<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.420> know<00:03:24.510> let's<00:03:24.810> face<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:24.989> if<00:03:25.290> I'm

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
grip but you know let's face it if I'm

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.960 
grip but you know let's face it if I'm
truthful<00:03:25.680> it's<00:03:26.070> nothing<00:03:26.310> like<00:03:26.400> g10<00:03:26.760> and

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
truthful it's nothing like g10 and

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.390 
truthful it's nothing like g10 and
because<00:03:27.930> these<00:03:28.050> handles<00:03:28.410> are<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:28.560> thin<00:03:28.980> some

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
because these handles are so thin some

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.770 
because these handles are so thin some
of<00:03:29.489> you<00:03:29.580> with<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.790> larger<00:03:30.060> hands<00:03:30.300> may<00:03:30.510> find<00:03:30.690> it

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
of you with the larger hands may find it

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.690 
of you with the larger hands may find it
difficult<00:03:31.080> to<00:03:31.170> hold<00:03:31.410> on<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.680> this<00:03:31.800> one<00:03:31.980> now

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
difficult to hold on to this one now

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.520 
difficult to hold on to this one now
cover<00:03:33.000> wise<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.510> handle<00:03:33.810> shape<00:03:33.989> provides<00:03:34.350> a

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
cover wise the handle shape provides a

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.380 
cover wise the handle shape provides a
very<00:03:34.770> good<00:03:34.860> grip<00:03:35.220> especially<00:03:35.940> with<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.120> big

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
very good grip especially with this big

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.990 
very good grip especially with this big
coil<00:03:36.690> locking<00:03:37.200> in<00:03:37.290> my<00:03:37.380> index<00:03:37.680> finger<00:03:38.010> now<00:03:38.880> it's

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
coil locking in my index finger now it's

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.070 
coil locking in my index finger now it's
a<00:03:39.030> good<00:03:39.120> thing<00:03:39.300> because<00:03:39.600> with<00:03:39.750> these<00:03:39.840> flick

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
a good thing because with these flick

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.240 
a good thing because with these flick
handles<00:03:40.440> you're<00:03:40.530> gonna<00:03:40.709> need<00:03:40.770> every<00:03:40.920> bit<00:03:41.040> of

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
handles you're gonna need every bit of

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.580 
handles you're gonna need every bit of
traction<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:42.660> you'll<00:03:42.989> know<00:03:43.140> it's<00:03:43.290> down<00:03:43.410> on<00:03:43.440> the

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
traction so you'll know it's down on the

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.900 
traction so you'll know it's down on the
underside<00:03:44.070> of<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.190> handles<00:03:44.580> there<00:03:44.730> are<00:03:44.790> these

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
underside of the handles there are these

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.430 
underside of the handles there are these
kind<00:03:45.120> of<00:03:45.180> cutouts<00:03:45.540> there<00:03:45.810> they're<00:03:46.140> all<00:03:46.260> like

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
kind of cutouts there they're all like

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.650 
kind of cutouts there they're all like
they<00:03:47.160> can<00:03:47.640> resemble<00:03:47.910> teeth<00:03:48.209> from<00:03:48.360> us<00:03:48.480> of<00:03:48.600> the

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
they can resemble teeth from us of the

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.110 
they can resemble teeth from us of the
gears<00:03:49.010> now<00:03:50.010> these<00:03:50.160> are<00:03:50.310> not<00:03:50.430> very<00:03:50.580> hard<00:03:50.850> cut

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
gears now these are not very hard cut

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.520 
gears now these are not very hard cut
but<00:03:51.450> they<00:03:51.540> had<00:03:51.630> tremendously<00:03:52.170> to<00:03:52.500> the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
but they had tremendously to the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.620 
but they had tremendously to the
traction<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.730> only<00:03:53.880> one<00:03:54.000> downside<00:03:54.450> is<00:03:54.600> that

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
traction the only one downside is that

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.360 
traction the only one downside is that
this<00:03:54.959> is<00:03:55.140> a<00:03:55.170> source<00:03:55.470> of<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.650> hot<00:03:55.800> spot<00:03:55.830> for<00:03:56.130> me

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
this is a source of a hot spot for me

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.790 
this is a source of a hot spot for me
when<00:03:56.519> I<00:03:56.550> grip<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.820> knife<00:03:57.030> tightly<00:03:57.680> now<00:03:58.680> the

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
when I grip the knife tightly now the

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.350 
when I grip the knife tightly now the
construction<00:03:59.190> of<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.610> handles<00:04:00.060> are<00:04:00.209> very

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
construction of the handles are very

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.449 
construction of the handles are very
simple<00:04:00.959> you<00:04:01.140> got<00:04:01.470> Torx<00:04:01.860> screws<00:04:02.190> holding<00:04:02.400> the

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
simple you got Torx screws holding the

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.360 
simple you got Torx screws holding the
pivot<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.269> back<00:04:03.450> spacer<00:04:03.870> in<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:05.190> think

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
pivot and the back spacer in and I think

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.070 
pivot and the back spacer in and I think
the<00:04:05.430> small<00:04:05.910> pin<00:04:06.180> that<00:04:06.390> comes<00:04:06.870> from<00:04:07.019> the

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
the small pin that comes from the

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.229 
the small pin that comes from the
titanium<00:04:07.530> side<00:04:07.769> this<00:04:07.920> well<00:04:08.670> assuming<00:04:09.120> it

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
titanium side this well assuming it

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.400 
titanium side this well assuming it
comes<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.540> titanium<00:04:09.720> side<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:10.230> keep<00:04:10.350> the

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
comes to the titanium side to keep the

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.370 
comes to the titanium side to keep the
backspace<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.010> from<00:04:11.250> rotating<00:04:11.670> out<00:04:11.760> of<00:04:11.880> place

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
backspace to from rotating out of place

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.810 
backspace to from rotating out of place
now<00:04:13.380> on<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.560> backspace<00:04:13.980> story<00:04:14.250> you'll<00:04:14.730> see

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
now on the backspace story you'll see

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.550 
now on the backspace story you'll see
there's<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.090> bit<00:04:15.209> of<00:04:15.239> writing<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:16.200> see<00:04:16.410> the

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
there's a bit of writing you see the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.909 
there's a bit of writing you see the
made<00:04:17.010> in<00:04:17.160> the<00:04:17.250> USA<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:18.239> also<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.620> think

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
made in the USA and also the I think

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.170 
made in the USA and also the I think
there's<00:04:20.070> a<00:04:20.190> serial<00:04:20.580> number<00:04:20.820> I'm<00:04:20.940> not<00:04:21.060> really

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
there's a serial number I'm not really

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.050 
there's a serial number I'm not really
too<00:04:21.390> sure<00:04:22.070> now<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.370> really<00:04:23.669> like<00:04:23.729> this<00:04:23.789> knife

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
too sure now I really like this knife

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.210 
too sure now I really like this knife
because<00:04:24.450> it's<00:04:24.990> really<00:04:25.590> simple<00:04:25.950> I<00:04:26.190> mean

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
because it's really simple I mean

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.080 
because it's really simple I mean
there's<00:04:26.490> not<00:04:26.580> too<00:04:26.729> many<00:04:26.789> part

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
there's not too many part

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.909 
there's not too many part
to<00:04:27.180> make<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.330> complex<00:04:27.810> for<00:04:28.080> takedown<00:04:28.590> and

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
to make a complex for takedown and

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.770 
to make a complex for takedown and
nothing<00:04:29.340> extra<00:04:29.610> to<00:04:29.730> add<00:04:29.850> to<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.090> weight<00:04:30.300> so

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
nothing extra to add to the weight so

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.450 
nothing extra to add to the weight so
it's<00:04:30.930> actually<00:04:31.560> it's<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:31.860> very<00:04:32.010> efficient

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
it's actually it's a very efficient

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.970 
it's actually it's a very efficient
design<00:04:32.730> now<00:04:33.720> one<00:04:33.930> thing<00:04:34.080> that<00:04:34.139> may<00:04:34.410> worry<00:04:34.680> some

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
design now one thing that may worry some

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.710 
design now one thing that may worry some
of<00:04:35.130> you<00:04:35.280> and<00:04:35.610> this<00:04:36.180> stuff's<00:04:36.389> like<00:04:36.479> kind<00:04:36.660> of

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
of you and this stuff's like kind of
