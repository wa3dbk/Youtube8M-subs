00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.199
 Good day! 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:06.200
 I'm in the car after we've just finished one 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.200
 an exclusive two-day seminar. 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.900
 Now I travel from Larissa to Thessaloniki to meet with some of our team partners. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.300
 We do it again, though 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.900
 that we have discussed so many times. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.900
 What do I mean? Just see what's going on. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.100
 When everyone goes to Athens, I drive alone in reverse 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.000
 direction from Athens. There is not a single car on the road. 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.900
 This is amazing and I really wonder what's the reason? 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.300
 Does it make sense to come home every Sunday at home? 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.000
 is preparing for the office for Monday morning? 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:05.500
 What makes sense and what is not? I'm not getting ready for the office for 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:15.000
 Monday morning, so I do not go back on Sunday night, and is that crazy? 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.100
 He keeps astonishing at me 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.000
 what is reasonable and what is not. 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.000
 Once you're going to make me company along the way, let me share what you once did 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.900
 I heard in one of the seminars of Christ Voulgardis. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.500
 He told us he could not understand how it was possible 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:46.800
 it is reasonable for someone to pay 700 euros per month instead of 700 euros per day. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Why is it sensible to feel secure, 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:59.000
 if you have insurance, and you do not feel secure 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.600
 as an entrepreneur and a businessman who can determine his own income. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.200
 What is reasonable and what is not, what determines it? 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
 I think we have completely lost 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.800
 the meaning of the difference between reasonable and unreasonable. 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:37.000
 And the point is, most of us have imagined how we live life 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.000
 you are in a totally different way. And now we're just following the flow. 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 What to do to change this? 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.000
 How much do we want to change it? Have not we compromised so far? 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.500
 Look at the path ... there is no 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 one car, it's amazing. It's 8 hours, and there's not one car. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.800
 What is reasonable and what? 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.600
 it is not, and if we are wise, do we want to be unwise? 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.500
 If we want to be unwise, how ready are we? 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.300
 When we start doing something like swimming 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.900
 against the current, how ready are we to accept the counter-action? 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Are we ready to hear comments like "What are you doing, are you crazy?". 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Are we ready to hear people say, 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.000
 "I know a lot who tried, but failed"? 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 Are we ready to assume that if we want to be different, 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:09.000
 we must accept not only the consequences, but also 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.700
 to take responsibility for our actions? 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 We had an outstanding seminar over the past two days with 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 a strong team, a team of new leaders who can 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:45.800
 to be very new to LR's business, but their results are astonishing. 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000
 They left for Athens, 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:04.400
 Serres, Thessaloniki, and I continued my journey. 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.800
 Because this is LR. It is a journey that you never know where it will take you. 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.100
 All you know is, 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.300
 that you live every second, feel every moment and feel 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.900
 enjoy every hour! 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.500
 I wish you all the best and thank you, 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.800
 that you made me company on this lonely road today. 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.600
 All the best!
