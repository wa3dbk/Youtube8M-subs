00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
keep your hair I techniques that I use

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.210 
keep your hair I techniques that I use
that<00:01:47.930> has<00:01:48.930> been<00:01:49.110> really<00:01:49.380> keeping<00:01:49.590> my<00:01:49.770> hair<00:01:50.040> and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
that has been really keeping my hair and

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.850 
that has been really keeping my hair and
is<00:01:50.670> from<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.570> cannot<00:01:52.020> remember<00:01:52.229> her<00:01:52.530> name<00:01:52.680> for

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
is from I cannot remember her name for

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.740 
is from I cannot remember her name for
life<00:01:53.070> at<00:01:53.189> me<00:01:53.310> but<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.520> will<00:01:53.820> put<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.509> little

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
life at me but I will put a little

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.039 
life at me but I will put a little
bubble<00:01:55.320> somewhere<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.189> here<00:01:56.430> talking<00:01:56.939> about

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
bubble somewhere in here talking about

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.510 
bubble somewhere in here talking about
saying<00:01:58.049> what<00:01:58.259> her<00:01:58.350> name<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.009> i<00:01:59.130> will<00:01:59.310> link

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
saying what her name is and i will link

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.660 
saying what her name is and i will link
you<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.909> her<00:02:00.360> technique<00:02:00.990> has<00:02:01.530> worked<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.219> lot

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
you to it her technique has worked a lot

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.690 
you to it her technique has worked a lot
better<00:02:02.729> for<00:02:03.299> me<00:02:03.450> than

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
better for me than

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.969 
better for me than
the<00:02:05.700> other<00:02:05.969> one<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.509> know<00:02:06.659> where<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.049> put<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
the other one you know where you put it

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.150 
the other one you know where you put it
through<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:09.259> I<00:02:10.259> don't<00:02:10.500> even<00:02:10.649> are<00:02:10.830> describing

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
through you I don't even are describing

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.680 
through you I don't even are describing
but<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.700> know<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.000> main<00:02:12.150> one<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.420> people

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
but you know the main one that people

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.170 
but you know the main one that people
use<00:02:12.959> on<00:02:13.110> YouTube<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:13.590> one<00:02:14.190> just<00:02:14.489> scoop<00:02:14.790> slips

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
use on YouTube that one just scoop slips

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.490 
use on YouTube that one just scoop slips
right<00:02:15.330> out<00:02:15.390> unless<00:02:15.870> you're<00:02:16.080> doing<00:02:16.319> like<00:02:16.470> a

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
right out unless you're doing like a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.369 
right out unless you're doing like a
bigger<00:02:16.800> wave<00:02:17.099> pattern<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.730> stains<00:02:18.269> better<00:02:18.660> but

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
bigger wave pattern it stains better but

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.309 
bigger wave pattern it stains better but
this<00:02:19.620> looks<00:02:19.920> this<00:02:20.629> wavier<00:02:21.629> it<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:22.230> know

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
this looks this wavier it is you know

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.369 
this looks this wavier it is you know
the<00:02:22.410> straighter<00:02:22.739> it<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:24.110> it's<00:02:25.110> just<00:02:25.290> gonna

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
the straighter it is it's just gonna

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.890 
the straighter it is it's just gonna
slip<00:02:25.590> out<00:02:25.739> and<00:02:25.950> on<00:02:26.580> her<00:02:27.180> technique<00:02:27.599> works

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
slip out and on her technique works

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.869 
slip out and on her technique works
really<00:02:28.080> well<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.470> key<00:02:28.709> is<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.040> use<00:02:29.430> smaller

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
really well the key is to use smaller

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.119 
really well the key is to use smaller
sections<00:02:30.660> but<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.230> way<00:02:31.319> that<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.680> nodded

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
sections but the way that you nodded

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.559 
sections but the way that you nodded
it's<00:02:32.340> going<00:02:32.549> to<00:02:32.610> make<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.879> a<00:02:32.910> lot<00:02:33.150> easier<00:02:33.180> for

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
it's going to make it a lot easier for

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.479 
it's going to make it a lot easier for
you<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.780> cut<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:34.200> out<00:02:34.349> and<00:02:34.620> that's<00:02:35.160> another

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
you to cut it out and that's another

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.039 
you to cut it out and that's another
reason<00:02:35.610> why<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:36.269> didn't<00:02:36.540> like<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.870> other

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
reason why I didn't like the other

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.750 
reason why I didn't like the other
technique<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.650> was<00:02:37.799> really<00:02:38.040> hard<00:02:38.370> for<00:02:38.400> me<00:02:38.549> to

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
technique it was really hard for me to

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.729 
technique it was really hard for me to
see<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.060> knots<00:02:39.299> to<00:02:39.690> cut<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:39.989> out<00:02:40.079> so<00:02:40.319> I<00:02:40.349> didn't

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
see the knots to cut it out so I didn't

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.440 
see the knots to cut it out so I didn't
cut<00:02:40.920> it<00:02:41.010> out<00:02:41.099> what<00:02:41.310> i<00:02:41.340> would<00:02:41.579> do<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:41.910> i<00:02:41.940> would

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
cut it out what i would do is i would

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.600 
cut it out what i would do is i would
take<00:02:42.900> my<00:02:43.110> brains<00:02:43.440> out<00:02:43.590> from<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:43.890> back<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:44.310> i'm

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
take my brains out from the back and i'm

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.819 
take my brains out from the back and i'm
taking<00:02:44.730> my<00:02:44.970> clothes<00:02:45.450> out<00:02:45.599> i<00:02:45.840> would<00:02:46.049> slide<00:02:46.560> the

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
taking my clothes out i would slide the

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.860 
taking my clothes out i would slide the
hair<00:02:47.069> off<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.549> that<00:02:48.090> worked<00:02:48.299> fairly<00:02:48.660> well

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
hair off and that worked fairly well

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.650 
hair off and that worked fairly well
until<00:02:49.380> i<00:02:49.440> would<00:02:49.620> get<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:50.130> crush<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.510> know<00:02:51.630> a

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
until i would get a crush you know a

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.009 
until i would get a crush you know a
piece<00:02:52.230> of<00:02:52.260> hair<00:02:52.560> that<00:02:52.769> would<00:02:53.340> not<00:02:53.819> loosen<00:02:54.510> but

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
piece of hair that would not loosen but

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.420 
piece of hair that would not loosen but
titan<00:02:55.410> on<00:02:55.530> my<00:02:55.620> hair<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:55.890> then<00:02:56.099> i'd<00:02:56.250> have<00:02:56.280> to

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
titan on my hair and then i'd have to

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.490 
titan on my hair and then i'd have to
pull<00:02:56.760> my<00:02:56.880> hair<00:02:56.910> out<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.299> this<00:02:57.390> knot<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.170> then<00:02:58.230> i

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
pull my hair out of this knot and then i

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.170 
pull my hair out of this knot and then i
was<00:02:58.620> pulling<00:02:58.890> hair<00:02:59.190> out<00:02:59.220> switch<00:02:59.610> is<00:02:59.730> defeating

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
was pulling hair out switch is defeating

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.850 
was pulling hair out switch is defeating
the<00:03:00.269> purpose<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.959> protective<00:03:01.410> style<00:03:01.650> which

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
the purpose of a protective style which

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.830 
the purpose of a protective style which
is<00:03:01.980> just<00:03:02.069> ripping<00:03:02.310> my<00:03:02.489> hair<00:03:02.640> out<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:03.299> her

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
is just ripping my hair out so her

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.720 
is just ripping my hair out so her
technique<00:03:04.230> allows<00:03:04.590> me<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.040> see<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.250> night<00:03:05.549> and

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
technique allows me to see the night and

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.069 
technique allows me to see the night and
i<00:03:05.790> just<00:03:05.970> cut<00:03:06.269> it<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.510> I'm<00:03:06.599> gonna<00:03:06.690> worry<00:03:06.900> about

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
i just cut it and I'm gonna worry about

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.080 
i just cut it and I'm gonna worry about
that<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.470> it's<00:03:07.799> a<00:03:07.860> lot<00:03:08.040> faster<00:03:08.250> than<00:03:08.730> the

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
that and it's a lot faster than the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.740 
that and it's a lot faster than the
other<00:03:09.299> way<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.510> was<00:03:09.720> taking<00:03:09.989> it<00:03:10.079> out<00:03:11.359> so<00:03:12.359> that's

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
other way I was taking it out so that's

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.220 
other way I was taking it out so that's
another<00:03:13.290> pointer<00:03:15.500> another<00:03:16.549> tip<00:03:17.549> I<00:03:17.940> would<00:03:18.930> give

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
another pointer another tip I would give

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.870 
another pointer another tip I would give
to<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.859> guys<00:03:20.130> is<00:03:22.190> patience<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.310> lot<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:23.760> people

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
to you guys is patience a lot of people

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.670 
to you guys is patience a lot of people
want<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.389> just<00:03:24.569> do<00:03:24.810> their<00:03:25.019> hair<00:03:25.170> get<00:03:25.410> it<00:03:25.500> done

using a little latch hook and putting

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.830 
using a little latch hook and putting
one<00:04:01.829> piece<00:04:02.069> of<00:04:02.220> hair<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.579> at<00:04:02.819> a<00:04:02.849> time<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.510> takes

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
one piece of hair and at a time it takes

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.080 
one piece of hair and at a time it takes
a<00:04:04.019> while<00:04:04.169> on<00:04:04.440> average<00:04:05.010> for<00:04:05.459> most<00:04:05.579> people<00:04:05.970> it

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
a while on average for most people it

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.339 
a while on average for most people it
takes<00:04:06.239> two<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.599> half<00:04:06.690> hours<00:04:07.019> at<00:04:07.169> three

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
takes two and a half hours at three
