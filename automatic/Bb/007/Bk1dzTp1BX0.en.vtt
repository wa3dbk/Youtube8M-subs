only<00:06:32.889> difference<00:06:33.070> I<00:06:33.639> think<00:06:33.850> is<00:06:34.320> the<00:06:35.320> addition

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
only difference I think is the addition

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:42.080 
only difference I think is the addition
of<00:06:37.530> so<00:06:38.530> it<00:06:38.620> has<00:06:38.770> bonus<00:06:39.220> track<00:06:39.610> which<00:06:39.970> is<00:06:40.180> the

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
of so it has bonus track which is the

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:48.210 
of so it has bonus track which is the
perfection<00:06:43.979> from<00:06:44.979> Spurgeon<00:06:45.729> um<00:06:46.000> and<00:06:46.979> it<00:06:47.979> has
