00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.070 
probably I think it came out no 4 so
it's<00:01:12.180> been<00:01:12.270> out<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:12.450> about<00:01:12.540> eight<00:01:12.750> years<00:01:12.780> now

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.929 
somewhere around in there it's a great
fitting<00:01:16.320> frame<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.979> fits<00:01:17.250> most<00:01:17.549> people<00:01:17.820> with<00:01:17.909> a

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
fitting frame it fits most people with a

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.450

smaller<00:01:18.240> face<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:19.259> typically<00:01:19.920> speaking<00:01:20.250> I

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
smaller face that typically speaking I

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.749 
smaller face that typically speaking I
would<00:01:20.520> sell<00:01:20.820> this<00:01:21.000> more<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.479> probably<00:01:22.759> early

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
would sell this more to probably early

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.080 
would sell this more to probably early
teenager<00:01:24.150> mid-teens<00:01:24.990> would<00:01:25.229> be<00:01:25.320> okay<00:01:26.090> but

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
maybe if they have a bit bigger face I

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
kind of sticks at first and then it

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.660

should drop down from there now what
you're<00:04:15.790> gonna<00:04:15.880> do<00:04:15.970> from<00:04:16.120> now<00:04:16.239> is<00:04:16.480> is<00:04:16.630> this<00:04:16.750> is

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
you're gonna do from now is is this is

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.659 
you're gonna do from now is is this is
just<00:04:17.109> me<00:04:17.380> I<00:04:17.410> don't<00:04:17.980> think<00:04:18.190> this<00:04:18.280> is<00:04:18.340> actually

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
just me I don't think this is actually

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.250 
just me I don't think this is actually
in<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:18.820> directions<00:04:19.120> but<00:04:19.450> for<00:04:19.660> me<00:04:19.840> it<00:04:19.959> makes<00:04:20.140> it

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
in the directions but for me it makes it

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.200 
in the directions but for me it makes it
easier<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:20.530> change<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:21.010> lenses<00:04:21.310> what<00:04:22.090> you're

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
easier to change the lenses what you're

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.970 
easier to change the lenses what you're
gonna<00:04:22.300> do<00:04:22.450> is<00:04:22.540> you're<00:04:22.630> gonna<00:04:22.690> pull<00:04:23.080> this<00:04:23.350> tooth

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
gonna do is you're gonna pull this tooth

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.420 
gonna do is you're gonna pull this tooth
of<00:04:24.760> this<00:04:24.970> switch<00:04:25.180> lock<00:04:25.419> out<00:04:26.110> like<00:04:27.100> I<00:04:27.130> said<00:04:27.340> you

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
of this switch lock out like I said you

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.380 
of this switch lock out like I said you
might<00:04:27.550> have<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.790> wiggle<00:04:28.060> with<00:04:28.150> it<00:04:28.270> a<00:04:28.300> little

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
might have to wiggle with it a little

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.820 
might have to wiggle with it a little
bit<00:04:28.510> sometimes<00:04:28.960> it<00:04:29.200> doesn't<00:04:29.320> want<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.590> do<00:04:29.680> it

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
bit sometimes it doesn't want to do it

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.710 
bit sometimes it doesn't want to do it
and<00:04:30.010> just<00:04:30.040> drop<00:04:30.490> it<00:04:30.610> all<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:30.730> way<00:04:30.940> down<00:04:31.150> for<00:04:31.570> me

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
and just drop it all the way down for me

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.270 
and just drop it all the way down for me
that's<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.140> easiest<00:04:32.530> way<00:04:32.770> to<00:04:32.830> do<00:04:33.040> it

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
that's the easiest way to do it

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.640 
that's the easiest way to do it
and<00:04:33.370> then<00:04:33.850> what<00:04:34.000> I'll<00:04:34.090> do<00:04:34.300> is<00:04:34.330> unlike<00:04:35.140> the<00:04:35.410> flat

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
and then what I'll do is unlike the flat

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.260 
and then what I'll do is unlike the flat
jacket<00:04:36.190> you're<00:04:36.430> gonna<00:04:36.520> start<00:04:36.850> from<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.060> back

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
jacket you're gonna start from the back

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.750 
jacket you're gonna start from the back
you're<00:04:37.510> gonna<00:04:37.630> pull<00:04:37.870> it<00:04:37.960> from<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.560> back

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
you're gonna pull it from the back

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.620 
you're gonna pull it from the back
downward<00:04:39.760> out<00:04:39.970> so<00:04:40.180> you're<00:04:40.270> gonna<00:04:40.360> pull<00:04:40.600> it

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
downward out so you're gonna pull it

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.540 
downward out so you're gonna pull it
down<00:04:41.260> this<00:04:41.560> way<00:04:42.300> just<00:04:43.300> like<00:04:43.390> that<00:04:43.600> now<00:04:44.550> to

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
down this way just like that now to

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.070 
down this way just like that now to
insert<00:04:45.790> the<00:04:46.000> lens<00:04:46.180> you're<00:04:46.450> just<00:04:46.630> going<00:04:46.780> to<00:04:46.810> do

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
insert the lens you're just going to do

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.659 
insert the lens you're just going to do
reverse<00:04:47.470> order<00:04:47.740> so<00:04:48.040> you're<00:04:48.130> gonna<00:04:48.250> start<00:04:48.550> in

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
reverse order so you're gonna start in

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:50.460 
reverse order so you're gonna start in
the<00:04:48.700> front<00:04:49.000> and<00:04:49.360> work<00:04:49.600> towards<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:49.960> back<00:04:50.169> and

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
the front and work towards the back and

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.870 
the front and work towards the back and
as<00:04:50.890> you<00:04:50.979> can<00:04:51.100> see<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.400> lens<00:04:51.550> will<00:04:51.729> have<00:04:51.850> a

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
as you can see the lens will have a

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.070 
as you can see the lens will have a
little<00:04:52.090> hook<00:04:52.360> right<00:04:52.780> there

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
little hook right there

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.330 
little hook right there
so<00:04:53.620> what<00:04:53.710> you're<00:04:53.830> gonna<00:04:53.919> do<00:04:54.070> is<00:04:54.160> you're<00:04:54.250> just

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
so what you're gonna do is you're just

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.620 
so what you're gonna do is you're just
going<00:04:54.430> to<00:04:54.580> put<00:04:54.790> it<00:04:54.880> in<00:04:55.060> and<00:04:55.300> just<00:04:55.450> kind<00:04:55.600> of

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
going to put it in and just kind of

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.719 
going to put it in and just kind of
wiggle<00:04:55.810> it<00:04:55.990> to<00:04:56.320> find<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.620> right<00:04:56.740> spot<00:04:56.860> make

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
wiggle it to find the right spot make

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.310 
wiggle it to find the right spot make
sure<00:04:58.000> that<00:04:58.210> you're<00:04:58.390> lining<00:04:58.630> up<00:04:58.960> this

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
sure that you're lining up this

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.870 
sure that you're lining up this
left-hand<00:04:59.860> corner<00:05:00.280> or<00:05:00.520> sorry<00:05:00.760> this

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
left-hand corner or sorry this

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.010 
left-hand corner or sorry this
right-hand<00:05:01.270> corner<00:05:01.510> of<00:05:01.540> the<00:05:01.630> lens<00:05:01.810> right<00:05:01.960> here

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
right-hand corner of the lens right here

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.350 
right-hand corner of the lens right here
then<00:05:02.830> you<00:05:02.860> just<00:05:03.100> push<00:05:03.250> it<00:05:03.400> down<00:05:03.550> so<00:05:03.580> it<00:05:03.880> flushes

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
then you just push it down so it flushes

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.780 
then you just push it down so it flushes
so<00:05:04.630> it<00:05:04.720> fits<00:05:04.930> flush<00:05:05.350> and<00:05:05.800> then<00:05:06.280> I<00:05:06.430> go<00:05:06.580> ahead<00:05:06.669> and

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
so it fits flush and then I go ahead and

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.090 
so it fits flush and then I go ahead and
put<00:05:07.000> the<00:05:07.090> tooth<00:05:07.330> back<00:05:07.840> in<00:05:08.110> right<00:05:08.290> there<00:05:08.530> and<00:05:08.770> I

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
put the tooth back in right there and I

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.230 
put the tooth back in right there and I
do<00:05:09.280> that<00:05:09.430> just<00:05:09.610> so<00:05:09.669> it<00:05:09.729> doesn't<00:05:09.790> scratch<00:05:10.180> the

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
do that just so it doesn't scratch the

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.719 
do that just so it doesn't scratch the
corner<00:05:10.690> of<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:10.870> lenses<00:05:11.250> and<00:05:12.250> then<00:05:12.430> you<00:05:12.550> what

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
corner of the lenses and then you what

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:13.980 
corner of the lenses and then you what
to<00:05:12.850> do<00:05:12.970> is<00:05:13.060> you'll<00:05:13.180> just<00:05:13.300> push<00:05:13.570> the<00:05:13.750> switch

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
to do is you'll just push the switch

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.140 
to do is you'll just push the switch
lock<00:05:14.229> all<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:15.100> way<00:05:15.160> back<00:05:15.340> up<00:05:15.370> until<00:05:15.729> you<00:05:15.940> hear

lock all the way back up until you hear
it<00:05:16.210> actually<00:05:16.570> lock<00:05:16.870> so<00:05:17.590> that's<00:05:18.070> the<00:05:18.340> easiest

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
relatively simple but it's just not

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:41.760 
relatively simple but it's just not
something<00:05:40.570> that<00:05:40.840> everybody<00:05:41.200> needs<00:05:41.620> to<00:05:41.710> be

two<00:05:58.960> this<00:05:59.710> teardrop<00:06:00.280> on<00:06:00.520> the<00:06:00.639> xlj<00:06:01.270> is<00:06:01.990> massive

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
two this teardrop on the xlj is massive

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.210 
two this teardrop on the xlj is massive
I<00:06:02.800> mean<00:06:02.979> it's<00:06:03.130> just<00:06:03.430> a<00:06:03.819> huge<00:06:04.300> winds<00:06:04.750> so<00:06:05.440> that's

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
I mean it's just a huge winds so that's

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.830 
I mean it's just a huge winds so that's
the<00:06:06.430> reason<00:06:06.580> I<00:06:06.849> tend<00:06:07.120> to<00:06:07.150> like<00:06:07.300> the<00:06:07.360> standard

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
the reason I tend to like the standard

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.969

size<00:06:08.050> a<00:06:08.080> little<00:06:08.349> bit<00:06:08.560> better

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:08.979 
size a little bit better

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:11.249 
size a little bit better
one<00:06:09.699> reason<00:06:10.060> that<00:06:10.090> I<00:06:10.360> kind<00:06:10.599> of<00:06:10.630> hesitated<00:06:10.780> to

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259 
one reason that I kind of hesitated to

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:13.200 
one reason that I kind of hesitated to
buy<00:06:11.440> the<00:06:11.500> flak<00:06:11.860> jacket<00:06:12.310> or<00:06:12.610> the<00:06:12.669> sorry<00:06:13.060> the
