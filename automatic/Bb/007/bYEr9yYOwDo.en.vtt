00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.709
 ae 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.180
 Good, I just got here, but it 's 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.090
 which sees the event as a country of death and 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.920
 from 5 to tvs to these dead are the 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.080
 same as always having a new version 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.820
 thus with different time modes 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.309
 acceptable if they were of such a vehicle 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.680
 informed that perhaps the animation was 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.440
 maybe now maybe bay area but it was 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.989
 maybe the vital and half and will show in the 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.579
 like this on the empty letters 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.579
 vital and disposable masks
