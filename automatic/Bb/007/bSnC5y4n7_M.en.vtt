00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
problem because we have P up here which

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.580 
problem because we have P up here which
stands<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.100> Park<00:01:26.540> you<00:01:27.540> just<00:01:27.720> turn<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.290> puts

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
cups which help keep it from moving when

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.030 
cups which help keep it from moving when
it's<00:01:41.970> kneading<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.600> dough<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.990> here<00:01:43.200> one<00:01:43.920> of

blades in this because it can be a
little<00:03:41.920> tricky<00:03:42.220> so<00:03:43.090> I'm<00:03:43.150> just<00:03:43.330> going<00:03:43.570> to<00:03:43.630> twist

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
little tricky so I'm just going to twist

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.960 
little tricky so I'm just going to twist
it<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:44.620> it<00:03:44.770> is<00:03:44.860> a<00:03:44.890> little<00:03:45.100> firm<00:03:45.340> which<00:03:45.550> is<00:03:45.580> good

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
it and it is a little firm which is good

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.810 
it and it is a little firm which is good
to<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.540> arrows<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.080> this<00:03:47.410> lifts<00:03:47.770> off<00:03:47.890> this

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
to the arrows and this lifts off this

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.699 
to the arrows and this lifts off this
little<00:03:49.120> part<00:03:49.330> right<00:03:49.390> here<00:03:49.720> also<00:03:50.260> comes<00:03:50.500> out

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
little part right here also comes out

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.830 
little part right here also comes out
which<00:03:50.890> makes<00:03:51.070> for<00:03:51.340> easy<00:03:51.489> cleaning<00:03:51.940> right<00:03:52.660> now

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
which makes for easy cleaning right now
