00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.870
 hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.360
 I will be taken away I am very glad that you 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.180
 like this format and your 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.660
 applications we will consider the legendary map 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.210
 called wake island for this very reason 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.640
 map can be judged revolve the wrong or 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.999
 other battlefield although this card is not 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.820
 there was a spin-off battlefield and his 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:32.070
 no bad bad game series 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.120
 vietnam it was not battlefield 2 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.489
 modern combat 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.489
 but today we only look at four 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.309
 version of this map from battlefield 1942 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.469
 battlefield 1943 battlefield 2 and 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.750
 battlefield 3 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.949
 but for starters a small historical 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.210
 reference 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:53.250
 the island was discovered on October 20, 1568 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.050
 spanish travelers who 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.960
 discovered the Solomon Islands 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.820
 worthless island is not represented and 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.430
 forgot about him in 1796 the island was 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.360
 reopened by English captain u and 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.690
 com in 1935 in the United States on this island 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.210
 built an intermediate race 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.800
 the battlefield series this island appeared in 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.050
 battlefield 1942 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.850
 and it could contemplate them play 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.810
 all types of troops who were 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.880
 presented in this game back in 2002 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.520
 year on this map occurred most 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.910
 hot battles with ships 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.820
 Aviation and photo foreign cap it was 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.120
 present and now unfortunately find 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.090
 a big server for 64 players is very difficult 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.780
 in this version, the island is forgotten and on it 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.940
 tusit 3020 lonely warrior but after 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.400
 a short break back to the island 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.710
 Americans and Chinese to solve everything 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.020
 my problems in my opinion option from 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.380
 battlefield 2 is the most cruel and 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.050
 heavy wake battlefield you can safely 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.490
 name the most meat card for hands 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.159
 just impossible 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.789
 fight you say that there is a thread on the ears 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.810
 Metro at 64 is meat means you did not play 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.110
 in battlefield 2 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.890
 especially skills despite the fact that 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.420
 battlefield 2 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.970
 disappeared cruisers with powerful 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.340
 artillery guns anyway 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.440
 skills going on hell 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.319
 front aviation in person 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.519
 bombers do not leave any chance 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.800
 vehicles not infantry in this variant you them 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.230
 he scares me with his heavenly view 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.340
 probably this is the whole soul 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.100
 This card as a whole is the perfect card. 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.230
 for fans to fly on 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.069
 fighter bombers for infantry 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.489
 and technology 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.760
 skills impossible to fight in the battlefield 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.560
 2142 Vek moved to the future became covered 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.700
 snow 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.799
 Sorry I could not play the option from 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.500
 2142 since there are no servers left 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.680
 only 5 immediately remembered here 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.680
 lovely podcast which was dedicated 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.299
 death of this but back to freud in 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.120
 battlefield 1943 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:15.359
 You first tried on Frostbyte and 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.690
 I can say what to go out since 1943 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:21.420
 beautiful but he has one problem 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.329
 this decision became much less days 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:29.010
 it is clear in this game the number of players 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:31.799
 decreased from 64 to 24 and even despite 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.810
 this sad fact is very skills 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.910
 interesting 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.370
 make it possible to preserve the meatiness of the data 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.569
 maps well and plus destructible itself 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.220
 adds the latest gameplay 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.810
 reincarnations to we saw in the battlefield 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.630
 3 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.650
 This version of this card calls me 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.910
 rage attack 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:57.120
 First Wake Island Battlefield 3 Lesson 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.220
 no filter makes this card just wretched 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.829
 in my opinion the heavenly beauty of this 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.730
 places is not even a chip but a soul 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:07.380
 of this card but days we decided 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.620
 show gloomy sky and blue 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.080
 filter so sorry guys but i will remove 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.800
 whether 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.320
 secondly they have changed too much 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.870
 landscape of the island added some stones 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.030
 us these extra hillock 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.010
 probably it was done for the sake of the prize 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.880
 fellers who fear fall from 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.210
 stray bullet 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.880
 the fact is that previous versions 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.540
 Watering was no it is not toward me 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.840
 hillock nothing it was just such 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.280
 fee 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.680
 palm cover yes you sure 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.810
 Become an easy target for snipers 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.240
 for reactivity bombers 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.570
 in any case, even in the form of 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.890
 battlefield 2 in this fun play wake 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.520
 from battlefield 3 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:57.010
 he personally has a veteran series 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.770
 causes only negative especially these 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.350
 stones and mounds too many shelters 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.460
 gets well and the last reason for my 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:08.860
 hate battlefield 3 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.930
 wake up in battlefield3 not meat 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.440
 you do not know what it is and because 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.810
 that battlefield 3 no bombers 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.940
 artillery and basically on this map 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.700
 very little technology is presented 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:25.060
 the only plus version of the battlefield 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.400
 3 is that we were presented 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.740
 wake in assault mode which is on my 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.950
 a look is one of the best drunk and 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.540
 In principle, I am pleased that the ransom 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.820
 We got all the new modes that 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.580
 presented in battlefield 3 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.640
 Well, the final question dear 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.830
