00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
for a while and it's not one of the

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.730 
for a while and it's not one of the
smallest<00:00:05.970> rap<00:00:06.330> that<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:07.020> half<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.319> size<00:00:07.710> and

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740

smallest rap that is half the size and
probably<00:00:08.340> even<00:00:08.400> less<00:00:08.639> power<00:00:08.910> but<00:00:09.320> today<00:00:10.320> we're

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
probably even less power but today we're

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.290 
probably even less power but today we're
going<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.679> do<00:00:10.830> something<00:00:11.250> with<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.429> we<00:00:12.030> haven't

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.040 
shoot into my face defend me can I have
a<00:00:47.489> protection<00:00:48.090> let's<00:00:48.210> do<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:53.449> where<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.600> it

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
a protection let's do it where is it

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.350 
a protection let's do it where is it
let's<00:00:55.980> check<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.340> out<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.670> slow<00:00:56.699> motion<00:00:57.090> and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
let's check it out in slow motion and

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:08.840 
let's check it out in slow motion and
see<00:00:57.510> what<00:00:57.660> happened

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.090 

but<00:01:09.390> they<00:01:09.600> look<00:01:09.780> pretty<00:01:09.810> cool<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.350> slow<00:01:10.590> motion

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
but they look pretty cool in slow motion

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.500 
but they look pretty cool in slow motion
although<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.610> wasn't<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.030> result<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.480> I

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
although it wasn't the result that I

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.840 
although it wasn't the result that I
expected<00:01:13.050> to<00:01:13.200> see<00:01:13.410> I'm<00:01:13.860> hoping<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.520> hit<00:01:14.700> it

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
expected to see I'm hoping to hit it

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.420 
expected to see I'm hoping to hit it
again<00:01:14.940> and<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.110> bracket<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.920> smash<00:01:17.220> it

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
again and for the bracket to smash it

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.010 
again and for the bracket to smash it
and<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:18.210> wanted<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.480> see<00:01:18.720> if<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.930> I'll

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
and I just wanted to see if and I'll

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.080 
and I just wanted to see if and I'll
break<00:01:19.230> it<00:01:19.470> or<00:01:19.590> what<00:01:19.770> happens<00:01:20.160> to<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.400> when<00:01:20.610> it

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
break it or what happens to it when it

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.720 
break it or what happens to it when it
smashes<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:22.230> against<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.740> wood<00:01:22.920> let's<00:01:23.400> do

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
smashes that against the wood let's do

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.000 
smashes that against the wood let's do
it<00:01:23.790> right<00:01:24.630> everyone<00:01:25.050> made<00:01:25.230> it<00:01:25.610> let's<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.850> it
