00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
the wall or socket whatever you have I

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.500 
the wall or socket whatever you have I
have<00:00:39.920> like<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:42.410> plugs<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:44.149> goes<00:00:45.149> into<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
have like a I plugs that goes into the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.150 
have like a I plugs that goes into the
wall<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.899> can<00:00:45.930> extend<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.680> then<00:00:47.039> you'll

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
wall so I can extend it and then you'll

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.220 
wall so I can extend it and then you'll
need<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.670> put<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> other<00:00:48.300> end<00:00:48.510> into<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.020> back

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
need to put the other end into the back

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.029 
need to put the other end into the back
of<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.530> console<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.840> it<00:00:51.840> might<00:00:52.469> be<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> little

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
of the console so it might be a little

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.889 
of the console so it might be a little
hard<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.460> get<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:53.969> push<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:54.750> some

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
hard to get in just push it with some

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.360 
hard to get in just push it with some
force<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.469> then<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:55.829> know<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.129> should<00:00:56.280> go

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
force and then you know it should go

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.580 
force and then you know it should go
into<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.640> record<00:00:56.760> console<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.449> then<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
into the record console and then the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.729 
into the record console and then the
next<00:00:58.890> step<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.579> plug<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.390> RCA<00:01:01.199> cables

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
next step is to plug in the RCA cables

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.680 
next step is to plug in the RCA cables
so<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.820> see<00:01:02.940> here<00:01:03.120> they'll<00:01:03.300> go<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.539> this

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
so you can see here they'll go in this

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.010 
so you can see here they'll go in this
slot<00:01:03.930> which<00:01:04.140> I'm<00:01:04.290> pointing<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.680> now<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:06.020> or

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
slot which I'm pointing to now and or

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.390 
slot which I'm pointing to now and or
dreamcast<00:01:07.290> apps<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.830> fit<00:01:07.979> with<00:01:08.250> their

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
dreamcast apps you can fit with their

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.520 
dreamcast apps you can fit with their
ethnic<00:01:09.060> port<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.510> that's<00:01:10.049> actually<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:10.439> you

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
ethnic port and that's actually so you

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.859 
ethnic port and that's actually so you
could<00:01:10.650> play<00:01:10.799> online<00:01:11.010> games<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.760> won't<00:01:12.570> be<00:01:12.659> doing

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
could play online games I won't be doing

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.539 
could play online games I won't be doing
anything<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.380> tutorial<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.979> do<00:01:14.070> with<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.310> but

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
anything in tutorial to do with that but

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.950 
anything in tutorial to do with that but
that<00:01:14.729> might<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.119> separate<00:01:15.540> video<00:01:15.659> because

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
that might be a separate video because

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.179 
that might be a separate video because
the<00:01:16.110> history<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.920> pretty

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
the history for that is that pretty

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.640 
the history for that is that pretty
interesting<00:01:18.020> okay<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:19.380> I'm<00:01:19.439> gonna<00:01:19.530> do

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
interesting okay so what I'm gonna do

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.810 
interesting okay so what I'm gonna do
now<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.830> I'm<00:01:19.979> going<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.280> take<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> close<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.759> my

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
now is I'm going to take a close to my

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
TV I've plugged the RCA cable into the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.120 
TV I've plugged the RCA cable into the
back<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.420> console<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.930> then<00:01:25.860> I've<00:01:26.100> put

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
