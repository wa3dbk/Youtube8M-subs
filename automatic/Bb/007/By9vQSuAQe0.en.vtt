00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
always a hot topic this one suppression

always a hot topic this one suppression
introduced<00:00:22.070> in<00:00:22.340> battlefield<00:00:22.939> 3<00:00:23.000> the<00:00:23.210> mechanic

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
introduced in battlefield 3 the mechanic

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.620 
introduced in battlefield 3 the mechanic
was<00:00:23.869> greeted<00:00:24.259> with<00:00:24.340> well<00:00:25.340> a<00:00:25.580> mixed<00:00:26.390> response

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
was greeted with well a mixed response

was greeted with well a mixed response
shall<00:00:27.050> we<00:00:27.230> say<00:00:27.489> adding<00:00:28.489> a<00:00:28.550> mechanic<00:00:28.970> in<00:00:29.150> game

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
shall we say adding a mechanic in game

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.390 
shall we say adding a mechanic in game
that<00:00:29.660> forces<00:00:30.050> a<00:00:30.079> player<00:00:30.320> to<00:00:30.590> break<00:00:30.829> away<00:00:31.009> from

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
that forces a player to break away from

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.540 
that forces a player to break away from
direct<00:00:31.669> fire<00:00:32.090> and<00:00:32.390> take<00:00:32.629> cover<00:00:32.930> made<00:00:33.800> sense<00:00:34.220> in

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
direct fire and take cover made sense in

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.329 
direct fire and take cover made sense in
battlefield<00:00:35.120> but<00:00:35.690> it<00:00:35.780> wasn't<00:00:36.140> perfect<00:00:36.379> at

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:37.339 
battlefield but it wasn't perfect at

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:39.759 
battlefield but it wasn't perfect at
that<00:00:37.610> time<00:00:37.910> dice<00:00:38.600> decided<00:00:39.230> that<00:00:39.350> making<00:00:39.710> it

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
that time dice decided that making it

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:41.259 
that time dice decided that making it
look<00:00:39.920> like<00:00:39.980> your<00:00:40.309> screen<00:00:40.670> had<00:00:40.820> been<00:00:40.850> steamed

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
look like your screen had been steamed

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:43.270 
look like your screen had been steamed
up<00:00:41.449> with<00:00:41.989> like<00:00:42.140> condensation<00:00:42.860> on<00:00:42.949> a<00:00:42.980> cold

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
up with like condensation on a cold

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.579 
up with like condensation on a cold
window<00:00:43.760> and<00:00:44.000> making<00:00:44.809> your<00:00:44.930> bullets<00:00:45.320> start

window and making your bullets start
firing<00:00:45.890> in<00:00:46.190> random<00:00:46.610> directions<00:00:46.870> was<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:48.019> best

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
firing in random directions was the best

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.369 
firing in random directions was the best
way<00:00:48.409> to<00:00:48.440> go<00:00:48.769> obviously<00:00:49.629> people<00:00:50.629> didn't<00:00:51.080> really

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
way to go obviously people didn't really

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.799 
way to go obviously people didn't really
like<00:00:51.589> this<00:00:51.860> and<00:00:52.129> in<00:00:52.460> battlefield<00:00:53.000> 4<00:00:53.239> the

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
like this and in battlefield 4 the

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.750 
like this and in battlefield 4 the
effect<00:00:54.170> was<00:00:54.320> reduced<00:00:54.739> somewhat<00:00:55.159> but<00:00:55.430> still

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
effect was reduced somewhat but still

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.350 
effect was reduced somewhat but still
played<00:00:56.030> a<00:00:56.210> big<00:00:56.570> role<00:00:56.600> in<00:00:56.930> gunfights

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
played a big role in gunfights

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.910 
played a big role in gunfights
essentially<00:00:59.360> what<00:00:59.839> suppression<00:01:00.409> did<00:01:00.650> was

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
essentially what suppression did was

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.549 
essentially what suppression did was
remove<00:01:01.519> skill<00:01:01.939> from<00:01:02.210> every<00:01:02.720> single<00:01:02.960> gunfight

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
remove skill from every single gunfight

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.830 
remove skill from every single gunfight
entered<00:01:03.979> by<00:01:04.159> a<00:01:04.189> player<00:01:04.519> and<00:01:04.850> leave<00:01:05.390> it<00:01:05.540> up<00:01:05.630> to

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
entered by a player and leave it up to

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.530 
entered by a player and leave it up to
random<00:01:06.320> fate<00:01:06.650> as<00:01:07.159> two<00:01:07.369> who'd<00:01:07.580> win<00:01:07.909> which

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
random fate as two who'd win which

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.630 
random fate as two who'd win which
wasn't<00:01:08.960> really<00:01:09.350> fair<00:01:09.590> at<00:01:09.770> all<00:01:09.979> if<00:01:10.159> you<00:01:10.280> go<00:01:10.460> into

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
wasn't really fair at all if you go into

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.850 
wasn't really fair at all if you go into
a<00:01:10.729> gunfight<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.509> person<00:01:12.110> with<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.320> best<00:01:12.530> aim

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
a gunfight the person with the best aim

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.420 
a gunfight the person with the best aim
should<00:01:13.460> always<00:01:13.700> win<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:14.570> to<00:01:15.350> an<00:01:15.470> extent<00:01:15.590> that

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
should always win and to an extent that

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.179 
should always win and to an extent that
still<00:01:16.909> happens<00:01:17.450> where<00:01:17.840> somebody<00:01:18.830> doesn't

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
still happens where somebody doesn't

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.760 
still happens where somebody doesn't
quite<00:01:19.460> win<00:01:19.729> because<00:01:19.970> of<00:01:20.270> suppression<00:01:20.720> and<00:01:21.110> I

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
quite win because of suppression and I

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.050 
quite win because of suppression and I
don't<00:01:21.979> really<00:01:22.249> think<00:01:22.340> that's<00:01:22.640> fair

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
don't really think that's fair

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.440 
don't really think that's fair
and<00:01:23.509> that's<00:01:23.689> only<00:01:23.840> due<00:01:24.079> to<00:01:24.259> a<00:01:24.289> visual<00:01:24.950> effect

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
and that's only due to a visual effect

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.569 
and that's only due to a visual effect

another go and just at face value it
looks<00:01:31.609> a<00:01:31.700> far<00:01:32.179> better<00:01:32.450> than<00:01:32.810> any<00:01:33.049> other

explains in short how gunfights and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.389 
explains in short how gunfights and
suppression<00:01:41.810> will<00:01:42.079> now<00:01:42.229> pair<00:01:42.590> together<00:01:42.859> and

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
suppression will now pair together and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.999 
suppression will now pair together and
to<00:01:43.880> quickly<00:01:44.060> explain<00:01:44.479> it<00:01:44.810> I'll<00:01:45.469> run<00:01:45.829> through

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
to quickly explain it I'll run through

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.039 
to quickly explain it I'll run through
some<00:01:46.340> of<00:01:46.520> what<00:01:46.549> it<00:01:46.969> it's<00:01:47.359> trying<00:01:47.659> to<00:01:47.780> show<00:01:47.990> you

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
some of what it it's trying to show you

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.679 
some of what it it's trying to show you
if<00:01:48.619> you're<00:01:49.159> using<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.520> gun<00:01:49.729> in<00:01:49.939> its<00:01:50.149> optimal

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
if you're using a gun in its optimal

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:53.050 
if you're using a gun in its optimal
range<00:01:50.929> that<00:01:51.229> is<00:01:51.350> to<00:01:51.499> say<00:01:51.679> in<00:01:51.979> like<00:01:52.399> extreme

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
range that is to say in like extreme

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.510 
range that is to say in like extreme
close<00:01:53.389> quarters<00:01:53.869> for<00:01:54.079> example<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:55.009> weapon<00:01:55.369> is

close quarters for example the weapon is

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.399 
close quarters for example the weapon is
unlikely<00:01:55.969> to<00:01:56.179> suppress<00:01:56.659> you<00:01:56.869> as<00:01:57.079> you're<00:01:57.319> in

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.570 
are actually trying to suppress someone
in<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:12.290> fall-off<00:02:12.530> zone<00:02:12.980> there's<00:02:13.310> still<00:02:13.550> a

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
in the fall-off zone there's still a

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.949 
in the fall-off zone there's still a
chance<00:02:13.819> that<00:02:14.120> you'd<00:02:14.240> be<00:02:14.360> looking<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.780> take

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
chance that you'd be looking to take

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.260 
chance that you'd be looking to take
somebody<00:02:15.410> down<00:02:15.440> but<00:02:16.310> due<00:02:16.459> to<00:02:16.610> recoil<00:02:17.000> and

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
somebody down but due to recoil and

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.090 
somebody down but due to recoil and
other<00:02:17.420> weapon<00:02:17.840> characteristics<00:02:18.620> the

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
other weapon characteristics the

other weapon characteristics the
likelihood<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:20.090> dropping<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.630> target

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
likelihood of you dropping that target

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.380 
likelihood of you dropping that target
is<00:02:21.290> greatly<00:02:21.770> reduced<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:23.030> suppression

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
is greatly reduced and the suppression

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.240 
is greatly reduced and the suppression
effect<00:02:23.630> is<00:02:24.080> applied<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.500> little<00:02:24.830> bit<00:02:24.980> and

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
effect is applied a little bit and

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.670 
effect is applied a little bit and
within<00:02:25.879> that<00:02:26.060> suppression<00:02:26.750> zone<00:02:26.989> entirely<00:02:27.470> at

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
within that suppression zone entirely at

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.500 
within that suppression zone entirely at
the<00:02:27.709> end<00:02:27.980> there<00:02:28.250> your<00:02:28.790> weapon<00:02:29.150> is<00:02:29.269> mainly

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
the end there your weapon is mainly

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.350 
the end there your weapon is mainly
being<00:02:29.870> used<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.409> suppress

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
being used to suppress

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.570 
being used to suppress
target<00:02:31.900> bullets<00:02:32.440> might<00:02:32.650> make<00:02:32.980> contact<00:02:33.460> with

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
target bullets might make contact with

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.490 
target bullets might make contact with
the<00:02:33.700> enemy<00:02:34.000> but<00:02:34.030> overall<00:02:34.510> you're<00:02:35.080> really<00:02:35.320> just

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
the enemy but overall you're really just

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.650 
the enemy but overall you're really just
looking<00:02:35.710> to<00:02:35.860> stop<00:02:36.130> them<00:02:36.430> taking<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.180> down<00:02:37.420> and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
looking to stop them taking you down and

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.810 
looking to stop them taking you down and
the<00:02:37.990> best<00:02:38.140> way<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.320> do<00:02:38.590> that<00:02:38.770> is<00:02:38.980> by<00:02:39.160> firing<00:02:39.700> at

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
the best way to do that is by firing at

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.020 
the best way to do that is by firing at
them<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:41.320> essentially<00:02:41.890> from<00:02:42.190> that<00:02:42.400> graph<00:02:42.700> we

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
them and essentially from that graph we

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.000 
them and essentially from that graph we
can<00:02:43.180> see<00:02:43.240> that<00:02:43.630> dice<00:02:43.900> la<00:02:44.230> have<00:02:44.500> clearly

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
can see that dice la have clearly

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.460 
can see that dice la have clearly
differentiated<00:02:45.970> how<00:02:46.090> suppression<00:02:46.750> will<00:02:47.170> work

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
differentiated how suppression will work

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.890 
differentiated how suppression will work
after<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.700> spring<00:02:48.940> patch<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:49.570> basically

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
after the spring patch and basically

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.110 
after the spring patch and basically
what<00:02:50.140> they've<00:02:50.290> done<00:02:50.470> is<00:02:50.770> remove<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.640> random

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
what they've done is remove the random

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.180 
what they've done is remove the random
aspect<00:02:52.630> of<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.020> mechanic<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.680> that's<00:02:53.980> been

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
aspect of the mechanic that that's been

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.070 
aspect of the mechanic that that's been
present<00:02:54.580> in<00:02:54.700> battlefield<00:02:55.180> 3<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.780> start

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.380 
present in battlefield 3 and the start
of<00:02:56.230> battlefield<00:02:56.680> 4<00:02:56.740> and<00:02:57.130> reworked<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.180> into

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
of battlefield 4 and reworked it into

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.880 
of battlefield 4 and reworked it into
something<00:02:58.600> that<00:02:58.720> you<00:02:58.840> might<00:02:59.110> expect<00:02:59.650> to

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
something that you might expect to

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.880 
something that you might expect to
actually<00:03:00.190> carry<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.060> title<00:03:01.270> of<00:03:01.890> suppression

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
actually carry the title of suppression

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.400 
actually carry the title of suppression
the<00:03:03.580> mechanic<00:03:03.970> is<00:03:04.090> now<00:03:04.270> a<00:03:04.300> useful<00:03:04.930> tool<00:03:05.200> to

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
the mechanic is now a useful tool to

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.890 
the mechanic is now a useful tool to

angle on the enemy by suppressing the

target<00:03:10.060> at<00:03:10.180> longer<00:03:10.390> ranges<00:03:10.840> allowing<00:03:11.709> you<00:03:11.830> to

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
target at longer ranges allowing you to

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.070 
target at longer ranges allowing you to
move<00:03:12.250> up<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.760> more<00:03:13.030> effective<00:03:13.360> range<00:03:13.780> and

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
move up to a more effective range and

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.760 
move up to a more effective range and
use<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.709> weapon<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.459> kill<00:03:15.640> somebody<00:03:15.910> instead

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
use that weapon to kill somebody instead

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.979 
use that weapon to kill somebody instead

um<00:03:38.049> I'm<00:03:38.440> really<00:03:38.799> looking<00:03:39.190> forward<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.549> seeing

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
um I'm really looking forward to seeing

um I'm really looking forward to seeing
what<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:40.390> guys<00:03:40.630> on<00:03:41.140> console<00:03:41.769> actually<00:03:42.160> make

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
what you guys on console actually make

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.729 
what you guys on console actually make
of<00:03:42.820> this<00:03:42.970> change<00:03:43.239> as<00:03:43.420> well<00:03:43.570> because<00:03:43.989> that's

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
of this change as well because that's

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.140 
of this change as well because that's
where<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.100> system<00:03:45.280> hasn't<00:03:45.610> been<00:03:45.790> fully

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.850 
where the system hasn't been fully

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.590 
yet but going from the implementation
that<00:03:50.470> we've<00:03:50.769> seen<00:03:51.010> on<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.280> PC<00:03:51.670> client<00:03:52.120> I'm

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
that we've seen on the PC client I'm

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.180 
that we've seen on the PC client I'm
pretty<00:03:52.930> confident<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.500> this<00:03:53.620> change<00:03:53.980> will

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
pretty confident that this change will

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.910 
pretty confident that this change will
be<00:03:54.220> considered<00:03:54.760> a<00:03:54.850> good<00:03:55.209> one<00:03:55.420> and<00:03:56.080> one<00:03:56.709> more

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
be considered a good one and one more

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.530 
be considered a good one and one more
thing<00:03:57.070> that<00:03:57.130> I<00:03:57.280> just<00:03:57.430> want<00:03:57.610> to<00:03:57.670> add<00:03:57.850> really<00:03:58.390> and

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
thing that I just want to add really and

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.509 
thing that I just want to add really and
it<00:03:58.900> kind<00:03:59.200> of<00:03:59.290> backs<00:03:59.500> up<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.890> reasoning<00:04:00.310> why

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
it kind of backs up the reasoning why

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.370 
it kind of backs up the reasoning why
this<00:04:00.580> mechanic<00:04:01.540> has<00:04:01.660> been<00:04:01.840> changed<00:04:02.260> because

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
this mechanic has been changed because

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.289 
this mechanic has been changed because
my<00:04:03.340> perspective<00:04:03.970> on<00:04:04.290> suppression<00:04:05.290> is<00:04:05.560> well

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299

have<00:04:30.520> done<00:04:30.729> is<00:04:31.180> simplified<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.110> process<00:04:32.350> and

implementation<00:04:57.250> I<00:04:57.370> think<00:04:57.669> of<00:04:57.849> what

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
implementation I think of what

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.809 
implementation I think of what
suppression<00:04:58.930> is<00:04:59.080> that<00:04:59.289> and<00:04:59.469> has<00:04:59.710> ever<00:05:00.009> been<00:05:00.310> in

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:00.819 
suppression is that and has ever been in

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:02.339 
suppression is that and has ever been in
the<00:05:01.060> Battlefield<00:05:01.539> series<00:05:01.599> and<00:05:02.020> let's<00:05:02.199> just

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
the Battlefield series and let's just

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.980 
the Battlefield series and let's just
hope<00:05:02.500> it<00:05:02.710> stays<00:05:02.979> that<00:05:03.039> way<00:05:03.370> for<00:05:03.789> future<00:05:04.360> titles

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
hope it stays that way for future titles

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.459 
hope it stays that way for future titles
in<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:05.379> Battlefield<00:05:05.860> franchise<00:05:05.919> and<00:05:07.469> just

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:08.469 
in the Battlefield franchise and just

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:10.559 
in the Battlefield franchise and just
one<00:05:08.710> more<00:05:08.860> thing<00:05:09.129> that<00:05:09.189> I<00:05:09.340> want<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:09.759> add<00:05:10.000> on<00:05:10.030> to

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:10.569 
one more thing that I want to add on to

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:13.860 
one more thing that I want to add on to
my<00:05:10.599> add-on<00:05:11.500> here<00:05:11.830> it<00:05:12.219> seems<00:05:12.610> that<00:05:12.879> CTE<00:05:13.479> for

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
my add-on here it seems that CTE for

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.159 
my add-on here it seems that CTE for
consoles<00:05:14.500> is<00:05:14.830> about<00:05:15.520> to<00:05:15.729> become<00:05:15.879> a<00:05:16.300> real<00:05:16.689> thing

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
consoles is about to become a real thing

not be able to tell but there are two
Xbox<00:05:26.590> ones<00:05:26.860> on<00:05:27.069> the<00:05:27.279> desk<00:05:27.580> there<00:05:27.909> and<00:05:28.330> both

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
Xbox ones on the desk there and both

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.179 
Xbox ones on the desk there and both
screens<00:05:28.960> are<00:05:29.169> hooked<00:05:29.379> up<00:05:29.560> to<00:05:29.620> them<00:05:29.860> and<00:05:30.009> they

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:30.189 
screens are hooked up to them and they

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:32.760 
screens are hooked up to them and they
are<00:05:30.310> both<00:05:30.580> running<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.689> CTE<00:05:32.169> client<00:05:32.680> and

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
are both running the CTE client and

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.260 
are both running the CTE client and
they're<00:05:32.860> not<00:05:33.009> development<00:05:33.669> boxes<00:05:34.060> they're

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
they're not development boxes they're

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.019 
they're not development boxes they're
actual<00:05:34.779> Xbox<00:05:35.379> ones<00:05:35.740> which<00:05:36.430> is<00:05:36.639> really

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:37.029 
actual Xbox ones which is really

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:39.209 
actual Xbox ones which is really
exciting<00:05:37.360> they<00:05:37.689> finally<00:05:38.199> managed<00:05:38.500> to<00:05:38.529> get<00:05:38.770> CTE

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:39.219 
exciting they finally managed to get CTE

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:41.969 
exciting they finally managed to get CTE
working<00:05:39.849> on<00:05:40.029> the<00:05:40.629> consoles<00:05:41.139> there's<00:05:41.379> still<00:05:41.650> no

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
working on the consoles there's still no

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.730 
working on the consoles there's still no
specific<00:05:42.610> time<00:05:42.909> frame<00:05:43.270> for<00:05:43.750> when<00:05:43.810> CTE<00:05:44.409> will

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
specific time frame for when CTE will

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.309 
specific time frame for when CTE will
arrive<00:05:45.219> on<00:05:45.580> consoles<00:05:46.300> but<00:05:46.810> it<00:05:46.900> has<00:05:47.110> been

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 
arrive on consoles but it has been

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:48.779 
arrive on consoles but it has been
confirmed<00:05:47.529> that<00:05:47.889> it<00:05:47.979> will<00:05:48.069> only<00:05:48.340> work<00:05:48.759> for

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789

getting access to CTE and the main

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.170 
getting access to CTE and the main
reason<00:05:59.259> for<00:05:59.289> that<00:05:59.440> is<00:05:59.610> well<00:06:00.610> the<00:06:00.819> consoles

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
reason for that is well the consoles

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.700 
reason for that is well the consoles
just<00:06:01.389> simply<00:06:01.659> aren't<00:06:01.839> powerful<00:06:02.110> enough<00:06:02.440> for

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
just simply aren't powerful enough for

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.170 
just simply aren't powerful enough for
those<00:06:02.800> of<00:06:02.949> you<00:06:03.009> that<00:06:03.099> don't<00:06:03.250> know<00:06:03.400> I<00:06:03.669> think<00:06:04.089> the

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
those of you that don't know I think the

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.800 
those of you that don't know I think the
ps3<00:06:04.690> only<00:06:04.870> has<00:06:05.110> 512<00:06:05.979> megabytes<00:06:06.639> of<00:06:06.879> RAM<00:06:07.180> so

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
ps3 only has 512 megabytes of RAM so

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.540 
ps3 only has 512 megabytes of RAM so
it's<00:06:07.990> amazing<00:06:08.319> that<00:06:08.589> the<00:06:08.800> games<00:06:09.039> still

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
it's amazing that the games still

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.180 
it's amazing that the games still
managed<00:06:09.879> to<00:06:10.060> even<00:06:10.210> run<00:06:10.629> on<00:06:11.050> those<00:06:11.589> consoles

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
managed to even run on those consoles

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.459 
managed to even run on those consoles
but<00:06:12.370> they<00:06:12.520> can't<00:06:12.819> handle<00:06:13.210> a<00:06:13.629> development

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:14.469 
but they can't handle a development

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:15.839 
but they can't handle a development
environment<00:06:14.589> but<00:06:15.189> it's<00:06:15.310> still<00:06:15.400> pretty<00:06:15.580> cool

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:15.849 
environment but it's still pretty cool

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:17.820 
environment but it's still pretty cool
