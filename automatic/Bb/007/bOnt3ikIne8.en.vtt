sandbox gameplay experience we've also

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.240 
sandbox gameplay experience we've also
felt<00:01:08.570> that<00:01:08.659> with<00:01:08.900> modern<00:01:09.050> consoles<00:01:09.590> we<00:01:09.950> can<00:01:10.130> do

felt that with modern consoles we can do

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.280 
felt that with modern consoles we can do
something<00:01:10.670> we<00:01:10.790> always<00:01:11.000> wanted<00:01:11.479> that<00:01:11.930> is<00:01:12.110> to

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
something we always wanted that is to

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.260 
something we always wanted that is to
create<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.590> truly<00:01:12.920> dynamic<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:13.759> destructible

world<00:01:14.600> of<00:01:15.170> course<00:01:15.470> this<00:01:16.070> meant<00:01:16.280> we<00:01:16.460> needed<00:01:16.490> to

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
world of course this meant we needed to

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.460 
world of course this meant we needed to
attack<00:01:16.940> a<00:01:16.970> lot<00:01:17.210> of<00:01:17.330> interesting<00:01:17.930> technical

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
attack a lot of interesting technical

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:33.999

challenges<00:01:18.950> like<00:01:31.360> thank<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.479> you're<00:01:32.630> Kim<00:01:33.009> so

what does all this actually mean anyway
well<00:01:36.619> what<00:01:37.009> it<00:01:37.130> means<00:01:37.160> is<00:01:37.640> that<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.880> frostbite

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
well what it means is that the frostbite

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.630 
well what it means is that the frostbite
engine<00:01:38.450> really<00:01:39.110> allows<00:01:39.590> us<00:01:39.619> to<00:01:39.860> take<00:01:40.220> fully

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
engine really allows us to take fully

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.580 
engine really allows us to take fully
advantage<00:01:40.759> of<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.600> processing<00:01:42.080> power<00:01:42.259> of<00:01:42.410> the

360 and the ps3 this new battlefield is

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.040 
360 and the ps3 this new battlefield is
not<00:01:46.130> only<00:01:46.310> incredibly<00:01:47.179> detailed<00:01:47.570> and

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
not only incredibly detailed and

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
buildings to vehicles to trees an actual

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.859 
buildings to vehicles to trees an actual
ground<00:02:08.530> you're<00:02:09.040> walking<00:02:09.460> on<00:02:09.580> it<00:02:10.149> can<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.780> it

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
ground you're walking on it can and it

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:21.150 
ground you're walking on it can and it
will<00:02:10.990> be<00:02:11.350> destroyed<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:20.530> in<00:02:20.650> order<00:02:20.770> for<00:02:20.890> this

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
will be destroyed so in order for this

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.580 
will be destroyed so in order for this
to<00:02:21.220> work<00:02:21.430> properly<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.840> lighting<00:02:23.260> needs<00:02:23.440> to

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
to work properly the lighting needs to

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.640 
to work properly the lighting needs to
be<00:02:23.680> dynamic<00:02:24.220> as<00:02:24.370> well<00:02:24.750> if<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.930> blow<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.170> hole<00:02:26.410> in<00:02:26.440> a

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
be dynamic as well if I blow a hole in a

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.750 
be dynamic as well if I blow a hole in a
wall<00:02:31.200> or<00:02:32.200> if<00:02:32.380> I<00:02:32.500> change<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.190> position<00:02:33.640> of<00:02:33.700> the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
wall or if I change the position of the

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.000 
wall or if I change the position of the
Sun<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.870> shadows<00:02:35.050> will<00:02:35.410> change<00:02:35.680> along<00:02:35.950> with

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
Sun the shadows will change along with

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.480 
Sun the shadows will change along with
it<00:02:36.220> so<00:02:36.990> all<00:02:37.990> of<00:02:38.170> this<00:02:38.320> adds<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:39.010> unique

we<00:02:54.910> wanted<00:02:55.240> this<00:02:55.330> game<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.870> be<00:02:55.900> really<00:02:56.380> really

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
we wanted this game to be really really

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.800 
we wanted this game to be really really
loud<00:02:56.950> but<00:02:57.550> there<00:02:57.700> are<00:02:57.820> so<00:02:57.970> many<00:02:58.090> sounds

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
loud but there are so many sounds

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.720 
loud but there are so many sounds
happening<00:02:59.170> at<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.350> same<00:02:59.530> time<00:02:59.610> that<00:03:00.610> it

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
happening at the same time that it

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.620 
happening at the same time that it
didn't<00:03:00.970> work

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
didn't work

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.910 
didn't work
what<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:03.190> didn't<00:03:03.790> work<00:03:04.030> yeah<00:03:04.840> but<00:03:05.410> we<00:03:05.530> fixed

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
what it didn't work yeah but we fixed

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.550 
what it didn't work yeah but we fixed
that<00:03:06.000> with<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.120> Frostbite<00:03:07.660> high<00:03:08.110> dynamic

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
that with the Frostbite high dynamic

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.500 
that with the Frostbite high dynamic
range<00:03:08.709> audio<00:03:09.250> we<00:03:09.519> have<00:03:09.580> introduced<00:03:10.150> way<00:03:10.450> to

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
range audio we have introduced way to

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.170 
range audio we have introduced way to
automatically<00:03:11.410> prioritize<00:03:12.160> sound<00:03:12.730> sources

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
automatically prioritize sound sources

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.330 
automatically prioritize sound sources
at<00:03:13.360> runtime<00:03:13.690> so<00:03:14.140> let's<00:03:14.739> take<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:14.950> look<00:03:15.100> at<00:03:15.250> an

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
at runtime so let's take a look at an

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.699 
at runtime so let's take a look at an
example<00:03:15.580> and<00:03:15.970> listen<00:03:16.630> to<00:03:16.750> how<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:16.989> music<00:03:17.470> of

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
example and listen to how the music of

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:27.160 
example and listen to how the music of
the<00:03:17.920> radio<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.730> explosions<00:03:19.269> interact

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.540 

so<00:03:28.170> when<00:03:28.410> you<00:03:28.530> were<00:03:28.620> getting<00:03:28.890> shot<00:03:29.070> at<00:03:29.310> you

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
so when you were getting shot at you

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.980 
so when you were getting shot at you
don't<00:03:29.760> really<00:03:29.850> care<00:03:29.970> about<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.480> radio<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:30.960> the

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
don't really care about the radio of the

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.960 
don't really care about the radio of the
car<00:03:31.290> playing<00:03:31.590> because<00:03:31.950> it's<00:03:32.100> not<00:03:32.250> important

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970
