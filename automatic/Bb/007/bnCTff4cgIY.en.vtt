00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.029
 prepare this cute fruit bowl I'm going to 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.059
 teach how to make fruits that is super 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.250
 easy and they will be very original for 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.889
 put them in the kitchen to give them to 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.010
 your mom for the kitchen what are we going 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.949
 to need is colored salt paste in 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.420
 You can also use pasta 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:27.450
 clay 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.610
 aluminum foil and one point varnish 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.220
 what we are going to do in the first place is 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.630
 model the small and glued pieces 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.390
 moistening them a little 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.760
 the little town 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.890
 you can do it with plasticine and then 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.989
 you can paint it 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.500
 to the large pieces with paper 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.590
 aluminum with albal paper as you see is 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.449
 super easy the apple you make a ball and 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.809
 the banana as well as if it were a banana 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.489
 so elongated and giving it the form and 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.050
 cover them with the salt paste 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.149
 colored with plasticine 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.229
 you can also cover it you can 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.790
 give a hand of paper and glue and then 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.619
 Leave them and dry them and once they are 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.890
 you can dry them the banana 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.710
 yellow the yellow or red apple 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.070
 and so it's also easy to make a hole 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.290
 with a punch and place the tail of the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.520
 fruits the acys hole up here and 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.039
 It is placed on the tail 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.920
 and finally stop drying time 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.469
 necessary and then you give him a hand of 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.710
 varnish so that it will last longer and last 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.710
 plus 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.500
 and you can use one of your fruit trees 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.760
 dishes 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.490
 that you have there at home and you will already have 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.890
 the fruit with the fruit bowl and you will stay 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.380
 so wonderful you can also do 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:57.660
 strawberries bananas apples pears oranges 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.960
 everything because nothing I hope that I have 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.500
 I liked my idea that you do what's left 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.710
 super original for the kitchen and not 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.570
