was<00:01:12.210> amazing<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.630> 20<00:01:13.080> kilometres<00:01:13.350> ago<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
was amazing that 20 kilometres ago the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.859 
was amazing that 20 kilometres ago the
time<00:01:14.189> gap<00:01:14.369> was<00:01:14.580> brown<00:01:14.880> about<00:01:15.180> one<00:01:15.450> minute<00:01:15.659> and

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
time gap was brown about one minute and

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.359 
time gap was brown about one minute and
1<00:01:16.020> 11<00:01:16.439> seconds<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.950> thought<00:01:17.159> they<00:01:17.280> were

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
1 11 seconds and I thought they were

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.679 
1 11 seconds and I thought they were
going<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.580> get<00:01:17.670> pulled<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.090> down<00:01:18.240> towards<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
going to get pulled in down towards the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.539 
going to get pulled in down towards the
end<00:01:18.810> however<00:01:19.470> they<00:01:19.650> did<00:01:19.710> survive<00:01:20.130> i<00:01:20.189> think

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
end however they did survive i think

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.219 
end however they did survive i think
they<00:01:20.640> played<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> very<00:01:21.150> clever<00:01:21.479> tactical<00:01:22.049> game

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
they played a very clever tactical game

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.870 
they played a very clever tactical game
i<00:01:22.439> think<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.979> lot<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.340> responsibility

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
i think a lot of that responsibility

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.640 
i think a lot of that responsibility
lies<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.600> shoulders<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:24.990> matty<00:01:25.259> white<00:01:25.530> the
