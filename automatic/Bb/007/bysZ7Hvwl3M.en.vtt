00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380
 okay let's about the cause of death by 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.899
 Photo 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:10.440
 first you need to determine the person died or 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.360
 No, this is a very difficult topic, but 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.630
 I'll try to explain at school 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.630
 itâ€™s not clear and this topic has already been 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:21.119
 voiced in order to determine 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.850
 alive man or honey as they do from 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.760
 newbie search engines that are very rare 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.160
 the first are mistaken that any living 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.219
 man has a connection with the cosmos with god 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.559
 that is, the channel is the first thing that is done 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.290
 look at the pictures look if 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.329
 energy channel if the channel is not that 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.850
 there is totally you know how black is over 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.739
 head this first means already 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.100
 or in a coma or something but here is 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.570
 something is very bad then there is no connection 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.309
 there is no connection or well, absolutely crazy 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:56.430
 there is totally a million without mind or 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.620
 he is dead this is the first one there is no channel 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.510
 determined if we saw that channel 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.710
 No, this does not mean that a person is dead 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:09.080
 until the end of what we see works 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.080
 whether the heart here if the heart is not working 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.070
 You know how the heart is pulsing 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.840
 look tune in to the heart 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.500
 look at the person in the photo 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.509
 whether it pulses make and visualization 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.080
 how to look in the school of dreams read 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.840
 the textbooks have looked at the heart of everything 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.549
 there is not pulsing and that's not enough then 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.759
 there may be further there 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.130
 there is still 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:43.439
 oh such a photograph 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.360
 and it blows from the cold just blows 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.509
 cold 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.619
 that means, too, most likely a person 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.450
 dead personally i always have me 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.770
 dead eyes they rush me 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.460
 look sad sad look 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.430
 empty sad look and cry here 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.640
 just crying that's why I don't know that is 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.329
 Here is such an effect I do with it 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.970
 did 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.340
 even when no notice was not engaged 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.800
 dreaming then 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.599
 the thing is that here I come to the funeral here 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.150
 there were some relatives were dying and 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.069
 there is a photo of her tears on 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.170
 eyes right on the photo honestly here 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.720
 all the time think oh my goodness why 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.330
 all the pictures are crying but the dead 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.069
 that is, dead people and the same thing i 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.250
 noticed in the cemetery when these 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:34.060
 portraits there, too, that's when they take 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.940
 photography there stones make ceramics there 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.610
 to the monument the same thing on the monument then 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.799
 the same effect is the crying eye 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.860
 that is, you feel right here for me 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.170
 this here was a hundred percent what man 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.150
 dead if if the photo here i am 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.970
 I need to watch TVs also shows 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.760
 photos of missing I look oh he 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.769
 crying all the mean myrtle but I don't speak 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.810
 nobody just for myself that's it for 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.140
 me it's kind of self-evident but it's for 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.120
 me and everyone have such a sign when 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.340
 you work a lot you already understand what 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.209
 so for you it is so displayed on 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.030
 Photo 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.340
 they and so on are put phantom and 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.380
 see whether the soul comes here 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.600
 when you work with a dead soul 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.430
 comes but not always if he is many 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.549
 represented it comes stand soul 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.480
 or he is not in peace too souls come 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:29.269
 Here's how all of these would diagnostics 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.599
 then actually very very much here 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.450
 we are more detailed and more correct 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.859
 the dough will be school dreaming like 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.180
 tune in how to sit down how to see how 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.609
 visualize liven up photo 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.859
 photography needs photography in general 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.900
 image it is necessary to create a phantom of 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.900
 this image with a photograph that is 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:52.419
 creating a phantom so that the phantom is like 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:55.099
 copy energy copy of man well 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:57.530
 if you want the astral body, that is, we 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.900
 created us astral body if phantom 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.650
 became alive 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:07.540
 I did not become a dead here and so that is 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.540
 general many tricks
