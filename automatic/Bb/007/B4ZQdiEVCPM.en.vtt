00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
the guitar after a couple days of rest

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.580 
the guitar after a couple days of rest
and<00:00:17.580> i<00:00:18.300> picked<00:00:18.539> up<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.750> map<00:00:18.930> track<00:00:19.170> i<00:00:19.320> haven't

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
and i picked up a map track i haven't

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.679 
and i picked up a map track i haven't
used<00:00:19.710> map<00:00:19.890> tracks<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.250> long<00:00:20.430> time<00:00:20.699> decided<00:00:21.660> to

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
used map tracks a long time decided to

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.910 
used map tracks a long time decided to
give<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.289> go<00:00:22.470> today<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:24.050> realized<00:00:25.050> how

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
give it a go today and I realized how

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.070 
give it a go today and I realized how
useful<00:00:26.189> these<00:00:26.730> map<00:00:27.000> tracks<00:00:27.300> are<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.900> actually

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
useful these map tracks are I actually

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.710 
useful these map tracks are I actually
knew<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.619> they<00:00:28.710> were<00:00:28.800> useful<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.720> just

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
knew that they were useful but I just

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.930 
knew that they were useful but I just
kind<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:30.990> rediscovered<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.859> got<00:00:32.520> really

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
kind of rediscovered and got really

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.569 
kind of rediscovered and got really
excited<00:00:33.059> about<00:00:33.510> map<00:00:33.930> tracks<00:00:34.260> again<00:00:34.460> what<00:00:35.460> our

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
excited about map tracks again what our

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.299 
excited about map tracks again what our
map<00:00:35.730> tracks<00:00:36.059> map<00:00:36.360> tracks<00:00:36.690> are<00:00:37.219> basically<00:00:38.219> a

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
map tracks map tracks are basically a

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.430 
map tracks map tracks are basically a
tool<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.290> were<00:00:40.290> designed<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.989> cover<00:00:42.989> two

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
tool that were designed to cover two

tool that were designed to cover two
things<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.250> answer<00:00:44.399> two<00:00:44.789> problems<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.420> first

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
things to answer two problems the first

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.049 
things to answer two problems the first
problem<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.350> lot<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.219> players<00:00:47.399> don't<00:00:47.789> really

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
problem is a lot of players don't really

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.240 
problem is a lot of players don't really
hear<00:00:48.539> scales<00:00:49.440> they<00:00:49.710> don't<00:00:49.890> really<00:00:50.010> hear

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
hear scales they don't really hear

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.430 
hear scales they don't really hear
colors<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.239> map<00:00:51.629> track<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.050> going<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.260> help

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
colors and a map track is going to help

improvise over key changes without the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.149 
improvise over key changes without the
headache<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.699> preparing<00:01:03.510> everything<00:01:04.159> they're

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
headache of preparing everything they're

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.980

great tools they're very inspirational

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.740 
great tools they're very inspirational
so<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:08.130> morning<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.520> decided<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.970> film<00:01:09.540> myself

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
so this morning I decided to film myself

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.990 
so this morning I decided to film myself
playing<00:01:10.350> over<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> map<00:01:11.040> track<00:01:11.310> using<00:01:11.670> one<00:01:11.970> of

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
playing over a map track using one of

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.609 
playing over a map track using one of
them<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.720> before<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.080> thought<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.320> would<00:01:13.470> do<00:01:13.590> a

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
them but before I thought I would do a

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.609 
them but before I thought I would do a
little<00:01:13.830> intro<00:01:14.900> explaining<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.200> first<00:01:16.470> of

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
little intro explaining to you first of

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.940 
little intro explaining to you first of
all<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> problem<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:18.500> occurs<00:01:19.500> when<00:01:19.920> you

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
all the problem that occurs when you

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.679 
all the problem that occurs when you
have<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.369> improvise<00:01:20.640> over<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> different<00:01:21.420> key

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
have to improvise over a different key

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.929 
have to improvise over a different key
changes<00:01:22.140> how<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> resolve<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.460> how<00:01:23.640> map

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
changes how to resolve it and how map

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.990 
changes how to resolve it and how map
tracks<00:01:24.270> really<00:01:24.570> does<00:01:24.990> an<00:01:25.860> excellent<00:01:26.430> job<00:01:26.729> at

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
tracks really does an excellent job at

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.530 
tracks really does an excellent job at
doing<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.619> all<00:01:28.619> right<00:01:29.000> key<00:01:30.000> changes<00:01:30.390> is

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
doing that all right key changes is

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.240 
doing that all right key changes is
probably<00:01:30.869> one<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.320> most<00:01:31.439> challenging<00:01:32.100> but

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
probably one of the most challenging but

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.359 
probably one of the most challenging but
most<00:01:32.490> rewarding<00:01:33.210> things<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:34.500> improvise<00:01:34.979> over

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
most rewarding things to improvise over

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.170 
most rewarding things to improvise over
it's<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.390> much<00:01:36.720> fun<00:01:37.070> once<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.790> do<00:01:39.000> that

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
it's so much fun once you can do that

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.480 
it's so much fun once you can do that
but<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.869> sometimes<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.799> little<00:01:40.920> tricky<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.280> do

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
but it's sometimes a little tricky to do

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.109 
but it's sometimes a little tricky to do
that<00:01:42.079> why<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.470> difficult<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:44.159> improvise

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
that why is it so difficult to improvise

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.590 
that why is it so difficult to improvise
over<00:01:45.720> key<00:01:46.320> changes<00:01:46.770> because<00:01:47.610> we're<00:01:48.329> using

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
over key changes because we're using

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.719 
over key changes because we're using
more<00:01:48.960> than<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.170> key<00:01:49.560> one<00:01:49.799> scale<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.460> guitar

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
more than one key one scale and guitar

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.429 
more than one key one scale and guitar
players<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.509> stay<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.960> comfort<00:01:52.409> zone

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
players like to stay in a comfort zone

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.490 
players like to stay in a comfort zone
so<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.670> order<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.000> improvise<00:01:54.899> over<00:01:55.320> key

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
so in order to improvise over key

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.380 
so in order to improvise over key
changes<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.159> lot<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.490> guitar<00:01:56.790> players<00:01:57.030> simply

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
changes a lot of guitar players simply

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.469 
changes a lot of guitar players simply
learn<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.710> first<00:01:58.920> key<00:01:59.159> one<00:01:59.549> position<00:02:00.030> play<00:02:00.420> in

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
learn the first key one position play in
