too quickly the weight on it isn't too
heavy<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.590> does<00:03:57.799> get<00:03:57.979> a<00:03:58.009> little<00:03:58.220> bit<00:03:58.370> weighty

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:58.669 
heavy it does get a little bit weighty

00:03:58.669 --> 00:03:59.979 
heavy it does get a little bit weighty
once<00:03:59.000> you<00:03:59.120> start<00:03:59.419> putting<00:03:59.569> things<00:03:59.840> down

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
once you start putting things down

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.809 
once you start putting things down
inside<00:04:00.439> of<00:04:00.470> there<00:04:00.739> but<00:04:01.220> compared<00:04:01.579> to<00:04:01.609> the<00:04:01.729> all

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
inside of there but compared to the all

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.460 
inside of there but compared to the all
leather<00:04:02.000> bags<00:04:02.329> it's<00:04:02.599> still<00:04:02.870> not<00:04:03.049> what<00:04:03.229> I<00:04:03.259> would

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
leather bags it's still not what I would

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.770 
leather bags it's still not what I would
consider<00:04:03.560> a<00:04:03.859> heavy<00:04:04.129> bag<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:04.609> I<00:04:05.030> do<00:04:05.090> find<00:04:05.540> that

there's<00:04:21.650> some<00:04:21.829> little<00:04:21.949> quirks<00:04:22.250> about<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.639> bag

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
there's some little quirks about the bag

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:24.070 
there's some little quirks about the bag
where<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.090> don't<00:04:23.419> want<00:04:23.570> to<00:04:23.599> get<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:23.870> zipper

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
where you don't want to get the zipper

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.620 
where you don't want to get the zipper
all<00:04:24.349> the<00:04:24.380> way<00:04:24.500> down<00:04:24.710> to<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:24.950> end<00:04:25.130> because<00:04:25.430> it

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
all the way down to the end because it

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.450 
all the way down to the end because it
it's<00:04:25.750> hard<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.110> get<00:04:26.470> it<00:04:26.560> stuck<00:04:26.890> but<00:04:27.370> my

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
it's hard to get it stuck but my

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.190 
it's hard to get it stuck but my
workaround<00:04:27.970> for<00:04:28.060> that<00:04:28.210> is<00:04:28.480> to<00:04:28.630> basically<00:04:28.990> just

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
workaround for that is to basically just

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.960 
workaround for that is to basically just
never<00:04:29.440> let<00:04:29.620> my<00:04:29.740> zipper<00:04:30.010> go<00:04:30.160> past<00:04:30.430> here<00:04:30.760> and

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
never let my zipper go past here and

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.510 
never let my zipper go past here and
that<00:04:31.420> way<00:04:31.630> we<00:04:31.960> won't<00:04:32.110> be<00:04:32.290> hard<00:04:32.560> to<00:04:32.650> unzip<00:04:32.950> it<00:04:33.370> or

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
that way we won't be hard to unzip it or

that way we won't be hard to unzip it or
zip<00:04:33.790> it<00:04:33.910> back<00:04:34.030> shut<00:04:34.600> and<00:04:34.870> then<00:04:35.470> also<00:04:35.860> these

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
zip it back shut and then also these

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
little buckles can leave the darker

lines<00:04:38.410> I<00:04:38.740> think<00:04:38.770> especially<00:04:39.100> with<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:39.550> older

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
lines I think especially with the older

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.760 
lines I think especially with the older
ones<00:04:39.880> after<00:04:40.450> they've<00:04:40.930> sat<00:04:41.170> against<00:04:41.440> the<00:04:41.620> bag

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
ones after they've sat against the bag

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.620 
ones after they've sat against the bag
for<00:04:41.980> a<00:04:42.010> number<00:04:42.250> of<00:04:42.340> times<00:04:42.550> but<00:04:42.790> for<00:04:43.000> me<00:04:43.150> it's

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
for a number of times but for me it's

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.120 
for a number of times but for me it's
not<00:04:43.780> such<00:04:43.990> a<00:04:44.110> big<00:04:44.260> deal<00:04:44.410> because<00:04:44.620> I<00:04:44.920> always

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
not such a big deal because I always

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.860 
not such a big deal because I always
leave<00:04:45.460> it<00:04:45.580> on<00:04:45.640> the<00:04:45.760> same<00:04:45.970> hole<00:04:46.270> so<00:04:46.570> it's<00:04:46.720> not

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
leave it on the same hole so it's not

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.990 
leave it on the same hole so it's not
really<00:04:47.170> quite<00:04:47.350> as<00:04:47.410> noticeable<00:04:47.860> so<00:04:48.610> all<00:04:48.760> in<00:04:48.880> all

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
really quite as noticeable so all in all

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.580 
really quite as noticeable so all in all
I<00:04:49.210> think<00:04:49.240> that<00:04:49.540> this<00:04:49.690> is<00:04:49.810> a<00:04:49.840> great<00:04:50.170> bag<00:04:50.380> by<00:04:50.560> the

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
I think that this is a great bag by the

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.680 
I think that this is a great bag by the
way<00:04:50.710> over<00:04:50.890> time<00:04:51.100> one<00:04:51.700> of<00:04:51.730> my<00:04:51.820> favorites<00:04:52.360> and<00:04:52.540> I
