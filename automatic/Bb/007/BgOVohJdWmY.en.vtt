00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:26.529
 Today's video always shows a simple one 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:31.329
 a vanishing point perspective technology 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:33.910
 we need a piece of paper in the 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.079
 size din a4 or din a3 depending on 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:41.290
 happened to have a pencil 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.510
 as well as the kidneys before we start 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.430
 the one escape point perspective too 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.100
 we need to draw on the sheet 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.460
 of course a horizon line to it 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:57.070
 We draw on the leaf on a 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:01:01.480
 Organic egg trend line which can also xp 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:04.449
 so far what I need only is 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.420
 a tough line where we get to this point 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.759
 could start right or left middle 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.890
 be depending on where he wanted it 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.890
 sat here in the etc 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:22.470
 and that is our central with the 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:26.289
 points from where we get out of ten the whole 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:31.020
 So flee film probably and now 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:36.789
 we can on the square 90 degrees one 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.590
 line drawing that can be so 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:44.649
 this sorry 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:49.050
 or do I want to draw me now 250 times 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:55.330
 meters in height then 45 degrees angle 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:56.979
 another thing points 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.340
 accordingly, be a bit straight 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.340
 to three inches and of course again 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.560
 55 So I technology 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.640
 a rectangle 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.370
 if we were right now he came without 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:35.780
 square depending on what we want 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:38.030
 we must now point accordingly 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.280
 go with the ruler to the point 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.269
 it here and there by the mediterranean sea 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.150
 a little smaller than the track has one 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.730
 its sad but about that so 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.440
 We point to this point 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.209
 our lines are pretty unfair 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:06.739
 So you want to have the 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:09.200
 the line of a body knew then 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:13.159
 we can say that in this point 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.099
 go next and go straight back to the 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:19.720
 point if until then show that 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.720
 line the plane 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.650
 and that does not set me too sad 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.260
 one side is too long you can afterwards 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.769
 Still , because the rent is natural 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.900
 Add away with about 2.2 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.909
 already knew how connected 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:48.959
 now you can also do one side here 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:54.329
 even draw it out so it's mine 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:59.099
 body so explorers are bringing now 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:04:02.159
 of course again a 45 degree angle 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.310
 again one straight they draw at 90 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.310
 Degree 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:31.290
 Do I associate that with you? 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:34.630
 piece here is a straight that's a 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:37.720
 sign where you get a 5 so one 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.090
 Examining a vanishing point perspective 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.280
 has drawn so his men 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.870
 appearance 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.600
 and of course you can say that 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.340
 would like to continue for example in 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:53.790
 the middle one could still be here in 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.790
 draw a box 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:25.460
 so we want to draw this win 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.460
 go back to a point 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.530
 on this point, the next body 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.530
 could 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:42.050
 in that my two surfaces 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.010
 you can not only see the page with it 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:49.850
 because that would not work 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:56.750
 Accordingly, you only see the 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:58.220
 upper edge of the rectangle now 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:03.250
 last for example because of one again 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.250
 go right and draw something here 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.140
 that you plug it back more to draw 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:33.180
 would a body so can the corner 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:35.750
 then the other again to the circle 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.750
 introduce 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.200
 the last 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:59.730
 draw straight again 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.650
 that's how it should look like 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:16.370
 I wish you much fun then 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.540
 to practice 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:23.380
 the entry perspective and afterwards 

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.520
 could he when you have this as 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.650
 make it harder in which we are around which 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.360
 Assess more complicated forms and 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.360
 to draw a rectangle
