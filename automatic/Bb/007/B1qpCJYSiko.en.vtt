with<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.950> developers<00:00:11.519> we<00:00:11.910> heard<00:00:12.120> news<00:00:12.330> about

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
with the developers we heard news about

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.310 
with the developers we heard news about
an<00:00:12.929> indirect<00:00:13.590> military<00:00:14.130> system<00:00:14.570> what<00:00:15.570> exactly

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
an indirect military system what exactly

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.429 
an indirect military system what exactly
does<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:16.770> mean<00:00:17.449> what<00:00:18.449> distinguishes<00:00:19.140> it

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
does this mean what distinguishes it

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.210 
does this mean what distinguishes it
from<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.830> previous<00:00:20.130> game<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.820> no<00:00:21.150> 1701<00:00:22.220> we

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
from the previous game a no 1701 we

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.070 
from the previous game a no 1701 we
asked<00:00:23.430> Dirk<00:00:23.789> regard<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.480> answer<00:00:24.869> this

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
asked Dirk regard to answer this

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.609 
asked Dirk regard to answer this
interesting<00:00:25.859> question<00:00:26.660> in<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:28.320> previous

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
interesting question in the previous

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.519 
interesting question in the previous
owner<00:00:28.859> games<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.609> player<00:00:29.849> was<00:00:30.630> commanding

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
owner games the player was commanding

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.500 
owner games the player was commanding
single<00:00:31.949> units<00:00:32.279> but<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.969> was<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.180> problem

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
single units but that was a problem

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.950 
single units but that was a problem
because<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.710> know<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.309> building<00:00:35.940> game<00:00:36.239> so

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
because I know it's a building game so

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.139 
because I know it's a building game so
the<00:00:37.350> unit's<00:00:37.649> got<00:00:37.829> lost<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.340> could<00:00:38.730> not<00:00:38.879> find

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the unit's got lost you could not find

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.690 
the unit's got lost you could not find
them<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.719> was<00:00:39.899> too<00:00:40.079> tactical<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.100> time<00:00:41.340> we

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
them it was too tactical so this time we

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.540 
them it was too tactical so this time we
choose<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.270> more<00:00:42.719> strategic<00:00:42.870> approach<00:00:43.550> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
choose a more strategic approach the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.630 
choose a more strategic approach the
player<00:00:44.760> builds<00:00:45.350> infrastructure<00:00:46.640> and

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
player builds infrastructure and

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.139 
player builds infrastructure and
encampments<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.579> cannon<00:00:50.579> positions<00:00:51.000> and

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
encampments and cannon positions and

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.220 
encampments and cannon positions and
stuff<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.719> okay<00:00:53.270> but<00:00:54.270> which<00:00:54.600> tactical

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
stuff like that okay but which tactical

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.139 
stuff like that okay but which tactical
options<00:00:55.649> does<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.190> military<00:00:56.640> system

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
options does this military system

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.450 
options does this military system
provide<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> player<00:00:57.899> with<00:00:58.199> which<00:00:58.800> units<00:00:59.250> does

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
provide the player with which units does

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.279 
provide the player with which units does
the<00:00:59.609> player<00:00:59.850> have<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.449> what<00:01:00.780> role<00:01:00.989> do<00:01:01.170> they

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the player have and what role do they

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.770 
the player have and what role do they
play<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.770> battles<00:01:02.160> digging<00:01:02.969> deeper<00:01:03.329> Dirk

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
play in the battles digging deeper Dirk

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.240 
play in the battles digging deeper Dirk
we<00:01:03.989> got<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.439> facts<00:01:05.900> so<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.920> most

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
we got as the facts so the most

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.760 
we got as the facts so the most
efficient<00:01:08.700> approach<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.630> player<00:01:09.869> is

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
efficient approach is that the player is

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.300 
efficient approach is that the player is
able<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.250> build<00:01:11.659> military<00:01:12.680> structures<00:01:13.680> like

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
able to build military structures like

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.940 
able to build military structures like
encampments<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:15.900> he<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.439> give<00:01:16.619> them

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
encampments and then he can give them

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.420 
encampments and then he can give them
those<00:01:17.430> encampment<00:01:17.970> strategic<00:01:18.390> orders<00:01:18.750> like

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
those encampment strategic orders like

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.920 
those encampment strategic orders like
attack<00:01:20.430> opponents<00:01:21.619> break<00:01:22.619> down<00:01:22.860> walls<00:01:23.930> defend

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
attack opponents break down walls defend

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.010 
attack opponents break down walls defend
yourself<00:01:25.700> go<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.729> another<00:01:27.090> place<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.420> stuff

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
yourself go to another place and stuff

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.580 
yourself go to another place and stuff
like<00:01:28.229> that

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
like that

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.810 
like that
so<00:01:28.890> it's<00:01:29.100> more<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.310> strategic<00:01:30.470> level<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.950> not

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
so it's more a strategic level and not

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.569 
so it's more a strategic level and not
so<00:01:33.030> much<00:01:33.180> technical<00:01:33.570> orders<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.579> single

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
so much technical orders for single

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.460 
so much technical orders for single
units<00:01:35.939> because<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.689> size<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> game<00:01:37.320> is

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
units because the size of the game is

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.800 
units because the size of the game is
bigger<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.790> scope<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.600> player

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
bigger and so the scope of the player

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.080 
bigger and so the scope of the player
has<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.140> be<00:01:40.259> bigger<00:01:40.530> too

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
has to be bigger too

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.880 
has to be bigger too
now<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.150> know<00:01:42.600> what<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:42.930> need<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.170> do<00:01:43.530> with<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
now we know what we need to do with the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.130 
now we know what we need to do with the
enemy<00:01:44.250> attacks<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:45.180> how<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.720> protect

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
enemy attacks but how can you protect

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.039 
enemy attacks but how can you protect
your<00:01:46.320> city<00:01:46.590> from<00:01:46.860> invaders<00:01:47.479> Chris<00:01:48.479> Smith<00:01:48.750> has
