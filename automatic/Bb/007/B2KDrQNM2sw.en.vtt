00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.910
 for centuries explorers of all 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.280
 world have come looking for a magic water 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.769
 the source of eternal youth in 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.740
 that pure and refreshing water could 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.809
 keep the body are elastic independent 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.850
 of the passage of time scientists 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.130
 have conducted experiments in places 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.859
 which say that water has properties 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.410
 remedies such as Lourdes in France and 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.670
 Himalayan glacial currents have 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.279
 an important discovery and 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.009
 surprising the ph levels of these 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.489
 waters that claim to be very alkaline and 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.770
 were highly organized. 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.350
 about 40 years Russian scientists 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.840
 passed running water through plates 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.270
 magnetically charged and thus 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.039
 develop a simple method of separating 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.039
 water in two parts 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.110
 bad kalina and the other is a process 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.260
 called this technology organization 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.690
 of initial organization was improved to 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.879
 the point that now the simple water of the 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.280
 faucet can be turned into water 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.180
 with properties capable of improving the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.880
 our life 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.010
 this amazing water is unique containing 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.590
 thousands of antioxidants and anti 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.720
 aging in each cup achieving 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.990
 to meet the hydration needs of the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.850
 body to provide calcium and oxygen and 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.580
 the most important helping to eliminate 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.130
 waste and toxins that are so damaging to 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.250
 kalina and humanized water 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.869
 is filled with hydroxyl ions 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.869
 negatively charged vehicles that act as 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.299
 powerful antioxidants in the body that 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.579
 to capture free radicals loaded 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.390
 positively damaging to 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.390
 our cells 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.509
 tap water or bottled form 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.000
 usually groups of 11 to 16 molecules 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.520
 but organized alkaline water 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.259
 reformulated during the organization of 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.939
 so that water molecules become 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.770
 reduce to 5 to 8 molecules per group 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.960
 this allows the water to penetrate more 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.180
 easily in cells and helps 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.299
 prevent and reverse associated problems 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.459
 such as chronic dehydration such as 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.930
 decreased energy problems 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:15.120
 digestive constipation and obesity 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.090
 in addition to water the organized climate 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.730
 is also highly oxygenated 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.129
 of common water this water contains more 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.560
 oxygen than hydrogen leaving it 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:28.069
 lighter and highly absorbable 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.069
 body 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:34.019
 perhaps the most important is the fact that 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.599
 organized kalina water can help the 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.090
 our body that works again at your 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.879
 the highest level and keep the 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.489
 value of the ph d frame thanks to 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:47.420
 alkaline minerals like calcium magnesium 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.010
 and potassium that the body can absorb 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.500
 easily the body tends to work 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.780
 hard to maintain your ph level 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.180
 because they constantly produce the 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.640
 acid residues the nutrients that 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.769
 we get through food comes to the 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.379
 our cells that are burned with 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.480
 oxygen to produce energy that 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.819
 allows you to live generating products 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.160
 secondary or waste products that almost always 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.010
 are assiduous our body normally 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.190
 said waste is being filtered 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.500
 through the liver kidneys and our colon 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.540
 lifestyle stressed in the absence of 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.370
 rest or type of food that 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.859
 we ingest and toxins that we are 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.349
 willingness limit our 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:31.230
 body to dispose of this waste 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.720
 quickly enough and our 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.910
 body uses a clever trick converts 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.069
 acid residues in waste 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.950
 solids that are stored in 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.620
 less critical as arteries vessels 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.780
 blood and fatty tissues 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.790
 some scientists suspect that it is 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.130
 I must limit the production of waste 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.769
 acids that trigger 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.230
 premature aging and disease 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.660
 alkaline is recognized in the 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.000
 Korea and Japan as having such value 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.940
 therapeutic use that has been used 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.760
 intensive hospitals and clinics these 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.090
 countries for more than 20 years to help 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.549
 treat diseases like diabetes hypertension 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.359
 and suffered from cancer and many other 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.359
 debilitating diseases
