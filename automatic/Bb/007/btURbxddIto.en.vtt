00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.380 

my<00:00:04.090> laboratory<00:00:04.750> discovered<00:00:05.470> a<00:00:05.790> new<00:00:06.790> kind<00:00:06.819> of

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:07.390 
my laboratory discovered a new kind of

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.560 
my laboratory discovered a new kind of
modification<00:00:08.320> of<00:00:08.500> proteins<00:00:09.340> that<00:00:10.150> occur<00:00:10.540> in

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.570 
modification of proteins that occur in

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.200 
modification of proteins that occur in
the<00:00:10.780> nucleus<00:00:11.170> and<00:00:11.500> the<00:00:11.730> cytoplasm<00:00:12.730> of<00:00:13.030> all

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.210 
the nucleus and the cytoplasm of all

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.470 
the nucleus and the cytoplasm of all
cells<00:00:13.599> and<00:00:14.219> this<00:00:15.219> modification<00:00:15.670> is<00:00:16.450> the

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
cells and this modification is the

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.089 
cells and this modification is the
attachment<00:00:19.480> of<00:00:19.540> a<00:00:19.660> sugar<00:00:20.020> molecule<00:00:20.320> to

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:21.099 
attachment of a sugar molecule to

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.600 
attachment of a sugar molecule to
proteins<00:00:21.730> and<00:00:22.619> what<00:00:23.619> we<00:00:23.770> have<00:00:23.890> discovered<00:00:24.310> in

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:24.610 
proteins and what we have discovered in

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.030 
proteins and what we have discovered in
the<00:00:24.730> last<00:00:24.910> 26<00:00:25.840> years<00:00:25.930> we've<00:00:26.349> been<00:00:26.500> working<00:00:26.739> on

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
the last 26 years we've been working on

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.760 
the last 26 years we've been working on
this<00:00:27.160> modification<00:00:27.610> is<00:00:28.470> that<00:00:29.470> it's<00:00:29.649> a

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
this modification is that it's a

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.720 
this modification is that it's a
fundamental<00:00:30.460> mechanism<00:00:31.149> of<00:00:31.419> regulating

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
fundamental mechanism of regulating

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.020 
fundamental mechanism of regulating
proteins<00:00:33.730> much<00:00:34.059> like<00:00:34.300> a<00:00:34.329> switch<00:00:35.730> turning<00:00:36.730> them

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
proteins much like a switch turning them

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.390 
proteins much like a switch turning them
on<00:00:37.060> and<00:00:37.300> turning<00:00:37.870> them<00:00:38.020> off<00:00:38.230> in<00:00:38.560> response<00:00:39.070> to

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
on and turning them off in response to

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.350 
on and turning them off in response to
cellular<00:00:39.880> nutrients<00:00:40.450> and<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:42.670> sugar<00:00:42.970> is

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
cellular nutrients and this sugar is

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.650 
cellular nutrients and this sugar is
directly<00:00:43.930> derived<00:00:44.380> from<00:00:44.560> glucose<00:00:45.100> and<00:00:45.660> it's

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
directly derived from glucose and it's

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.440 
directly derived from glucose and it's
important<00:00:47.170> in<00:00:47.290> disease<00:00:47.710> because<00:00:48.340> when<00:00:48.850> this

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
important in disease because when this

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.760 
important in disease because when this
sugar<00:00:50.110> is<00:00:50.760> added<00:00:51.760> in<00:00:52.180> to<00:00:52.570> high<00:00:52.810> quantities<00:00:53.530> as

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
sugar is added in to high quantities as

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.180 
sugar is added in to high quantities as
it<00:00:53.920> is<00:00:54.070> in<00:00:54.250> diabetes<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.930> actually<00:00:56.190> explains

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
it is in diabetes it actually explains

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.780 
it is in diabetes it actually explains
why<00:00:58.050> high<00:00:59.050> glucose<00:00:59.680> in<00:00:59.920> the<00:00:59.950> blood<00:01:00.280> is<00:01:00.489> toxic

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
why high glucose in the blood is toxic

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.910 
why high glucose in the blood is toxic
in<00:01:02.790> basically<00:01:03.790> the<00:01:04.170> simple<00:01:05.170> way<00:01:05.470> of<00:01:05.500> looking

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
in basically the simple way of looking

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.390 
in basically the simple way of looking
at<00:01:06.070> this<00:01:06.250> is<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.670> seller<00:01:06.970> cellular<00:01:07.659> machinery

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
at this is the seller cellular machinery

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.160 
at this is the seller cellular machinery
literally<00:01:09.400> doesn't<00:01:10.180> work<00:01:10.390> correctly<00:01:10.630> when

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
literally doesn't work correctly when

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.740 
literally doesn't work correctly when
there's<00:01:11.380> too<00:01:11.560> much<00:01:11.740> of<00:01:11.979> this<00:01:12.100> sugar<00:01:12.750> attached

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
there's too much of this sugar attached

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.690 
there's too much of this sugar attached
to<00:01:14.140> the<00:01:14.320> proteins<00:01:14.890> that<00:01:15.159> regulate<00:01:15.520> gene

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
to the proteins that regulate gene

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.289 
to the proteins that regulate gene
expression<00:01:17.130> cellular<00:01:18.130> structure<00:01:18.549> and<00:01:19.000> other

many<00:01:19.690> many<00:01:19.990> other<00:01:20.260> things<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:22.060> it<00:01:22.210> also<00:01:22.360> turns

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
many many other things and it also turns

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.710 
many many other things and it also turns
out<00:01:22.990> that<00:01:23.020> in<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.440> brain<00:01:24.360> most<00:01:25.360> of<00:01:25.600> the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
out that in the brain most of the

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
out that in the brain most of the
proteins<00:01:26.680> in<00:01:26.799> the<00:01:26.860> brain<00:01:27.100> are<00:01:28.380> modified<00:01:29.380> by

proteins in the brain are modified by

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.420 
proteins in the brain are modified by
the<00:01:29.770> sugar<00:01:30.250> normally<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.390> as<00:01:32.229> we<00:01:32.470> age<00:01:32.680> there's

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
the sugar normally and as we age there's

the sugar normally and as we age there's
defects<00:01:34.150> in<00:01:34.360> glucose<00:01:34.750> metabolism<00:01:34.990> that<00:01:35.650> cause

like<00:01:41.440> Alzheimer's<00:01:42.159> disease<00:01:42.549> I<00:01:42.850> think<00:01:43.510> this<00:01:43.630> is

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
like Alzheimer's disease I think this is

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.160 
like Alzheimer's disease I think this is
an<00:01:43.930> example<00:01:44.290> of<00:01:44.850> basic<00:01:45.850> research<00:01:46.170> discovering

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
an example of basic research discovering

something totally unexpected and new

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.859 
something totally unexpected and new
