later<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.539> the<00:01:54.630> song<00:01:54.810> maybe<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.140> don't<00:01:55.259> want<00:01:55.530> to

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
later in the song maybe I don't want to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.289 
later in the song maybe I don't want to
make<00:01:55.679> the<00:01:55.799> G<00:01:56.009> sound<00:01:56.310> exactly<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.759> same<00:01:57.000> way<00:01:57.149> so

necessary<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:05.580> root<00:04:05.760> note<00:04:05.940> is<00:04:06.060> now<00:04:06.269> on<00:04:07.230> string

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
necessary the root note is now on string

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.649 
necessary the root note is now on string
three<00:04:08.390> okay<00:04:09.390> so<00:04:09.620> here's<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.680> major<00:04:10.950> chord<00:04:11.310> shape

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
three okay so here's a major chord shape

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:18.349 
three okay so here's a major chord shape
with<00:04:12.659> the<00:04:12.810> root<00:04:12.989> on<00:04:13.170> string<00:04:13.530> one<00:04:17.150> okay<00:04:18.150> and

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
with the root on string one okay and

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.810 
with the root on string one okay and
that's<00:04:18.479> from<00:04:19.260> this<00:04:19.470> guy<00:04:19.650> but<00:04:20.459> I'm<00:04:20.549> just<00:04:20.639> going

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
that's from this guy but I'm just going

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.069 
that's from this guy but I'm just going
to<00:04:20.910> throw<00:04:21.030> all<00:04:21.209> this<00:04:21.389> out<00:04:21.539> the<00:04:21.690> window<00:04:21.959> and

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
to throw all this out the window and

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:32.810 
to throw all this out the window and
just<00:04:22.169> play<00:04:22.350> this<00:04:25.639> or<00:04:27.560> one<00:04:28.560> two<00:04:28.830> three<00:04:29.100> okay<00:04:31.820> so

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
just play this or one two three okay so

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.750 
just play this or one two three okay so
here<00:04:33.060> that<00:04:33.389> would<00:04:33.510> be<00:04:33.539> a<00:04:33.630> C<00:04:33.900> major<00:04:34.080> chord<00:04:34.760> okay

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
here that would be a C major chord okay

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.320 
here that would be a C major chord okay
I'm<00:04:36.660> on<00:04:36.720> the<00:04:36.780> eighth<00:04:36.990> position

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
I'm on the eighth position

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.810 
I'm on the eighth position
so<00:04:39.330> that's<00:04:39.510> root<00:04:39.780> string<00:04:40.139> one<00:04:40.490> now<00:04:41.490> root

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
so that's root string one now root

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.960 
so that's root string one now root
string<00:04:42.120> -<00:04:42.300> is<00:04:42.539> that<00:04:42.720> D<00:04:42.900> shape<00:04:43.820> looks<00:04:44.820> like<00:04:44.880> a

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
string - is that D shape looks like a

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.490 
string - is that D shape looks like a
dave<00:04:45.240> and<00:04:45.450> now<00:04:45.539> it's<00:04:45.720> a<00:04:45.810> G<00:04:46.080> because<00:04:46.289> I'm<00:04:46.380> on

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
dave and now it's a G because I'm on

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.040 
dave and now it's a G because I'm on
full<00:04:46.800> right<00:04:47.389> now<00:04:48.389> I<00:04:48.419> can<00:04:48.599> do<00:04:48.690> this<00:04:48.780> other<00:04:48.960> one

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
full right now I can do this other one

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.920 
full right now I can do this other one
root<00:04:49.650> on<00:04:49.950> string<00:04:50.669> three<00:04:51.150> I'm<00:04:51.750> gonna<00:04:51.960> play<00:04:52.139> D

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
root on string three I'm gonna play D

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.260 
root on string three I'm gonna play D
third<00:04:54.930> fifth<00:04:55.169> it's<00:04:55.919> nice<00:04:56.160> and<00:04:56.370> neat

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
third fifth it's nice and neat

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.120 
third fifth it's nice and neat
so<00:04:58.720> I'm<00:04:58.810> going<00:04:58.900> to<00:04:58.990> play<00:04:59.250> G<00:05:00.450> CJD<00:05:01.770> here<00:05:02.770> and<00:05:02.950> then

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
so I'm going to play G CJD here and then

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.080 
so I'm going to play G CJD here and then
I'm<00:05:03.220> going<00:05:03.310> to<00:05:03.400> play<00:05:03.520> it<00:05:03.610> up<00:05:03.640> here<00:05:03.850> you<00:05:03.970> can

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
I'm going to play it up here you can

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:16.170 
I'm going to play it up here you can
hear<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.300> difference<00:05:04.540> so<00:05:13.530> okay<00:05:14.530> G<00:05:15.100> CJD<00:05:15.940> now

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
hear the difference so okay G CJD now

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:32.130 
hear the difference so okay G CJD now
watch<00:05:16.360> this<00:05:30.810> sound<00:05:31.810> sounds<00:05:32.020> like

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
watch this sound sounds like

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.650 
watch this sound sounds like
free-falling<00:05:32.590> padding<00:05:33.340> so<00:05:33.970> you<00:05:34.030> get<00:05:34.180> contrast

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
free-falling padding so you get contrast

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.660 
free-falling padding so you get contrast
that<00:05:34.810> way<00:05:34.930> the<00:05:35.020> same<00:05:35.230> chord<00:05:35.470> progression

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:35.670 
that way the same chord progression

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.950 
that way the same chord progression
different<00:05:36.670> voicing<00:05:37.210> and<00:05:37.390> throw<00:05:37.540> that<00:05:37.660> way<00:05:37.810> up

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
different voicing and throw that way up

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.510 
different voicing and throw that way up
the<00:05:38.050> neck<00:05:38.080> don't<00:05:38.770> have<00:05:38.890> to<00:05:38.950> do<00:05:39.040> bar<00:05:39.220> chords

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
the neck don't have to do bar chords

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.460 
the neck don't have to do bar chords
it's<00:05:40.300> a<00:05:40.390> it's<00:05:40.660> a<00:05:40.720> really<00:05:40.930> nice<00:05:41.050> way<00:05:41.260> to<00:05:41.290> get

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
it's a it's a really nice way to get

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.110 
it's a it's a really nice way to get
some<00:05:41.590> texture<00:05:41.890> now<00:05:42.370> there's<00:05:42.580> obviously<00:05:42.730> a

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
some texture now there's obviously a

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.790 
some texture now there's obviously a
minor<00:05:43.450> version<00:05:43.780> for<00:05:44.140> all<00:05:44.170> of<00:05:44.380> these<00:05:44.500> shapes

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
minor version for all of these shapes

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.560 
minor version for all of these shapes
these<00:05:45.460> are<00:05:45.580> just<00:05:45.730> gonna<00:05:45.850> be<00:05:45.970> triads<00:05:46.390> though

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
these are just gonna be triads though

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.200 
these are just gonna be triads though
root<00:05:46.750> third<00:05:46.930> fifth<00:05:46.960> so<00:05:47.410> no<00:05:47.560> 7s<00:05:48.040> here<00:05:48.220> if<00:05:49.060> you

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
root third fifth so no 7s here if you

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.150 
root third fifth so no 7s here if you
end<00:05:49.390> up<00:05:49.510> like<00:05:49.780> what<00:05:49.960> if<00:05:50.050> I<00:05:50.140> do<00:05:50.200> the<00:05:50.380> d7<00:05:50.920> shape

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
end up like what if I do the d7 shape

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.860 
end up like what if I do the d7 shape
and<00:05:51.310> I<00:05:51.340> don't<00:05:51.400> have<00:05:51.580> my<00:05:51.670> D<00:05:51.730> that's<00:05:52.480> actually<00:05:52.840> a

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
and I don't have my D that's actually a

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.290 
and I don't have my D that's actually a
diminished<00:05:53.350> triad<00:05:53.410> so<00:05:54.010> it's<00:05:54.700> not<00:05:54.910> going<00:05:55.090> to<00:05:55.180> be

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
diminished triad so it's not going to be

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.540 
diminished triad so it's not going to be
you<00:05:55.480> know<00:05:55.570> this<00:05:55.750> isn't<00:05:55.900> a<00:05:56.080> g7<00:05:56.530> you<00:05:57.220> could<00:05:57.340> use

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
you know this isn't a g7 you could use

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.090 
you know this isn't a g7 you could use
it<00:05:57.700> like<00:05:57.820> one<00:05:57.850> is<00:05:58.630> like<00:05:58.840> g7<00:05:59.590> that's<00:06:00.010> a

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
it like one is like g7 that's a

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.810 
it like one is like g7 that's a
diminished<00:06:00.550> chord<00:06:00.960> so<00:06:02.430> that's<00:06:03.430> F<00:06:03.610> sharp

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
diminished chord so that's F sharp

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.330 
diminished chord so that's F sharp
diminished<00:06:04.350> this<00:06:05.350> is<00:06:05.500> B<00:06:05.710> diminished

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
diminished this is B diminished

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.010 
diminished this is B diminished
so<00:06:06.700> the<00:06:06.910> minor<00:06:07.090> shapes<00:06:07.390> then<00:06:07.600> would<00:06:07.750> be<00:06:07.840> just

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
so the minor shapes then would be just

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.070 
so the minor shapes then would be just
like<00:06:08.140> girlfriend<00:06:08.530> from<00:06:08.830> your<00:06:09.480> let's<00:06:10.480> sort<00:06:11.050> of

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
like girlfriend from your let's sort of

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.510 
like girlfriend from your let's sort of
the<00:06:11.170> first<00:06:11.320> one<00:06:11.500> root<00:06:11.680> on<00:06:11.860> the<00:06:11.980> first<00:06:12.220> string

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
the first one root on the first string

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.390 
the first one root on the first string
we<00:06:13.120> had<00:06:13.410> if<00:06:14.410> I'm<00:06:14.620> in<00:06:14.740> the<00:06:14.830> eighth<00:06:14.920> positions

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
we had if I'm in the eighth positions

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.390 
we had if I'm in the eighth positions
eight<00:06:15.670> eight<00:06:16.450> nine<00:06:16.720> that<00:06:17.650> 9<00:06:17.920> is<00:06:18.130> the<00:06:18.160> major

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
eight eight nine that 9 is the major

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.890 
eight eight nine that 9 is the major
third<00:06:18.760> so<00:06:18.940> just<00:06:19.090> lower<00:06:19.240> that<00:06:19.330> a<00:06:19.450> half<00:06:19.630> step<00:06:19.870> so

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
third so just lower that a half step so

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.270 
third so just lower that a half step so
I've<00:06:20.140> got<00:06:20.260> three<00:06:20.650> in<00:06:20.740> a<00:06:20.800> row

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
I've got three in a row

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.930 
I've got three in a row
that's<00:06:21.880> my<00:06:22.090> minor<00:06:22.330> strings<00:06:23.320> right<00:06:23.530> the<00:06:24.220> D

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
that's my minor strings right the D

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.550 
that's my minor strings right the D
shape<00:06:25.210> the<00:06:25.420> D<00:06:25.540> minor<00:06:25.780> shape<00:06:26.080> is<00:06:26.260> just<00:06:26.440> like

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
shape the D minor shape is just like
