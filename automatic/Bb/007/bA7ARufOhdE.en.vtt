federal ranks what is the veteran rank
system<00:00:35.160> well<00:00:35.460> basically<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.690> an<00:00:36.840> extra

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
system well basically this is an extra

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.069 
system well basically this is an extra
tier<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:38.040> progression<00:00:38.760> once<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.600> hit<00:00:39.780> max

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
tier of progression once you hit max

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.380 
tier of progression once you hit max

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
veteran rank 1 and then again there's

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.469 
veteran rank 1 and then again there's
there's<00:01:37.320> gear<00:01:37.590> 4<00:01:37.799> 2<00:01:38.100> 3<00:01:38.460> 4<00:01:38.729> all<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.000> way<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:39.360> to

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
there's gear 4 2 3 4 all the way up to

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.840 
there's gear 4 2 3 4 all the way up to
10<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.960> each<00:01:40.439> one<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.009> these<00:01:41.159> tiers<00:01:41.610> of

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
10 and each one of these tiers of

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.270 
10 and each one of these tiers of
veteran<00:01:42.119> rank<00:01:42.329> here<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.810> slight<00:01:43.710> increase

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
veteran rank here is a slight increase

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.960 
veteran rank here is a slight increase
in<00:01:44.600> stats<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.530> tier<00:01:46.799> before<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.820> I

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
in stats to the tier before it and I

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.670 
in stats to the tier before it and I
think<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.329> difference<00:01:48.659> between<00:01:48.720> 1<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.470> 10

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
think the difference between 1 and 10

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.969 
think the difference between 1 and 10
it's<00:01:50.490> not<00:01:50.700> huge<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.350> noticeable

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
it's not huge but it is noticeable

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.440 
it's not huge but it is noticeable
enough<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.610> if<00:01:53.850> you've<00:01:53.970> got<00:01:54.119> veteran

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
enough so that if you've got veteran

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.139 
enough so that if you've got veteran
rank<00:01:54.630> 10<00:01:54.899> gear<00:01:55.200> or<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.040> veteran<00:01:56.399> rank<00:01:56.549> 10<00:01:56.759> weapon

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
rank 10 gear or a veteran rank 10 weapon

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.520 
rank 10 gear or a veteran rank 10 weapon
as<00:01:57.270> opposed<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.689> veteran<00:01:57.960> rank<00:01:58.110> 1<00:01:58.320> weapon

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
as opposed to a veteran rank 1 weapon

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.010 
as opposed to a veteran rank 1 weapon
you're<00:01:59.430> going<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.570> know<00:02:00.600> you're

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
you're going to have you know you're

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.450

going to have an easier time of things

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.039

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
because you will be doing more damage

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
falls this is typically if you're are in

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.640 
falls this is typically if you're are in
the<00:03:19.540> ebon<00:03:19.750> heart<00:03:19.930> pact<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:20.440> you're<00:03:20.530> just

the ebon heart pact and you're just

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.720 
the ebon heart pact and you're just
starting<00:03:20.800> a<00:03:20.950> new<00:03:21.070> character<00:03:21.370> this<00:03:21.670> is

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
starting a new character this is

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.699 
starting a new character this is
basically<00:03:22.180> your<00:03:22.360> beginning<00:03:22.750> his<00:03:22.840> own<00:03:23.050> the

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
mobs here at the beginning are I think

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.020 
mobs here at the beginning are I think
between<00:03:26.020> like<00:03:26.320> levels<00:03:26.650> five<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.130> ten<00:03:27.370> in<00:03:27.730> fact

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
between like levels five and ten in fact

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.610 
between like levels five and ten in fact
I've<00:03:28.180> got<00:03:28.330> characters<00:03:28.810> that<00:03:29.020> are<00:03:29.110> low<00:03:29.260> level

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
I've got characters that are low level

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.100 
I've got characters that are low level
in<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:30.400> ebon<00:03:30.880> hard-packed<00:03:31.270> and<00:03:31.600> typically

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
in the ebon hard-packed and typically

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.650

these<00:03:32.440> these<00:03:32.980> niches<00:03:33.280> here<00:03:33.880> are<00:03:34.030> I<00:03:34.090> think

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
these these niches here are I think

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.020 
these these niches here are I think
level<00:03:35.080> five<00:03:35.290> or<00:03:35.500> six<00:03:35.800> in<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.310> most<00:03:36.610> recent

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
as you can see as I mouse over them they

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.260 
as you can see as I mouse over them they
are<00:03:41.740> actually<00:03:41.890> veteran<00:03:42.400> rank<00:03:42.580> one<00:03:42.790> so<00:03:43.120> they

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
are actually veteran rank one so they

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.510 
are actually veteran rank one so they
are<00:03:43.420> the<00:03:43.570> same<00:03:43.750> veteran<00:03:44.110> rank<00:03:44.290> as<00:03:44.410> me<00:03:44.440> now<00:03:44.860> this

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
are the same veteran rank as me now this

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.880 
are the same veteran rank as me now this
content<00:03:46.150> these<00:03:46.480> mobs<00:03:46.810> are<00:03:47.140> even<00:03:47.620> more

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
content these mobs are even more

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.280

difficult<00:03:48.520> than<00:03:48.820> normal<00:03:49.450> so<00:03:49.660> normally<00:03:50.170> when

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
difficult than normal so normally when

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.440 
difficult than normal so normally when
I'm<00:03:50.440> fighting<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.770> mob<00:03:50.950> on<00:03:51.160> my<00:03:51.310> level<00:03:51.520> if<00:03:51.850> I<00:03:52.360> am

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
I'm fighting a mob on my level if I am

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.620 
I'm fighting a mob on my level if I am
to<00:03:52.600> do<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.810> sneak<00:03:53.320> attack<00:03:53.610> heavy<00:03:54.610> bow<00:03:54.970> draw<00:03:55.270> from

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
to do a sneak attack heavy bow draw from

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.990 
to do a sneak attack heavy bow draw from
behind<00:03:55.930> it's<00:03:56.410> actually<00:03:57.190> usually<00:03:57.670> only

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
behind it's actually usually only

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.880 
behind it's actually usually only
requires<00:03:58.360> like<00:03:58.630> three<00:03:58.990> hits<00:03:59.260> so<00:03:59.560> I<00:03:59.590> do<00:03:59.709> the

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
requires like three hits so I do the

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.310 
requires like three hits so I do the
sneak<00:04:00.100> attack<00:04:00.190> I<00:04:00.550> hit<00:04:01.000> my<00:04:01.120> number<00:04:01.360> one<00:04:01.570> I<00:04:01.840> then

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
sneak attack I hit my number one I then

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.140 
sneak attack I hit my number one I then
do<00:04:02.440> a<00:04:02.470> light<00:04:02.770> attack<00:04:03.100> and<00:04:03.340> number<00:04:03.550> two<00:04:03.790> and

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
do a light attack and number two and

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.030 
do a light attack and number two and
that's<00:04:04.209> typically<00:04:04.690> enough<00:04:04.990> to<00:04:05.230> kill<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.800> mob

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
that's typically enough to kill a mob

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.610 
that's typically enough to kill a mob
that's<00:04:06.430> equal<00:04:06.760> level<00:04:07.120> these<00:04:07.720> mobs<00:04:08.140> are<00:04:08.320> equal

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
that's equal level these mobs are equal

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.500 
that's equal level these mobs are equal
level<00:04:08.920> let's<00:04:09.489> see<00:04:09.670> if<00:04:09.760> it's<00:04:09.940> that<00:04:10.090> easy<00:04:10.300> to

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
level let's see if it's that easy to

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.410 
level let's see if it's that easy to
kill<00:04:10.660> them<00:04:11.130> so<00:04:12.130> there's<00:04:12.280> one<00:04:12.489> and<00:04:12.520> two<00:04:12.730> there's

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
kill them so there's one and two there's

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.270 
kill them so there's one and two there's
a<00:04:13.540> light<00:04:13.750> attack<00:04:14.080> and<00:04:14.350> he<00:04:14.800> is<00:04:14.890> nowhere<00:04:15.100> near

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
a light attack and he is nowhere near

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.330 
a light attack and he is nowhere near
dead<00:04:15.670> as<00:04:15.880> you<00:04:16.359> can<00:04:16.540> clearly<00:04:16.810> see<00:04:16.930> so<00:04:17.470> it<00:04:17.709> is

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
dead as you can clearly see so it is

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.400 
dead as you can clearly see so it is
more<00:04:18.549> difficult<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:19.390> mobs<00:04:19.600> are<00:04:19.930> harder<00:04:20.380> to

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
more difficult the mobs are harder to

I'm still killing them of course but

they're more challenging they've got

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:50.010 
about the difficulty and I think it's
important<00:04:49.180> to<00:04:49.240> keep<00:04:49.360> in<00:04:49.509> mind<00:04:49.719> a<00:04:49.810> few<00:04:49.840> things

will<00:05:23.080> be<00:05:23.139> coming<00:05:23.439> I<00:05:23.740> guess<00:05:24.069> it's<00:05:24.279> just<00:05:24.310> really

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
will be coming I guess it's just really

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.100 
will be coming I guess it's just really
a<00:05:24.669> matter<00:05:25.029> of<00:05:25.120> when<00:05:25.479> and<00:05:25.719> when<00:05:25.839> we're<00:05:25.960> going<00:05:25.990> to

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
a matter of when and when we're going to

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.350 
a matter of when and when we're going to
get<00:05:26.289> more<00:05:26.439> details<00:05:26.860> so<00:05:27.099> again<00:05:27.370> typically<00:05:28.150> if

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
get more details so again typically if

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.570 
get more details so again typically if
this<00:05:28.509> was<00:05:28.659> a<00:05:28.689> mod<00:05:28.930> even<00:05:29.289> my<00:05:29.379> level<00:05:29.800> it<00:05:30.460> would

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
this was a mod even my level it would

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.369 
this was a mod even my level it would
have<00:05:30.729> been<00:05:30.819> dead<00:05:31.060> a<00:05:31.089> few<00:05:31.449> shots<00:05:31.689> earlier<00:05:32.169> than

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:32.379 
have been dead a few shots earlier than

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:33.839 
have been dead a few shots earlier than
it<00:05:32.529> actually<00:05:32.650> was<00:05:32.889> again<00:05:33.520> it's<00:05:33.699> still

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
it actually was again it's still

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:35.999 
it actually was again it's still

glass<00:06:05.349> cannon<00:06:05.740> style<00:06:06.509> that's<00:06:07.509> how<00:06:07.719> it<00:06:07.899> that's

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
glass cannon style that's how it that's

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.779 
glass cannon style that's how it that's
how<00:06:08.319> I<00:06:08.349> roll<00:06:08.649> so<00:06:08.860> yes<00:06:09.039> the<00:06:09.219> veteran<00:06:09.550> rank

system every veteran rank gets you

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:13.800 
system every veteran rank gets you
access<00:06:12.729> to<00:06:12.759> a<00:06:12.879> higher<00:06:13.089> tier<00:06:13.360> of<00:06:13.509> gear

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
access to a higher tier of gear

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.689 
access to a higher tier of gear
increases<00:06:14.500> your<00:06:14.649> attributes<00:06:15.159> a<00:06:15.279> little<00:06:15.520> bit

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:15.699 
increases your attributes a little bit

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:18.420 
increases your attributes a little bit
and<00:06:15.990> there's<00:06:16.990> just<00:06:17.199> it's<00:06:17.469> a<00:06:17.620> lot<00:06:17.800> more<00:06:17.949> content

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
and there's just it's a lot more content

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.040 
and there's just it's a lot more content
there's<00:06:18.729> just<00:06:18.969> a<00:06:19.029> lot<00:06:19.210> more<00:06:19.240> content<00:06:19.810> I've<00:06:19.899> got
