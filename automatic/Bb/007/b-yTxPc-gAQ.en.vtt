00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:06.649
 abramo dari sonohra baby came in 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.500
 this spot light 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:11.000
 today we talk about bac bac bol 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.269
 of course the latest version of 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.430
 minecraft I'm talking about a mod that there 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.840
 really facilitates life since there 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.730
 adds lots of slots to the mike loft and 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.640
 they only occupy one in what sense 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.429
 now how do you see a magma who in hand that 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.080
 occupies only one slot for the first 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:32.600
 clicking instead adds more 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.820
 the beauty is that this bac bac 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.490
 or the little one in coming a few but 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.950
 with the big look how many it reaches 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:43.100
 so I remind you that the inventory is 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:46.070
 done this way however we have these 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.940
 these slots plus these in the bag 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.810
 so think about putting everyone all bac 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.430
 big bac occupying all these slots 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.490
 think how many objects we will be able to 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.000
 then bring the nice that the bucks with us 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.160
 they are available in all colors 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.320
 my favorites sincerely are 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.320
 black and red blue white 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.400
 let's say these two are just right 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.430
 to show you, however, let's move on to 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.920
 crafting methods this way 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.830
 we create the bac bac or kraft I call 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.570
 the bac bac normal without color in 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.110
 this way we sing that instead 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.780
 big the lettre of course is not like 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.030
 the one we normally find in 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.820
 minecraft but now a leader who worked there 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.730
 I show this way later instead 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.560
 that I love the bac bac colored and this the 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.970
 so instead it created the big bac and 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.460
 colored 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.880
 in this way we create the and her back 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.040
 pack or the bac bac created with n 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.180
 chest not practical having all the bars 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.130
 paquin 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.380
 these are the objects within a 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.140
 backend will also be found in the other pope 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.090
 keller however in this way 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.270
 we can remove the batman's color 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.000
 then make it but some normal and then 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.000
 we can recolor instead in this 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.520
 so we create the leading band and finally 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.950
 we will create this rover latimer law 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.520
 leather that will allow us to kraft areas 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.480
 iba 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.400
 large all very simple or me them 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.800
 I see some other time and a half 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.910
 portraits while I talk to you and I'm very 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.610
 simple 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.440
 there is nothing else to say and I repeat to you 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.750
 ways to add in practice adds 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.980
 of bac bac that occupy only small 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:37.850
 space however one slot space this 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:41.140
 slot occupying these bach let's say ne 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.540
 they will add more since with just one 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.820
 slots we will be able to have many more slots 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.950
 and of course using the big ones 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:53.090
 we will be able to bring many with us 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.070
 objects and so we say I recommend you 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.560

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.140
