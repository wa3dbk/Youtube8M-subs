00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.420
 today we are going to prepare zucchini chips 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.680
 and baked parmesan and the ingredients 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.680
 what are we going to use are 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.519
 a medium zucchini three tablespoons of 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.790
 flour two spoons of sweet paprika 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.099
 two beaten eggs 8 tablespoons of bread 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:24.500
 grated 12 tablespoons of parmesan 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.500
 grated ground black pepper and salt 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.400
 we're going well the zucchini we discard 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.890
 the ends and we start to take out 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.660
 slices as thin as we can if 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.340
 we have a mandolin we will achieve 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.340
 Take out thin and perfect slices 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.670
 once we have the zucchini cut 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.980
 We started preparing the batter in a 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.210
 we toss the flour and the paprika and 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.220
 we mix until the ingredients 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.420
 are well integrated and do not remain 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.250
 lumps 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.379
 the amount of the ingredients is 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.010
 indicative since it depends on the size 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.010
 of the zucchini 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.170
 in another bowl we will mix 4 tablespoons of 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.310
 bread crumbs 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:10.829
 6 tablespoons of parmesan 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.829
 Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.299
 we are replacing this mixture of cheese and 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.590
 bread crumbs as you go 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.109
 ending 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.060
 in total for about 70 chips we have 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:25.610
 used 8 tablespoons of breadcrumbs and 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.380
 12 parmesan 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.180
 We put a few slices of 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.730
 zucchini in the bowl of flour and paprika 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.510
 and stir well until all 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.510
 well battered 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.370
 we shake it to remove the excess and 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.370
 we bathe them in the beaten egg 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.560
 then we drain them and the 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.700
 We went through bread crumbs and cheese 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.509
 ensuring that they are well impregnated 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.509
 on both sides 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.840
 we cover a baking sheet with paper 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.349
 vegetable and let's place the slices 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.349
 about her 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.500
 We put the tray in the oven that we have 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.140
 had preheating to 180 degrees from 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.790
 we start the recipe and we bake 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.120
 until the zucchini joke is 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.120
 golden 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.590
 it's a very easy recipe and a good one 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.250
 way to enjoy a healthy snack 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.440
 and delicious made by ourselves 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.380
 we hope you liked it as much as 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.420
 we'll see each other in the next 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.420
 recipe until next time
