there's<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.509> belt<00:00:15.890> power<00:00:16.890> steering<00:00:17.190> pump

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
there's the belt power steering pump

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.450 
there's the belt power steering pump
that<00:00:18.510> goes<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.199> second<00:00:19.830> power<00:00:20.100> steering

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
that goes to the second power steering

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.170 
that goes to the second power steering
pump<00:00:20.640> goes<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.090> second<00:00:21.570> groove<00:00:23.060> on<00:00:24.060> the

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
pump goes to the second groove on the

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.370 
pump goes to the second groove on the
water<00:00:24.390> pump<00:00:24.720> pulley<00:00:25.550> and<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.670> second<00:00:27.090> groove

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
water pump pulley and the second groove

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.549 
water pump pulley and the second groove
on<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.949> on<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.670> crank<00:00:30.000> pulley<00:00:30.710> and<00:00:31.710> then<00:00:33.559> okay

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
on the on the crank pulley and then okay

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.280 
on the on the crank pulley and then okay
so<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.040> air<00:00:35.190> conditioner<00:00:35.760> bracket<00:00:36.180> mounts<00:00:37.079> to

Quadrajet some guys love it I'm not one

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.420 
Quadrajet some guys love it I'm not one
of<00:01:16.979> them

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
of them

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.859 
of them
I<00:01:17.630> don't<00:01:18.630> know<00:01:18.750> how<00:01:18.930> okay<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.430> let's<00:01:21.360> see<00:01:21.600> what

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
I don't know how okay so let's see what

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.890 
I don't know how okay so let's see what
else<00:01:22.020> we<00:01:22.140> got<00:01:22.290> here<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:22.740> need<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.979> do

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
else we got here that we need to do

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.819 
else we got here that we need to do
these<00:01:25.220> lines<00:01:26.220> here<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.320> think<00:01:28.320> are<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
these lines here I think are the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.120 
these lines here I think are the
transmission<00:01:29.520> cooler<00:01:29.790> lines<00:01:30.560> this<00:01:31.560> one<00:01:31.770> here

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
transmission cooler lines this one here

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.039 
transmission cooler lines this one here
and<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.700> one<00:01:32.939> here<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.570> those<00:01:33.750> were

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
and this one here and those were

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.560 
and this one here and those were
connected<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.619> bottom<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.009> radiator<00:01:35.570> so

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
connected the bottom of the radiator so

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.969 
connected the bottom of the radiator so
I<00:01:38.689> don't<00:01:39.689> know<00:01:39.810> why<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.020> radiator<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.680> running

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
I don't know why the radiator is running

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.789 
I don't know why the radiator is running
transmission<00:01:41.549> fluid<00:01:41.880> through<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.180> but<00:01:42.799> it

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
transmission fluid through it but it

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.520 
transmission fluid through it but it
obviously<00:01:44.130> seems<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:44.909> what's<00:01:45.060> going<00:01:45.299> on

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
obviously seems to be what's going on

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.380 
obviously seems to be what's going on
with<00:01:46.530> those<00:01:46.680> two<00:01:46.740> lines

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
with those two lines

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.780 
with those two lines
must<00:01:48.960> be<00:01:49.050> a<00:01:49.080> little<00:01:49.260> a<00:01:49.800> little<00:01:50.010> port<00:01:50.370> inside<00:01:50.670> of

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
must be a little a little port inside of

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.310 
must be a little a little port inside of
it<00:01:50.910> for<00:01:51.120> tranny<00:01:51.630> fluid<00:01:52.370> okay<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:54.990> here's<00:01:55.200> where

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
it for tranny fluid okay so here's where

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.360 
it for tranny fluid okay so here's where
we're<00:01:55.530> at<00:01:55.560> we're<00:01:56.040> gonna<00:01:56.130> pull<00:01:56.370> this<00:01:56.490> out<00:01:56.690> and

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
we're at we're gonna pull this out and

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.140 
we're at we're gonna pull this out and
just<00:01:59.370> make<00:02:00.770> very<00:02:01.770> good<00:02:01.830> mental<00:02:02.250> notes<00:02:02.490> here<00:02:02.880> of

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
just make very good mental notes here of

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:11.350 
just make very good mental notes here of
the<00:02:03.540> belts<00:02:04.520> alternator

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.610 

got<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.020> bracket<00:02:13.030> right<00:02:14.030> in<00:02:14.240> here<00:02:15.400> for<00:02:16.400> the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
got the bracket right in here for the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.000 
got the bracket right in here for the
bypass<00:02:18.620> water<00:02:19.400> pump<00:02:19.730> tube<00:02:20.710> goes<00:02:21.710> on<00:02:21.890> the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
bypass water pump tube goes on the

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.320 
bypass water pump tube goes on the
alternator<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:24.260> air<00:02:24.410> conditioner<00:02:25.330> these

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
alternator and the air conditioner these

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.960 
alternator and the air conditioner these
brackets<00:02:26.630> here<00:02:30.250> just<00:02:31.250> do<00:02:31.460> it

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
brackets here just do it

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.880 
brackets here just do it
quick<00:02:32.450> once<00:02:32.720> around<00:02:33.050> so<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.410> can<00:02:33.530> see<00:02:33.710> where

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
quick once around so you can see where

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:41.710 
quick once around so you can see where
everything<00:02:34.280> is<00:02:37.120> tired<00:02:38.120> engine<00:02:40.630> oppression<00:02:41.630> is

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
everything is tired engine oppression is

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.660 
everything is tired engine oppression is
shot<00:02:41.930> on<00:02:41.960> the<00:02:42.200> left<00:02:42.320> side<00:02:42.580> compression<00:02:43.580> is

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
shot on the left side compression is

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.190 
shot on the left side compression is
good<00:02:43.820> on<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:43.970> right<00:02:44.210> side<00:02:44.860> I'm<00:02:45.860> thinking

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
good on the right side I'm thinking

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.510 
good on the right side I'm thinking
right<00:02:48.200> here<00:02:48.230> I've<00:02:48.560> got<00:02:48.710> one<00:02:48.920> cylinder<00:02:49.280> with

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
right here I've got one cylinder with

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.400 
right here I've got one cylinder with
zero<00:02:49.880> compression<00:02:50.390> I'm<00:02:50.810> thinking<00:02:51.170> maybe<00:02:51.320> I

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
zero compression I'm thinking maybe I

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.960

after I did a compression test I could
definitely<00:03:22.930> definitely<00:03:23.930> see<00:03:24.350> why
