so that's like the first process there
being<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.049> next<00:03:49.199> thing<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:02.400> next<00:04:02.430> step<00:04:02.819> is

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
being the next thing the next step is

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:04.339 
being the next thing the next step is
going<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.150> be<00:04:03.209> when<00:04:03.720> he<00:04:03.780> brings<00:04:03.989> their<00:04:04.139> bells

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
door opens so this key to training

00:05:18.450 --> 00:06:07.950 
door opens so this key to training
yeah<00:05:20.420> of<00:05:21.420> course<00:05:21.720> need<00:05:22.380> patience

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.469 

so<00:06:09.370> Maximas<00:06:10.370> he's<00:06:10.520> picking<00:06:10.819> this<00:06:10.880> up<00:06:11.060> fairly

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
so Maximas he's picking this up fairly

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.050 
so Maximas he's picking this up fairly
simple<00:06:11.900> your<00:06:12.680> dog<00:06:12.889> might<00:06:13.220> come<00:06:13.580> back<00:06:13.759> and<00:06:13.940> work

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
simple your dog might come back and work

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.760 
simple your dog might come back and work
with<00:06:14.240> him<00:06:14.389> so<00:06:14.599> it<00:06:14.840> really<00:06:14.990> takes<00:06:15.380> a<00:06:15.590> lot<00:06:15.740> of

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
with him so it really takes a lot of

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.770 
with him so it really takes a lot of
patience<00:06:16.190> our<00:06:16.340> dogs<00:06:16.699> are<00:06:16.880> really<00:06:17.120> smart<00:06:17.569> to

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
patience our dogs are really smart to

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.050 
patience our dogs are really smart to
say<00:06:17.990> work<00:06:18.830> with<00:06:19.039> him<00:06:19.160> so<00:06:19.340> he's<00:06:19.490> knowing<00:06:19.849> that

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
say work with him so he's knowing that

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.909 
say work with him so he's knowing that
he<00:06:20.150> wants<00:06:20.389> it<00:06:20.509> he<00:06:20.960> wants<00:06:21.169> some<00:06:21.259> more<00:06:21.380> food<00:06:21.620> so

he wants it he wants some more food so

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:35.650 
he wants it he wants some more food so

and give him the treat so they can

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:48.240 
and give him the treat so they can
associate<00:06:45.650> that<00:06:45.860> as<00:06:46.069> well

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
associate that as well

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.850 
associate that as well
now<00:06:49.250> do<00:06:49.310> about<00:06:49.610> a<00:06:49.639> snapping<00:06:50.210> or<00:06:50.870> commands<00:06:51.409> so

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.959 

all<00:07:19.680> right<00:07:19.800> so<00:07:20.009> I<00:07:20.219> feel<00:07:20.249> that<00:07:20.460> a<00:07:20.610> couple<00:07:20.909> of

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:20.969 
all right so I feel that a couple of

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:23.149 
all right so I feel that a couple of
times<00:07:21.180> and<00:07:21.539> I'm<00:07:22.080> pretty<00:07:22.319> sure<00:07:22.529> like<00:07:22.770> a<00:07:22.830> day<00:07:23.039> or

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:23.159 
times and I'm pretty sure like a day or

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:25.549 
times and I'm pretty sure like a day or
two<00:07:23.309> he<00:07:23.610> lit<00:07:23.759> the<00:07:23.789> whole<00:07:24.089> thing<00:07:24.419> down<00:07:24.899> pat<00:07:25.229> so

00:07:25.549 --> 00:07:25.559 
two he lit the whole thing down pat so

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:29.149 
two he lit the whole thing down pat so
send<00:07:26.520> a<00:07:26.580> wrap<00:07:26.759> up<00:07:26.969> for<00:07:27.089> see<00:07:27.990> he<00:07:28.830> knows<00:07:28.979> what

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:29.159 
send a wrap up for see he knows what

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:31.429
