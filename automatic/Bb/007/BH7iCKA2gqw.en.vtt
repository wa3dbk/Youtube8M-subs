00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190
 hello to all today we find ourselves 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.470
 for a little video about android 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.650
 5.0.1 lollipop on you will have recognized 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.870
 the galaxy note 4 so first of all I 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.210
 will show you a little bit of the page 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.850
 so traditional update 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.189
 software then we are sure 5.0 points 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.080
 I pay you 10 base payment bo b4 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.510
 which is the last in raw that is 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.369
 available on ours 4 then the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.170
 novelties we will find in the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.570
 settings 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.530
 the blocking mode it has been replaced so 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.260
 title that I find you by the way 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.340
 interruption so that's it changes a 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.840
 little bit it's on these other ones a 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.820
 question really have something else 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.160
 if you know the galaxy s 5 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.020
 him he has a dumb mode here not yet on 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.820
 our 4 I think it will come because 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.739
 we have the same menu a priori but not 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.320
 still this famous silent mode that has disappeared 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.460
 with hip hop and it's very bad the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.649
 fonts are a little bigger 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.320
 on our 4 with hip hop 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.190
 it's very very light when you have them 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.840
 two beside we can realize 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.859
 as we just passed is 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.049
 rather not bad because we have room 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.180
 on 24 recent applications 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.439
 so we have a slightly different design 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.680
 it's a little bit more fold also 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.360
 we know that at all - so we have here to 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.869
 go through multiple windows in the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.369
 settings 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.630
 so we find in the menu 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.229
 applications the manager 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.780
 applications 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.640
 we're going to tell the lollypop with a little 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.540
 little more info in the run menu 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.549
 I had a lot of stuff 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.009
 was spinning we just had info 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.229
 on the train on kitkat and pages 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.900
 application if I advance one that we 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.369
 inform a little bit more to the east are 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.950
 a little more information 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.979
 including external applications 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.720
 I do not have much 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.320
 Here is active in more info more 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.570
 control unlike lollipop on 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.130
 touch with so under the bed people that 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.810
 becomes complicated the savings menu 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.360
 of energy in fact is a little bit 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.159
 different than on the a5 also including 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.600
 that is to say that there is no such thing as 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.220
 the bed people energy saving they are 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.470
 directly here the economy mode d 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.390
 j of samsung so the new who is 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.100
 already a classic and ultra mode 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.380
 energy savings we have a little bit 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.180
 more info here about using the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.490
 battery still my little bug 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.760
 graph that's here with the 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.520
 graphics under the police it's a small 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.410
 little way but it's not very serious 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.880
 and finally then hardware applications 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.430
 design so you already knew them from 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.300
 anyway on the on the bed pop on 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.680
 our 4 here it is the fonts would be a 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.130
 little bit bigger here also I 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.530
 can not really 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.430
 I can not really 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.480
 to tell if it's true or not I 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.970
 printing a little bit the numbers 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.440
 lessons do not have much big 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.770
 more to say otherwise it's white 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.800
 we are on a touch with design with a 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.880
 structure a lolly pop shape 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.980
 finally I was talking about the silent mode that 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.140
 do not exist just vibrator know that we 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.980
 has a kind of dumb mode but not like 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.300
 on the s5 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.510
 that is, if I go on his 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.000
 identification is so in a so 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.030
 sorry about application notifications here 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.840
 I can go on chrome for example and 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.290
 block notifications from this 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.750
 application 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.850
 so it's kind of these two modes 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.850
 blocking actually it's kind of to 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.710
 say shortcuts to overcome the fact 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.630
 that there is no fashion but on our 4 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.850
 for the moment on hip hop here 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.170
 it was the galaxy note 4 under android 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.520
 5.0.1 lollipop 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.520
 thank you all welcome
