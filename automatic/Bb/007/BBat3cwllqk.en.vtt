on<00:01:09.970> your<00:01:10.060> weight<00:01:10.210> 300<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:11.020> 400<00:01:11.700> 500<00:01:12.700> if<00:01:13.060> you're

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
on your weight 300 to 400 500 if you're

heavy<00:01:13.440> close<00:01:14.440> to<00:01:14.620> 500<00:01:15.070> then<00:01:15.580> you<00:01:15.700> can<00:01:15.850> start

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
heavy close to 500 then you can start

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.600 
heavy close to 500 then you can start
playing<00:01:16.330> around<00:01:16.479> with<00:01:16.870> different<00:01:16.930> grips

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
playing around with different grips

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.500 
playing around with different grips
because<00:01:18.610> your<00:01:18.729> shoulders<00:01:19.090> would<00:01:19.180> be<00:01:19.270> strong

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
because your shoulders would be strong

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.240 
because your shoulders would be strong
enough<00:01:19.720> to<00:01:19.840> handle<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.440> different<00:01:20.740> grips<00:01:20.979> and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
enough to handle the different grips and

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.610 
enough to handle the different grips and
I<00:01:21.280> also<00:01:21.729> suggest<00:01:22.060> using<00:01:22.479> dumbbells<00:01:22.870> hit<00:01:23.440> your

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
I also suggest using dumbbells hit your

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.870 
I also suggest using dumbbells hit your

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
mr. obvious reasons but basically that

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.590 
mr. obvious reasons but basically that
if<00:01:37.190> I<00:01:37.280> was<00:01:37.430> going<00:01:37.550> to<00:01:37.640> do<00:01:37.850> bodybuilding<00:01:38.420> I

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
if I was going to do bodybuilding I

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.630 
if I was going to do bodybuilding I
would<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:38.870> most<00:01:39.020> of<00:01:39.260> my<00:01:39.350> accessory<00:01:39.770> work<00:01:39.950> with

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
would you most of my accessory work with

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.060 
would you most of my accessory work with
dumbbells<00:01:41.120> or<00:01:41.420> an<00:01:41.630> incline<00:01:42.050> because<00:01:42.470> in<00:01:42.950> my

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
dumbbells or an incline because in my

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.800 
dumbbells or an incline because in my
opinion<00:01:43.220> is<00:01:43.640> just<00:01:43.880> much<00:01:44.060> safer<00:01:44.450> on<00:01:44.750> the

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
opinion is just much safer on the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.600 
opinion is just much safer on the

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.050 
really got to focus on the first time to
try<00:03:32.829> your<00:03:33.829> upper<00:03:34.099> back<00:03:34.280> is<00:03:34.489> probably<00:03:34.849> going<00:03:35.000> to

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
try your upper back is probably going to

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.630 
try your upper back is probably going to
be<00:03:35.150> sore<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:35.870> amounts<00:03:36.440> of<00:03:36.530> 15<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:37.099> then

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
be sore and amounts of 15 and then

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.399 
be sore and amounts of 15 and then
bitched<00:03:37.879> remembers<00:03:38.420> a<00:03:38.480> full<00:03:38.750> body<00:03:38.930> movement

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
bitched remembers a full body movement

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:40.869 
bitched remembers a full body movement
so<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.769> harder<00:03:40.069> you<00:03:40.129> driving<00:03:40.519> to<00:03:40.579> the<00:03:40.640> floor

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
so the harder you driving to the floor

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.150 
so the harder you driving to the floor
and<00:03:41.150> the<00:03:41.690> tighter<00:03:41.900> your<00:03:42.110> stomach<00:03:42.440> is<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.980> more

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
and the tighter your stomach is the more

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.430 
and the tighter your stomach is the more
you<00:03:43.250> can<00:03:43.340> be<00:03:43.489> able<00:03:43.609> to<00:03:43.670> press<00:03:43.910> and<00:03:44.750> I<00:03:45.170> can't

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
you can be able to press and I can't

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.199 
you can be able to press and I can't
emphasize<00:03:45.620> how<00:03:45.890> much<00:03:46.190> you<00:03:46.489> need<00:03:46.579> to<00:03:46.700> focus<00:03:46.879> on

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
emphasize how much you need to focus on

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.289 
emphasize how much you need to focus on
just<00:03:48.170> basic<00:03:48.709> bench<00:03:48.920> press<00:03:49.220> and<00:03:49.970> getting

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
just basic bench press and getting

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.680 
just basic bench press and getting
strong<00:03:50.660> in<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:50.959> big<00:03:51.109> movements<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:53.090> then

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
strong in the big movements and then

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.240 
strong in the big movements and then
worrying<00:03:54.019> about<00:03:54.079> specializing<00:03:54.890> once<00:03:55.099> you

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
worrying about specializing once you

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:02.620 
worrying about specializing once you
reach<00:03:56.180> an<00:03:56.329> intermediate<00:03:56.810> steps

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.630 

Oh
