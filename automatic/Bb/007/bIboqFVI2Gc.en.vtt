of<00:03:16.329> nutrients<00:03:16.900> that<00:03:17.019> I've<00:03:17.170> digested<00:03:17.769> in<00:03:17.980> your

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
of nutrients that I've digested in your

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.399 
of nutrients that I've digested in your
belly<00:03:18.579> and<00:03:18.909> your<00:03:19.000> intestinal<00:03:19.480> tract<00:03:19.780> all<00:03:20.019> that

belly and your intestinal tract all that

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.650 
belly and your intestinal tract all that
stuff<00:03:20.620> gets<00:03:20.799> flushed<00:03:21.040> out<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.609> all<00:03:22.329> that's

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
stuff gets flushed out and all that's

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.189 
stuff gets flushed out and all that's
really<00:03:22.840> left<00:03:22.930> is<00:03:23.349> bile<00:03:24.069> in<00:03:24.489> mucus<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.299> toxins

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:26.199 
really left is bile in mucus and toxins

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:27.569 
really left is bile in mucus and toxins
and<00:03:26.410> your<00:03:26.530> own<00:03:26.650> body<00:03:26.919> fat<00:03:27.160> that<00:03:27.430> you're

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
and your own body fat that you're

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.089 
and your own body fat that you're
melting<00:03:27.760> off<00:03:28.060> getting<00:03:28.810> flushed<00:03:29.079> out<00:03:29.349> but<00:03:29.919> even

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
melting off getting flushed out but even

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.530 
melting off getting flushed out but even
with<00:03:30.459> all<00:03:30.579> that<00:03:30.609> body<00:03:30.910> fat<00:03:31.120> that<00:03:31.359> you're

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
with all that body fat that you're

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.750 
with all that body fat that you're
melting<00:03:32.019> off<00:03:32.319> of<00:03:32.500> yourself<00:03:32.560> at<00:03:33.069> some<00:03:33.519> point

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
melting off of yourself at some point

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.280 
melting off of yourself at some point
that<00:03:34.030> stops<00:03:34.329> getting<00:03:34.510> flushed<00:03:34.780> out<00:03:34.989> because

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
that stops getting flushed out because

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.289 
that stops getting flushed out because
it<00:03:35.470> doesn't<00:03:35.739> have<00:03:35.829> enough<00:03:35.889> weight<00:03:36.340> or<00:03:36.760> mass<00:03:37.030> to

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
it doesn't have enough weight or mass to

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:38.849 
it doesn't have enough weight or mass to
it<00:03:37.449> to<00:03:37.810> actually<00:03:38.139> get<00:03:38.290> pushed<00:03:38.470> through<00:03:38.709> your

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
it to actually get pushed through your

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.379 
it to actually get pushed through your
intestinal<00:03:39.340> tract<00:03:39.609> and<00:03:39.849> what's<00:03:40.209> going<00:03:40.359> to

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
intestinal tract and what's going to

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:41.670 
intestinal tract and what's going to
happen<00:03:40.720> is<00:03:40.810> when<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:40.989> actually<00:03:41.199> have<00:03:41.530> your

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
happen is when you actually have your

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.189 
happen is when you actually have your
first<00:03:41.859> meal<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.669> break<00:03:42.879> the<00:03:43.030> fast<00:03:43.239> that<00:03:43.959> meal

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:44.199 
first meal to break the fast that meal

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.229 
first meal to break the fast that meal
is<00:03:44.230> actually<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:44.799> push<00:03:45.010> all<00:03:45.250> that<00:03:45.280> stuff<00:03:45.760> out

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
is actually to push all that stuff out

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.720 
is actually to push all that stuff out
so<00:03:46.599> you<00:03:46.660> basically<00:03:46.840> have<00:03:47.109> the<00:03:47.829> worst<00:03:48.040> diuretic

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
so you basically have the worst diuretic

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.159 
so you basically have the worst diuretic
 that<00:03:49.180> you've<00:03:49.299> ever<00:03:49.480> taken<00:03:49.750> in<00:03:50.049> your

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.289 
 that you've ever taken in your
entire<00:03:50.410> life<00:03:50.739> when<00:03:51.370> you<00:03:51.459> break<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:51.910> extend<00:03:52.209> it

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
entire life when you break and extend it

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.629 
entire life when you break and extend it
fast<00:03:52.569> like<00:03:53.169> the<00:03:53.290> kind<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:53.620> going<00:03:53.859> right<00:03:54.010> now<00:03:54.250> on
