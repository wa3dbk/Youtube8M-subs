with<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.130> thermal<00:00:35.969> scope<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:37.280> wanted<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.460> try

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
with the thermal scope I wanted to try

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
with the thermal scope I wanted to try
out<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.629> thermal<00:00:40.140> with<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> m4<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:44.300> CR<00:00:45.300> and

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
out the thermal with the m4 is a CR and

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.979 
out the thermal with the m4 is a CR and
I<00:00:46.800> would<00:00:47.539> also<00:00:48.539> like<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.050> m4<00:00:50.480> so<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.899> can

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989

well with it there's a few things you

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.789 
well with it there's a few things you
gotta<00:01:00.739> know<00:01:01.739> when<00:01:01.920> you're<00:01:02.100> using<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.910> m4<00:01:03.799> just

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
gotta know when you're using the m4 just

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.070 
gotta know when you're using the m4 just
keep<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.129> mind<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.510> mean<00:01:07.409> yeah<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.100> very

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
keep in mind that I mean yeah it is very

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.039 
keep in mind that I mean yeah it is very
accurate<00:01:10.080> assault<00:01:10.680> rifle<00:01:11.210> but<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.510> also<00:01:12.659> has<00:01:13.020> a

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
accurate assault rifle but it also has a

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.660 
accurate assault rifle but it also has a
lot<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.560> recoil<00:01:14.100> when<00:01:15.000> you're<00:01:15.150> using<00:01:15.270> a

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
lot of recoil when you're using a

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.640 
lot of recoil when you're using a
thermal<00:01:17.670> scope<00:01:17.880> look<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.299> am<00:01:20.090> so<00:01:21.090> I'm<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:22.470> if

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
thermal scope look I am so I'm like if

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.219 
thermal scope look I am so I'm like if
you're<00:01:22.830> taking<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.280> long<00:01:23.580> shot<00:01:23.939> like<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.110> know

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
you're taking a long shot like you know

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.070 
you're taking a long shot like you know
try<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:25.979> hit<00:01:26.130> something<00:01:26.400> far<00:01:26.909> away<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.659> would

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
try to hit something far away I would

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.730 
try to hit something far away I would
definitely<00:01:28.650> recommend<00:01:30.079> just<00:01:31.079> kind<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.530> burst

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
definitely recommend just kind of burst

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.810 
definitely recommend just kind of burst
firing<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.400> wouldn't<00:01:32.939> go<00:01:33.150> fully<00:01:33.450> automatic<00:01:34.020> I

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
firing I wouldn't go fully automatic I

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.370 
firing I wouldn't go fully automatic I
mean<00:01:35.820> close<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.390> medium<00:01:36.540> range<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.170> should

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
mean close to medium range you should

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.120 
mean close to medium range you should
have<00:01:37.470> no<00:01:37.619> problem<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.900> if<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.380> hold<00:01:40.950> your

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
have no problem and if you hold your

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.749 
have no problem and if you hold your
breath<00:01:41.689> sometimes<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:43.200> uh<00:01:43.229> keeps<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.369> you

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
breath sometimes that uh keeps it you

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.969 
breath sometimes that uh keeps it you
know<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:45.450> bit<00:01:45.930> more<00:01:45.960> steady<00:01:46.409> when<00:01:46.619> you're<00:01:46.770> using

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
know a bit more steady when you're using

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.830 
know a bit more steady when you're using
it<00:01:48.979> actually<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.130> fairly<00:01:50.820> decent<00:01:51.329> with<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.659> I

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
it actually do fairly decent with it I

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.260 
it actually do fairly decent with it I
mean<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.890> know<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.189> doesn't<00:01:53.340> show<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.000> game

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
mean I know it doesn't show in this game

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.260 
mean I know it doesn't show in this game
but<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.840> do<00:01:55.200> have<00:01:55.560> blue<00:01:56.189> tiger<00:01:56.610> for<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.000> right

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
but I do have blue tiger for it right

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.840 
but I do have blue tiger for it right
now<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.630> got<00:01:57.930> today<00:02:00.979> it<00:02:01.979> would<00:02:02.189> obviously

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
now I just got today it would obviously

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.120 
now I just got today it would obviously
see<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.270> if<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.509> walked<00:02:04.290> at<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.619> point<00:02:04.860> but

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
see it if I walked at this point but

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.290 
see it if I walked at this point but
this<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:06.119> actually<00:02:06.570> just<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.910> pur<00:02:09.119> I

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
this is actually just the the pur I

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.820 
this is actually just the the pur I
think<00:02:09.509> it<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.869> was<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.229> first<00:02:10.470> game<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
think it this was the first game of the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.580 
think it this was the first game of the
day<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.220> actually<00:02:11.370> played

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
and there's a little bit of surprise at

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.220 
and there's a little bit of surprise at
the<00:02:18.370> end<00:02:18.400> of<00:02:19.060> this<00:02:19.239> match<00:02:19.480> which<00:02:19.780> I'm<00:02:20.020> not

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
take you to reach tens prestige if you

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.289 
take you to reach tens prestige if you
didn't<00:02:54.940> like<00:02:55.150> booster<00:02:55.690> anything<00:02:56.280> well<00:02:57.280> I<00:02:57.610> got

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
didn't like booster anything well I got

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.750 
didn't like booster anything well I got
my<00:02:58.420> 10th<00:02:58.690> prestige<00:02:59.400> around<00:03:00.930> 31<00:03:02.100> days<00:03:03.100> gameplay

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
my 10th prestige around 31 days gameplay

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.110 
my 10th prestige around 31 days gameplay
which<00:03:04.600> is<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:05.260> know<00:03:05.380> about<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:05.739> month<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:07.060> I

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
which is you know about a month so I

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.690 
which is you know about a month so I
guess<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.569> could<00:03:07.690> just<00:03:07.840> base<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:07.989> off<00:03:08.230> of<00:03:08.260> that

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
guess you could just base it off of that

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.059 
guess you could just base it off of that
and<00:03:10.260> another<00:03:11.260> question<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:11.739> might<00:03:11.769> be<00:03:11.950> asking

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
and another question you might be asking

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.699 
and another question you might be asking
is<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:13.330> know<00:03:13.450> what<00:03:13.690> game<00:03:13.930> type<00:03:14.170> do<00:03:14.350> you<00:03:14.380> mostly
