00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
entrance to the smoke chamber would be

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.950 
entrance to the smoke chamber would be
as<00:00:41.070> low<00:00:41.280> as<00:00:41.460> possible<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.150> box<00:00:43.699> and<00:00:44.930> have<00:00:45.930> a

I've got slits on either side of the box
that<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.090> slips<00:00:51.420> into<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.890> will<00:00:53.040> hold

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
that it slips into and that will hold

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.490 
that it slips into and that will hold
the<00:00:53.460> product<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.630> I'm<00:00:54.719> going<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.020> smoke<00:00:55.290> in

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
the product that I'm going to smoke in

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.500 
the product that I'm going to smoke in
this<00:00:55.620> case<00:00:55.829> it'll<00:00:56.010> be<00:00:56.070> cheese<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:57.450> I

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
this case it'll be cheese and then I

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.840 
this case it'll be cheese and then I
just<00:00:57.660> have<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.809> simple<00:00:58.050> cardboard<00:00:58.770> top<00:00:59.219> with

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
just have a simple cardboard top with

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.880 
just have a simple cardboard top with
another<00:01:00.090> little<00:01:00.329> piece<00:01:00.540> of<00:01:00.750> PVC<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:01.680> for

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
another little piece of PVC on there for

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.070 
another little piece of PVC on there for
a<00:01:01.920> little<00:01:02.070> chimney<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:03.390> that's<00:01:03.629> smoke<00:01:03.870> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
a little chimney so that's smoke and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.760 
a little chimney so that's smoke and
exit<00:01:05.360> it's<00:01:06.360> pretty<00:01:06.600> simple<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.200> way<00:01:07.740> I

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
exit it's pretty simple so that way I

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.880 
exit it's pretty simple so that way I
can<00:01:08.070> have<00:01:08.399> cold<00:01:09.210> smoke<00:01:09.570> going<00:01:09.930> into<00:01:10.259> the<00:01:10.410> box

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
can have cold smoke going into the box

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.850 
can have cold smoke going into the box
and<00:01:11.539> not<00:01:12.539> heat<00:01:12.840> up<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> cheese<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.619> point

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
and not heat up the cheese to the point

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.040 
and not heat up the cheese to the point
where<00:01:14.039> it<00:01:14.100> starts<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.430> melt<00:01:14.700> which<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.720> have

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
where it starts to melt which I have

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.630 
where it starts to melt which I have
done<00:01:16.289> in<00:01:16.410> the<00:01:16.500> past

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:33.380 

okay<00:01:20.640> I'm<00:01:20.819> using<00:01:21.470> Applewood<00:01:22.470> chips<00:01:22.500> here<00:01:32.390> it's

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
okay I'm using Applewood chips here it's

okay I'm using Applewood chips here it's
already<00:01:33.509> getting<00:01:33.869> warm<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.360> gets<00:01:36.569> to<00:01:36.690> about

already getting warm and I gets to about
ninety<00:01:37.319> degrees<00:01:37.649> it'll<00:01:37.950> start<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.310> smoke

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.570

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
cheese here and these four chunks here

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.240 
cheese here and these four chunks here
are<00:01:50.940> going<00:01:51.300> to<00:01:51.480> be<00:01:52.730> smoked<00:01:53.730> sharp<00:01:54.330> cheddar<00:01:55.250> and

are going to be smoked sharp cheddar and

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.100 
are going to be smoked sharp cheddar and
we're<00:01:56.580> just<00:01:56.640> going<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.880> put<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.300> in<00:01:57.780> the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
we're just going to put this in the

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:11.720 
we're just going to put this in the
smoke<00:02:01.110> box<00:02:09.770> we'll<00:02:10.770> spread<00:02:11.070> these<00:02:11.220> chunks<00:02:11.610> out

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
smoke box we'll spread these chunks out

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.720 
smoke box we'll spread these chunks out
so<00:02:11.970> there<00:02:12.150> it's<00:02:12.270> an<00:02:12.360> airspace<00:02:13.070> in<00:02:14.070> between

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
so there it's an airspace in between

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.780 
so there it's an airspace in between
allow<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.180> smoke<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.570> circulate<00:02:19.310> there<00:02:20.310> we<00:02:20.400> go

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
allow the smoke to circulate there we go

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.780 
allow the smoke to circulate there we go
and<00:02:21.120> as<00:02:21.300> soon<00:02:21.450> as<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.660> starts<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.020> smoke<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.790> will

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
and as soon as it starts to smoke I will

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:33.229 
and as soon as it starts to smoke I will
leave<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.630> in<00:02:24.690> there<00:02:24.870> for<00:02:24.900> about<00:02:25.200> an<00:02:25.320> hour

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.869 

so<00:02:34.239> here<00:02:34.569> we<00:02:34.690> go<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.050> smoke<00:02:35.349> is<00:02:35.670> coming<00:02:36.670> out

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
so here we go the smoke is coming out

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:37.880 
so here we go the smoke is coming out
the<00:02:37.090> top

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
the top

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.440 
the top
and<00:02:38.890> should<00:02:39.310> be<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.459> lot<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.760> smoke<00:02:40.000> in<00:02:40.180> there

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
and should be a lot of smoke in there

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.000 
and should be a lot of smoke in there
yeah<00:02:40.750> I<00:02:41.050> could<00:02:41.290> already<00:02:41.440> see<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.800> cheese

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
yeah I could already see the cheese

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.129 
yeah I could already see the cheese
changing<00:02:42.610> color<00:02:43.379> so<00:02:44.379> that's<00:02:44.590> a<00:02:44.709> good<00:02:44.860> sign
