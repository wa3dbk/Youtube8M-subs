00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
no nest these capri suns will put in at

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.820 
no nest these capri suns will put in at
the<00:00:08.670> same<00:00:08.820> time<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:09.690> one

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.470 

and<00:00:13.660> this<00:00:14.660> one<00:00:14.930> except<00:00:15.530> isolated

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
and this one except isolated

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.750 
and this one except isolated
after<00:00:18.480> figuring<00:00:18.660> out<00:00:18.930> something<00:00:19.610> these<00:00:20.610> are

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
after figuring out something these are

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.650 
after figuring out something these are
hard<00:00:21.230> this<00:00:22.230> one<00:00:22.520> is<00:00:23.520> still<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.180> completely

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
hard this one is still a completely

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.010 
hard this one is still a completely
liquid<00:00:25.070> that's<00:00:26.070> because<00:00:26.610> it's<00:00:27.510> been<00:00:27.630> super

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
liquid that's because it's been super

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.930 
liquid that's because it's been super
cool<00:00:29.420> so<00:00:30.420> we're<00:00:30.570> going<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.750> open<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.080> up<00:00:31.260> and

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
cool so we're going to open it up and

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.700 
cool so we're going to open it up and
pour<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.330> a<00:00:34.520> cup<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.820> watch<00:00:36.720> it<00:00:36.960> freeze

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
pour it in a cup and watch it freeze

00:00:37.710 --> 00:01:21.500 
pour it in a cup and watch it freeze
instantly<00:00:43.370> scissors

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.610 

ok

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:35.530 

I<00:01:25.710> think<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.460> will<00:01:26.640> work

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:44.510 

now

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.709 

did<00:01:45.520> ya<00:01:45.759> I<00:01:46.950> know<00:01:47.950> if<00:01:48.070> you<00:01:48.159> did<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:49.689> oh<00:01:51.719> it's

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
did ya I know if you did but oh it's

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.200 
did ya I know if you did but oh it's
clearly<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.560> gel<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.429> they're<00:01:54.820> basically<00:01:55.329> just

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
clearly a gel and they're basically just

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.760 
clearly a gel and they're basically just
microscopic<00:01:58.210> ice<00:01:58.720> particles<00:01:59.079> mixed<00:01:59.530> with

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
microscopic ice particles mixed with

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:07.560 
microscopic ice particles mixed with
liquid<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:02.140> see<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:04.780> basically<00:02:05.170> a<00:02:05.289> gel
