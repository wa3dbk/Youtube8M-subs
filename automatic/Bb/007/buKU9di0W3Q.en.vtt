00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.660
 hello everyone I am the other the x 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.549
 welcome to this new video 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.080
 finally we go to see those two 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.400
 components for my pc that I already had 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.980
 announced on my facebook page 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.080
 in fact I am this new mouse and this one 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.240
 new keyboard as you can see they do 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.699
 part of the devastated kit published by 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.529
 cm store last month in fact towards the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.510
 end of September the cm store that one 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.030
 part of the curia master who publishes 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.860
 gaming components for the pc has decided 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.750
 to publish a kit dedicated to everyone 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.520
 those who wanted something yes 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.469
 quality but something that 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.290
 it cost quite a bit indeed 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.480
 this kit can be found on the note 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.930
 on amazon or even on other sites from 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.100
 gaming at a price really 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.329
 insignificant for what it offers 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.370
 30 EUR 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.140
 but let's see what goes on right away 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.300
 in this film it contains as you can well 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.780
 see from the images a keyboard that 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.920
 this is called mb 24 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.439
 keyboard spent 800 98 grams and it is 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.630
 formed by membrane-like rates 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.240
 with backlight plus some keys 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.670
 quick as for example play break stop 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.500
 forward back with the music and you get up 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.000
 and lower the 2 so I have to say 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.890
 a great keyboard and I have to say that 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.229
 when I tried it the first time i 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.240
 keys are really fast not 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.549
 they are not at all hard indeed they really are 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.159
 light after that neither inside the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.759
 package we also find the mouse 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.070
 called ms 2k this mouse is a mouse 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.909
 which can range from 800 up to 2000 and dpa 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.609
 and therefore something not 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.710
 not performing at levels really of 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:43.840
 progaming but still something that is 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.069
 indeed very useful 2000 dpi 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.409
 there are just so many for those who want to use 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.490
 simply the computer but anyway 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.649
 something good 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.450
 this mouse precisely to a yes to a 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:02:00.880
 simple sensor on the fly is like it already 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.250
 said can go from 800 to 2000 and dpa e 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.340
 another peculiarity that has a cable well 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.319
 two meters long and made in simple 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.720
 comma the same thing for the keyboard is 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.360
 you too if they are not trained not 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.019
 have just a usb cable plated in 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.739
 gold 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:19.920
 after which the mouse weighs only 128 grams 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.810
 and he also enlightened you both on 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.269
 precisely on the back than on the wheel e 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.930
 also two small LEDs ahead that we will see 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.359
 later 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.400
 but let's see the other keyboard 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:32.859
 which I wanted to say when you buy the 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.590
 kit will be attentive to the model in fact the 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:38.109
 model theme must end with 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.150
 precisely the why and why you are going to Italy 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.470
 in fact this keyboard is sold 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.400
 the whole world and therefore based on the 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.319
 ending theme you will notice that 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.810
 precisely what layout we are talking about 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.160
 both the Italian or the American one o 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.319
 however to the cilea 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.090
 how can you see the dead also two 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.370
 those small side keys 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.319
 they are usually used to do 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.019
 back and forth in the pages or 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:06.069
 in the folders and I must say that it is 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:09.159
 the mouse click is really convenient 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.920
 really optimized and very comfortable 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:14.170
 in fact, to use the mouse is one 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.209
 of the two pits that angela what i 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.499
 more than half scott than the 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.560
 keyboard 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:22.569
 let's go now to see the keyboard 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.359
 more closely as you can see the keys 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.310
 they are quite ad hoc as is usual 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:30.299
 use for the ones used in a computer 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.769
 desktop and the numeric keypad divided 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.620
 compared to the keyboard and it really is 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.120
 excellent did not open bought little if it were 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.459
 was the 2 1 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.849
 as you can see the rates precisely 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.769
 in addition they are above the keyboard e 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.680
 those two little ones you see are of 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:50.169
 raises and lowers the volume is more to it 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.419
 we find those free pause stops 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:55.629
 back and forth with music 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:58.480
 here they are the peaks that allow us 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.909
 just to turn up a little more angular 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.510
 the keyboard towards us and as you see 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:07.030
 in short, everything is perfect, it really is 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.680
 something like but now let's go to 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.409
 see and do a little review 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.909
 because now I've used it from these mice 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:15.129
 I used this note this evening 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.889
 just a few weeks ago I can 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.669
 tell you that they are both excellent though 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.979
 the keyboard 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.990
 I noticed some small flaws but 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.599
 let's talk about the way the mouse is 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.729
 truly spectacular is beautiful it is 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.919
 really really enjoyed it too 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:33.159
 the lighting on the back is really 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.020
 beautiful theme if all the site is like this 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:38.490
 it can be said is really great 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:41.409
 and that band of light that emanates towards 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.330
 towards the front it is really beautiful from 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:45.699
 see especially at night 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.409
 as you can see the upper key 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.650
 which is used to modify i 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:53.110
 definitive to those who go to 800 until 2000 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.320
 dpi and illuminated to the maximum then it wants 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.810
 say that it was imposed 2000 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.180
 on the other hand, it was set at about 800 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.880
 been turned off but beyond 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.420
 set it 800 and 2 thousand we can also 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.420
 set it 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.780
 an intermediate area that should be 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.970
 at 1200 1600 dpi 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.639
 instead with regards to the keyboard 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.930
 here too an excellent keyboard even though I have 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.740
 in fact a small defect was found 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:25.120
 naming the backlight 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:28.780
 of the keyboard is not very strong and therefore 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.820
 however there is not the note but the 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.490
 network every nation if it has some light 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.039
 one does not notice so much is one 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.710
 quite open determination then 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:41.320
 I was hoping for something a little stronger it is 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.620
 also a thing even if it is not in the 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.210
 style is not at night and therefore day 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.789
 and we see the keyboard 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.590
 since the unlit keys are 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.600
 the whites practically get confused 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.550
 with the keys the backlighting the 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.340
 you will always have to keep active to see 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.740
 well it is a second flaw is that 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.190
 the lighting is not uniform on all 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.070
 the keys 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:05.320
 so let's say these are the only ones 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.810
 defects that they managed to find out about 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.060
 these two components however the mouse 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.979
 I believe it has no defect only the 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.720
 keyboard to this small flaw that the 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:16.510
 network me nation is not similar homogeneous 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.700
 keys and that a little more ago but anyway 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.860
 really something great 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.570
 I very much hope this video is there 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.910
 I hope you liked this keyboard and 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.380
 this master cooler mouse 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.980
 precisely from the cm in the store there is 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.540
 liked 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.790
 I tried to tell you all the sides 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.560
 positive and negative I managed to 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.080
 find in this week of use 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.530
 and see you in a next video hi a 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.530
 all
