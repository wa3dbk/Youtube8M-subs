00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
course we had to defeat a lot of the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.010 
course we had to defeat a lot of the
safety<00:01:50.100> features<00:01:50.250> because<00:01:50.909> we<00:01:51.270> make<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.930> so

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
safety features because we make it so

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.630 
safety features because we make it so
the<00:01:52.050> car<00:01:52.259> doesn't<00:01:52.470> do<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:52.920> easily<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.369> let

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640

it<00:01:53.790> let<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.030> go<00:01:54.210> let<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.479> rip<00:01:54.690> hope<00:01:55.200> we<00:01:55.320> don't

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
it let it go let it rip hope we don't

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.070 
it let it go let it rip hope we don't
worry<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:56.670> course<00:01:56.700> we<00:01:57.030> don't<00:01:57.630> try<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:57.960> at

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
worry of course we don't try this at

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.680 
worry of course we don't try this at

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
car all-wheel drive we also ended up

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.440 
car all-wheel drive we also ended up
adjusting<00:02:05.650> the<00:02:05.770> torque<00:02:06.100> so<00:02:06.820> that<00:02:07.060> we<00:02:07.240> have<00:02:07.270> the

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
adjusting the torque so that we have the

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.750 
adjusting the torque so that we have the
torque<00:02:07.810> with<00:02:08.050> all-wheel<00:02:08.380> drive<00:02:08.710> on<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.460> front

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
and the rear equally distributed it so
