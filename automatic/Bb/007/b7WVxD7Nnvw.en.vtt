00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.400 
the Phantom of the Opera by Gaston
Leroux<00:00:02.429> was<00:00:02.850> certainly<00:00:03.389> not<00:00:03.720> the<00:00:03.959> book<00:00:04.140> that<00:00:04.380> I

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
Leroux was certainly not the book that I

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.289 
Leroux was certainly not the book that I
was<00:00:04.589> expecting<00:00:05.250> which<00:00:05.819> sounds<00:00:06.180> really

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
was expecting which sounds really

was expecting which sounds really
strange<00:00:06.629> but<00:00:07.080> all<00:00:07.290> my<00:00:07.500> kind<00:00:07.799> of<00:00:08.090> assumptions

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
strange but all my kind of assumptions

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.790 
strange but all my kind of assumptions
and<00:00:09.210> what<00:00:09.360> this<00:00:09.510> level<00:00:09.870> would<00:00:09.990> be<00:00:10.050> like<00:00:10.410> or

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
and what this level would be like or

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.490

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
what it was about was based on and my

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.609 
what it was about was based on and my
knowledge<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.190> 1986<00:00:14.940> musical<00:00:15.289> my<00:00:16.289> engine

very<00:00:28.500> very<00:00:29.189> very<00:00:29.429> different<00:00:30.590> which<00:00:31.590> i<00:00:31.679> think

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
very very very different which i think

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.260 
very very very different which i think
is<00:00:31.949> actually<00:00:32.040> really<00:00:32.219> nice<00:00:32.550> because<00:00:33.059> it

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
is actually really nice because it

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.709 
is actually really nice because it
enables<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.079> watch<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.420> musical<00:00:36.420> and

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
enables you to watch the musical and

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.110 
enables you to watch the musical and
then<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.079> read<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.290> book<00:00:37.469> can<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:37.860> two<00:00:38.820> very

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
then to read the book can have two very

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.799 
then to read the book can have two very
separate<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.290> different<00:00:40.980> experiences<00:00:41.879> but<00:00:42.570> I

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
separate and different experiences but I

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.500 
separate and different experiences but I
still<00:00:43.200> kind<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.469> united<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.610> idea

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
still kind of united with this idea

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.990 
still kind of united with this idea
which<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.050> really<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:46.680> Gaston<00:00:47.399> Lewis<00:00:47.700> normal

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
which I really like Gaston Lewis normal

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.299 
which I really like Gaston Lewis normal
is<00:00:48.149> much<00:00:48.510> more<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.989> mystery<00:00:49.440> crime<00:00:49.920> thriller

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
is much more of a mystery crime thriller

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.600 
is much more of a mystery crime thriller
than<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.210> love<00:00:51.480> story<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.230> at<00:00:52.920> first<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.399> was<00:00:53.430> a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.330 
than a love story and at first I was a
bit<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:54.030> this<00:00:54.329> isn't<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.780> novel<00:00:55.309> what<00:00:56.309> I

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
which is which really adds to the turn

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.200 
which is which really adds to the turn
of<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.009> novel<00:01:29.369> because<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:29.970> very

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
of the novel because it's very

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.920 
of the novel because it's very
melodramatic<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.500> very<00:01:31.740> rich<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.540> just

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
melodramatic and very rich and and just

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.830 
melodramatic and very rich and and just
really<00:01:34.259> fits<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.799> with<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.189> kind<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.390> idea

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
really fits in with the kind of the idea

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.510 
really fits in with the kind of the idea
of<00:01:36.960> what<00:01:37.079> an<00:01:37.200> opera<00:01:37.500> house<00:01:37.710> would<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:38.100> like<00:01:38.280> in

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520

Varrick but in fact there was a

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.260 
Varrick but in fact there was a
character<00:05:07.650> in<00:05:07.980> the<00:05:08.070> Persian<00:05:08.490> but<00:05:08.730> the<00:05:08.880> Persian

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
character in the Persian but the Persian

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.120 
character in the Persian but the Persian
was<00:05:09.900> throughout<00:05:10.140> the<00:05:10.200> novel<00:05:10.500> but<00:05:10.770> he<00:05:10.830> really

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
was throughout the novel but he really

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.370 
was throughout the novel but he really
kind<00:05:11.280> of<00:05:11.400> came<00:05:11.610> into<00:05:11.820> the<00:05:12.030> room<00:05:12.270> um<00:05:12.690> towards

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.370 
kind of came into the room um towards
the<00:05:13.620> end<00:05:13.920> I<00:05:14.250> think<00:05:14.400> there<00:05:14.670> was<00:05:14.790> a<00:05:14.820> little

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
the end I think there was a little

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.600 
the end I think there was a little
mention<00:05:16.380> to<00:05:16.650> him<00:05:16.800> in<00:05:17.040> the<00:05:17.220> kind<00:05:17.460> of<00:05:17.490> the

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
beginning but at the end there was a

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.310 
beginning but at the end there was a
shift<00:05:19.860> in<00:05:20.130> a<00:05:20.550> narrative<00:05:21.420> shifting<00:05:22.050> narrator

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
that this could have so easily have been

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.080 
that this could have so easily have been
going<00:06:32.850> on<00:06:33.980> like<00:06:34.980> behind<00:06:35.370> the<00:06:35.550> scenes<00:06:35.790> all<00:06:36.060> the

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.180 
going on like behind the scenes all the
things<00:06:36.360> that<00:06:36.450> you<00:06:36.570> don't<00:06:36.750> really<00:06:37.590> get<00:06:37.800> to<00:06:37.950> see

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
things that you don't really get to see

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.500

your<00:06:38.370> hero<00:06:38.669> in<00:06:38.850> the<00:06:39.000> novel

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510

your hero in the novel
and<00:06:39.600> I<00:06:40.440> really<00:06:41.100> think<00:06:41.280> that<00:06:41.550> like<00:06:41.820> some<00:06:42.660> of

those<00:06:42.810> themes<00:06:43.050> in<00:06:43.350> this<00:06:43.530> would<00:06:43.950> have<00:06:44.040> happened

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
those themes in this would have happened

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.120 
those themes in this would have happened
in<00:06:45.060> the<00:06:45.120> novel<00:06:45.570> that<00:06:45.780> doesn't<00:06:46.740> make<00:06:46.800> any<00:06:46.980> sense

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:47.130 
in the novel that doesn't make any sense
