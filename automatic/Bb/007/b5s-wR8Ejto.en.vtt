also hints at Cold War action which

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.289 
also hints at Cold War action which
would<00:01:25.740> make<00:01:25.920> sense<00:01:26.219> due<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.909> years<00:01:27.149> that

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
would make sense due to the years that

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.950 
would make sense due to the years that
the<00:01:27.420> game<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.750> due<00:01:27.899> to<00:01:28.020> be<00:01:28.140> setting<00:01:28.560> and
