 it<00:00:21.410> that<00:00:21.590> pig<00:00:25.030> has<00:00:26.030> to<00:00:26.210> have<00:00:26.330> some<00:00:26.600> heavy

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
 it that pig has to have some heavy

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.980 
 it that pig has to have some heavy
pins<00:00:27.110> and<00:00:27.410> I<00:00:27.440> know<00:00:27.850> power<00:00:28.850> creek<00:00:29.270> attaches<00:00:29.810> in

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
pins and I know power creek attaches in

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.550 
pins and I know power creek attaches in
some<00:00:30.170> places<00:00:30.470> aren't<00:00:30.950> quite<00:00:31.580> as<00:00:32.380> bountiful<00:00:33.380> as

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
some places aren't quite as bountiful as

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.820 
some places aren't quite as bountiful as
they<00:00:33.650> are<00:00:33.830> here<00:00:34.130> so<00:00:34.750> this<00:00:35.750> is<00:00:35.930> a<00:00:35.960> WDM<00:00:36.530> wedge

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:36.830 
they are here so this is a WDM wedge

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.510 
they are here so this is a WDM wedge
lock<00:00:37.100> coupler<00:00:37.370> as<00:00:38.270> you<00:00:38.480> can<00:00:38.600> see<00:00:39.340> if<00:00:40.340> you

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
lock coupler as you can see if you

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.340 
lock coupler as you can see if you
looked<00:00:40.700> at<00:00:40.850> the<00:00:41.390> back<00:00:41.570> of<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:41.840> bucket<00:00:41.989> there

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
looked at the back of the bucket there

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.229 
looked at the back of the bucket there
you'll<00:00:42.800> see<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.220> coupler<00:00:43.550> itself<00:00:43.850> and

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
you'll see the coupler itself and

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:53.700 
you'll see the coupler itself and
there's<00:00:44.690> that<00:00:44.900> wedge<00:00:47.620> you'll<00:00:48.620> see<00:00:48.860> it'll<00:00:49.040> move

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.840 

sometimes<00:00:54.710> you<00:00:54.890> get<00:00:54.980> a<00:00:55.039> little<00:00:55.280> sticky<00:00:55.489> for

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
sometimes you get a little sticky for

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:09.800 
sometimes you get a little sticky for
being<00:00:56.089> on<00:00:56.210> too<00:00:56.480> long<00:00:57.010> as<00:00:58.010> this<00:00:58.219> one<00:00:58.280> is<00:00:58.670> a<00:01:02.289> shake

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.250 

sometimes<00:01:10.810> they<00:01:10.990> get<00:01:11.080> a<00:01:11.140> little<00:01:11.380> stubborn

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.230 

so<00:01:14.740> as<00:01:14.860> you<00:01:15.010> can<00:01:15.130> see<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.430> wages<00:01:15.760> come<00:01:15.940> out<00:01:16.120> of

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
so as you can see the wages come out of

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.300 
so as you can see the wages come out of
the<00:01:16.300> bucket<00:01:16.600> there

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.640 

and<00:01:24.880> you<00:01:25.030> just<00:01:25.180> take<00:01:25.750> it<00:01:25.810> off<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.200> frontiers

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
and you just take it off the frontiers

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.270 
and you just take it off the frontiers
they're<00:01:26.920> so

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.160 

Thanks<00:01:32.850> wedge<00:01:33.090> goes<00:01:33.359> back<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.869> there's<00:01:34.079> a

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
Thanks wedge goes back in there's a

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.469 
Thanks wedge goes back in there's a
cylinder<00:01:34.560> there<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:35.039> move<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:36.030> couple

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
cylinder there just move it in a couple

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.580 
cylinder there just move it in a couple
of<00:01:36.630> return<00:01:36.929> Springs<00:01:37.289> to<00:01:37.500> hold<00:01:37.679> it<00:01:37.829> in

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
of return Springs to hold it in

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.899 
of return Springs to hold it in
you<00:01:40.590> see<00:01:40.829> pen<00:01:44.299> it's<00:01:45.299> pretty<00:01:45.509> straightforward

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
you see pen it's pretty straightforward

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.190 
you see pen it's pretty straightforward
the<00:01:47.909> hardest<00:01:48.240> part<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.509> just<00:01:48.689> lying<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.080> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the hardest part is just lying in the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.139 
the hardest part is just lying in the
bucket<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.590> foot<00:01:49.830> here

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
bucket on foot here

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:59.580 
bucket on foot here
dump<00:01:51.780> like<00:01:51.990> me<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.500> can't<00:01:52.710> see<00:01:52.890> your<00:01:53.039> Olaf

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:07.880 

just<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.680> matter<00:02:00.920> get<00:02:01.130> lined<00:02:01.460> up

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.330 

keeping<00:02:08.610> everything<00:02:08.850> straight

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
keeping everything straight

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.930 
keeping everything straight
you

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.420 

and<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:13.660> just<00:02:13.780> hold<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.230> curl<00:02:14.860> function<00:02:15.280> on

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
and you just hold the curl function on

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.760 
and you just hold the curl function on
your<00:02:15.640> rear<00:02:16.390> bucket<00:02:16.690> kind<00:02:17.140> of<00:02:17.230> power<00:02:17.440> that

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
your rear bucket kind of power that

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.080 
your rear bucket kind of power that
circuit

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
circuit

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.070 
circuit
and<00:02:20.180> give<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.690> little<00:02:20.930> shake<00:02:22.750> make<00:02:23.750> sure<00:02:23.959> it's

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
and give a little shake make sure it's

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.380 
and give a little shake make sure it's
locked<00:02:24.290> on

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
locked on

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.860 
locked on
and<00:02:26.900> it's<00:02:27.020> as<00:02:27.170> simple<00:02:27.350> as<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.860> go<00:02:28.130> from

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
and it's as simple as that to go from

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:37.780 
and it's as simple as that to go from
they<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.410> small<00:02:30.710> bucket

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.190 

and<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:39.150> should<00:02:39.330> be<00:02:39.360> able<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.629> see<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.959> side

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
and you should be able to see the side

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.380 
and you should be able to see the side
profile<00:02:40.709> there<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:42.480> coupler

just<00:02:47.680> go<00:02:47.860> right<00:02:48.070> in<00:02:48.250> these<00:02:48.340> ears<00:02:48.730> here<00:02:49.720> where

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
just go right in these ears here where

here it's pretty simple coupler design I

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.729 
here it's pretty simple coupler design I
don't<00:03:06.220> prefer<00:03:06.519> as<00:03:06.700> much<00:03:06.879> as<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.180> pin<00:03:07.360> grabbers
