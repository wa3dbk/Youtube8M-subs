00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
so what they actually did was they made

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.390 
so what they actually did was they made
the<00:01:09.900> death<00:01:10.140> penalty<00:01:10.590> when<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.770> die<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.010> only

lose up to five hundred dollars it's

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.810 
lose up to five hundred dollars it's
usually<00:01:13.500> around<00:01:13.590> 300<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.640> lot<00:01:14.790> more

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
balanced because especially you know the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.960 
balanced because especially you know the
missions<00:01:17.040> they<00:01:17.159> barely<00:01:17.369> give<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.640> any<00:01:17.790> money

one which I know a lot of people have we

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.300 
one which I know a lot of people have we
were<00:02:51.239> sort<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.540> joking<00:02:51.959> we<00:02:52.349> called<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.680> at<00:02:53.160> one

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.729 
were sort of joking we called it at one
point<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.700> cloud<00:02:54.000> watching<00:02:54.450> simulator<00:02:55.140> 2013

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
point the cloud watching simulator 2013

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.890 
point the cloud watching simulator 2013
but<00:02:56.549> it<00:02:56.670> seems<00:02:56.880> like<00:02:57.030> they<00:02:57.150> said<00:02:57.540> they<00:02:57.660> fixed

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
but it seems like they said they fixed

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.300 
but it seems like they said they fixed
an<00:02:58.110> issue<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.380> causing<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:58.920> lot<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.069> black

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
an issue that causing a lot of black

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.089 
an issue that causing a lot of black
screams<00:02:59.730> long<00:03:00.630> load<00:03:01.079> times<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.739> sort<00:03:02.040> of

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
screams long load times and sort of

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.130 
screams long load times and sort of
being<00:03:02.220> stuck<00:03:02.579> watching<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.180> clouds<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:04.049> know

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
being stuck watching the clouds you know

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.210 
being stuck watching the clouds you know
after<00:03:04.260> missions<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:04.859> stuff<00:03:04.890> so<00:03:05.100> that's

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
after missions and stuff so that's

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.099 
after missions and stuff so that's
really<00:03:05.340> awesome<00:03:05.609> they<00:03:06.420> also<00:03:06.600> added<00:03:06.959> some

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
really awesome they also added some

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:09.199 
really awesome they also added some
changes<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.769> character<00:03:08.340> creation<00:03:08.940> menu

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
changes to the character creation menu

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.460 
changes to the character creation menu
so<00:03:09.359> I<00:03:09.390> think<00:03:09.630> if<00:03:09.690> you're<00:03:09.810> a<00:03:09.840> random<00:03:10.350> they

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
so I think if you're a random they

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.630 
so I think if you're a random they
actually<00:03:10.769> made<00:03:10.859> it<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:11.010> little<00:03:11.220> bit<00:03:11.400> better<00:03:11.489> I

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
actually made it a little bit better I

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.860 
actually made it a little bit better I
guess<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.970> get<00:03:12.060> your<00:03:12.209> character<00:03:12.630> looks<00:03:12.810> a

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
guess you get your character looks a

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.840 
guess you get your character looks a
little<00:03:12.989> bit<00:03:13.140> better<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.470> they<00:03:14.340> also<00:03:14.489> added

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
little bit better and they also added

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.240 
little bit better and they also added
some<00:03:15.000> details<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.019> UI<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.290> clarify<00:03:17.010> if

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
some details and the UI to clarify if

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.770 
some details and the UI to clarify if
your<00:03:17.400> character<00:03:17.880> is<00:03:18.000> actually<00:03:18.389> not<00:03:18.480> there<00:03:18.660> if

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
your character is actually not there if

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.660 
your character is actually not there if
usually<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:19.319> temporary<00:03:20.100> character<00:03:20.489> or<00:03:20.639> if

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
usually a temporary character or if

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.650 
usually a temporary character or if
you're<00:03:20.790> actually<00:03:20.940> using<00:03:21.150> your<00:03:21.480> actual

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
you're actually using your actual

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.539 
you're actually using your actual
character<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.799> is<00:03:22.920> pretty<00:03:23.010> much<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.220> with

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
character so that is pretty much it with

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.789 
character so that is pretty much it with
this<00:03:23.730> patch<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.269> know<00:03:24.389> it<00:03:24.630> fix<00:03:25.200> me<00:03:25.410> it<00:03:25.620> mainly
