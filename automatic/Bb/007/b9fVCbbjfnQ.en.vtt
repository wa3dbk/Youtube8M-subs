00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.970
 little things and now we go to the important thing 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.419
 because my recipe today is spaghetti 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:37.489
 with salmon the ingredients that 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:41.989
 we need are smoked salmon spaghetti 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:45.050
 cut into strips cream chopped onion 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:50.480
 liquid nutmeg 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:53.239
 white wine oil and salt water 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.160
 Preparation is super simple friends of 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.200
 this delicious 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.080
 Well, I do not need to tell you these 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.910
 heights since the spaghetti we 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.200
 do with plenty of water with oil 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.670
 while they are making the spaghetti 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.790
 let's go to the sauce in a pan add 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.430
 Olive oil and chopped onion 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.930
 we mix it until it is golden and 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.450
 there we are going to add salmon and we leave some 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.030
 2 minutes or so for the sat the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.440
 salmon do not stay soft we mix it and 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.880
 from there we're going to pour white wine 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.550
 while the white wine evaporates 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.970
 that this will take around 2 minutes 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:43.160
 when we see that is added 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:46.729
 liquid cream we mix everything and we will 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.340
 throw nutmeg but yes in your 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.770
 just measure friends because if not then 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.160
 it can take on a slightly strong flavor like that 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.710
 that I watch out for nutmeg like this 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.390
 as you know to your liking 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.150
 now we are going to mix it with the 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.150
 spaghetti we mix everything we serve 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.630
 and now to serve it we add cheese 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.140
 grated and equal to spaghetti with sauce 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.140
 of salmon 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.020
 very easy true of friends and very rich and 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.960
 talking about rich this reminds me of 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.360
