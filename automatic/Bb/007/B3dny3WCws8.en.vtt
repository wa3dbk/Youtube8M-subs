00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.340 

then<00:00:43.989> you<00:00:44.110> put<00:00:44.380> it<00:00:44.470> in<00:00:44.559> like<00:00:44.770> that

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:59.840 

and<00:00:47.440> you<00:00:48.129> wait

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:12.230 

there's<00:01:00.269> that<00:01:00.510> little<00:01:00.690> thing

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:35.080 

going<00:01:13.240> really<00:01:13.510> slow<00:01:14.010> because<00:01:15.010> this

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.430 

anyway<00:01:35.840> this<00:01:36.049> thing<00:01:36.320> should<00:01:36.500> pop<00:01:36.710> up

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
anyway this thing should pop up

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.260 
anyway this thing should pop up
and<00:01:38.560> then<00:01:38.920> all<00:01:39.160> you<00:01:39.310> have<00:01:39.340> to<00:01:39.550> do<00:01:39.700> install<00:01:40.240> it

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.800 

and<00:01:43.359> this<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.310> car

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
and this is the car

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.850 
and this is the car
I<00:01:46.899> know<00:01:47.409> if<00:01:47.740> you<00:01:47.890> look<00:01:48.100> at<00:01:48.310> it<00:01:49.350> names<00:01:50.350> upside

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
I know if you look at it names upside

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.670 
I know if you look at it names upside
down<00:01:51.070> but<00:01:51.840> that's<00:01:52.840> all<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.110> have<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.380> insert

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
down but that's all you have to insert

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.899 
down but that's all you have to insert
it

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.899 

so<00:01:56.509> you<00:01:56.630> still<00:01:56.990> upside<00:01:57.229> down<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:58.549> right<00:01:58.729> way

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
so you still upside down the right way

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.209
