00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.489
 called and vader released on their 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.460
 site you find in description and see 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.220
 a point com finally the jailbreak of the 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.500
 ios 6.1 firmware also compatible with 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.530
 fourth generation iphone 5 ipad

 fifth-generation apple touch e 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.059
 also available in percent 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.739
 but let's see immediately how 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.420
 download this master program a 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.840
 bring us to our browser in this 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.480
 case safari go to the link you find 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.300
 in description that is what you see 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.759
 crush on accept we say ai 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.950
 terms of condition and click 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.229
 download at the end of the download vi 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.500
 you will find this point file of mg 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.330
 just open it to unpack it and vi 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.009
 you will find these three do what we do 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.530
 what interests us is which means that 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.540
 an application will be enough to click on two of them 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.970
 times over to open it expected 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.409
 certainly on opened and shows up 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.530
 this way this is his 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.270
 let's say good graphical interface first 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.549
 to start the jailbreak procedure 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.009
 obviously we will have to go and connect 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.110
 our device on the computer but in 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.710
 this case connect my iphone 5 to it 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.200
 with my case lightning and after having it 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.060
 inserted in the usb port also from the 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.950
 other extreme we could start 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.840
 finally the jailbreak procedure 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.720
 simply by clicking the button 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.630
 jailbreak and that we will see now will begin 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.710
 a whole installation procedure 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.939
 then your iphone 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.969
 yes let's say it will reboot you will do respring 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.950
 many times up to a certain point where 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.190
 also the application then program 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.380
 that we are using will ask us to 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.630
 go to our iphone where we will find 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.150
 let's say a new icon that 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.480
 simply a kind of application 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.030
 which is installed up 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.970
 now just click on it once for 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.799
 let's allow our program 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.349
 to conclude the installation of the 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.940
 jailbreak when the blue bar will have 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.879
 finished his journey will be enough 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.430
 press the exit button on it 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.500
 will come out to close the application 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.650
 and now let's focus on our photos 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.010
 that meanwhile a lot of will restart 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.950
 sometimes I would respring the system e 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.400
 in the meantime it will install all of the files 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.780
 and to prepare the let 's say the end of 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.760
 jailbreak 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.459
 at the end of all these revi 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.680
 finally we would find the application 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.620
 Syria will be enough to click on it the first time 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.220
 to let you prepare all the files 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.200
 system 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.359
 however, it is all the files it has 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.069
 need after the iphone restarts 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.010
 for one last time we will meet again 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.940
 finally silvia complete where will do the 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.859
 re spring and download the last ones again 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.180
 the latest update packages from 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:22.769
 silvia and the installation is completed 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.109
