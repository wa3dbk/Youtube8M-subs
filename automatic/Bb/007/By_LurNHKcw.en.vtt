00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
how I tying myself first of all I start

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.340 
how I tying myself first of all I start
the<00:00:13.590> long<00:00:14.070> scar<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:15.599> can<00:00:15.839> do<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.170> with<00:00:16.320> a

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
the long scar you can do it with a

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.650 
the long scar you can do it with a
triangular<00:00:17.130> scar<00:00:17.279> but<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:17.970> find<00:00:18.330> it's<00:00:18.510> much

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
triangular scar but I find it's much

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.189 
triangular scar but I find it's much
easier<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:19.380> do<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.949> with<00:00:20.369> us<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.420> my<00:00:21.930> hair<00:00:22.170> is

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
easier to do it with us so my hair is

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.650 
easier to do it with us so my hair is
already<00:00:22.439> covered<00:00:23.039> because<00:00:23.460> I'm<00:00:23.880> married<00:00:24.240> my

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
already covered because I'm married my

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.210 
already covered because I'm married my
hair<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:24.990> covered<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.380> can't<00:00:25.560> see<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.920> but<00:00:26.160> you

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
hair is covered you can't see it but you

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.310 
hair is covered you can't see it but you
don't<00:00:26.490> have<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.730> have<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.330> underneath<00:00:27.779> just
