the<00:01:23.970> Death<00:01:24.120> Star<00:01:24.180> yeah<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.140> know<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.410> drill

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.140 

and<00:01:30.690> in<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.650> regard<00:01:31.830> I<00:01:32.280> guess<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.790> game<00:01:32.970> does

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
and in that regard I guess the game does

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.330 
and in that regard I guess the game does
a<00:01:33.180> pretty<00:01:33.479> admirable<00:01:33.900> job<00:01:34.410> of<00:01:34.470> translating

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
a pretty admirable job of translating

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.580 
a pretty admirable job of translating
the<00:01:35.430> film<00:01:35.700> into<00:01:36.090> videogame<00:01:36.570> form<00:01:36.930> especially

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the film into videogame form especially

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.680 
the film into videogame form especially
when<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.340> many<00:01:38.460> other<00:01:38.700> movie<00:01:39.150> based<00:01:39.360> games

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
when so many other movie based games

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.330 
when so many other movie based games
from<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.110> era<00:01:40.350> just<00:01:40.800> put<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.160> main

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
from that era just put the main

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.219 
from that era just put the main
character<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:41.940> a<00:01:42.030> random<00:01:42.509> side-scrolling

environment without much regard to

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.390 
environment without much regard to
storyline<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.619> gotta<00:01:46.890> say<00:01:47.190> I<00:01:47.220> was

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
storyline but I gotta say I was

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.160 
storyline but I gotta say I was
definitely<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> bit<00:01:48.270> disappointed<00:01:48.990> at<00:01:49.140> the
