so<00:02:12.640> again<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.450> Montauk<00:02:13.840> Monster<00:02:13.870> is<00:02:14.380> not

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
so again the Montauk Monster is not

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.190 
so again the Montauk Monster is not
officially<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.280> cryptid<00:02:15.790> monster<00:02:16.630> it's<00:02:16.870> just<00:02:17.080> a

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
officially a cryptid monster it's just a

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.100 
officially a cryptid monster it's just a
raccoon<00:02:17.730> but<00:02:18.730> again<00:02:18.970> what<00:02:19.240> classifies<00:02:19.780> it

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
raccoon but again what classifies it

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.140 
raccoon but again what classifies it
within<00:02:20.319> my<00:02:20.530> youtube<00:02:20.890> channel<00:02:20.920> mainly<00:02:21.819> is<00:02:21.970> the

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
within my youtube channel mainly is the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.830 
within my youtube channel mainly is the
area<00:02:22.600> associated<00:02:22.990> around<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:24.450> Montauk<00:02:25.480> as<00:02:25.720> I

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
area associated around it Montauk as I

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.050 
area associated around it Montauk as I
mentioned<00:02:26.170> earlier<00:02:26.290> has<00:02:26.680> two<00:02:27.060> distinctive

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
mentioned earlier has two distinctive

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.809 
mentioned earlier has two distinctive
departments<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.930> are<00:02:29.350> again<00:02:29.950> infamous<00:02:30.430> for

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
departments that are again infamous for

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.390 
departments that are again infamous for
a<00:02:31.030> lot<00:02:31.720> of<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.080> super-secret<00:02:32.590> projects

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
a lot of the super-secret projects

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.890 
a lot of the super-secret projects
around<00:02:33.489> there<00:02:33.790> one<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.030> them<00:02:34.150> is<00:02:34.330> called<00:02:34.569> the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
around there one of them is called the

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.190 
around there one of them is called the
Plum<00:02:35.500> Island<00:02:35.739> Animal<00:02:36.489> Disease<00:02:36.520> Center<00:02:37.200> which

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
Plum Island Animal Disease Center which

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.260 
Plum Island Animal Disease Center which
you'll<00:02:38.380> see<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.560> picture<00:02:38.830> of<00:02:38.950> here

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
you'll see a picture of here

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.010 
you'll see a picture of here
this<00:02:40.600> place<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:41.140> infamous<00:02:41.650> because<00:02:42.480> it's<00:02:43.480> when

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
this place is infamous because it's when

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.890 
this place is infamous because it's when
I<00:02:44.050> was<00:02:44.230> first<00:02:44.350> created<00:02:44.680> its<00:02:45.430> goal<00:02:46.060> or<00:02:46.480> at<00:02:46.750> least

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
I was first created its goal or at least

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.990 
I was first created its goal or at least
a<00:02:46.989> goal<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:47.260> presented<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:47.830> public<00:02:48.310> was

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
a goal it presented to the public was

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.420 
a goal it presented to the public was
that<00:02:49.239> it's<00:02:49.510> gonna<00:02:49.660> be<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:49.870> place<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.680> create<00:02:50.980> and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
that it's gonna be a place to create and

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.449 
that it's gonna be a place to create and
protect<00:02:52.080> livestock<00:02:53.080> from<00:02:53.560> animal<00:02:53.950> diseases

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
protect livestock from animal diseases

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.140 
protect livestock from animal diseases
and<00:02:54.820> so<00:02:55.709> it<00:02:56.709> would<00:02:56.890> involve<00:02:57.340> experiments<00:02:58.030> to

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
and so it would involve experiments to

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.030 
and so it would involve experiments to
make<00:02:58.300> sure<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.780> anything<00:02:59.500> that<00:02:59.709> could<00:02:59.920> in

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
make sure that anything that could in

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.830 
make sure that anything that could in
fact<00:03:00.069> or<00:03:00.610> caused<00:03:00.819> harm<00:03:01.120> to<00:03:01.180> animals

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
fact or caused harm to animals

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.870 
fact or caused harm to animals
well<00:03:02.739> I'm<00:03:02.830> thinking<00:03:03.100> I'll<00:03:03.190> find<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.610> cure<00:03:03.819> for

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
well I'm thinking I'll find the cure for

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.979 
well I'm thinking I'll find the cure for
it<00:03:04.120> they'll<00:03:04.269> find<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.510> cure<00:03:04.630> for<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.840> disease

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
it they'll find the cure for the disease

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.559 
it they'll find the cure for the disease
and<00:03:05.350> that'll<00:03:06.130> solve<00:03:06.310> them<00:03:06.519> but<00:03:07.300> what<00:03:07.450> had

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
and that'll solve them but what had

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.320 
and that'll solve them but what had
happened<00:03:07.600> was<00:03:08.040> during<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.130> Cold<00:03:09.400> War<00:03:09.519> era<00:03:09.760> and

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
happened was during the Cold War era and

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.330 
happened was during the Cold War era and
going<00:03:10.569> forward<00:03:10.840> maybe<00:03:11.230> even<00:03:11.530> up<00:03:11.650> till<00:03:11.800> today<00:03:11.950> a

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
going forward maybe even up till today a

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.540 
going forward maybe even up till today a
lot<00:03:13.330> of<00:03:13.360> biological<00:03:14.140> weapons<00:03:14.319> are<00:03:15.010> actually

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
lot of biological weapons are actually

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.880 
lot of biological weapons are actually
developed<00:03:16.060> in<00:03:16.239> this<00:03:16.450> place<00:03:16.750> when<00:03:17.709> by

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
developed in this place when by

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.310 
developed in this place when by
biological<00:03:18.459> weapons<00:03:18.760> I<00:03:18.910> mean<00:03:19.120> like<00:03:19.600> super

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
biological weapons I mean like super

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.150 
biological weapons I mean like super
viruses<00:03:21.930> so<00:03:22.930> that<00:03:23.079> kind<00:03:23.290> of<00:03:23.350> stuff<00:03:23.620> that<00:03:24.010> would

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
viruses so that kind of stuff that would

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.240 
viruses so that kind of stuff that would
wipe<00:03:24.400> out<00:03:24.579> entire<00:03:24.640> cities<00:03:25.570> if<00:03:25.930> countries<00:03:26.590> are

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
wipe out entire cities if countries are

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.490 
wipe out entire cities if countries are
just<00:03:27.489> being<00:03:27.700> developed<00:03:28.090> there<00:03:28.329> either<00:03:29.019> to

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
just being developed there either to

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.890 
just being developed there either to
test<00:03:30.010> out<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.459> make<00:03:30.640> sure<00:03:30.670> that<00:03:31.060> something

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
test out to make sure that something

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.449 
test out to make sure that something
like<00:03:32.079> that<00:03:32.290> does<00:03:32.500> happen<00:03:32.920> then<00:03:33.220> there's<00:03:33.400> a

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
like that does happen then there's a

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.080 
like that does happen then there's a
cure<00:03:33.760> or<00:03:34.180> as<00:03:34.870> a<00:03:34.900> form<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.260> attack<00:03:35.910> again<00:03:36.910> you

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
cure or as a form of attack again you

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.060 
cure or as a form of attack again you
know<00:03:37.180> this<00:03:37.360> is<00:03:37.570> all<00:03:37.750> just<00:03:38.410> me<00:03:38.560> talking<00:03:38.980> on

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
know this is all just me talking on

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.890 
know this is all just me talking on
there<00:03:39.310> but<00:03:39.549> thinking<00:03:40.180> based<00:03:40.360> on<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.570> research

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
there but thinking based on the research

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.630 
there but thinking based on the research
and<00:03:41.350> the<00:03:41.590> stuff<00:03:41.829> I've<00:03:42.010> looked<00:03:42.220> up<00:03:42.340> on<00:03:42.519> this

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
and the stuff I've looked up on this

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.699 
and the stuff I've looked up on this
place<00:03:42.910> that's<00:03:43.720> what<00:03:43.930> it's<00:03:44.049> known<00:03:44.200> for<00:03:44.500> at

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
place that's what it's known for at

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.430 
place that's what it's known for at
least<00:03:44.920> when<00:03:45.130> it<00:03:45.250> comes<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.609> the<00:03:45.870> outer<00:03:46.870> circles

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
least when it comes to the outer circles

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.800 
least when it comes to the outer circles
of<00:03:47.680> people<00:03:48.400> out<00:03:48.730> there<00:03:48.760> who<00:03:49.269> are<00:03:49.390> into<00:03:49.690> that

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
of people out there who are into that

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.660 
of people out there who are into that
kind<00:03:49.870> of<00:03:50.200> stuff<00:03:50.470> when<00:03:50.920> it<00:03:51.040> comes<00:03:51.250> to<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.579> black

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
kind of stuff when it comes to the black

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.180 
kind of stuff when it comes to the black
helicopters<00:03:51.970> and<00:03:52.690> super-secret<00:03:53.650> governments

and<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.989> way<00:03:56.109> that<00:03:56.320> this<00:03:56.470> Montauk<00:03:56.859> Monster

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
and the way that this Montauk Monster

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.220 
and the way that this Montauk Monster
was<00:03:57.130> found<00:03:57.459> was<00:03:57.640> actually<00:03:57.760> it<00:03:58.660> was<00:03:58.720> found<00:03:58.989> on<00:03:59.170> a

to it but long story short when they
came<00:05:16.480> to<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:16.750> Philadelphia<00:05:17.260> Experiment<00:05:17.680> it

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
came to the Philadelphia Experiment it

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.310 
came to the Philadelphia Experiment it
was<00:05:18.610> essentially<00:05:19.030> a<00:05:19.210> bunch<00:05:19.450> of<00:05:19.600> scientists

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
was essentially a bunch of scientists

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.470 
was essentially a bunch of scientists
working<00:05:20.710> together<00:05:21.070> to<00:05:21.850> try<00:05:22.000> to<00:05:22.060> develop

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
working together to try to develop

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.410 
working together to try to develop
something<00:05:22.720> that<00:05:22.900> could<00:05:23.340> potentially<00:05:24.340> go<00:05:24.940> in

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 
something that could potentially go in

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.720 
something that could potentially go in
time<00:05:25.690> either<00:05:26.380> forward<00:05:26.860> or<00:05:26.980> backwards<00:05:27.370> in<00:05:27.520> time

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
time either forward or backwards in time

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.660 
time either forward or backwards in time
and<00:05:27.790> they<00:05:28.630> tested<00:05:29.050> it<00:05:29.200> on<00:05:29.410> a<00:05:29.770> naval<00:05:30.130> ship<00:05:30.160> with

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
and they tested it on a naval ship with

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.970 
and they tested it on a naval ship with
some<00:05:30.910> actual<00:05:31.230> naval<00:05:32.230> officers<00:05:32.620> on<00:05:32.740> there<00:05:32.890> and

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
some actual naval officers on there and

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.510 
some actual naval officers on there and
it<00:05:33.100> worked

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
it worked

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.630 
it worked
it<00:05:33.880> went<00:05:34.060> back<00:05:34.180> in<00:05:34.330> time<00:05:34.510> but<00:05:35.130> with<00:05:36.130> disastrous

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
it went back in time but with disastrous

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.060 
it went back in time but with disastrous
results<00:05:37.210> because<00:05:37.750> when<00:05:37.930> the<00:05:38.110> naval<00:05:38.650> ship<00:05:38.860> came

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
results because when the naval ship came

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.500 
results because when the naval ship came
back<00:05:39.540> people<00:05:40.540> that<00:05:40.900> came<00:05:41.410> back<00:05:41.620> with<00:05:41.920> it<00:05:41.950> or

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
back people that came back with it or

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.810 
back people that came back with it or
either<00:05:43.510> welded<00:05:44.050> to<00:05:44.230> the<00:05:44.260> ship<00:05:44.620> or<00:05:44.860> lost

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
either welded to the ship or lost

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.440 
either welded to the ship or lost
altogether<00:05:46.150> and<00:05:46.930> so<00:05:47.310> again<00:05:48.310> I<00:05:48.940> may<00:05:49.210> just

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
altogether and so again I may just

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.940 
altogether and so again I may just
create<00:05:49.600> a<00:05:49.720> video<00:05:49.870> for<00:05:50.020> this<00:05:50.350> because<00:05:50.740> there's

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:50.950 
create a video for this because there's

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:52.620 
create a video for this because there's
a<00:05:51.040> lot<00:05:51.070> of<00:05:51.250> stuff<00:05:51.550> associated<00:05:51.880> with<00:05:52.330> this

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
a lot of stuff associated with this

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.040 
a lot of stuff associated with this
place

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
place

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.530 
place
and<00:05:53.830> again<00:05:54.100> it's<00:05:54.250> nearby<00:05:54.490> the<00:05:54.640> area<00:05:55.120> where<00:05:55.390> the

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
and again it's nearby the area where the

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.240 
and again it's nearby the area where the
Montauk<00:05:55.930> Monster<00:05:56.320> was<00:05:56.350> found<00:05:56.710> which<00:05:56.980> again

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
Montauk Monster was found which again

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.100 
Montauk Monster was found which again
many<00:05:57.790> people<00:05:57.880> think<00:05:58.330> oh<00:05:58.450> my<00:05:58.600> goodness<00:05:58.900> now<00:05:59.050> we

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
many people think oh my goodness now we

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.200 
many people think oh my goodness now we
have<00:05:59.380> Plum<00:06:00.040> Island<00:06:00.190> and<00:06:00.640> then<00:06:00.730> we've<00:06:00.910> got<00:06:01.060> the

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
have Plum Island and then we've got the

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.900 
have Plum Island and then we've got the
Montauk<00:06:01.600> Project<00:06:02.100> and<00:06:03.100> that's<00:06:03.370> all<00:06:03.490> creating

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
Montauk Project and that's all creating

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.180 
Montauk Project and that's all creating
