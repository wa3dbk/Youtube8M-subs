it's pretty good and a whopping 30 grams
of<00:01:13.799> protein<00:01:14.090> now<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.479> muscletech<00:01:16.229> they<00:01:16.619> do

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
of protein now it is muscletech they do

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.700 
of protein now it is muscletech they do
put<00:01:17.070> some<00:01:17.540> honestly<00:01:18.540> do<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.530> honestly

put some honestly do you do you honestly
think<00:01:19.950> muscletech<00:01:20.670> puts<00:01:20.939> poor<00:01:21.330> ingredients

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.399 
alanine lysene and taurine and of course
they<00:01:58.920> put<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> hundred<00:01:59.670> milligrams<00:02:00.180> of

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
they put a hundred milligrams of

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.929 
they put a hundred milligrams of
digestive<00:02:01.409> enzymes<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.100> here<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.759> can

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
digestive enzymes in here so you can

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.969 
digestive enzymes in here so you can
digest<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.869> can<00:02:04.020> break<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.500> down<00:02:04.649> and

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
digest it you can break it down and

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.610 
digest it you can break it down and
assimilate<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.149> much

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
assimilate it that much

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.760 
assimilate it that much
easier<00:02:06.980> now<00:02:07.640> price-wise<00:02:08.290> you<00:02:09.290> know<00:02:09.380> it's<00:02:09.590> a

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
easier now price-wise you know it's a

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.250 
easier now price-wise you know it's a
little<00:02:10.070> higher<00:02:10.520> than<00:02:10.880> your<00:02:10.910> normal<00:02:11.300> bucket<00:02:12.170> of

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
little higher than your normal bucket of

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.470 
little higher than your normal bucket of
protein<00:02:12.680> okay<00:02:13.010> two<00:02:13.640> pounds<00:02:14.180> you're<00:02:14.270> looking

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
protein okay two pounds you're looking

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.020 
protein okay two pounds you're looking
at<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.720> very<00:02:15.020> low<00:02:15.320> thirty<00:02:15.860> dollar<00:02:16.190> range<00:02:16.520> the

four pounder you're looking at about the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.980 
four pounder you're looking at about the
mid-50s<00:02:20.090> towards<00:02:20.990> the<00:02:21.230> 60s<00:02:21.860> so<00:02:22.460> price-wise

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
mid-50s towards the 60s so price-wise

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.530 
mid-50s towards the 60s so price-wise
again<00:02:23.990> not<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.700> greatest<00:02:25.700> price<00:02:26.120> but<00:02:26.420> it's

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
again not the greatest price but it's

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.390 
again not the greatest price but it's
not<00:02:26.720> it's<00:02:27.020> not<00:02:27.260> outlet<00:02:27.800> we<00:02:28.100> have<00:02:28.190> a<00:02:28.250> lot<00:02:28.370> of

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
not it's not outlet we have a lot of

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.210 
not it's not outlet we have a lot of
proteins<00:02:28.880> that<00:02:29.330> are<00:02:29.410> very<00:02:30.410> expensive<00:02:30.770> and

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
proteins that are very expensive and

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.250 
proteins that are very expensive and
we've<00:02:31.820> got<00:02:32.000> some<00:02:32.180> proof<00:02:32.360> proteins<00:02:32.990> that<00:02:33.200> are

we've got some proof proteins that are

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.200 
we've got some proof proteins that are
really<00:02:33.980> cheap<00:02:34.220> this<00:02:34.460> is<00:02:34.610> probably<00:02:34.820> about<00:02:34.940> the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
really cheap this is probably about the

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.330 
really cheap this is probably about the
