 Hello everyone from Turin 58 evening we see 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:21.980
 how to make the filling for tigelle ie 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.260
 it is the minced bacon and rosemary 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.330
 let's go immediately to see the ingredients 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:32.380
 which are few and the necessary tools 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:37.970

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:50.510
 flavoring a little more we study the 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:52.690

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.860
 we have got inside 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.690
 so let's do a two or three times why 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.200
 otherwise it is not good to proceed 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.200
 a bit of a mistake 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:28.040
