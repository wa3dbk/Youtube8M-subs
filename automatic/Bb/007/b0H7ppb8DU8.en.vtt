ethics according to a subjective view

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.470 
ethics according to a subjective view
there<00:00:28.860> are<00:00:28.950> no<00:00:29.070> facts<00:00:29.430> of<00:00:29.610> the<00:00:29.730> matter<00:00:29.939> about

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
there are no facts of the matter about

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.020 
there are no facts of the matter about
ethical<00:00:31.110> questions<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.369> for<00:00:32.489> example<00:00:32.940> if

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
ethical questions so for example if

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.240 
ethical questions so for example if
someone<00:00:33.360> says<00:00:33.630> euthanasia<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.680> right<00:00:34.920> and

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
someone says euthanasia is right and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.030 
someone says euthanasia is right and
someone<00:00:35.520> else<00:00:35.700> says<00:00:35.910> euthanasia<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.690> wrong

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
someone else says euthanasia is wrong

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.290 
someone else says euthanasia is wrong
ultimately<00:00:38.040> that's<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.370> matter<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.610> subjective

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
ultimately that's a matter of subjective

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.549 
ultimately that's a matter of subjective
taste<00:00:39.630> not<00:00:40.320> scientific<00:00:40.980> fact<00:00:41.510> so<00:00:42.510> if<00:00:43.140> that's

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
taste not scientific fact so if that's

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.669 
taste not scientific fact so if that's
the<00:00:43.739> case<00:00:44.300> why<00:00:45.300> do<00:00:45.360> people<00:00:45.809> think<00:00:46.260> that

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:46.679 
the case why do people think that

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.470 
the case why do people think that
they're<00:00:46.920> having<00:00:47.039> disagreements<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.359> be

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
they're having disagreements that can be

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.380 
they're having disagreements that can be
resolved<00:00:48.899> by<00:00:48.960> argument<00:00:49.620> after<00:00:49.920> all<00:00:50.339> if<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.089> say

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
resolved by argument after all if I say

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.009 
resolved by argument after all if I say
chocolate<00:00:52.140> ice<00:00:52.469> creams<00:00:52.829> nice<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.089> say<00:00:54.329> no

chocolate ice creams nice and you say no

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.810 
chocolate ice creams nice and you say no

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
it isn't there's nothing more to be

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.700 
it isn't there's nothing more to be
discussed<00:00:57.300> because<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.170> acknowledge<00:00:58.679> that

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
discussed because we acknowledge that

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.889 
discussed because we acknowledge that
each<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.159> us<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.579> expressing<00:01:00.120> our<00:01:00.269> tastes<00:01:00.570> and

there's no further facts that matter one
of<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.690> strongest<00:01:04.110> arguments<00:01:04.530> for<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.949> the

of the strongest arguments for the the

subject of view which in part responds

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.500 
subject of view which in part responds
to<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.500> objection<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:09.060> fact<00:01:09.300> that

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
to that objection is the fact that

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.120 
to that objection is the fact that
different<00:01:09.720> communities<00:01:10.320> around<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.100> world

at different periods of time have held

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.010 
at different periods of time have held
widely<00:01:13.800> divergent<00:01:14.490> ethical<00:01:14.880> views<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.840> some

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
widely divergent ethical views so some

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.110 
widely divergent ethical views so some
people<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.320> thought<00:01:16.500> for<00:01:16.770> example<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.760> OK

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
people have thought for example it's OK

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.630 
people have thought for example it's OK
to<00:01:18.150> perform<00:01:18.660> honor<00:01:18.900> killing<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:20.130> young<00:01:20.370> girls

other communities find that to be an

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.770 
other communities find that to be an
abhorrent<00:01:25.640> thing<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:26.940> and<00:01:27.300> you<00:01:27.510> can<00:01:27.630> think

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
abhorrent thing to do and you can think

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.540 
abhorrent thing to do and you can think
of<00:01:27.840> many<00:01:27.900> many<00:01:28.140> examples<00:01:28.320> like<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.280> a

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
of many many examples like that a

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.220 
of many many examples like that a
natural<00:01:30.060> response<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.600> say<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.780> that

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
natural response to say to that

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.470 
natural response to say to that
that<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> subjective<00:01:32.340> view<00:01:32.670> gives<00:01:32.940> us<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.300> say

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
that the subjective view gives us to say

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.090 
that the subjective view gives us to say
that's<00:01:33.990> because<00:01:34.140> there's<00:01:34.440> no<00:01:34.590> fact<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.010> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
that's because there's no fact of the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.100 
that's because there's no fact of the
matter<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.730> first<00:01:35.910> place<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.900> bit

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
matter in the first place it's a bit

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.080 
matter in the first place it's a bit
like<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.920> preference<00:01:38.400> for<00:01:38.610> chocolate<00:01:38.970> ice

round to their moral point of view so if

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.399 
round to their moral point of view so if
we<00:02:42.629> think<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:43.099> the<00:02:44.299> abolitionist<00:02:45.299> movement<00:02:45.409> or

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
we think of the abolitionist movement or

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.280 
we think of the abolitionist movement or
the<00:02:47.180> campaign<00:02:48.180> for<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.540> emancipation<00:02:49.200> of

women in both cases a large part of

women in both cases a large part of
their<00:02:52.950> methods<00:02:53.519> were<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.810> rational

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
their methods were the rational

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.530 
their methods were the rational
persuasion<00:02:55.889> of<00:02:56.430> other<00:02:56.639> people<00:02:57.150> through

persuasion of other people through

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.830 
persuasion of other people through
argument<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:58.920> how<00:02:59.189> do<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.459> explain<00:02:59.849> what's

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
argument so how do you explain what's

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.509 
argument so how do you explain what's
going<00:03:00.989> on<00:03:01.379> in<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:01.709> process<00:03:01.950> from<00:03:02.400> a

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
going on in that process from a

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.099 
going on in that process from a
subjectivist<00:03:03.060> point<00:03:03.359> of<00:03:03.480> view<00:03:03.629> it's

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
subjectivist point of view it's

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.830 
subjectivist point of view it's
certainly<00:03:04.650> true<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.299> from<00:03:06.299> a<00:03:06.329> subjective

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
certainly true that from a subjective

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.020 
certainly true that from a subjective
point<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.139> view<00:03:07.519> it's<00:03:08.519> a<00:03:08.669> little<00:03:08.909> bit

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
point of view it's a little bit

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.729 
point of view it's a little bit
difficult<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.569> account<00:03:09.870> for<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.260> idea<00:03:10.590> that

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
difficult to account for the idea that

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.129 
difficult to account for the idea that
we've<00:03:10.829> made<00:03:11.040> moral<00:03:11.370> progress<00:03:11.669> for<00:03:12.299> example<00:03:12.780> so

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
we've made moral progress for example so

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.050 
we've made moral progress for example so
we<00:03:13.409> all<00:03:13.530> we<00:03:13.739> all<00:03:13.859> tend<00:03:14.069> to<00:03:14.159> believe<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.489> we

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
we all we all tend to believe that we

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.580 
we all we all tend to believe that we
have<00:03:15.209> made<00:03:15.389> moral<00:03:15.719> progress<00:03:15.959> we've<00:03:16.349> moved

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
have made moral progress we've moved

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.159 
have made moral progress we've moved
from<00:03:16.769> you<00:03:17.280> know<00:03:17.340> times<00:03:17.609> when<00:03:17.849> slavery<00:03:18.180> was<00:03:18.419> was

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
from you know times when slavery was was

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.589 
from you know times when slavery was was
dominant<00:03:19.560> its<00:03:20.340> abolition<00:03:20.669> say<00:03:21.150> over<00:03:21.389> a<00:03:21.450> few

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
dominant its abolition say over a few

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.390 
dominant its abolition say over a few
hundred<00:03:21.750> period<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.709> few<00:03:22.739> hundred<00:03:23.219> years

hundred period of a few hundred years
and<00:03:23.669> that<00:03:23.790> clearly<00:03:24.150> seems<00:03:24.510> to<00:03:24.659> be<00:03:24.780> progress

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
and that clearly seems to be progress

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.699 
and that clearly seems to be progress
but<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.950> subject<00:03:26.549> of<00:03:26.700> this<00:03:26.849> will<00:03:27.060> say<00:03:27.299> that<00:03:28.139> it

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
but a subject of this will say that it

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.879 
but a subject of this will say that it
doesn't<00:03:29.010> follow<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:30.359> we've<00:03:31.079> learnt<00:03:31.650> the

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
doesn't follow that we've learnt the

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
world like slavery is wrong where we

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.819 
world like slavery is wrong where we
used<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.209> think<00:03:36.389> slavery<00:03:36.930> was<00:03:37.049> okay

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
used to think slavery was okay

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.219 
used to think slavery was okay
rather<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.909> subjectivist<00:03:39.629> will<00:03:39.810> try<00:03:40.079> and

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:40.229 
rather a subjectivist will try and

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.439 
rather a subjectivist will try and
account<00:03:40.590> for<00:03:40.709> our<00:03:41.040> sense<00:03:41.609> of<00:03:41.849> moral<00:03:42.150> progress

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
account for our sense of moral progress

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:46.189 
account for our sense of moral progress
without<00:03:43.939> appealing<00:03:44.939> to<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.150> idea<00:03:45.569> that<00:03:46.049> it

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199 
without appealing to the idea that it

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:48.289 
without appealing to the idea that it
involved<00:03:46.680> apprehending<00:03:47.549> the<00:03:47.669> truth<00:03:47.939> about

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
involved apprehending the truth about

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.039 
involved apprehending the truth about
objective<00:03:48.900> moral<00:03:49.169> facts<00:03:50.750> yeah<00:03:51.750> that's

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
objective moral facts yeah that's

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.179 
objective moral facts yeah that's
interesting<00:03:52.229> I'm<00:03:52.709> not<00:03:53.699> yet<00:03:53.970> persuaded<00:03:54.209> that

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:55.189 
interesting I'm not yet persuaded that

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:58.610 
interesting I'm not yet persuaded that
we<00:03:56.189> have<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:56.430> reason<00:03:56.879> to<00:03:56.909> deny<00:03:57.180> that<00:03:57.720> there<00:03:58.500> are

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
we have a reason to deny that there are

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.370 
we have a reason to deny that there are
ethical<00:03:58.769> truths
