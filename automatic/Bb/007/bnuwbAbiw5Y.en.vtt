review and today I will show you how to
make<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.629> duplication<00:00:04.049> machine<00:00:04.529> for<00:00:04.710> my

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
make the duplication machine for my

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:05.900 
make the duplication machine for my
graph<00:00:05.040> and<00:00:05.069> point<00:00:05.339> eight<00:00:05.430> points<00:00:05.700> have<00:00:05.790> any

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
graph and point eight points have any

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.909 
graph and point eight points have any
multiplayer<00:00:06.180> duplication<00:00:06.839> glitch<00:00:06.870> so<00:00:07.830> I'll

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
multiplayer duplication glitch so I'll

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:08.509 
multiplayer duplication glitch so I'll
get<00:00:08.069> right<00:00:08.130> into<00:00:08.280> it

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
get right into it

going<00:01:15.390> done<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> repeater<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.759> there<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.850> go

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
going done a repeater and there you go

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.760 
going done a repeater and there you go
you<00:01:18.030> made<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.420> now<00:01:18.930> what<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.200> want<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> do<00:01:19.530> is
