cannon<00:00:20.400> up<00:00:20.820> one<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.300> was<00:00:21.779> able<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.199> upgrade<00:00:22.680> it

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
cannon up one I was able to upgrade it

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.099 
cannon up one I was able to upgrade it
with<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.010> gems<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.430> had<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.939> I've<00:00:24.510> tested<00:00:24.990> it

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
with the gems I had and I've tested it

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.679 
with the gems I had and I've tested it
out<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.740> huge<00:00:26.279> improvement<00:00:26.699> for<00:00:27.300> armor

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
out it is a huge improvement for armor

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.120 
out it is a huge improvement for armor
users<00:00:28.080> let's<00:00:28.410> break<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.189> out<00:00:29.250> ooh

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
users let's break it out ooh

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.700 
users let's break it out ooh
so<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.369> looks<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.730> same<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:35.570> the<00:00:36.570> upgrade<00:00:37.079> it

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
so it looks the same and the upgrade it

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.490 
so it looks the same and the upgrade it
doesn't<00:00:38.219> make<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.790> look<00:00:39.059> different<00:00:39.360> at<00:00:39.690> all<00:00:39.840> as

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
doesn't make it look different at all as

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.889 
doesn't make it look different at all as
you<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.739> see<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.280> took<00:00:41.489> me<00:00:41.670> really<00:00:42.059> short<00:00:42.719> to
