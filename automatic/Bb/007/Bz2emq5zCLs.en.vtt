00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.020 
very well it was 13 and a half inches
penetration<00:04:30.570> now<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:32.070> round<00:04:32.250> did<00:04:32.490> come<00:04:32.700> apart

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
penetration now the round did come apart

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.330 
penetration now the round did come apart
as<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.420> was<00:04:33.540> going<00:04:33.840> through<00:04:34.020> I<00:04:34.320> think<00:04:35.160> they're

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
as it was going through I think they're

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.830 
as it was going through I think they're
using<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.790> velocity<00:04:35.940> to<00:04:36.540> get<00:04:36.690> their

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
using the velocity to get their

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.200 
using the velocity to get their
penetration<00:04:37.460> obviously<00:04:38.460> it's<00:04:38.610> not<00:04:38.700> a<00:04:38.760> bonded

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
penetration obviously it's not a bonded

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.540 
the lead and I showed you guys that hole
wound<00:04:51.960> track<00:04:52.320> and<00:04:52.590> how<00:04:52.740> it<00:04:52.950> just<00:04:53.190> started

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
wound track and how it just started

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.000 
wound track and how it just started
coming<00:04:53.670> apart<00:04:53.880> going<00:04:54.300> down<00:04:54.650> but<00:04:55.650> it<00:04:55.740> did<00:04:55.860> its

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
coming apart going down but it did its

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.770 
coming apart going down but it did its
job<00:04:56.070> it<00:04:56.370> got<00:04:56.490> to<00:04:56.640> 13<00:04:57.030> and<00:04:57.210> a<00:04:57.240> half<00:04:57.390> inches

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
job it got to 13 and a half inches

job it got to 13 and a half inches
penetration<00:04:58.760> you<00:04:59.760> know<00:04:59.880> they<00:05:00.000> want<00:05:00.210> 15<00:05:00.690> 13<00:05:01.530> and

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
penetration you know they want 15 13 and

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.530 
penetration you know they want 15 13 and
a<00:05:01.770> half<00:05:01.800> we're<00:05:02.580> right<00:05:02.730> on<00:05:02.760> the<00:05:03.030> line<00:05:03.210> there<00:05:03.510> I

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
a half we're right on the line there I

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.600 
a half we're right on the line there I
mean<00:05:03.840> that's<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.440> good<00:05:04.740> penetration<00:05:05.430> the

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
mean that's the good penetration the

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.580 
mean that's the good penetration the
shock<00:05:05.940> wave<00:05:06.240> when<00:05:06.570> this<00:05:06.750> hit<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.050> gel<00:05:07.320> you

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
shock wave when this hit the gel you

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.940 
shock wave when this hit the gel you
guys<00:05:08.220> seen<00:05:08.520> that<00:05:08.700> gel<00:05:09.060> come<00:05:09.300> up<00:05:09.680> massive<00:05:10.680> wound

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
guys seen that gel come up massive wound

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.580 
guys seen that gel come up massive wound
track<00:05:11.280> very<00:05:11.730> massive<00:05:12.120> wound<00:05:12.540> track<00:05:12.900> they<00:05:13.530> do

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
track very massive wound track they do

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.840 
track very massive wound track they do
make<00:05:13.890> their<00:05:14.070> own<00:05:15.500> hollow<00:05:16.500> points<00:05:16.980> at<00:05:17.550> core

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
make their own hollow points at core

make their own hollow points at core
bond<00:05:18.030> now<00:05:18.410> they<00:05:19.410> still<00:05:19.680> use<00:05:19.920> Starline<00:05:20.400> brass

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
bond now they still use Starline brass
