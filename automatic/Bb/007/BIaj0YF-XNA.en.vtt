00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:07.800
 hello you love today I want you 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.730
 to tell something about the film with one 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.730
 digital SLR camera 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.450
 the autofocus on a digital 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.310
 SLR camera is not so 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.750
 necessarily the bringer so you have to 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.320
 almost always manually 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.850
 focus because otherwise a 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.080
 common annoying is bound and for 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.730
 People may not be that good 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.800
 can look at this little display 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.199
 not so much to see everything 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.690
 there is the notepad that you look at 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.950
 picture stand can enlarge there is 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.710
 but still a better option 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:46.800
 nowadays a display group 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.620
 That's a little gap here 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.200
 fixed on the display and had one 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.180
 enlarged version of the display picture 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.700
 that is possible because this display 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.200
 Sundays are very high resolution then 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.449
 can not you because then 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.079
 see through and quite sharp 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:08.819
 put and I bought myself 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:12.090
 the itarion of the middle distance v1 

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:13.619
 universal lcd fifa basically exists 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.179
 change or what these two share 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.789
 once the says on the plate with the 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:20.249
 she is attached to the camera and the 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:23.060
 Actual luca the farmers now 

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:23.060
 just here 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:49.289
 the beak just gets down here 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:54.960
 screwed to the adapter nut if 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:57.899
 you then attached the camera tripod 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.759
 this is introduced here that there is one 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:05.610
 types of magnet that is yes then sees 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.439
 one that a camera can possibly 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.430
 still left and right and minutes 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:14.640
 out of care that it is exactly on the 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.400
 display fits and dan conner an example 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.080
 single piece and screw it firmly me 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.700
 I have no cent piece to hand I can 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:27.170
 that does not work in the water 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.170
 but now with the camera and filming 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.130
 one can put on the live mode here 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.090
 by amt and has the whole picture in 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.109
 two and a half driver increase 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.090
 that means I can do a lot now 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:45.859
 Better judging the picture is sharp 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.480
 or not and that is a good thing 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:51.060
 if you are still set on 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.780
 you can watch his display 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.780
 fold 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:02.420
 the only thing that I consider a shortcoming 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.420
 Watch this screw here 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.810
 because it hides the steering wheel 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.640
 the developer does not have that 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.770
 thought that he was very happy with this 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.600
 big screw here this sets 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:24.480
 hidden but you get it set 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.780
 if you are not so fat finger 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.460
 has and therefore you can find 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.720
 there lift out the screw and fekters 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.120
 would still hold but me 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.040
 could bring it too and so for 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.880
 all the people are not that good 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.710
 is that a real help for the 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.840
 show position 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.990
 that brings already the amount and in the 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.830
 anna contrast to lure the masses on 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.850
 the display sticks on it resp 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.100
 somehow with clips or rubber band 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:57.750
 this is fixed by the processing 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:04.890
 forth quite massive would continue old 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:07.370
 These were already stuck a bit and 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.370
 is not that expensive 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:19.620
 So if you try this 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:23.330
 are italy display th hyphen 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.380
 prevent universal city view 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.510
 is available at amazon 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.250
 I paid less than 50 euros for it 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.930
 You can be sure of her 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.090
 sell does not get along 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.419
 a second easy magnification and me 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.570
 It may differ from its stability and design 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.039
 definitely recommend it if you like it 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.350
 I would be happy if mine 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.330
 channel subscribed to or a 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.199
 Write comment and otherwise with 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.199
 your nice day
