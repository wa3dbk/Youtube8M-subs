you plant the nuke if thrown all the way
back<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.219> beginning<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.780> long

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
back to the beginning it's just so long

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.069 
back to the beginning it's just so long
and<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:56.100> set<00:00:56.309> third<00:00:56.730> one<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.120> escape<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.899> foot

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and the set third one is escape the foot

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.069 
and the set third one is escape the foot
escape<00:00:58.620> first<00:00:58.859> time<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.879> xscape<00:01:00.300> distinction

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
escape first time so xscape distinction

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.959 
escape first time so xscape distinction
first<00:01:01.260> time<00:01:01.530> I've<00:01:01.770> done<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.399> like<00:01:02.520> three

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
electric fence and fire traps in a

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.300 
electric fence and fire traps in a
single<00:01:33.180> game<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.590> think<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.860> guys<00:01:35.040> can

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
single game I think you guys can

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.460 
single game I think you guys can
actually<00:01:35.820> get<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.630> pretty<00:01:37.259> simple

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
actually get that on it's pretty simple

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.370
