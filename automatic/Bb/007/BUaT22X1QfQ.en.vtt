about ready to flip I do want to say one
thing<00:04:48.300> it's<00:04:49.300> probably<00:04:49.479> best<00:04:49.840> to<00:04:49.960> have<00:04:50.169> Turkey

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
thing it's probably best to have Turkey

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.170

on<00:04:50.830> one<00:04:51.039> side<00:04:51.280> and<00:04:51.310> beef<00:04:51.789> on<00:04:51.970> the<00:04:52.060> other

on one side and beef on the other

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.490 
on one side and beef on the other
because<00:04:52.449> sometimes<00:04:52.780> they<00:04:52.900> can<00:04:52.960> get<00:04:53.169> a<00:04:53.199> little

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
because sometimes they can get a little

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.110 
because sometimes they can get a little
confusing<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:54.070> tell<00:04:54.340> which<00:04:54.490> one<00:04:54.669> is<00:04:54.760> which<00:04:54.880> I

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
confusing to tell which one is which I

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.450 
confusing to tell which one is which I
pretty<00:04:55.360> much<00:04:55.479> know<00:04:55.750> it<00:04:55.900> but<00:04:56.050> you<00:04:56.800> know<00:04:56.830> do<00:04:57.370> it

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
pretty much know it but you know do it

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.230 
pretty much know it but you know do it
works<00:04:57.639> for<00:04:57.820> you<00:04:57.940> so<00:04:58.180> I'm<00:04:58.330> going<00:04:58.449> to<00:04:58.479> put<00:04:58.690> these

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240

works for you so I'm going to put these
nice<00:05:01.240> little<00:05:01.479> color<00:05:01.919> and<00:05:02.919> as<00:05:03.130> you<00:05:03.190> can<00:05:03.340> see

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
nice little color and as you can see

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.930 
nice little color and as you can see
they<00:05:03.669> they<00:05:03.909> shrink<00:05:04.180> up<00:05:04.389> a<00:05:04.539> little<00:05:04.780> bit<00:05:05.849> so<00:05:06.849> you

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
they they shrink up a little bit so you

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.939 
they they shrink up a little bit so you
don't<00:05:07.090> want<00:05:07.210> to<00:05:07.270> make<00:05:07.389> them<00:05:07.510> too<00:05:07.720> small<00:05:08.080> to

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
don't want to make them too small to

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.089 
don't want to make them too small to
begin<00:05:09.099> with<00:05:10.020> you<00:05:11.020> know<00:05:11.050> with<00:05:11.320> burgers<00:05:11.860> I'm

begin with you know with burgers I'm
always<00:05:12.280> resisting<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.180> urge<00:05:13.360> to<00:05:13.840> press<00:05:14.320> down

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
always resisting the urge to press down

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.219 
always resisting the urge to press down
that<00:05:15.039> doesn't<00:05:15.340> really<00:05:15.510> get<00:05:16.510> you<00:05:16.690> anything<00:05:16.900> but

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
that doesn't really get you anything but

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.719 
that doesn't really get you anything but
a<00:05:17.289> dry<00:05:17.620> burger<00:05:18.099> so<00:05:19.740> that's<00:05:20.740> enough<00:05:20.979> to<00:05:21.099> just<00:05:21.370> so

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729
