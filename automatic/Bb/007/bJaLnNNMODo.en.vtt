00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
and that's hard to do

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.680 
and that's hard to do
if<00:02:16.520> you<00:02:16.640> think<00:02:16.850> back<00:02:17.030> some<00:02:17.330> of<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.480> people

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
if you think back some of the people

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.110 
if you think back some of the people
have<00:02:17.810> had<00:02:17.930> long<00:02:18.200> long<00:02:18.470> careers<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:19.160> think<00:02:20.000> one

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
have had long long careers I think one

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.460 
have had long long careers I think one
of<00:02:20.150> their<00:02:20.300> best<00:02:20.480> qualities<00:02:20.660> on<00:02:20.990> the<00:02:21.080> screen<00:02:21.320> is

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
of their best qualities on the screen is

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.560 
of their best qualities on the screen is
that<00:02:23.770> they're<00:02:24.770> easy<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.340> watch<00:02:25.550> you<00:02:26.450> don't

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
that they're easy to watch you don't

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.960 
that they're easy to watch you don't
question<00:02:26.930> anything<00:02:27.230> they<00:02:27.500> do<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:28.550> just<00:02:28.760> fall

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
into it and that's a very hard place to

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.900 
into it and that's a very hard place to
to<00:02:33.110> find<00:02:33.410> as<00:02:33.680> an<00:02:34.040> actor<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.520> that's<00:02:34.610> something
