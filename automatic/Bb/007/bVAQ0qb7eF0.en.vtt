alright guys so as you can see i got the
mold<00:00:07.340> done<00:00:07.550> here<00:00:07.930> of<00:00:08.930> the<00:00:09.320> dawnguard<00:00:09.860> helmet

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
mold done here of the dawnguard helmet

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
mold done here of the dawnguard helmet
and<00:00:10.820> they've<00:00:11.330> also<00:00:11.480> pulled<00:00:11.900> one<00:00:12.110> cast<00:00:12.410> so<00:00:12.770> far

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510 
and they've also pulled one cast so far

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.440 
and they've also pulled one cast so far
this<00:00:14.510> one<00:00:14.750> is<00:00:14.869> made<00:00:15.049> at<00:00:15.260> a<00:00:15.289> smooth<00:00:15.650> gas<00:00:16.210> 65<00:00:17.210> D

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
this one is made at a smooth gas 65 D

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.730 
this one is made at a smooth gas 65 D
plastic<00:00:19.180> and<00:00:20.180> I<00:00:20.990> think<00:00:21.289> it<00:00:21.380> turned<00:00:21.560> out<00:00:21.679> really

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
plastic and I think it turned out really

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.579 
plastic and I think it turned out really
good<00:00:23.619> it<00:00:24.619> fits<00:00:24.890> me<00:00:25.099> great<00:00:25.429> a<00:00:26.289> little<00:00:27.289> bit<00:00:27.529> of

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:27.589 
good it fits me great a little bit of

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.019 
good it fits me great a little bit of
room<00:00:27.710> to<00:00:27.859> spare<00:00:28.070> so<00:00:29.230> size<00:00:30.230> should<00:00:30.619> be<00:00:30.789> not<00:00:31.789> much

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
room to spare so size should be not much

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.560 
room to spare so size should be not much
of<00:00:32.180> a<00:00:32.240> problem<00:00:32.450> if<00:00:32.960> you<00:00:33.080> have<00:00:33.200> advertised<00:00:33.800> head

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
of a problem if you have advertised head

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.200 
of a problem if you have advertised head
so<00:00:35.570> that<00:00:35.600> means<00:00:35.900> I<00:00:36.050> probably<00:00:36.079> will<00:00:36.890> sell<00:00:37.220> a<00:00:37.490> few

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
so that means I probably will sell a few

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.950 
so that means I probably will sell a few

helmet<00:01:04.180> you<00:01:05.180> know<00:01:05.299> so<00:01:05.710> meaning<00:01:06.710> there's<00:01:07.040> not<00:01:07.220> a

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
helmet you know so meaning there's not a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.710 
helmet you know so meaning there's not a
lot<00:01:07.490> of<00:01:07.520> them<00:01:07.729> out<00:01:07.880> there<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.860> also<00:01:10.630> you<00:01:11.630> know

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
lot of them out there and also you know

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.060 
lot of them out there and also you know
after<00:01:11.990> a<00:01:12.020> while<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.320> mold<00:01:12.530> starts<00:01:12.860> to<00:01:12.980> wear

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
after a while the mold starts to wear

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.850 
after a while the mold starts to wear
down

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
down

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.220 
down
but<00:01:15.760> mostly<00:01:16.270> just<00:01:16.510> to<00:01:16.690> keep<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:16.930> uniqueness

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
but mostly just to keep the uniqueness

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.470 
but mostly just to keep the uniqueness
of<00:01:17.320> a<00:01:17.560> helmet<00:01:17.920> but<00:01:18.130> i<00:01:18.370> will<00:01:18.880> be<00:01:18.910> selling<00:01:19.150> a<00:01:19.330> few

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.410 
of a helmet but i will be selling a few
and<00:01:19.690> probably<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:21.310> i<00:01:21.340> just<00:01:21.910> thought<00:01:22.060> i'd<00:01:22.180> show

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
you you know how it looks so far i'm

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.170 
you you know how it looks so far i'm
getting<00:01:27.100> ready<00:01:27.280> to<00:01:27.340> put<00:01:27.490> this<00:01:27.610> one<00:01:27.820> in<00:01:27.910> primer

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
this is my casting this is the first one

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.110 
this is my casting this is the first one
and<00:01:31.380> i<00:01:32.380> actually<00:01:32.860> scuffs<00:01:33.490> handed<00:01:33.820> a<00:01:33.910> little

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
and i actually scuffs handed a little

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.000 
and i actually scuffs handed a little
bit<00:01:34.270> already<00:01:35.229> so<00:01:35.470> i'm<00:01:35.560> gonna<00:01:35.650> put<00:01:35.860> it<00:01:35.950> in

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
bit already so i'm gonna put it in

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.160 
bit already so i'm gonna put it in
primer<00:01:36.310> and<00:01:38.220> yeah<00:01:39.220> wet<00:01:39.970> sand<00:01:40.240> it<00:01:40.390> and<00:01:40.420> get<00:01:41.140> it

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
primer and yeah wet sand it and get it

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.850 
primer and yeah wet sand it and get it
painted<00:01:41.410> up<00:01:42.240> um<00:01:43.240> i<00:01:43.330> decided<00:01:43.870> to<00:01:44.260> cut<00:01:44.440> out<00:01:44.620> or

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
painted up um i decided to cut out or

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.700 
painted up um i decided to cut out or
obviously<00:01:45.850> had<00:01:45.970> to<00:01:46.060> cut<00:01:46.210> out<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.479> guys<00:01:47.080> but<00:01:47.440> i

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
obviously had to cut out the guys but i

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.380 
obviously had to cut out the guys but i
think<00:01:48.340> i'm<00:01:48.580> just<00:01:48.670> gonna<00:01:48.940> leave<00:01:49.119> him<00:01:49.240> open

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
think i'm just gonna leave him open

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.320 
think i'm just gonna leave him open
instead<00:01:49.750> of<00:01:49.840> putting<00:01:50.140> like<00:01:50.290> a<00:01:50.320> black<00:01:51.060> visor<00:01:52.060> in

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
instead of putting like a black visor in

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.499 
instead of putting like a black visor in
there<00:01:52.509> because<00:01:53.520> while<00:01:54.520> in<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:54.880> game<00:01:55.060> it's<00:01:55.300> a

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
there because while in the game it's a

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.080 
there because while in the game it's a
solid<00:01:55.750> black<00:01:56.110> visor<00:01:56.440> um<00:01:56.890> i<00:01:57.610> think<00:01:57.790> it<00:01:58.000> would

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
solid black visor um i think it would

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.760 
solid black visor um i think it would
look<00:01:58.180> better<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.690> more<00:01:58.840> realistic<00:01:59.410> if<00:01:59.500> I<00:01:59.590> just

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
look better and more realistic if I just

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.280 
look better and more realistic if I just
left<00:01:59.890> it<00:02:00.009> open<00:02:00.160> and<00:02:00.810> as<00:02:01.810> for<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.080> holes

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
left it open and as for the holes

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.290 
left it open and as for the holes
they're<00:02:03.070> probably<00:02:03.310> meant<00:02:03.580> to<00:02:03.700> be<00:02:03.790> open<00:02:04.149> in

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
they're probably meant to be open in

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.010 
they're probably meant to be open in
real<00:02:05.050> life<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.790> I<00:02:06.820> haven't<00:02:07.300> decided<00:02:07.509> yet<00:02:07.840> if<00:02:07.869> I

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
real life so I haven't decided yet if I

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.510 
real life so I haven't decided yet if I
my<00:02:08.140> drill<00:02:08.380> those<00:02:08.530> out<00:02:08.739> or<00:02:08.890> not

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
