00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
seen maybe some market improvement over

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.660 
seen maybe some market improvement over
the<00:00:45.930> past<00:00:46.140> couple<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.469> weeks<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:47.309> learning

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
the past couple of weeks just learning

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.420 
the past couple of weeks just learning
the<00:00:47.760> schemes<00:00:48.090> i<00:00:48.300> think<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> guys<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.110> know<00:00:49.430> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
the schemes i think the guys you know a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.130 
the schemes i think the guys you know a
lot<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.000> things<00:00:51.149> we're<00:00:51.329> doing<00:00:51.360> offensively<00:00:51.780> or

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
lot of things we're doing offensively or

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.000 
lot of things we're doing offensively or
similar<00:00:52.920> different<00:00:53.760> terminology<00:00:54.449> there's

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
similar different terminology there's

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.869 
similar different terminology there's
different<00:00:56.010> fundamentals<00:00:56.579> different

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
different fundamentals different

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.229 
different fundamentals different
coaching<00:00:57.210> points<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.660> are<00:00:57.780> guys<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.199> stress

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
coaching points that are guys is stress

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.340 
coaching points that are guys is stress
we're<00:01:00.239> lining<00:01:00.390> up<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.750> an<00:01:00.840> entirely<00:01:01.199> different

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
we're lining up in an entirely different

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.340 
we're lining up in an entirely different
defense<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.309> then<00:01:02.520> we<00:01:02.640> had<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.780> past<00:01:03.960> and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
defense and then we had in the past and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.170 
defense and then we had in the past and
so<00:01:04.949> there's<00:01:05.159> there's<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.460> lot<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.760> learn<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:05.939> i

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
so there's there's a lot to learn and i

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.390 
so there's there's a lot to learn and i
think<00:01:06.420> they've<00:01:06.570> come<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> long<00:01:06.900> way<00:01:07.890> since<00:01:08.189> day

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
think they've come a long way since day

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.270 
think they've come a long way since day
one<00:01:08.640> there<00:01:09.140> but<00:01:10.140> each<00:01:10.290> day<00:01:10.320> there's<00:01:10.920> there's

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
one there but each day there's there's

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.380 
one there but each day there's there's
new<00:01:11.460> installation<00:01:12.060> there's<00:01:12.240> new<00:01:12.360> things

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
new installation there's new things
