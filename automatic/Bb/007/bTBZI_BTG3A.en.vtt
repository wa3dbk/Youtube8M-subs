one<00:00:19.120> of<00:00:19.210> the<00:00:19.270> reasons<00:00:19.690> I<00:00:19.870> love<00:00:20.290> working<00:00:20.620> with

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
one of the reasons I love working with

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.400 
one of the reasons I love working with
paramedic<00:00:21.220> tools<00:00:21.790> is<00:00:22.330> that<00:00:22.390> they<00:00:22.630> just<00:00:23.050> make

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
paramedic tools is that they just make

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.220 
paramedic tools is that they just make
sense<00:00:24.510> everything<00:00:25.510> works<00:00:25.750> the<00:00:25.870> way<00:00:25.960> I<00:00:26.080> think

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
sense everything works the way I think

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.200 
sense everything works the way I think
it<00:00:26.500> should<00:00:26.530> and<00:00:27.010> it's<00:00:27.130> just<00:00:27.370> so<00:00:27.580> enjoyable<00:00:28.060> to

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
it should and it's just so enjoyable to

it should and it's just so enjoyable to
use<00:00:28.300> a<00:00:28.480> tool<00:00:28.810> to<00:00:29.110> expect<00:00:30.100> it<00:00:30.280> to<00:00:30.400> work<00:00:30.430> the

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300
