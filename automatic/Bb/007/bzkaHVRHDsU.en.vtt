00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.160
 show you the new 3.0 update of the 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:31.869
 playstation vita good first of all 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.869
 let's see the new message icon 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.820
 we give messages 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.270
 and now there is a new option that 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.890
 call invitations here is here 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.050
 we see all the invitations that we 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.650
 make 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.430
 and then the usual is not the message 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.430
 etc 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.350
 good 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.960
 Now the most interesting thing of all is the 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.840
 camera because he now has the camera 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.220
 panorama 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.220
 let's click 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.509
 and a lot 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.820
 We have a panoramic view and we can 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.740
 set it in four modes 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:26.390
 here we press it and now 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.920
 we see more or less like this we can give the 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.220
 side that we want here shows us in the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.689
 little screen we can go and in the 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.840
 number of photos we have to take 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.619
 39 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.890
 or in height and width no more than 9 and so not 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.890
 etc 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.220
 the truth that this is interesting because 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.040
 Well we have more pictures taken 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.250
 professionals 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.270
 But if it's not cool because the 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.270
 camera is still 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.930
 well a cooked 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.020
 here we open it with panoramic 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.550
 and if we did a little photos 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.670
 as if we were inside the photo 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.670
 do not 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.140
 so that's normal and that's where we have the option 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.180
 of panoramic 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.640
 very good something interesting is also the 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.790
 parental control so that if any 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.129
 of 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.670
 well here the beginning will ask us 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.340
 a key 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.310
 there is to enter or if any of 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.720
 you have children or something because 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.170
 you can block either here the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.770
 functions not for example in games 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.080
 and here he explains 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:44.120
 for example level 9 and here already tells you 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:47.790
 what can they play at level 10 9 11 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.120
 at level 1 will not be able to play my mothers 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.540
 but you can say timber gas off yo 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.090
 I do not occupy anything like the functions what 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.569
 is the browser because you are going to see porn it 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.569
 block it 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.290
 and in the duration of fire to see my 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.930
 Fucking appointment to see want to play if you already 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.990
 Well, I'm going to set a fixed schedule 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.110
 there they put him 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.500
 or equal per day your task exceeds and already 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.540
 that each game 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.280
 and then here if we want to change the key 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.069
 from the beginning it says it changed it very 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.409
 wrong 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.370
 well the new function was also added 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:28.590
 link with playstation 4 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.959
 Well, here we can make use of 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.720
 distance there explains to us that it is or the 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.400
 second screen to use now yes that 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.290
 as if we had the price are four 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.290
 the hands adjust it as control 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.050
 something that also changes a lot is the 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.980
 Friends section because now I know 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:51.980
 as fresher more more to the style already 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:56.850
 we see that here it is already divided we can 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:04:00.410
 search our friends for our requests 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.780
 or those that we have blocked not 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.890
 well also something interesting is that 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.980
 here it appears for example auriazul is 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.220
 playing fifa 14 in play 3 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.070
 here they are alone here they start or they are 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.780
 appears in which they are playing not 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.610
 even though he says he is when fish 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.790
 invite but here seems a control of 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:26.400
 play I do not know why before the 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.830
 console icon but good 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.530
 and at the party, it also improved 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.540
 quite 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.230
 well I do not know for real but if we go 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.590
 here friends 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.600
 here is an option that says 016 not the 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.790
 I have tried a I do not know if I want to say that 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.170
 We can add 16 friends to the party or 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:50.100
 no and here we can add those either by 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:55.050
 alphabetical order or connection status 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.050
 even those who are connected 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:03.240
 and also to this icon I change the use to 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:06.470
 distance with playstation 3 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.470
