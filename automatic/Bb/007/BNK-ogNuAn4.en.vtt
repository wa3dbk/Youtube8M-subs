00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.810
 so it's a concert 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.270
 little interpreted I think that one of the 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.220
 reasons is that the concert for 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.960
 sweet violoncello that is one of the 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.050
 more like mental and I think it's one 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.070
 of the most important in what what 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.170
 presents concerts for instruments and 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.199
 of course it's a bit in the shadow of 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.410
 this concert and I also think it's 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.780
 a concert that is not easy to interpret 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.790
 not only for example 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.180
 technical difficulties but musically 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:56.270
 it also requires a lot of attention 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.770
 a lot of energy and it seems to me that 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.760
 this is one of the actions for the 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.560
 violinist who do not fancy so 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.820
 naturally as the concert of 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.590
 beethoven tchaikovsky works 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.170
 but I think it 's a concert 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.659
 fantastic I like it a lot I like it 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.659
 much the composer in general 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.460
 the composers who 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.610
 despite being a slave and despite 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.119
 to have a lot of melancholy in his music is 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.280
 one of the healthiest composers that 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.350
 I mean with this is that for example 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.980
 trans mostly in have they have 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.440
 typically emotions 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.870
 dramatic are melancholy and you are 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.720
 who is a very complete composer since 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.450
 this point of view and it's a pleasure to touch 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.050
 it's a pleasure to play his music is a 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.640
 pleasure to enter your world and in general to 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.300
 I think it 's one of the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.890
 composers that are the best 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.500
 besides playing his concert for violin 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.480
 for example I will have the luck of 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.010
 direct one of his symphonies because 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.799
 right now 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.079
 He has treated me also so I have 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:27.680
 some concerts every season to 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:30.049
 direct and one of the most important that 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.959
 I do this year is the symphony number 8 of 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:36.069
 edwards erc so I'm very deep inside 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.069
 of his from his world 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:58.170
 and what 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.780
 of lottery master has made 1,703 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:05.489
 it subtracts you that all the insults of this 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:10.940
 caliber of this luthier are incredible 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:12.980
 they are like a formula 1 of violin and 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:16.010
 I have this instrument in mind 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.120
 these 10 years since girl some of the 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.210
 Health 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.400
 in chicago 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.470
 I can really tell you that I have a 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.720
 very good relationship with this instrument 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.090
 It is an instrument with many many 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.069
 sound qualities 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.100
 with many colors what is very 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.990
 important for 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.480
 to have the variety 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.760
 in the interpretation but also for 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.240
 play in big rooms with big 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.510
 orchestras the projection and sound is 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:49.700
 something that surpasses everything 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.700
 kind of explanations
