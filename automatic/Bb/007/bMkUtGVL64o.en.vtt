00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.609
 Welcome to our website 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.990
 we would get the founder family gaming 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.719
 are really glad that you are there 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.000
 not one of georg harloff's 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.040
 good day together and mine 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.480
 little benny or even test and you 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.680
 are now available at gaming and that is 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.150
 a pretty good sign for that 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.340
 means that the website is online 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.570
 and that was a long way off we have 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.310
 at that time in the middle of march the youtube channel 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.960
 founded and also bipa gaming view 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.460
 To emphasize their already then and also 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.650
 It will not only be on youtube 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.330
 we stay bigger and have one 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.019
 important building block of the whole was the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.189
 website 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.020
 we have always been ahead of you 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.969
 community weird the roof portal too 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.980
 found the fifa world networked 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.360
 where we also integrate ourselves and that 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.399
 is now on this site with this website 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.079
 case the case comes to mind 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.879
 that we can do that now 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.530
 and until then it was a long long 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.030
 away you noticed that too often 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.620
 asked what the website 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.449
 when does she come online advertising says yes 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.489
 we are on our way we are progressing 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.350
 and so it was but had a lot 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.610
 while we learn because it 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.020
 originally demanded 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.520
 it did not work that way it was maybe 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.690
 not from us to think yes that is 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.190
 not so easy is a website too 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.840
 We then create over time 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.369
 long notice we wanted to partner with 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.159
 work together to support us 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.689
 to work out this site was 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.740
 or have noticed that works like this 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.689
 not because we are only then 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.430
 limited in the dimensions as we one 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.810
 vip gaming the website embellish 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.810
 can and accordingly we have 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.119
 noted that does not work we have to 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.560
 take some deep and that's why 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.240
 We will eventually go to a website 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.220
 agency that helps us 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.780
 because so mid-summer and 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.799
 Accordingly, we have to go there 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.360
 We also made progress and now 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.790
 Do you see the product the result 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.770
 namely the website is online and in the 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.820
 see the course of this design of a site 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.369
 Now maybe there is a new one 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.350
 represent a general new logo 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.610
 as we portray ourselves as in gaming 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.950
 are looking forward to your feedback like 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.350
 the whole effect on you we are very 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.670
 Of course yes , everyone is satisfied 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.310
 case something else but 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.750
 still noticed that that works 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.680
 is really cool actually so this 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.270
 I have got a bit off 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.049
 definitely get used to it yes we are very 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.490
 satisfied with it 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.500
 and now because we, of course, about it 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.869
 let us show or explain you 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.159
 everything on the website right now 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.780
 is offered and then what else 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.840
 In the future, we all come what we 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.950
 have visions with the website 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.050
 Ultimately, our goal is with the 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.730
 website to offer everything it's all about 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.470
 the game fifa is to be experienced and 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.610
 very complex accordingly 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.230
 complex are the different ones 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.030
 Sections and I want you now 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.530

 each still be my video 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.299

 that will always be a bit like that 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.720
 be the target of the selection 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.400
 here comes the websites on the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.260
 first look what an overview

 beyond that also into the whole 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.430
 scene pure, so to speak 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.250
 the fifa school itself is ultimately 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.810

 Targeted learning concept that really becomes 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.590
 have worked very long since 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.269
 whether a lot of time invested and 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.829
 there too i think we should be on everyone 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.389
 make a balcony is one of the whole 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.010
 big news from hyper gaming is 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.430
 a great enlargement we mighty proud 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.079

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.030
 in our forum you can then 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.319
 ultimately with us for everything it is 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.060
 to talk about fifa like that 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.349
 discuss are his in exchange 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.910
 that means we will definitely be 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.260
 be active the most important is, of course, 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.760
 also that everyone be active 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.109
 in the end, we'll do it for you 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.180
 so we as a community get together with each other 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.320
 No matter what it is there, you can exchange 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.340
 is certainly still much to tell 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.840
 for example 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.220
 we are open for it and we are happy 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.730
 that 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.600
 there is last but not least 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.520
 maybe you are also interested in this 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.260
 very little bit who behind pieper 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.880
 you know three of us already 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.170
 a bit much and joshua you know 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.070
 Of course a bit we too 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.840
 now have two new editors 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.610
 but hide even more people 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.930
 behind vip gaming and that much you know 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.100
 maybe not yet about us 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.960
 Maybe you will learn one or the other 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.610
 Another new thing in any case is that 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.650
 the goal of this section is about us 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.670
 simply called plump first 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.930
 to introduce the team 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.520
 later, if necessary, sometimes projects 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.870
 introduce and everything a bit 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.080
 behind the scenes of juniper gaming 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.700
 goes to summarize like that and that was 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.020
 now the short six survey i 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.760
 I hope I could give you an insight 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.560
 give it on the website 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.940
 to experience everything there and next 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.820
 it tells you a little bit now 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.110
 what to give about the future of opel 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.640
 Exactly because with the website we have 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.800
 now the next big milestone 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.390
 achieved by bipa gaming and therefore becomes 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.860
 of course in the near future, too 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.450
 first let's go on the website 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.680
 keep the whole thing up to date that that 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.630
 everything is running that the new article 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.669
 come that are forum everything runs around 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.440
 Of course this is a task 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.600
 an additional organizational as well 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.430
 where we are approaching but about it 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.960
 Of course, we also look around in 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.280
 which areas we can still afford 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.110
 evolve where can we still 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.730
 continue to expand and a thing we 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.440
 For example, we can imagine ourselves 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.710
 things that we next to the injured of 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.450
 also try to persuade the person and the 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.880
 more networking and closer to the community 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.560
 to bring each other through , for example 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.090
 live events ie tournaments were organized by 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.770
 from time to time you suggested so 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.750
 what can you imagine or at the 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.640
 fifa school that is there in the direction 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.560
 maybe live events can go 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.120
 In the course, of course, we look 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.800
 even after partners around us 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.570
 can support such things and 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.340
 that's another big point 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.169
 and then live, for example 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.460
 streams is a matter of our turn 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.470
