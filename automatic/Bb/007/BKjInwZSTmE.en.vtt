dedicated menu button and then

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.429 
dedicated menu button and then
compensate<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.180> androids<00:01:21.180> got<00:01:21.450> some

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
compensate for that androids got some

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.390 
compensate for that androids got some
differences<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.950> have<00:01:23.009> been<00:01:23.159> incorporated

differences that have been incorporated

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.760 
differences that have been incorporated
into<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.970> applications<00:01:24.570> themselves<00:01:24.770> so

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
into the applications themselves so

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.620 
into the applications themselves so
you'll<00:01:25.950> notice<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.369> example<00:01:26.400> when<00:01:27.390> we<00:01:27.479> go<00:01:27.600> to

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
you'll notice for example when we go to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.800 
you'll notice for example when we go to
maps<00:01:28.250> now<00:01:29.250> will<00:01:29.729> typically<00:01:30.090> find<00:01:30.420> that

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
maps now will typically find that

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.929 
maps now will typically find that
there's<00:01:31.740> going<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:31.979> be<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.100> search<00:01:32.430> option<00:01:32.670> at

there's going to be a search option at

there's going to be a search option at
