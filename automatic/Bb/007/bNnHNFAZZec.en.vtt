more about the activator or kicker that
I<00:00:12.690> use<00:00:12.929> for<00:00:13.230> my<00:00:13.440> CA<00:00:14.070> thumb<00:00:14.429> safe<00:00:15.139> super<00:00:16.139> glue<00:00:16.289> so

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
I use for my CA thumb safe super glue so

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.439 
I use for my CA thumb safe super glue so
this<00:00:16.800> stuff<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.070> your<00:00:17.190> foam<00:00:17.400> safe<00:00:17.699> CA<00:00:17.970> super

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
this stuff is your foam safe CA super

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.330 
this stuff is your foam safe CA super
glue<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.289> works<00:00:19.439> really<00:00:19.650> well<00:00:19.740> however<00:00:20.130> it

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
glue and it works really well however it

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.099 
glue and it works really well however it
with<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.730> even<00:00:21.210> though<00:00:21.300> it's<00:00:21.449> medium

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
with the even though it's medium

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.040 
with the even though it's medium
thickness<00:00:22.430> it<00:00:23.430> just<00:00:23.699> takes<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.689> know<00:00:24.810> could

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
thickness it just takes you know could

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.990 
thickness it just takes you know could
take<00:00:25.199> 5-10<00:00:25.439> minutes<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.220> glue<00:00:26.369> foam<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.789> foam

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
take 5-10 minutes to glue foam to foam

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.359 
take 5-10 minutes to glue foam to foam
just<00:00:27.630> because<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.140> material<00:00:28.590> doesn't<00:00:29.310> add

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
just because this material doesn't add

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.070 
just because this material doesn't add
he<00:00:29.550> severe<00:00:29.849> II<00:00:29.880> well<00:00:30.090> if<00:00:30.510> your<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.779> glue<00:00:30.929> this

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
he severe II well if your to glue this

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.860 
he severe II well if your to glue this
to<00:00:31.380> wood<00:00:31.710> or<00:00:32.009> steel<00:00:32.730> or<00:00:32.790> something<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.510> blue

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
to wood or steel or something it blue

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.930 
to wood or steel or something it blue
much<00:00:34.110> much<00:00:34.320> quicker<00:00:34.530> but<00:00:34.890> foam<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.280> foam<00:00:35.489> does

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
much much quicker but foam to foam does

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.720 
much much quicker but foam to foam does
not<00:00:36.120> glue<00:00:36.329> very<00:00:36.540> quickly<00:00:37.260> with<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.430> foam

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
not glue very quickly with just the foam

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.450 
not glue very quickly with just the foam
glue<00:00:39.420> itself<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.079> if<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.649> use<00:00:40.770> kicker<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.370> was

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
glue itself so if you use kicker it was

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.819 
glue itself so if you use kicker it was
a<00:00:41.520> lot<00:00:41.700> faster<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.780> what's<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.410> show<00:00:43.559> really

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
a lot faster so what's so show really

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.860 
a lot faster so what's so show really
quick<00:00:44.040> my<00:00:44.789> first<00:00:45.030> example<00:00:45.390> I'm<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.600> going<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
quick my first example I'm just going to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.010 
quick my first example I'm just going to
apply<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.620> surface<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:47.420> like<00:00:48.420> so

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
apply this to the surface here like so

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.540 
apply this to the surface here like so
just<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.680> quick<00:00:49.980> line<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:52.010> cap<00:00:53.010> back<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.399> you

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
just a quick line of it cap back on you

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.849 
just a quick line of it cap back on you
don't<00:00:53.670> want<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.059> getting<00:00:54.449> air<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.870> there<00:00:55.079> and

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.369 

so<00:00:58.859> I've<00:00:58.949> got<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.430> glue<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.699> one<00:00:59.910> surface<00:01:00.379> I'm

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
so I've got to glue on one surface I'm

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.399 
so I've got to glue on one surface I'm
gonna<00:01:01.590> spray<00:01:01.980> activator<00:01:02.930> on<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.589> surface

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
gonna spray activator on this surface

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.050 
gonna spray activator on this surface
and<00:01:07.409> I'm<00:01:08.189> if<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.520> tell<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:08.790> like<00:01:08.970> a

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
and I'm if you can tell it's just like a

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.820 
and I'm if you can tell it's just like a
little<00:01:09.210> glaze<00:01:09.979> touch<00:01:10.979> these<00:01:11.159> two<00:01:11.189> together

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
little glaze touch these two together

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.320 
little glaze touch these two together
hold<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> second

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.400 

and<00:01:20.730> they're<00:01:21.730> good<00:01:21.820> to<00:01:21.850> go<00:01:22.230> it's<00:01:23.230> pretty

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
and they're good to go it's pretty

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.790 
and they're good to go it's pretty
strong<00:01:24.240> very<00:01:25.240> very<00:01:25.540> strong<00:01:25.840> so<00:01:26.410> put<00:01:26.560> into

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
strong very very strong so put into

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.980 
strong very very strong so put into
perspective<00:01:27.160> how<00:01:27.580> strong<00:01:27.850> that<00:01:27.880> is<00:01:28.240> so<00:01:28.900> this

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
perspective how strong that is so this

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.050 
perspective how strong that is so this
is<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.530> laminated<00:01:30.070> side<00:01:30.280> to<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.550> laminated

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
is the laminated side to the laminated

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.960 
is the laminated side to the laminated
sign<00:01:31.270> if<00:01:31.870> you<00:01:31.930> were<00:01:32.080> to<00:01:32.140> glue<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.970> this

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
sign if you were to glue the this

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.760 
sign if you were to glue the this
vertically<00:01:34.420> like<00:01:34.570> this<00:01:34.600> if<00:01:35.440> you're<00:01:35.560> doing<00:01:35.590> a

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
vertically like this if you're doing a

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.110 
vertically like this if you're doing a
rudder<00:01:36.010> or<00:01:36.220> something<00:01:36.580> you<00:01:36.700> can<00:01:36.790> do<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:36.940> same

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
rudder or something you can do the same

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.350 
rudder or something you can do the same
thing<00:01:37.330> again<00:01:37.900> can<00:01:38.560> you<00:01:38.620> supply<00:01:38.950> your<00:01:39.520> glue<00:01:39.910> to

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
thing again can you supply your glue to

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.190 
thing again can you supply your glue to
one<00:01:40.780> side<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:45.510> again<00:01:46.510> if<00:01:46.630> I<00:01:46.720> were<00:01:46.810> just<00:01:46.900> to<00:01:47.050> lay

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
one side and again if I were just to lay

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.630 
one side and again if I were just to lay
this<00:01:47.350> straight<00:01:47.650> down<00:01:47.800> to<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.010> foam<00:01:48.250> I'd<00:01:48.490> have

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
this straight down to the foam I'd have

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.670 
this straight down to the foam I'd have
to<00:01:48.730> hold<00:01:48.910> it<00:01:49.030> for<00:01:49.090> a<00:01:49.270> few<00:01:49.300> minutes<00:01:49.690> and<00:01:49.900> then<00:01:50.140> it

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
to hold it for a few minutes and then it

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.780 
to hold it for a few minutes and then it
would<00:01:50.770> work<00:01:50.920> don't<00:01:51.220> get<00:01:51.310> me<00:01:51.400> wrong<00:01:51.430> it<00:01:51.670> does

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
would work don't get me wrong it does

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.760 
would work don't get me wrong it does
work<00:01:51.970> with<00:01:52.240> just<00:01:52.510> the<00:01:52.630> glue<00:01:52.810> but<00:01:53.020> it<00:01:53.500> takes<00:01:53.680> a

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
work with just the glue but it takes a

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.770 
work with just the glue but it takes a
few<00:01:53.890> minutes<00:01:54.190> and<00:01:54.400> by<00:01:55.030> then<00:01:55.240> your<00:01:55.420> hands<00:01:55.570> gonna

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
few minutes and by then your hands gonna

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.570 
few minutes and by then your hands gonna
get<00:01:55.900> tired<00:01:56.080> and<00:01:56.440> you<00:01:56.710> might<00:01:57.070> make<00:01:57.250> a<00:01:57.280> mistake

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
get tired and you might make a mistake

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.120 
get tired and you might make a mistake
or<00:01:57.730> something<00:01:57.940> so<00:01:58.120> I<00:01:58.330> spread<00:01:58.690> this<00:01:58.780> like<00:01:58.930> that

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
or something so I spread this like that

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.040 
or something so I spread this like that
it's<00:02:00.130> quick<00:02:00.370> spray<00:02:00.670> it's<00:02:00.850> like<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.000> hair<00:02:01.930> spray

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
it's quick spray it's like a hair spray

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.930 
it's quick spray it's like a hair spray
kind<00:02:02.410> of<00:02:02.470> stuff<00:02:02.680> just<00:02:02.920> sprays<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:03.460> like<00:02:03.610> a<00:02:03.670> mist

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.850 
kind of stuff just sprays it like a mist
put<00:02:04.720> that<00:02:04.870> down<00:02:06.240> hold<00:02:07.240> it<00:02:07.330> for<00:02:07.570> about<00:02:07.900> you<00:02:08.800> know

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
put that down hold it for about you know

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:18.650 
put that down hold it for about you know
five<00:02:09.369> seconds<00:02:10.210> or<00:02:10.300> so<00:02:10.510> and<00:02:16.110> you're<00:02:17.110> good<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.320> go

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
five seconds or so and you're good to go

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.930 
five seconds or so and you're good to go
nice<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:19.690> firm<00:02:20.020> so<00:02:20.230> pretty<00:02:20.830> quick<00:02:21.070> there's

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
nice and firm so pretty quick there's

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.320 
nice and firm so pretty quick there's
another<00:02:22.090> tactic<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:22.720> could<00:02:22.870> do<00:02:23.020> oh<00:02:23.430> yeah<00:02:24.430> you

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
another tactic you could do oh yeah you

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.970 
another tactic you could do oh yeah you
know<00:02:25.450> let's<00:02:25.570> say<00:02:25.870> that<00:02:26.110> you've<00:02:26.290> got<00:02:26.500> a<00:02:26.650> long

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
know let's say that you've got a long

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.160 
know let's say that you've got a long
piece<00:02:27.820> of<00:02:28.060> foam<00:02:28.239> that<00:02:28.390> you're<00:02:28.510> attaching<00:02:28.810> you

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
piece of foam that you're attaching you

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.290 
piece of foam that you're attaching you
don't<00:02:29.500> want<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:29.709> can't<00:02:29.980> lay<00:02:30.400> this<00:02:30.430> down<00:02:30.610> then

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
don't want you can't lay this down then

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.090 
don't want you can't lay this down then
spray<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.470> do<00:02:32.560> all<00:02:32.650> that<00:02:32.739> kind<00:02:32.890> of<00:02:32.980> thing

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
spray it and do all that kind of thing

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.380 
spray it and do all that kind of thing
you<00:02:33.220> can<00:02:33.310> do<00:02:33.459> this<00:02:33.610> kind<00:02:33.790> of<00:02:33.820> stuff<00:02:34.000> -<00:02:34.150> this<00:02:34.270> is

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
you can do this kind of stuff - this is

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.360 
you can do this kind of stuff - this is
what<00:02:34.480> I<00:02:34.510> do<00:02:34.630> sometimes<00:02:35.440> if<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:35.830> need<00:02:35.980> two<00:02:36.130> hands

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
what I do sometimes if I need two hands

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.830 
what I do sometimes if I need two hands
at<00:02:36.550> once<00:02:36.730> then<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.420> can<00:02:37.780> lay<00:02:38.230> glue<00:02:38.500> on<00:02:39.100> this

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
at once then I can lay glue on this

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.160 
at once then I can lay glue on this
attach<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:42.310> my<00:02:42.580> piece<00:02:43.540> let's<00:02:43.810> say<00:02:44.020> right

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
attach it to my piece let's say right

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.740 
attach it to my piece let's say right
here<00:02:44.500> then<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:46.660> can<00:02:46.810> spray<00:02:47.350> your<00:02:48.450> glue<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.660> the

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
here then you can spray your glue to the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.970 
here then you can spray your glue to the
kind<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.050> sides<00:02:50.350> because<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.709> can<00:02:50.800> barely

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
kind of the sides because you can barely

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.790 
kind of the sides because you can barely
see<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.280> glue<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.489> seat<00:02:51.670> see<00:02:52.030> this<00:02:52.180> glue<00:02:52.450> is

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
see the glue the seat see this glue is

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.960 
see the glue the seat see this glue is
there's<00:02:53.800> no<00:02:53.890> spray<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.250> so<00:02:54.400> that<00:02:54.520> it's<00:02:54.880> not

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
there's no spray it so that it's not

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.640 
there's no spray it so that it's not
firming<00:02:55.390> it<00:02:55.480> very<00:02:55.660> quickly<00:02:55.870> well<00:02:56.410> if<00:02:56.470> you<00:02:56.530> want

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
firming it very quickly well if you want

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.130 
firming it very quickly well if you want
to<00:02:56.709> do<00:02:56.800> it<00:02:56.890> really<00:02:57.010> cool<00:02:57.220> if<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.489> want<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:58.140> get

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
to do it really cool if you want to get

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.360 
to do it really cool if you want to get
the<00:02:59.230> activator<00:02:59.590> in<00:02:59.739> there<00:02:59.860> you<00:03:00.040> just<00:03:00.190> kind<00:03:00.310> of

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
the activator in there you just kind of

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.690 
the activator in there you just kind of
tip<00:03:00.459> it<00:03:00.550> to<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.700> side<00:03:01.410> spray<00:03:02.489> hold<00:03:03.489> it<00:03:03.580> down

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
tip it to the side spray hold it down

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.479 
tip it to the side spray hold it down
maybe<00:03:04.150> one<00:03:04.300> more<00:03:04.450> on<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.600> other<00:03:04.630> side<00:03:05.489> and

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
maybe one more on the other side and

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.610 
maybe one more on the other side and
wait<00:03:07.360> a<00:03:07.390> few<00:03:07.600> moments<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:09.700> there<00:03:09.850> you<00:03:09.940> go

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
wait a few moments and there you go

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.540 
wait a few moments and there you go
split<00:03:11.620> down<00:03:11.770> there<00:03:11.950> oh<00:03:12.070> this<00:03:12.220> is<00:03:12.310> not<00:03:12.370> going<00:03:12.489> to

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
split down there oh this is not going to

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.920 
split down there oh this is not going to
glue<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.790> as<00:03:12.880> well<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.330> can<00:03:13.450> tell<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.630> still<00:03:13.840> is

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
glue it as well you can tell it still is

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.449 
glue it as well you can tell it still is
kind<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.200> moving<00:03:14.410> a<00:03:14.470> little<00:03:14.590> bit<00:03:14.770> but<00:03:15.400> that's

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
kind of moving a little bit but that's

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.699 
kind of moving a little bit but that's
because<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:16.180> glue<00:03:16.450> or<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.930> activators<00:03:17.470> not

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
because the glue or the activators not

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.460 
because the glue or the activators not
all<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.100> way<00:03:18.190> in<00:03:18.220> there<00:03:18.430> yet<00:03:18.690> so<00:03:19.690> you<00:03:20.290> have<00:03:20.410> to

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
all the way in there yet so you have to

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.810 
all the way in there yet so you have to
take<00:03:20.590> a<00:03:20.620> few<00:03:20.830> moments<00:03:21.160> but<00:03:21.250> this<00:03:21.459> this<00:03:21.670> will

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
take a few moments but this this will

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.940 
take a few moments but this this will
hold<00:03:21.970> it<00:03:22.060> long<00:03:22.239> enough<00:03:22.360> for<00:03:22.600> the<00:03:22.720> glue<00:03:22.950> inside

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
hold it long enough for the glue inside

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.830 
hold it long enough for the glue inside
that's<00:03:24.220> not<00:03:24.340> been<00:03:24.489> exposed<00:03:24.850> to<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.180> activator

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
that's not been exposed to the activator

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.560 
that's not been exposed to the activator
to<00:03:26.380> kind<00:03:26.590> of<00:03:26.709> do<00:03:27.070> its<00:03:27.190> job<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:27.670> finish<00:03:28.390> it<00:03:28.510> up

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
to kind of do its job and finish it up

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.120 
to kind of do its job and finish it up
so<00:03:28.870> you're<00:03:29.200> doing<00:03:29.290> like<00:03:29.470> a<00:03:29.530> long<00:03:29.710> piece<00:03:29.950> like<00:03:30.100> a

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
so you're doing like a long piece like a

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.920 
so you're doing like a long piece like a
wing<00:03:30.430> or<00:03:30.700> something<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:31.210> you<00:03:31.270> want<00:03:31.450> to<00:03:31.540> glue

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
wing or something and you want to glue

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:32.850 
wing or something and you want to glue
this<00:03:32.080> in<00:03:32.230> here<00:03:32.350> you<00:03:32.500> can

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
this in here you can

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.920 
this in here you can
use<00:03:32.950> activator<00:03:33.730> still<00:03:34.000> you<00:03:34.180> just<00:03:34.360> lay<00:03:34.810> the

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
use activator still you just lay the

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.050 
use activator still you just lay the
glue<00:03:35.080> down<00:03:35.230> put<00:03:35.740> the<00:03:35.830> pieces<00:03:36.190> down<00:03:36.340> then<00:03:36.550> spray

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
glue down put the pieces down then spray

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.330 
glue down put the pieces down then spray
activator<00:03:37.480> between<00:03:38.350> and<00:03:38.590> it<00:03:39.070> should<00:03:39.220> work

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
activator between and it should work

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.630 
activator between and it should work
just<00:03:39.370> fine<00:03:39.550> so<00:03:40.240> there's<00:03:40.420> my<00:03:41.070> little<00:03:42.070> ship

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
just fine so there's my little ship

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.610 
just fine so there's my little ship
thing<00:03:42.970> I<00:03:43.150> don't<00:03:43.210> know<00:03:43.330> what<00:03:43.450> that<00:03:43.600> that<00:03:43.780> is<00:03:43.930> and

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
thing I don't know what that that is and

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.240 
thing I don't know what that that is and
that's<00:03:44.950> how<00:03:45.130> you<00:03:45.190> use<00:03:45.490> pro<00:03:46.420> CA<00:03:47.010> so<00:03:48.010> that's<00:03:48.160> how

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
that's how you use pro CA so that's how

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.630 
that's how you use pro CA so that's how
you<00:03:48.310> use<00:03:48.400> CA<00:03:49.090> activator<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:49.840> CA<00:03:50.560> glue<00:03:50.800> I'll

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
you use CA activator and CA glue I'll

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.830 
you use CA activator and CA glue I'll

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
to get a strong bond again this is this

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.250 
to get a strong bond again this is this
is<00:04:01.209> very<00:04:01.480> strong<00:04:02.940> see<00:04:03.940> here<00:04:06.720> so<00:04:07.720> I<00:04:07.750> had<00:04:07.930> to<00:04:08.050> push

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
is very strong see here so I had to push

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.860 
is very strong see here so I had to push
pretty<00:04:08.620> hard<00:04:08.770> for<00:04:09.100> that<00:04:09.160> to<00:04:09.220> break<00:04:09.430> and<00:04:09.670> it's

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
pretty hard for that to break and it's

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.510 
pretty hard for that to break and it's
you<00:04:10.870> know<00:04:10.900> it's<00:04:11.140> it's<00:04:11.410> taking<00:04:11.800> fun<00:04:11.980> with<00:04:12.190> it

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
you know it's it's taking fun with it

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.760 
you know it's it's taking fun with it
so<00:04:12.940> you<00:04:13.000> can<00:04:13.180> see<00:04:13.300> it<00:04:13.390> left<00:04:13.600> foam<00:04:13.870> behind<00:04:14.080> so

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
so you can see it left foam behind so

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.979 
so you can see it left foam behind so
that's<00:04:14.950> had<00:04:15.820> to<00:04:15.940> rip<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.239> foam<00:04:16.450> actually<00:04:16.690> to

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
that's had to rip the foam actually to

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.460 
that's had to rip the foam actually to
break<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:17.680> then<00:04:18.010> something<00:04:18.609> like<00:04:18.730> this

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
break that and then something like this

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.040 
break that and then something like this
I'm<00:04:20.470> just<00:04:20.530> pulling<00:04:20.950> straight<00:04:21.750> so<00:04:22.750> that<00:04:22.900> gives

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
I'm just pulling straight so that gives

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.750 
I'm just pulling straight so that gives
you<00:04:23.110> an<00:04:23.169> idea<00:04:23.320> how<00:04:23.500> strong<00:04:23.830> that<00:04:23.890> is<00:04:24.070> and<00:04:24.550> again

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
you an idea how strong that is and again

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.760 
you an idea how strong that is and again
we<00:04:24.880> just<00:04:24.910> added<00:04:25.390> that<00:04:25.540> and<00:04:25.750> this<00:04:26.350> piece<00:04:26.620> would

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
we just added that and this piece would

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.830 
we just added that and this piece would
be<00:04:26.830> just<00:04:27.790> about<00:04:28.230> possible<00:04:29.230> tear<00:04:29.530> off<00:04:30.210> so<00:04:31.210> in

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
be just about possible tear off so in

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.750 
be just about possible tear off so in
fact<00:04:32.020> it<00:04:32.110> just<00:04:32.140> tore<00:04:32.410> the<00:04:32.440> foam<00:04:32.650> so<00:04:33.490> you're<00:04:33.610> not

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
fact it just tore the foam so you're not

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.180 
fact it just tore the foam so you're not
gonna<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.840> lengthwise<00:04:35.560> this<00:04:35.830> stuff's<00:04:36.040> gonna

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
gonna the lengthwise this stuff's gonna

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.600 
gonna the lengthwise this stuff's gonna
really<00:04:36.520> really<00:04:36.700> strong<00:04:37.890> anyway<00:04:38.890> pretty

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
really really strong anyway pretty

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.950 
really really strong anyway pretty
