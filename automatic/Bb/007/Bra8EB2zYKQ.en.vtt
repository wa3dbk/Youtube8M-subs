one<00:00:59.930> of<00:01:00.050> my<00:01:00.110> favorite<00:01:00.440> things<00:01:00.680> to<00:01:00.890> put<00:01:00.920> into

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
one of my favorite things to put into

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:12.899 
one of my favorite things to put into
food<00:01:01.640> I<00:01:02.000> just<00:01:02.629> love<00:01:02.809> the<00:01:02.930> flavor<00:01:03.199> of<00:01:03.350> it

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.149 

once<00:01:13.479> it's<00:01:13.750> pretty<00:01:14.260> much<00:01:14.470> cooked<00:01:14.799> all<00:01:15.009> the<00:01:15.130> way

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
once it's pretty much cooked all the way

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.690 
once it's pretty much cooked all the way
I'll<00:01:15.700> take<00:01:15.939> that<00:01:16.150> and<00:01:16.420> I<00:01:16.540> rinse<00:01:17.049> water<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:18.400> it

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
I'll take that and I rinse water on it

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.460 
I'll take that and I rinse water on it
and<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:20.380> already<00:01:20.590> really<00:01:21.070> lean<00:01:21.900> but<00:01:22.900> as<00:01:23.229> I

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
and it's already really lean but as I

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.310 
and it's already really lean but as I
get<00:01:23.530> closer<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:24.190> it<00:01:24.220> to<00:01:25.000> my<00:01:25.119> show<00:01:25.420> I<00:01:25.810> just<00:01:25.960> try

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
get closer to it to my show I just try

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.980 
get closer to it to my show I just try
to<00:01:26.380> cut<00:01:26.619> fats<00:01:26.920> down<00:01:27.479> even<00:01:28.479> more

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
to cut fats down even more

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.780 
to cut fats down even more
so<00:01:29.200> I'll<00:01:29.500> rinse<00:01:29.710> it<00:01:29.890> with<00:01:29.979> water<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.399> couple

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
so I'll rinse it with water a couple

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.180 
so I'll rinse it with water a couple
times<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:31.479> then<00:01:31.570> put<00:01:31.780> it<00:01:31.869> back<00:01:31.899> on<00:01:32.200> the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
times and then put it back on the

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.940 
times and then put it back on the
stovetop<00:01:33.490> and<00:01:33.759> cook<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.840> water<00:01:35.020> back<00:01:35.320> back

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
stovetop and cook the water back back

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:46.320

Joe's they're already cooked in a

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.730 
Joe's they're already cooked in a
package<00:01:48.880> so<00:01:49.149> you<00:01:49.240> just<00:01:49.539> cut<00:01:50.020> it<00:01:50.140> open

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
package so you just cut it open

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.930 
package so you just cut it open
throw<00:01:51.520> that<00:01:51.759> in<00:01:52.409> total<00:01:53.409> total<00:01:54.250> carbs<00:01:54.729> in<00:01:54.880> a

whole package of those like 44 carbon
grams<00:01:59.050> I<00:01:59.319> believe<00:01:59.970> really<00:02:00.970> high<00:02:01.210> in<00:02:01.330> fiber

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
grams I believe really high in fiber

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:09.139 
grams I believe really high in fiber
really<00:02:02.080> high<00:02:02.200> in<00:02:02.259> protein

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.630 

like<00:02:09.660> offseason<00:02:10.410> I'd<00:02:10.530> put<00:02:10.769> brown<00:02:11.039> rice<00:02:11.340> and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
like offseason I'd put brown rice and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.800 
like offseason I'd put brown rice and
maybe<00:02:12.269> with<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.920> little<00:02:13.920> bit<00:02:14.420> just<00:02:15.420> for<00:02:15.599> more

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
maybe with it a little bit just for more

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.619 
maybe with it a little bit just for more
carb<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.760> then<00:02:17.760> I'll<00:02:17.879> cut<00:02:18.090> up<00:02:18.120> some<00:02:18.390> green

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
carb and then I'll cut up some green

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.430 
carb and then I'll cut up some green
beans<00:02:18.959> which<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.739> fibrous<00:02:20.160> carb<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:21.440> don't

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
beans which is the fibrous carb I don't

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.400 
beans which is the fibrous carb I don't
typically<00:02:22.830> even<00:02:22.980> count<00:02:23.720> fibrous<00:02:24.720> carb<00:02:24.989> carb

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
typically even count fibrous carb carb

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.580 
typically even count fibrous carb carb
grams<00:02:25.799> and<00:02:26.099> my<00:02:26.190> diet

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.740 

I'll<00:02:32.040> throw<00:02:32.280> some<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.640> that<00:02:32.730> in<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.330> then

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
I'll throw some of that in and then

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.340 
I'll throw some of that in and then
maybe<00:02:33.960> some<00:02:34.350> corn<00:02:34.680> or<00:02:35.100> peas<00:02:36.230> depending<00:02:37.230> on

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
maybe some corn or peas depending on

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.900 
maybe some corn or peas depending on
what<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.620> feel<00:02:37.860> like<00:02:37.980> for<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.250> day<00:02:38.490> but<00:02:38.550> not

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
what I feel like for the day but not

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.000 
what I feel like for the day but not
much<00:02:39.120> of<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:39.330> either<00:02:39.720> as<00:02:39.960> those<00:02:40.200> corn<00:02:40.860> and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
much of that either as those corn and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.010 
much of that either as those corn and
peas<00:02:41.160> are<00:02:41.370> both<00:02:41.520> starchy<00:02:41.970> carbohydrates<00:02:42.690> but

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
peas are both starchy carbohydrates but

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.550 
peas are both starchy carbohydrates but
they<00:02:43.920> are<00:02:44.070> still<00:02:44.340> high<00:02:44.550> in<00:02:44.700> fiber<00:02:45.320> that's<00:02:46.320> it

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
they are still high in fiber that's it

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.310 
they are still high in fiber that's it
it's<00:02:47.370> about<00:02:47.550> six<00:02:47.910> meals<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.690> works<00:02:48.900> out<00:02:49.080> about

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
it's about six meals it works out about

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.920 
it's about six meals it works out about
45<00:02:49.770> grams<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.430> protein<00:02:50.940> probably<00:02:51.480> only<00:02:51.600> 20

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
45 grams of protein probably only 20

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.060 
45 grams of protein probably only 20
grams<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.350> carbs<00:02:52.709> it's<00:02:53.280> actually<00:02:53.730> less<00:02:53.940> carbs

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
grams of carbs it's actually less carbs

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.590 
grams of carbs it's actually less carbs
than<00:02:56.070> I<00:02:56.160> eat<00:02:56.340> during<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:57.060> week<00:02:57.270> with<00:02:57.570> the
