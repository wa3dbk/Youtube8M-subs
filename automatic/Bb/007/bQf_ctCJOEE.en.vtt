00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
at that very nice pigmentation and we

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.389 
at that very nice pigmentation and we
will<00:01:00.840> see<00:01:01.020> how<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.410> looks<00:01:01.649> after<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> few

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
minutes so we can see it what type of

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.350 
minutes so we can see it what type of
finish<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.830> has<00:01:05.040> but<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.640> looks<00:01:05.880> like<00:01:06.119> it's

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
finish this has but it looks like it's

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.350 
finish this has but it looks like it's
kind<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.720> like<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.740> has<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.340> matte<00:01:08.640> finish<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.119> it

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
kind of like it has a matte finish to it

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.870 
kind of like it has a matte finish to it
it's<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.600> very<00:01:09.840> intense<00:01:10.380> black<00:01:10.830> color<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.729> this

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
it's a very intense black color so this

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.240 
it's a very intense black color so this
next<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.450> called<00:01:12.689> black<00:01:13.140> gems<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.860> from

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
next one is called black gems and from

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.399 
next one is called black gems and from
the<00:01:14.400> packaging<00:01:14.970> up<00:01:15.119> here<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.509> has<00:01:15.750> little

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
specks of glitter so I'm assuming this

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.289 
specks of glitter so I'm assuming this
one<00:01:18.960> has<00:01:19.200> some<00:01:19.799> sort<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.189> shimmer<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.880> I'm
