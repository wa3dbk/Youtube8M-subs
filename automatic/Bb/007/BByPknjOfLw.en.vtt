 Today's tutorial will teach you how to do 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.180
 this starbucks miniature that I'm 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.460
 using as little key 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.530
 If you want to know how I continue 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.540
 this video exists if you like 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.160

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.160

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.930
 offers to use quito with a piece of 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:50.390
 March we will shoot with another piece of 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:52.160
 our white ink brown ink green one 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.309
 cup that you have at home 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:58.670
 plastic a little piece of toothpick 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.460
 transparent contact paper and the 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.660
 from starbucks and if I printed and a 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.280
 scissors 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.040
 to start you will join the two 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.220
 pasta to brown is white and will mix 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.220
 good 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:23.810
 then just put it inside the glass of 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:27.580
 plastic and tighten well and that's missing 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.580
 You mix more and put it there. 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.820
 Now we're going to the part of the 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.860
 whipped cream with white pasta is the people 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.130
 will make a kind of straw 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:42.190
 with her and we'll wrap around the edge of 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.190
 cup to the top making a snail 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.950
 then with a toothpick you go 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.050
 make a small hole that will be we will 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.050
 put the spoon in 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.250
 I'm putting it because I'm going 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.660
 make a keychain then I'll need 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.280
 Something to learn from 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.640
 ringlets green tea then this will 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.640
 help a lot 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.260
 I'll do a heavy so I can 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.790
 put brown paint that will be the syrup 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.280
 then I got this one. 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.710
 plastic I had here and I'm going to 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.220
 the brown paint inside it with the help 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.220
 of a spoonful 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.580
 Ok, now I'll close with Durex. 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.890
 and so became a billionaire now with 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.470
 scissors or make a good cut 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.470
 little ones who will decorate the ice cream 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.600
 with the help of a brush I'll spread 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:22.320
 a little our chocolate sauce 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:23.970
 false we make the caramel that goes 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.980
 stay on top of the chocolate syrup 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.110
 so I used a mass of 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.750
 biscuit yellow white mass and a 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.850
 Bit of a free ride until you get there. 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.370
 in the tone of caramel and I'm going to make a 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:42.980
 and I'll remember bits and pieces well 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.980
 tiny and you have to step back enough 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.330
 now with the help of a forceps I will 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.390
 place the caramel on top of the 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.390
 chocolate 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:19.359
 Look what a few people, I'm going now. 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.359
 paint with the green toothpick 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.340
 Now I'm going to put the toothpick there. 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.750
 are that we had done before and 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.820
 I will cut 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.500
 I'm using pliers because with 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:38.750
 the scissors could not cut 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:41.180
 pinpoint paint and now on contact paper 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.680
 I made a circle and took out the plastic 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:53.510
 that I will use as one of the 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:55.550
 checks and I will paste teaching the ice cream and 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:00.580
 so the wait staff is going to have 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.580
 advanced until the next tutorial bye
