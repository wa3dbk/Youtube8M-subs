of thing like an idiot for a while but

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.359 
of thing like an idiot for a while but
I've<00:00:25.380> never<00:00:25.529> managed<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.890> make<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.070> work<00:00:26.189> so

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
I've never managed to make it work so

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.050 
I've never managed to make it work so
I'm<00:00:26.789> going<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.029> continue<00:00:27.300> onwards<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.939> as<00:00:29.939> you

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
I'm going to continue onwards and as you

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.120 
I'm going to continue onwards and as you
can<00:00:30.150> see<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.660> level<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.050> full<00:00:31.260> terribly

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
can see this level is full terribly

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.110 
can see this level is full terribly
annoyingly<00:00:32.669> placed<00:00:33.090> enemies<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:35.120> really

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
annoyingly placed enemies and really

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.319 
annoyingly placed enemies and really
obnoxious<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.809> make<00:00:36.960> jumps<00:00:38.090> hopefully<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.149> will

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
obnoxious to make jumps hopefully I will

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.889 
obnoxious to make jumps hopefully I will
not<00:00:39.480> screw<00:00:39.780> up<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.079> jumps<00:00:41.480> because<00:00:42.480> that

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
not screw up the jumps because that

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.229 
not screw up the jumps because that
would<00:00:43.050> be<00:00:43.170> sad<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.820> would<00:00:44.940> suck<00:00:45.980> so

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
would be sad and it would suck so

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.639 
would be sad and it would suck so
continuing<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.629> now<00:00:48.719> have<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.200> hardest

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
continuing on we now have the hardest

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.869 
continuing on we now have the hardest
jump<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> level<00:00:50.670> but<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.480> made<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.850> now

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
jump in the level but I made it and now

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.000 
jump in the level but I made it and now
we<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> secret<00:00:54.899> here<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.620> can<00:00:55.770> make<00:00:55.890> it

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
we have a secret here if I can make it

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.510 
we have a secret here if I can make it
work<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:57.109> have<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.140> jump<00:00:58.500> at<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.010> exact

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
work you have to jump at the exact

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.170 
work you have to jump at the exact
highest<00:01:00.149> point<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.690> sink<00:01:00.960> there<00:01:01.140> we<00:01:01.260> go<00:01:02.180> either

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
highest point to sink there we go either

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.149 
highest point to sink there we go either
at<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> jump<00:01:03.840> at<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> highest<00:01:04.229> point<00:01:04.500> or<00:01:04.739> land

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
at the jump at the highest point or land

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.039 
at the jump at the highest point or land
on<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.580> at<00:01:05.670> its<00:01:05.820> highest<00:01:06.119> point<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:07.020> not

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
on it at its highest point and it's not

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.090 
on it at its highest point and it's not
particularly<00:01:07.380> easy<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.920> do<00:01:08.010> either<00:01:09.470> and<00:01:13.100> yes

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
particularly easy to do either and yes

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.609 
particularly easy to do either and yes
these<00:01:14.310> enemies<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.210> will<00:01:15.390> kill<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.900> but

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
these enemies can and will kill you but

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.410 
these enemies can and will kill you but
it's<00:01:16.799> worth<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.130> because<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:17.850> gives<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.330> an

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
it's worth it because this gives you an

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.030 
it's worth it because this gives you an
extra<00:01:18.689> hit<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.409> skip<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.740> bunch<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:19.950> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
extra hit and you skip a bunch of the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.219 
extra hit and you skip a bunch of the
level<00:01:20.450> which<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.600> always<00:01:21.750> nice<00:01:23.030> now<00:01:24.030> we<00:01:24.509> can

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
level which is always nice now we can

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.780 
level which is always nice now we can
take<00:01:25.380> two<00:01:25.590> hits<00:01:25.740> without<00:01:25.920> dieing<00:01:26.310> because<00:01:26.670> we

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
take two hits without dieing because we

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.210 
take two hits without dieing because we
have<00:01:26.880> become<00:01:27.150> white<00:01:27.420> ninja<00:01:27.710> master<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.920> being

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
have become white ninja master of being

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.210 
have become white ninja master of being
white<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.020> making<00:01:31.020> no<00:01:31.170> sense<00:01:31.439> because<00:01:32.070> that's

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
white and making no sense because that's

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.240 
white and making no sense because that's
what<00:01:32.369> white<00:01:32.549> ninja<00:01:32.759> does<00:01:33.680> he<00:01:34.680> also<00:01:34.829> kills

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
what white ninja does he also kills

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.350 
what white ninja does he also kills
mimes<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:37.159> now<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.220> battle<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> Horned<00:01:39.180> Witch

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
mimes and now we battle the Horned Witch

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.340 
mimes and now we battle the Horned Witch
she's<00:01:39.829> actually<00:01:40.829> not<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.040> difficult

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
she's actually not that difficult

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.350 
she's actually not that difficult
especially<00:01:43.350> if<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:44.240> she<00:01:45.240> splits<00:01:45.689> and

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
especially if you do this she splits and

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.740 
especially if you do this she splits and
now<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:49.130> kill<00:01:50.130> them<00:01:50.250> all<00:01:50.399> she<00:01:51.360> goes<00:01:51.479> away

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
now we just kill them all she goes away

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.420 
now we just kill them all she goes away
and<00:01:52.079> check<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.409> out<00:01:52.560> if<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.890> hit<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.189> it

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
and check this out if you hit this it

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.499 
and check this out if you hit this it
turns<00:01:53.579> into<00:01:53.729> something<00:01:53.880> else<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.390> get

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
turns into something else and you get

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.580 
turns into something else and you get
more<00:01:54.630> points

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.370 

so<00:01:58.590> that's<00:01:58.980> round<00:01:59.430> three<00:02:00.150> attaboy<00:02:00.660> kid<00:02:01.080> Nikki

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
so that's round three attaboy kid Nikki

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.760 
so that's round three attaboy kid Nikki
keep<00:02:01.650> at<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.810> now<00:02:03.990> we<00:02:04.050> will<00:02:04.290> start<00:02:04.500> out

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
keep at it and now we will start out

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:12.640 
keep at it and now we will start out
round

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.059 

and<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:14.040> we<00:02:14.400> arrived<00:02:15.110> at<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.230> ice<00:02:16.379> caves<00:02:16.769> and

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
and so we arrived at the ice caves and

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.250 
and so we arrived at the ice caves and
we<00:02:17.129> start<00:02:17.489> by<00:02:17.700> cowering<00:02:18.269> in<00:02:18.540> fear<00:02:18.599> because

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
we start by cowering in fear because
