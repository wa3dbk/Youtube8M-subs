successfully<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.470> I<00:02:10.470> think<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.920> actually<00:02:11.010> all

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
successfully and I think it actually all

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.250 
successfully and I think it actually all
started<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.670> Australia<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.990> know<00:02:13.080> those

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
started in Australia you know those

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.370 
started in Australia you know those
Aussies<00:02:13.680> are<00:02:13.710> pretty<00:02:14.100> smart<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.300> do<00:02:15.960> like<00:02:16.230> some

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
Aussies are pretty smart I do like some

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.090 
Aussies are pretty smart I do like some
Aussie<00:02:16.710> I<00:02:16.740> like<00:02:17.010> offices<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:18.920> regardless<00:02:19.920> of

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
Aussie I like offices and regardless of

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:28.850 
Aussie I like offices and regardless of
that<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.350> basically<00:02:25.710> it<00:02:25.950> take<00:02:26.330> it's<00:02:27.860> what

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
that it is basically it take it's what

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.200 
that it is basically it take it's what
it's<00:02:29.010> called<00:02:29.250> it's<00:02:29.400> deep<00:02:29.640> brain<00:02:29.820> stimulation

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
it's called it's deep brain stimulation

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.480 
it's called it's deep brain stimulation
now<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.170> involves<00:02:31.770> if<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:31.950> have<00:02:32.040> no<00:02:32.250> idea

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
now this involves if you have no idea

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.640 
now this involves if you have no idea
what<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:32.730> mm-hmm<00:02:33.570> this<00:02:34.020> is<00:02:34.170> going<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.500> sound

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
what it is mm-hmm this is going to sound

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.390 
what it is mm-hmm this is going to sound
weird<00:02:35.010> so<00:02:35.600> bear<00:02:36.600> with<00:02:36.630> me<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:37.440> drilled<00:02:37.680> two

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
weird so bear with me you drilled two

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.460 
weird so bear with me you drilled two
holes<00:02:38.430> in<00:02:38.940> your<00:02:39.120> skull<00:02:39.420> after<00:02:40.110> doing

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
holes in your skull after doing

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.740 
holes in your skull after doing
obviously<00:02:40.830> an<00:02:41.130> advanced<00:02:41.550> MRI<00:02:41.880> and<00:02:42.300> get<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.600> all

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
obviously an advanced MRI and get it all

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.500 
obviously an advanced MRI and get it all
your<00:02:43.200> calculations<00:02:44.190> right<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.550> suppose<00:02:45.150> has<00:02:45.390> to

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
your calculations right I suppose has to

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.850 
your calculations right I suppose has to
do<00:02:45.600> with<00:02:45.690> going<00:02:45.810> in<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.080> basal<00:02:46.380> ganglia<00:02:46.410> which

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
do with going in the basal ganglia which

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.640 
do with going in the basal ganglia which
is<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:48.120> dope<00:02:48.420> new<00:02:48.660> receptors<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.350> don't<00:02:49.530> know

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
is and dope new receptors I don't know

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.460 
is and dope new receptors I don't know
but<00:02:50.190> regardless<00:02:50.880> two<00:02:51.150> metal<00:02:51.450> rods<00:02:51.480> will<00:02:52.350> go

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
but regardless two metal rods will go

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.500 
but regardless two metal rods will go
into<00:02:52.710> your<00:02:53.010> brain<00:02:53.220> that's<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.150> far<00:02:54.330> you're

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
into your brain that's so far you're

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.780 
into your brain that's so far you're
hanging<00:02:54.810> who<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.050> hell<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.230> going<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.440> do<00:02:55.560> this

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
hanging who the hell is going to do this

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.790 
hanging who the hell is going to do this
you're<00:02:56.790> you're<00:02:57.360> full<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.630> shit<00:02:57.750> no<00:02:58.290> no<00:02:58.500> that's

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
you're you're full of shit no no that's

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.150 
you're you're full of shit no no that's
no<00:02:59.520> yeah<00:03:00.410> these<00:03:01.410> metal<00:03:01.650> rods<00:03:01.800> are<00:03:01.950> thin

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
no yeah these metal rods are thin

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.770 
no yeah these metal rods are thin
they're<00:03:02.489> not<00:03:02.610> just<00:03:02.760> like<00:03:02.940> thick<00:03:03.180> things<00:03:03.480> going

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
they're not just like thick things going

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.850 
they're not just like thick things going
into<00:03:03.959> your<00:03:04.050> brain<00:03:04.200> like<00:03:04.380> a<00:03:04.440> bullet<00:03:04.680> or

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
into your brain like a bullet or

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.040 
into your brain like a bullet or
something<00:03:05.220> there's<00:03:06.000> very<00:03:06.270> thin<00:03:06.540> metal<00:03:06.750> rods

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
something there's very thin metal rods

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.080 
something there's very thin metal rods
and<00:03:07.830> these<00:03:08.100> metal<00:03:08.340> rods<00:03:08.520> are<00:03:08.640> attached<00:03:08.880> to

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
and these metal rods are attached to

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.330 
and these metal rods are attached to
wires<00:03:09.270> and<00:03:09.630> these<00:03:09.870> wires<00:03:10.170> it's<00:03:11.040> basically

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
wires and these wires it's basically

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.920 
wires and these wires it's basically
like<00:03:11.550> setting<00:03:11.820> up<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:11.970> car<00:03:12.150> audio<00:03:12.480> system

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
like setting up a car audio system

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.410 
like setting up a car audio system
except<00:03:13.260> in<00:03:13.350> your<00:03:13.440> brain<00:03:14.000> that's<00:03:15.000> how<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.180> look

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
except in your brain that's how I look

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.030 
except in your brain that's how I look
at<00:03:15.570> it<00:03:15.600> because<00:03:15.780> I've<00:03:16.020> been<00:03:16.050> wiring<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.650> lot<00:03:16.920> of

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
at it because I've been wiring a lot of

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.400 
at it because I've been wiring a lot of
car<00:03:17.220> audio<00:03:17.250> systems<00:03:17.880> like<00:03:18.000> leave<00:03:18.410> then

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
car audio systems like leave then

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:26.180 
car audio systems like leave then
basically<00:03:20.370> your<00:03:20.730> wiring<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:23.840> the<00:03:24.860> probes<00:03:25.860> are

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
basically your wiring the the probes are

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.060 
basically your wiring the the probes are
the<00:03:26.310> poles<00:03:26.550> rods<00:03:27.270> whatever<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:27.690> want<00:03:27.840> called

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
the poles rods whatever you want called

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.910 
the poles rods whatever you want called
down<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.100> neck<00:03:29.489> into<00:03:30.350> either<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.530> chest

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
down the neck into either the chest

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.920 
down the neck into either the chest
cavity<00:03:32.100> or<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.610> stomach<00:03:33.030> hmm<00:03:33.860> now<00:03:35.690> look<00:03:36.690> for

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
cavity or the stomach hmm now look for

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.640 
cavity or the stomach hmm now look for
me<00:03:36.959> out<00:03:37.530> if<00:03:38.130> I<00:03:38.280> do<00:03:38.340> get<00:03:38.880> this<00:03:39.150> at<00:03:39.390> all<00:03:39.540> I'm<00:03:40.470> not

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
me out if I do get this at all I'm not

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.930 
me out if I do get this at all I'm not
sure<00:03:40.709> where<00:03:41.160> we're<00:03:41.280> going<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.459> put<00:03:41.700> it<00:03:41.820> either

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
sure where we're going to put it either

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.240 
sure where we're going to put it either
stomach<00:03:42.450> or<00:03:42.600> chest<00:03:42.630> it<00:03:43.020> depends<00:03:43.380> because<00:03:43.920> i<00:03:44.190> do

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
stomach or chest it depends because i do

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.760 
stomach or chest it depends because i do
have<00:03:44.810> chest<00:03:45.810> tix<00:03:46.050> but<00:03:46.200> i<00:03:46.230> also<00:03:46.410> have<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.620> lot<00:03:46.739> of

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
have chest tix but i also have a lot of

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.840 
have chest tix but i also have a lot of
stomach<00:03:47.010> tix<00:03:47.310> oh<00:03:48.800> I<00:03:49.800> mean<00:03:50.040> just<00:03:50.280> hitting<00:03:50.610> Tex

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
stomach tix oh I mean just hitting Tex

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.830 
stomach tix oh I mean just hitting Tex
like<00:03:51.090> not<00:03:51.300> just<00:03:51.570> just<00:03:51.959> you<00:03:52.170> know<00:03:52.230> um

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
like not just just you know um

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.770 
like not just just you know um
regardless<00:03:54.830> it<00:03:54.980> goes<00:03:55.160> into<00:03:55.310> a<00:03:55.370> pacemaker

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
regardless it goes into a pacemaker

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.540 
regardless it goes into a pacemaker
these<00:03:56.780> wires<00:03:57.080> run<00:03:57.500> down<00:03:57.709> into<00:03:58.250> a<00:03:58.310> pacemaker

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
these wires run down into a pacemaker

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.229 
these wires run down into a pacemaker
and<00:03:59.290> basically<00:04:00.290> you<00:04:00.440> can<00:04:00.560> adjust<00:04:00.650> the<00:04:00.980> voltage

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
and basically you can adjust the voltage

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.630 
and basically you can adjust the voltage
until<00:04:02.239> your<00:04:02.810> tix<00:04:03.080> have<00:04:03.290> really<00:04:03.560> diminished<00:04:04.099> in

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
until your tix have really diminished in

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.339 
until your tix have really diminished in
the<00:04:04.760> end<00:04:04.970> in<00:04:05.300> some<00:04:05.540> cases<00:04:05.780> completely

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349 
the end in some cases completely

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:08.740 
the end in some cases completely
disappeared<00:04:06.860> and<00:04:07.400> now<00:04:07.849> to<00:04:07.910> even<00:04:08.180> think<00:04:08.510> of<00:04:08.599> the

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
disappeared and now to even think of the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.550 
disappeared and now to even think of the
thought<00:04:08.989> takes<00:04:09.379> completely<00:04:09.920> disappeared<00:04:10.489> is

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
thought takes completely disappeared is

something<00:04:12.560> that<00:04:12.920> I<00:04:12.980> haven't<00:04:13.280> thought<00:04:13.519> of<00:04:13.580> for

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
something that I haven't thought of for

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.759 
something that I haven't thought of for
years<00:04:14.150> mm-hmm<00:04:15.160> now<00:04:16.160> I<00:04:16.190> know<00:04:16.459> that<00:04:16.579> I<00:04:16.820> have

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
seemed pretty relatively still two years

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.439 
seemed pretty relatively still two years
ago<00:04:20.780> in<00:04:21.049> past<00:04:21.410> videos<00:04:21.530> obviously<00:04:22.449> relatively

still is far much more still in this and

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.650 
still is far much more still in this and
pretty<00:04:27.830> awkward<00:04:28.340> of<00:04:28.520> that<00:04:30.940> but<00:04:31.940> I<00:04:31.970> did<00:04:32.240> have<00:04:32.419> I

pretty awkward of that but I did have I

itch I don't have to shake that would
just<00:04:44.389> be<00:04:44.450> so<00:04:44.690> weird<00:04:45.020> I<00:04:45.229> don't<00:04:45.289> even<00:04:45.500> know<00:04:45.650> how<00:04:45.800> I

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
just be so weird I don't even know how I

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.400 
just be so weird I don't even know how I
would<00:04:45.889> explain<00:04:46.370> it<00:04:46.430> um<00:04:47.120> I<00:04:47.720> don't<00:04:48.020> even<00:04:48.350> know

would explain it um I don't even know
how<00:04:48.500> to<00:04:48.530> think<00:04:48.830> about<00:04:49.100> it<00:04:49.250> to<00:04:49.370> be<00:04:49.430> honest<00:04:50.979> but

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
how to think about it to be honest but

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.830 
how to think about it to be honest but
granted<00:04:52.940> this<00:04:53.090> has<00:04:53.270> been<00:04:53.389> so<00:04:53.630> successful

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
granted this has been so successful

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.350 
granted this has been so successful
among<00:04:54.500> so<00:04:54.710> many<00:04:54.740> people<00:04:55.130> who<00:04:55.729> worst<00:04:55.970> comes<00:04:56.270> to

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
among so many people who worst comes to

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.150 
among so many people who worst comes to
worst<00:04:56.660> and<00:04:56.900> there's<00:04:57.350> a<00:04:57.410> two<00:04:57.590> percent<00:04:57.979> chance

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
worst and there's a two percent chance

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.710 
worst and there's a two percent chance
you<00:04:58.400> could<00:04:58.550> get<00:04:58.669> an<00:04:58.820> infection<00:04:58.910> they<00:04:59.419> remove

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
you could get an infection they remove

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.570 
you could get an infection they remove
the<00:04:59.750> probes<00:05:00.229> can<00:05:00.979> you<00:05:01.130> clear<00:05:01.370> the<00:05:01.460> infection

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
the probes can you clear the infection

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.140 
the probes can you clear the infection
and<00:05:02.180> you<00:05:02.240> do<00:05:02.360> it<00:05:02.479> again<00:05:02.630> if<00:05:02.750> you<00:05:02.870> wish<00:05:03.669> I<00:05:04.669> think

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
and you do it again if you wish I think

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.820 
and you do it again if you wish I think
probes<00:05:05.389> is<00:05:05.539> a<00:05:05.570> kind<00:05:05.780> of<00:05:05.870> funny<00:05:06.080> word<00:05:06.350> so<00:05:06.650> I
