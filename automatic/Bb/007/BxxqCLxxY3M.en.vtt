00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.280
Strange Flames on the International Space Station

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.730
Presented by Science@NASA

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.260
Fire, it is often said, 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.020
is mankind's oldest chemistry experiment. 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.750
For thousands of years, 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.340
people have been mixing the oxygen-rich air of Earth 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.490
with an almost endless variety of fuels to produce hot luminous flame. 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.990
There's an arc of learning about combustion 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.060
that stretches from the earliest campfires of primitive humans 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.220
to the most advanced automobiles 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.800
racing down the superhighways of the 21st century. 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.170
Engineers study burning to produce better internal combustion engines; 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.580
chemists peer into flames looking for exotic reactions; 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.370
chefs experiment with fire to cook better food.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.360
You would think there's not much more to learn. 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.830
Dr. Forman A. Williams, 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.320
a professor of physics at the University of California San Diego, 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.620
would disagree. 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.930
'When it comes to fire,' he says, 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.000
'we're just getting started.'

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.150
Flames are hard to understand 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.950
because they are complicated. 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.160
In an ordinary candle flame, 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.420
thousands of chemical reactions take place. 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.600
Hydrocarbon molecules from the wick are vaporized 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.430
and cracked apart by heat. 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.710
They combine with oxygen to produce light, heat, 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.000
carbon dioxide and water. 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.180
Some of the hydrocarbon fragments form ring-shaped molecules 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.660
called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.250
and, eventually, soot. 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.260
Soot particles can themselves burn or simply drift away as smoke. 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.690
The familiar teardrop shape of the flame 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.860
is an effect caused by gravity. 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.050
Hot air rises and draws fresh cool air behind it. 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.060
This is called buoyancy 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.970
and is what makes the flame shoot up and flicker.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.210
But what happens when you light a candle, 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.810
say, on the International Space Station?

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.700
'In microgravity, flames burn differently-

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.340
they form little spheres,' says Williams.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.610
Space station flame balls 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.720
turn out to be wonderful mini-labs for combustion research. 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.580
Unlike flames on Earth, 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.920
which expand greedily when they need more fuel, 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.900
flame balls let the oxygen come to them. 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.540
Oxygen and fuel combine in a narrow zone at the surface of the sphere, 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.140
not hither and yon throughout the flame. 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.930
It's a much simpler system.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.700
Recently, Williams and colleagues were doing a space station experiment 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.740
called 'FLEX' to learn how to put out fires in microgravity 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.740
when they came across something odd. 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.900
Small droplets of heptane were burning inside the FLEX combustion chamber.  

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.530
As planned, the flames went out, 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.250
but unexpectedly the droplets of fuel continued burning.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.770
'That's right-burning without flames,' says Williams. 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.830
'At first we didn't believe it ourselves.'

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.120
In fact, Williams believes the flames are there, 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.600
just too faint to see. 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.120
'These are cool flames,' he explains.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.830
Ordinary, visible fire burns at a high temperature 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.850
between 2200 and 3100 degrees fahrenheit. 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.620
Heptane flame balls on the space station 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.870
started out in this 'hot fire' regime. 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.950
But as the flame balls cooled and began to go out, 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.860
a different kind of burning took over.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.230
'Cool flames burn at the relatively low temperature 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.390
of 400 to 1000 degrees fahrenheit,' says Williams. 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.290
'And their chemistry is completely different. 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.490
Normal flames produce soot, 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.560
carbon dioxide and water. 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.970
Cool flames produce carbon monoxide and formaldehyde.'

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.930
Similar cool flames have been produced on Earth, 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.430
but they flicker out almost immediately. 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.350
On the space station, however, 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.040
cool flames can burn for nearly a minute.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.920
'There are practical implications of these results,' notes Williams. 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.350
'For instance, they could lead to cleaner auto ignitions.'

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.400
One of the ideas that auto companies have worked on for years is HCCI--

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.800
short for 'homogeneous charge compression ignition.' 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.860
In the automobile cylinder 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.990
instead of a spark there would be a gentler, 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.830
less polluting combustion process throughout the chamber.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.170
'The chemistry of HCCI involves cool flame chemistry,' says Williams. 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.240
'The extra control we get from steady-state burning on the space station 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.390
will give us more accurate chemistry values 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.390
for this type of research.'

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.130
Just getting started, indeed.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.780
