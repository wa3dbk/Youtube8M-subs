now<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.590> reason<00:03:35.010> this<00:03:35.160> works<00:03:35.460> so<00:03:35.610> well<00:03:35.730> is

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
now the reason this works so well is

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.240 
now the reason this works so well is
it's<00:03:36.210> got<00:03:36.390> some<00:03:36.570> lidocaine<00:03:36.870> in<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.560> now<00:03:38.160> you

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
it's got some lidocaine in it now you

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.950 
it's got some lidocaine in it now you
may<00:03:38.460> not<00:03:38.610> know<00:03:38.670> about<00:03:38.970> lidocaine<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.720> this

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
may not know about lidocaine that this

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.370 
may not know about lidocaine that this
helps<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.620> numb<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:41.580> surface<00:03:42.030> area<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.660> this

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
helps to numb the surface area and this

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.120 
helps to numb the surface area and this
works<00:03:43.620> very<00:03:44.070> very<00:03:44.220> well<00:03:45.290> honey<00:03:46.290> is<00:03:46.470> also<00:03:46.500> known
