you<00:02:06.060> what<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.450> looks<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:06.720> without<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.500> is

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
you what it looks like without this is

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.000 
you what it looks like without this is
put<00:02:08.399> some<00:02:08.610> ounces<00:02:08.940> goes<00:02:09.149> right<00:02:09.690> here<00:02:10.140> and

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
put some ounces goes right here and

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.920 
put some ounces goes right here and
right<00:02:11.730> there<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:12.000> didn't<00:02:12.210> have<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.420> remove<00:02:12.570> this

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
right there I didn't have to remove this

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.170 
right there I didn't have to remove this
though<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.590> think<00:02:13.680> this<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.070> AC<00:02:14.250> line<00:02:14.880> I

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
though I think this is the AC line I

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.330 
though I think this is the AC line I
don't<00:02:15.720> have<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.900> remove<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.500> get<00:02:16.680> the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
don't have to remove that to get the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.490 
don't have to remove that to get the
pits<00:02:17.640> done<00:02:17.850> on<00:02:17.970> out<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:19.080> I'm<00:02:19.260> going<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.440> be

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
pits done on out so I'm going to be

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.130 
pits done on out so I'm going to be
putting<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.860> parent<00:02:20.250> one<00:02:20.340> in<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:21.480> parent

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
putting the parent one in and the parent

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.320 
putting the parent one in and the parent
one<00:02:22.260> they<00:02:22.890> actually<00:02:23.190> give<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.520> some<00:02:23.850> grease

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
one they actually give you some grease

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.630 
one they actually give you some grease
that<00:02:24.600> you're<00:02:24.870> supposed<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.350> put<00:02:26.190> on<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.310> bushing

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
that you're supposed to put on a bushing

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.190 
that you're supposed to put on a bushing
so<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:27.150> guess<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.480> just<00:02:27.630> put<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.840> around<00:02:27.900> here

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
so I guess you just put it around here

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.360 
so I guess you just put it around here
and<00:02:28.410> here<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.459> then<00:02:29.580> slide<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:29.970> in<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:31.370> I'll

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
and here and then slide that in and I'll

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.180 
and here and then slide that in and I'll
show<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.640> one<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:32.910> done<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.739> got<00:02:34.980> the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
show you one and done so I got the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.880 
show you one and done so I got the
parent<00:02:35.610> put<00:02:35.760> stop<00:02:36.000> mount<00:02:36.209> installed<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.989> the

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
parent put stop mount installed and the

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.100 
parent put stop mount installed and the
one<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.459> one<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.640> back<00:02:38.940> was<00:02:39.510> really<00:02:39.690> easy<00:02:39.959> to

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
one the one the back was really easy to

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.530 
one the one the back was really easy to
get<00:02:40.260> in<00:02:40.410> but<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.709> one<00:02:40.800> in<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:40.950> front

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
it's kind of hard to get in I had to get

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.810 
it's kind of hard to get in I had to get
a<00:02:44.239> rubber<00:02:45.239> mallet<00:02:45.510> here<00:02:46.070> and<00:02:47.070> just<00:02:47.340> whack<00:02:47.580> on

it<00:02:47.940> a<00:02:48.000> few<00:02:48.030> times<00:02:48.360> back<00:02:48.570> here<00:02:48.870> say<00:02:49.709> get<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.250> down

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
it a few times back here say get it down

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.370 
it a few times back here say get it down
there<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.060> hole<00:02:51.180> but<00:02:51.330> once<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.840> hit<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.230> a

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
there in the hole but once I hit it a

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.870 
there in the hole but once I hit it a
few<00:02:52.410> times<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:52.920> was<00:02:53.010> really<00:02:53.190> easy<00:02:53.310> just<00:02:53.519> bolted

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
few times it was really easy just bolted

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.479 
few times it was really easy just bolted
it<00:02:53.970> back<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.739> everything<00:02:55.739> was<00:02:55.830> good<00:02:55.980> now

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
intercooler back in I'm going to torque

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.680 
intercooler back in I'm going to torque
the<00:03:02.190> bolts<00:03:02.310> down<00:03:02.489> to<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:03.030> torque<00:03:03.390> settings

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
the bolts down to the torque settings

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.100 
the bolts down to the torque settings
that<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.489> Perrin<00:03:05.600> instruction<00:03:06.600> told<00:03:06.870> me<00:03:06.930> to

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
that the Perrin instruction told me to

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.020 
that the Perrin instruction told me to
the<00:03:08.040> back<00:03:08.700> needs<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.090> be<00:03:09.150> torqued<00:03:09.510> down<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:11.030> 43

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
the back needs to be torqued down to 43

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.479 
the back needs to be torqued down to 43
foot-pounds<00:03:12.540> in<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.720> front<00:03:12.900> is<00:03:13.019> 37<00:03:13.590> so<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.310> have

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
foot-pounds in the front is 37 so I have

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.830 
foot-pounds in the front is 37 so I have
a<00:03:14.519> torque<00:03:14.760> wrench<00:03:14.940> when<00:03:15.300> installing<00:03:15.690> this

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
a torque wrench when installing this

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.830 
a torque wrench when installing this
makes<00:03:16.769> things<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.040> lot<00:03:17.130> easier<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.720> yep<00:03:18.720> I'm

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
makes things a lot easier and yep I'm

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.270 
makes things a lot easier and yep I'm
going<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.019> put<00:03:19.140> it<00:03:19.200> back<00:03:19.260> together<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:19.769> I'll

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
going to put it back together and I'll

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.000 
going to put it back together and I'll
see<00:03:20.700> how<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:20.850> is
