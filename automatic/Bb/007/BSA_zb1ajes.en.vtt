we<00:00:05.229> are<00:00:05.410> developing<00:00:05.680> soft-bodied<00:00:06.549> robots<00:00:07.120> and

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:07.359 
we are developing soft-bodied robots and

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:09.509 
we are developing soft-bodied robots and
there<00:00:07.839> are<00:00:07.899> three<00:00:08.139> important<00:00:08.799> things<00:00:08.889> to<00:00:09.340> know

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:09.519 
there are three important things to know

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.079 
there are three important things to know
about<00:00:09.789> these<00:00:10.209> robots<00:00:10.680> first<00:00:11.680> the<00:00:12.460> bodies<00:00:12.879> are

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:13.089 
about these robots first the bodies are

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:15.329 
about these robots first the bodies are
made<00:00:13.330> out<00:00:13.570> of<00:00:13.599> soft<00:00:14.049> silicone<00:00:14.650> and<00:00:14.860> they<00:00:15.099> can

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:15.339 
made out of soft silicone and they can

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.060 
made out of soft silicone and they can
bend<00:00:15.700> and<00:00:15.969> twist<00:00:16.119> because<00:00:16.570> of<00:00:16.810> that<00:00:17.080> they're

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
bend and twist because of that they're

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.179 
bend and twist because of that they're
also<00:00:18.340> inherently<00:00:19.210> safe<00:00:19.570> to<00:00:19.900> be<00:00:20.050> around<00:00:20.189> second

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
also inherently safe to be around second

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.940 
also inherently safe to be around second
because<00:00:21.550> of<00:00:22.210> their<00:00:22.419> body's<00:00:22.930> capability<00:00:23.500> to

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
because of their body's capability to

of very compliant motion and they are

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.280 
of very compliant motion and they are

a<00:01:06.220> soft<00:01:06.790> robot<00:01:07.119> has<00:01:07.329> two<00:01:07.540> parts<00:01:07.930> one<00:01:08.649> a<00:01:08.920> little

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
a soft robot has two parts one a little

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.489 
a soft robot has two parts one a little
bit<00:01:09.460> smaller<00:01:09.729> is<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.090> rigid<00:01:10.569> part<00:01:10.810> we<00:01:11.139> store

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:11.499 
bit smaller is the rigid part we store

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:13.770 
bit smaller is the rigid part we store
all<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:12.189> supporting<00:01:12.609> hardware<00:01:12.789> in<00:01:13.179> the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
all the supporting hardware in the

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.690 
all the supporting hardware in the
second<00:01:14.170> part<00:01:14.319> a<00:01:14.499> little<00:01:14.740> bit<00:01:14.829> larger<00:01:15.249> is<00:01:15.399> the

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
second part a little bit larger is the

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.029 
second part a little bit larger is the
soft<00:01:16.119> body<00:01:16.450> where<00:01:17.139> all<00:01:17.259> the<00:01:17.409> continuous

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
soft body where all the continuous

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:20.190 
soft body where all the continuous
natural<00:01:18.609> movement<00:01:19.060> happens<00:01:19.450> and<00:01:19.689> so<00:01:20.020> when<00:01:20.139> we

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
natural movement happens and so when we

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.989 
natural movement happens and so when we
thought<00:01:20.380> about<00:01:20.439> it<00:01:20.709> a<00:01:20.920> fish<00:01:21.189> made<00:01:21.369> sense<00:01:21.700> it

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:21.999 
thought about it a fish made sense it

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:24.149 
thought about it a fish made sense it
has<00:01:22.209> a<00:01:22.240> very<00:01:22.479> similar<00:01:22.719> structure<00:01:23.109> in<00:01:23.439> the<00:01:24.009> head

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
has a very similar structure in the head

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.219 
has a very similar structure in the head
of<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.399> fish<00:01:24.609> where<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.389> brains<00:01:25.810> are<00:01:26.020> held

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
of the fish where the brains are held

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.739 
of the fish where the brains are held
it's<00:01:26.920> a<00:01:27.039> little<00:01:27.249> bit<00:01:27.340> more<00:01:27.459> rigid<00:01:27.880> but<00:01:28.509> in<00:01:28.659> the

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:28.749 
it's a little bit more rigid but in the

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:30.690 
it's a little bit more rigid but in the
rear<00:01:28.959> of<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.109> fish<00:01:29.469> where<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.159> undulatory

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.760 
rear of the fish where the undulatory
motion<00:01:31.299> happens<00:01:31.719> it's<00:01:32.079> quite<00:01:32.289> soft<00:01:32.590> and

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
motion happens it's quite soft and

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.730 
motion happens it's quite soft and

series of pipes and valves into the body

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.980 
series of pipes and valves into the body
and<00:01:51.399> if<00:01:51.999> you<00:01:52.090> think<00:01:52.270> about<00:01:52.359> it<00:01:52.630> it's<00:01:52.810> very

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
and if you think about it it's very

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.830 
and if you think about it it's very
similar<00:01:53.439> to<00:01:53.590> pulling<00:01:54.279> up<00:01:54.399> a<00:01:54.490> balloon<00:01:54.670> in<00:01:55.090> that

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
similar to pulling up a balloon in that

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.809 
similar to pulling up a balloon in that
case<00:01:56.139> your<00:01:56.740> mouth<00:01:56.979> would<00:01:57.279> be<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.609> pressure

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
case your mouth would be the pressure

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:59.789 
case your mouth would be the pressure
source<00:01:58.209> and<00:01:58.509> the<00:01:58.869> balloon<00:01:59.139> would<00:01:59.289> be<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.590> body

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
source and the balloon would be the body

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.519 
source and the balloon would be the body
actuator<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:00.609> basically<00:02:01.209> by<00:02:01.630> inflating<00:02:02.200> and

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:02.529 
actuator and basically by inflating and
