00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello to you andrew andreevich my 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.130
 YouTube channel all-all ru and we decide 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.960
 task number one hundred and sixty one hundred 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.420
 sixty 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.690
 in how many ways in 9 local 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:20.939
 minibus can accommodate nine 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.220
 passengers means 9 places in the bus 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.140
 because it is written in how many ways 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.680
 in 9 seats in a minibus only 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:36.600
 places 9 let's sketch out 9 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:38.910
 places like this way so 9th place 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.280
 minivan but such minivans 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:47.219
 Of course it does not happen but let it be schematic 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.640
 will be so mean 9 beds and nine people 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.879
 need to place 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:57.239
 when will the first passenger sit down 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:01:00.510
 he can choose from 9 places that is 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.489
 all seats will be free 9 and 1 passenger 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.600
 when he sits down he will choose one 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.580
 place of 9 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.340
 that is, he has options where to sit 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:13.979
 as many as nine will be when the first passenger 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.229
 already sat down no matter where 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.930
 for example here 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.970
 8 places left already included 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.670
 the second passenger and he chooses already between 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.990
 eight places that is where options 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.790
 sit down he will have only 8 for example 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.369
 he got out of here no matter where 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.130
 when the third passenger seats 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.320
 7 and the third passenger will be 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.820
 choose between seven places to sit 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.220
 he will already have 7 places to choose from 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.520
 just ask 2 already busy for example on 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.560
 too , the following forces remain somewhere 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.579
 only 6 free places where he can 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:57.210
 sit down for example sat down when it comes 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.329
 the next all place will be 5 he too 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.850
 one will take five places all he will 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.860
 for choosing at the next place to choose 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.869
 there will be only 4 and it will take 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.110
 next will be only 3 place where 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.320
 sit down 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.040
 and he will take some from the penultimate 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:22.400
 there will be a choice of where to sit from two places 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.990
 so we will multiply by 2 and the last 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.850
 no choice will he can eat 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.860
 so much here so we can still 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.650
 multiply by only one 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.830
 one instead will be for choosing here 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:42.920
 the number of housing calculator counted 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:46.190
 in advance this number is 360 2880 but you can 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.110
 multiply by 9 multiply by 87 out of 2 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.030
 then multiply by 7 multiply by 6 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.150
 multiply by 5 multiply by 4 multiply by 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.860
 3 times 2 and 1 times you can 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:02.030
 im click on 1 here is such a large number 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:11.270
 number of places 3620 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:13.900
 and I am here 360 2880 places and in the task 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.670
 there is a second part 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.100
 in how many ways in 9 local 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.310
 minibus can accommodate nine 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.310
 passengers 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.090
 if one of them knows the route well 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:33.140
 will sit next to the driver gun and we 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.209
 there is a driver right here and a place next to 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:40.810
 him and all 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.810
 bus seats 9 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.740
 but what will not be such a minibus 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:55.650
 see all the places should be nine 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:57.870
 one, two, three 4 5 6 7 8 9 total places 9 1 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.530
 places near the driver and in the cabin more 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.990
 some places all places 9 but the passenger 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.450
 knowing the route will sit next to 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.690
 the driver has no choice where to sit 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:13.080
 he immediately take off with the driver whereas 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.240
 distributed remaining means first 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.820
 of the remaining site to any place from 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:21.350
 eight free because free 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.670
 only 8 left because 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.630
 ninth place is a man who 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.000
 knows the route well 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.800
 near the driver of villages left free 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.820
 only 8 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.390
 so he will choose 1 of the passengers 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.250
 which 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.850
 but also which are good from cars 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.310
 tree will choose from eight places and 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:45.000
 then someone will sit at the next place 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.800
 It will be only 7 to select and have 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.530
 the next places will be only six 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.320
 for choosing next to select 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.120
 there will be only five places 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:58.470
 he is far from a site next 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.120
 there will be only 4 place to choose it 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.210
 choose a place next 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:07.320
 only 3 place to choose and the last 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:10.010
 there will only be 2 place to choose from 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.280
 last but one last place 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.900
 therefore there will not be 8 to multiply 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.400
 by 7 multiplied by 6 multiplied by 5 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.400
 multiply by 4 multiply by 3 multiply by 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:26.370
 2 and multiply by 1 this is obtained if 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:28.080
 you count 40 thousand three hundred twenty well i 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.380
 I read honestly on a calculator 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.600
 because such a clean column 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.669
 it's hard to consider something and the task is the same 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.260
 the most was but one place already in advance 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.419
 one person took and we have left 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.760
 eight seats and eight passengers 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.350
 so 8 multiply by 7 multiply by 6 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.650
 multiply by 5 multiply by 4 multiply by 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:51.169
 3 is multiplied by two and multiplied by 1 and 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:06:04.099
 the previous case here we have 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:06:07.349
 lost somewhere and here we had 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:08.970
 nine passengers and 9 seats therefore 9 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:13.259
 multiply by 8 multiply by 7 multiply by 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:16.199
 6 and so on and here when one 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:18.240
 passenger knowing the place knowing the route 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:20.880
 took a seat next to the driver at you 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:25.110
 eight passengers left and 8 seats 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.669
 so this is how it is calculated 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.620
 I hope that the task was clear to you 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.870
 write in the comments on my channel 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.539
 under this video 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:36.870
 I understand the decision is very important to me from 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:39.180
 you know my channel on youtube all all ru 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.139
