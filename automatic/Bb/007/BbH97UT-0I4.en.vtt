short pieces on the outside and now this

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.180 
short pieces on the outside and now this
gets<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:09.780> little<00:02:09.929> bit<00:02:10.140> difficult<00:02:10.349> tucking<00:02:11.069> it

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
gets a little bit difficult tucking it

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.720 
gets a little bit difficult tucking it
in<00:02:11.340> here<00:02:12.410> with<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.590> other<00:02:13.739> paracord<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.549> there

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
in here with the other paracord in there

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.600 
in here with the other paracord in there
so<00:02:15.739> sometimes<00:02:16.739> you<00:02:16.920> might<00:02:17.069> need<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.430> use<00:02:17.549> a

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
so sometimes you might need to use a

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.170 
so sometimes you might need to use a
separate<00:02:18.120> tool<00:02:18.390> or<00:02:19.280> something<00:02:20.280> but<00:02:20.519> I<00:02:20.730> got<00:02:21.060> it

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
separate tool or something but I got it

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:36.440 
separate tool or something but I got it
through<00:02:21.360> there<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:22.530> then<00:02:24.799> loop<00:02:25.799> it<00:02:25.950> through

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:46.729 

great<00:02:38.180> short<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.300> on<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.629> outside<00:02:45.560> all<00:02:46.560> right

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
great short in on the outside all right

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.410 
great short in on the outside all right
so<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:46.950> got<00:02:47.099> my<00:02:47.220> two<00:02:47.280> little<00:02:47.610> tighten<00:02:48.390> down

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
so I got my two little tighten down

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.990 
so I got my two little tighten down
loops<00:02:48.930> on<00:02:49.519> the<00:02:50.519> female<00:02:51.060> end<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:53.550> paracord

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
loops on the female end of the paracord

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.220 
loops on the female end of the paracord
I<00:02:54.150> always<00:02:54.390> do<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:55.730> loop<00:02:56.730> facing<00:02:57.599> to<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.780> front

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
I always do the loop facing to the front

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.559 
I always do the loop facing to the front
just<00:02:58.500> ends<00:02:59.489> up<00:02:59.580> looking<00:02:59.790> better<00:03:00.180> when<00:03:00.420> you're

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
just ends up looking better when you're

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.380 
just ends up looking better when you're
finished<00:03:01.280> all<00:03:02.280> right<00:03:02.400> now<00:03:02.819> I<00:03:04.940> go<00:03:05.940> down<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.330> the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
finished all right now I go down to the

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:18.710 
finished all right now I go down to the
other<00:03:06.599> end<00:03:07.790> of<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.900> cords<00:03:15.170> make<00:03:16.170> sure<00:03:17.720> get
