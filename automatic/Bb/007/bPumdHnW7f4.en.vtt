00:00:06.025 --> 00:00:06.992
Hi, I’m Francis, 

00:00:06.992 --> 00:00:09.973
the host of this show "Cooking with Dog."

00:00:21.906 --> 00:00:27.845
First, cut four slices from the sweet potato about a quarter inch thick.

00:00:29.537 --> 00:00:33.930
Sweet potatoes are hard so be careful not to cut yourself.

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:39.372
Cut the slices into quarter inch cubes.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.384
Place the potato into a bowl of water 

00:00:48.384 --> 00:00:52.546
and let it sit for 5 minutes to reduce the bitterness.

00:00:55.186 --> 00:00:58.412
Meanwhile, add the water to the brown sugar 

00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:01.414
and dissolve it completely using a spatula.

00:01:05.412 --> 00:01:09.363
Now, drain the potato with a mesh strainer 

00:01:09.363 --> 00:01:11.791
and place it onto a paper towel.

00:01:14.437 --> 00:01:16.852
Remove the excess water thoroughly 

00:01:16.852 --> 00:01:19.064
and place it onto a plate.

00:01:20.304 --> 00:01:22.807
Let’s make the batter for the mushipan.

00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:25.634
Combine the cake flour, 

00:01:27.383 --> 00:01:28.799
baking powder 

00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:33.340
and a sprinkle of salt in a mesh strainer 

00:01:35.252 --> 00:01:38.043
and sift the powders into a bowl.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.385
Pour the brown sugar water into the center of the flour 

00:01:45.385 --> 00:01:48.209
while mixing with a balloon whisk.

00:01:48.453 --> 00:01:52.413
Gradually mix in the flour from the center to the outside.

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:56.140
This will help avoid pockets of dry flour.

00:01:58.867 --> 00:02:01.543
Mix until smooth as shown.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.974
Next, place a cupcake liner into each cupcake tin.

00:02:11.516 --> 00:02:16.590
You can also use a regular cupcake pan or silicon baking cups.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.840
Pour the batter into the liners evenly. 

00:02:27.144 --> 00:02:29.763
Use a spatula to clean the bowl, 

00:02:29.763 --> 00:02:32.408
distributing the remaining batter.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.426
Place the sweet potato cubes onto the batter.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.164
Sprinkle on the brown sugar.

00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:52.172
Finally, place the raisins on top.

00:02:58.367 --> 00:03:02.035
Lightly tap on the toppings to attach them to the batter.

00:03:03.015 --> 00:03:05.764
And now, let's steam the mushipan.

00:03:06.203 --> 00:03:10.715
Turn off the burner to avoid burning yourself with the hot steam.

00:03:12.623 --> 00:03:17.459
Place the cupcake tins into the steamer using a pair of tongs.

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.421
Replace the lid 

00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:30.185
and steam the mushipan on medium high heat for about 12 minutes.

00:03:31.103 --> 00:03:37.357
Wrapping the lid with a dish towel will help prevent the condensation from dripping off the lid.

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.251
Now, let’s remove the mushipan.

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.565
Pierce the mushipan with a bamboo stick.

00:03:46.098 --> 00:03:49.204
If the stick is clean, they are ready.

00:03:50.151 --> 00:03:52.361
Turn off the burner 

00:03:54.048 --> 00:03:58.111
and place the cupcake tins onto a tray with the tongs.

00:04:04.644 --> 00:04:07.697
Remove the mushipan from the cupcake tins 

00:04:07.697 --> 00:04:09.875
and place them onto a plate.

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.586
This recipe doesn’t have any butter or eggs so it is easy to make.

00:04:17.056 --> 00:04:22.150
The ingredients are simple so this can be an excellent dessert for children.

00:04:22.514 --> 00:04:26.750
We also recommend dried figs and walnuts for toppings.

00:04:31.978 --> 00:04:35.886
This healthy dessert will remind you of a comforting taste.

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:38.597
Good luck in the kitchen.
