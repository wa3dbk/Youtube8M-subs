00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149 

I<00:00:00.149> just<00:00:00.570> want<00:00:00.750> to<00:00:00.810> get<00:00:00.900> back<00:00:01.110> to<00:00:01.350> the<00:00:01.949> heights

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
I just want to get back to the heights

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.940 
I just want to get back to the heights
of<00:00:02.340> 2012<00:00:03.210> really<00:00:03.540> so<00:00:03.780> you<00:00:04.620> know<00:00:04.740> I've<00:00:04.830> had<00:00:04.890> a

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
of 2012 really so you know I've had a

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.880 
of 2012 really so you know I've had a
good<00:00:05.130> winter<00:00:05.339> up<00:00:05.580> to<00:00:05.700> now<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:06.649> think<00:00:07.649> the

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
good winter up to now and I think the

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.290 
good winter up to now and I think the
one<00:00:08.040> thing<00:00:08.250> that<00:00:08.309> comes<00:00:08.639> with<00:00:08.849> disappointment

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
one thing that comes with disappointment

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.780 
one thing that comes with disappointment
is<00:00:09.630> you<00:00:09.870> build<00:00:10.050> from<00:00:10.349> it<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.769> think<00:00:10.830> you'd

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
is you build from it and I think you'd

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.310 
is you build from it and I think you'd
never<00:00:11.969> have<00:00:12.210> that<00:00:12.389> success<00:00:12.840> if<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.110> didn't

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
never have that success if you didn't

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.650 
never have that success if you didn't
have<00:00:13.410> this<00:00:13.559> disappointing<00:00:14.280> year<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:14.759> as

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.270 
gonna hurt 2014 I think you know there's
a<00:01:20.420> lot<00:01:20.660> of<00:01:20.690> riders<00:01:20.930> within<00:01:21.259> Team<00:01:21.590> Sky<00:01:21.890> that<00:01:22.130> can

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
a lot of riders within Team Sky that can

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.910 
a lot of riders within Team Sky that can
potentially<00:01:23.140> score<00:01:24.140> some<00:01:24.380> big<00:01:24.770> results

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
potentially score some big results

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.770 
potentially score some big results
throughout<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:25.610> year<00:01:25.759> obviously<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:26.690> know

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
throughout the year obviously you know

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.870 
throughout the year obviously you know
Chris<00:01:27.080> trim<00:01:27.410> will<00:01:28.130> go<00:01:28.250> back<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:28.700> try<00:01:28.850> and

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
Chris trim will go back and try and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.660 
Chris trim will go back and try and
defend<00:01:29.180> his<00:01:29.360> Tour<00:01:29.600> title<00:01:29.960> but<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:31.310> one<00:01:31.490> week

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
defend his Tour title but the one week

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.749 
defend his Tour title but the one week
stayed<00:01:32.000> races<00:01:32.450> the<00:01:32.990> classics<00:01:33.640> so<00:01:34.640> I<00:01:34.700> think

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
stayed races the classics so I think

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.889 
stayed races the classics so I think
there's<00:01:35.000> a<00:01:35.060> lot<00:01:35.210> of<00:01:35.270> opportunities<00:01:35.869> I<00:01:36.850> don't

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
there's a lot of opportunities I don't

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.090 
there's a lot of opportunities I don't
really<00:01:38.899> take<00:01:39.140> an<00:01:39.320> active<00:01:39.649> interest<00:01:39.679> in

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
really take an active interest in

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.600 
really take an active interest in
cycling<00:01:40.580> more<00:01:40.880> outside<00:01:41.360> of<00:01:41.390> the<00:01:41.600> team<00:01:41.840> and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
cycling more outside of the team and

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.550 
cycling more outside of the team and
there's<00:01:43.610> always<00:01:43.759> new<00:01:44.149> faces<00:01:44.720> at<00:01:44.960> races<00:01:45.380> and

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
there's always new faces at races and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.740 
there's always new faces at races and
new<00:01:45.740> riders<00:01:46.190> each<00:01:46.340> you<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:47.000> you<00:01:47.119> sort<00:01:47.539> of<00:01:47.600> lose

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
new riders each you and you sort of lose

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.060 
new riders each you and you sort of lose
track<00:01:47.960> of<00:01:48.200> who's<00:01:48.350> doing<00:01:48.619> well<00:01:48.830> and<00:01:48.890> who's

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
track of who's doing well and who's

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.130 
track of who's doing well and who's
doing<00:01:49.369> what<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:49.970> I<00:01:50.390> think<00:01:50.570> so<00:01:50.689> much<00:01:50.840> of<00:01:50.990> the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
doing what and I think so much of the

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.859 
doing what and I think so much of the
focus<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:51.979> is<00:01:52.159> around<00:01:52.700> Team<00:01:53.030> Sky<00:01:53.360> and<00:01:53.540> we<00:01:53.659> seem

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
focus and is around Team Sky and we seem

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.260 
focus and is around Team Sky and we seem
to<00:01:54.020> have<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.290> best<00:01:54.439> riders<00:01:54.799> in<00:01:54.829> the<00:01:54.979> world<00:01:55.270> is

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
to have the best riders in the world is

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.969 
to have the best riders in the world is
it<00:01:56.479> it's<00:01:56.570> difficult<00:01:56.720> outside<00:01:57.350> as<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.650> riders

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
it it's difficult outside as the riders

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.710 
it it's difficult outside as the riders
you<00:01:58.070> already<00:01:58.280> know<00:01:58.400> like<00:01:58.430> Mark<00:01:58.970> Cavendish<00:01:59.270> in
