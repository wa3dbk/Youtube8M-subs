running

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:13.770 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:20.210 

coming<00:00:14.770> up<00:00:14.860> an<00:00:14.950> attitude<00:00:15.720> the<00:00:16.720> bubbler<00:00:17.020> here

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.790 

show<00:00:21.220> you<00:00:21.280> I<00:00:21.670> am<00:00:21.970> running<00:00:22.240> them

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
show you I am running them

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.380 
show you I am running them
I<00:00:23.890> mention<00:00:24.550> into<00:00:24.730> off<00:00:24.849> the<00:00:24.880> relay<00:00:25.269> here

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
I mention into off the relay here

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.420 
I mention into off the relay here
and<00:00:27.480> who's<00:00:27.660> running

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.950 

just<00:00:31.060> shy<00:00:31.240> of<00:00:31.270> 14<00:00:31.990> volts

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.630 

so

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.310 

I<00:00:38.670> don't<00:00:39.269> have<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:40.999> DC<00:00:41.999> amp<00:00:42.269> meter<00:00:42.449> just<00:00:42.600> yet<00:00:43.050> so

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
I don't have a DC amp meter just yet so

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.369 
I don't have a DC amp meter just yet so
I<00:00:43.350> can't<00:00:43.679> measure<00:00:43.859> the<00:00:44.039> amps<00:00:44.309> coming<00:00:44.579> out<00:00:45.379> or

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
I can't measure the amps coming out or

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.219 
I can't measure the amps coming out or
going<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> cell<00:00:46.979> I<00:00:47.010> should<00:00:47.250> say<00:00:48.199> right<00:00:49.199> now

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:49.229 
going to the cell I should say right now

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:52.250 
going to the cell I should say right now
the<00:00:49.409> it's<00:00:50.129> got<00:00:50.280> some<00:00:50.460> decent<00:00:50.609> production<00:00:51.260> what

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
the it's got some decent production what

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.490 
the it's got some decent production what
I<00:00:52.289> did<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.100> took<00:00:53.159> a<00:00:55.609> one<00:00:56.609> gallon<00:00:57.320> jug<00:00:58.320> of

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
I did is I took a one gallon jug of

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.289 
I did is I took a one gallon jug of
distilled<00:00:58.829> water<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.339> added<00:01:00.210> half<00:01:01.109> a

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:02.299 
distilled water and added half a

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:08.210 
distilled water and added half a
tablespoon<00:01:03.299> of<00:01:06.229> this<00:01:07.229> robic<00:01:07.649> crystal<00:01:08.039> drain

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
tablespoon of this robic crystal drain

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.649 
tablespoon of this robic crystal drain
opener<00:01:11.330> as<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.509> see<00:01:12.600> here<00:01:12.780> which<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:12.990> a

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
opener as you can see here which is a

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.529 
opener as you can see here which is a
100<00:01:15.659> cent<00:01:16.640> sodium<00:01:17.640> hydroxide<00:01:19.940> I<00:01:20.940> started<00:01:21.450> with

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
100 cent sodium hydroxide I started with

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.219 
100 cent sodium hydroxide I started with
half<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:22.049> tablespoon<00:01:22.549> and<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.700> put<00:01:23.940> between<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
half a tablespoon and I put between the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.770 
half a tablespoon and I put between the
cell<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:26.130> bubbler<00:01:26.580> took<00:01:26.789> about<00:01:27.030> half<00:01:27.539> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
cell and the bubbler took about half the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.210 
cell and the bubbler took about half the
gallon<00:01:29.209> so<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:31.409> that's<00:01:31.590> particularly<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
gallon so so that's particularly the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.639 
gallon so so that's particularly the
production<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.700> put<00:01:32.880> down<00:01:32.970> right<00:01:33.149> now<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:34.110> will

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
production is put down right now I will

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.169 
production is put down right now I will
probably<00:01:34.890> add<00:01:36.049> another<00:01:37.049> half<00:01:37.350> tablespoon<00:01:38.280> to

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
probably add another half tablespoon to

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:40.850 
probably add another half tablespoon to
the<00:01:39.270> mix<00:01:39.450> here<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.990> see<00:01:40.140> if<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.350> will<00:01:40.470> increase

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
the mix here to see if it will increase

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.090 
the mix here to see if it will increase
the<00:01:41.039> production

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
the production

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.740 
the production
and<00:01:43.190> here<00:01:43.430> very<00:01:43.790> soon<00:01:43.970> I'm<00:01:44.120> going<00:01:44.240> happy<00:01:44.540> at<00:01:44.630> a

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
and here very soon I'm going happy at a

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.510 
and here very soon I'm going happy at a
DC<00:01:45.310> ant<00:01:46.310> meter<00:01:47.470> clamp-on<00:01:48.470> ammeter<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:49.250> we<00:01:49.370> can

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
DC ant meter clamp-on ammeter so we can

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.760 
DC ant meter clamp-on ammeter so we can
measure<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.970> amps<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.720> see<00:01:51.410> how<00:01:51.530> that's

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
measure the amps and see how that's

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.170 
measure the amps and see how that's
affecting<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.430> Union

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
affecting the Union

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.490 
affecting the Union
but<00:01:53.750> there<00:01:54.230> is<00:01:54.380> installed<00:01:55.690> in<00:01:56.690> kind<00:01:57.080> to<00:01:57.230> see<00:01:57.410> it

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
but there is installed in kind to see it

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.550 
but there is installed in kind to see it
down<00:01:58.010> here<00:01:58.070> I<00:02:01.570> think<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:02.630> can<00:02:02.750> kind<00:02:03.290> of<00:02:03.380> see

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
down here I think you can kind of see

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.620 
down here I think you can kind of see
the<00:02:03.620> tube<00:02:03.890> there<00:02:04.160> that's<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.210> tube<00:02:05.390> coming

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
the tube there that's the tube coming

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.740 
the tube there that's the tube coming
out<00:02:05.780> of<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:05.960> top<00:02:06.170> of<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.830> sail<00:02:07.100> and<00:02:07.750> that's

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
out of the top of the sail and that's

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.300 
out of the top of the sail and that's
running<00:02:09.050> now<00:02:09.979> up<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:11.810> top<00:02:12.320> part<00:02:12.530> there<00:02:13.280> is

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
running now up to the top part there is

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.280 
running now up to the top part there is
the<00:02:13.460> sail<00:02:13.790> coming<00:02:14.570> out<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.750> bottom<00:02:14.840> of

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
the sail coming out the bottom of

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.620 
the sail coming out the bottom of
bubbler<00:02:15.770> going<00:02:16.160> through<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.430> bottom<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:17.360> the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
bubbler going through the bottom of the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.250 
bubbler going through the bottom of the
cell

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.520 

so<00:02:21.090> it's<00:02:22.090> works<00:02:22.330> everything's<00:02:23.290> installed

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
so it's works everything's installed

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.360 
so it's works everything's installed
running<00:02:24.489> pretty<00:02:24.670> smooth<00:02:26.099> I'll<00:02:27.099> play<00:02:27.250> around

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
running pretty smooth I'll play around

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.070 
running pretty smooth I'll play around
with<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.700> electrolytes<00:02:28.150> more<00:02:28.390> see<00:02:28.599> so<00:02:29.049> I

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
with the electrolytes more see so I

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.910 
with the electrolytes more see so I
think<00:02:29.230> about<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.530> production<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:31.030> next<00:02:31.299> step

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
think about the production the next step

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.800 
think about the production the next step
once<00:02:32.920> I<00:02:33.040> get<00:02:33.159> that<00:02:33.250> figured<00:02:33.549> out<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:33.940> gotta

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
once I get that figured out I gotta

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.059 
once I get that figured out I gotta
figure<00:02:34.930> out<00:02:35.080> what<00:02:35.170> I'm<00:02:35.260> going<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.530> do<00:02:35.709> about<00:02:35.920> a

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
figure out what I'm going to do about a

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.660 
figure out what I'm going to do about a
flashback<00:02:36.910> arrestor<00:02:38.190> running<00:02:39.190> between<00:02:39.489> the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
flashback arrestor running between the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.000 
flashback arrestor running between the
port<00:02:39.879> here<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:40.150> a<00:02:40.810> port<00:02:41.410> I'm<00:02:41.530> going<00:02:41.739> to<00:02:41.830> add

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
port here and a port I'm going to add

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.410 
port here and a port I'm going to add
right<00:02:42.879> here<00:02:43.120> on<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.510> intake<00:02:43.780> just<00:02:44.049> before<00:02:44.830> the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
right here on the intake just before the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.170 
right here on the intake just before the
before<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.629> butterfly<00:02:47.200> valve<00:02:47.440> in<00:02:47.620> there<00:02:48.180> so

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
before the butterfly valve in there so

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.140 
before the butterfly valve in there so
once<00:02:49.420> I<00:02:49.450> get<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.599> figured<00:02:49.930> out

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
once I get that figured out

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.690 
once I get that figured out
we'll<00:02:52.150> continue<00:02:52.660> on<00:02:53.049> all<00:02:53.590> right

all right guys I just want to give you a
little<00:02:57.010> show<00:02:57.250> of<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.520> production<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.240> this

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
little show of the production of this

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.699 
little show of the production of this
unit<00:02:58.720> I<00:02:59.099> did<00:03:00.099> add<00:03:00.340> another<00:03:00.730> 1/2<00:03:01.060> teaspoon<00:03:01.720> it's

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
unit I did add another 1/2 teaspoon it's

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.030 
unit I did add another 1/2 teaspoon it's
the<00:03:02.830> mix<00:03:03.040> here<00:03:03.459> so<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.940> has<00:03:05.430> three<00:03:06.430> fours<00:03:06.670> -<00:03:06.910> 1

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
the mix here so it has three fours - 1

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.070 
the mix here so it has three fours - 1
teaspoon<00:03:09.040> or<00:03:09.640> sorry<00:03:09.940> tablespoon<00:03:10.599> I<00:03:10.810> had<00:03:10.959> it

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
teaspoon or sorry tablespoon I had it

teaspoon or sorry tablespoon I had it
another<00:03:11.230> 1/2<00:03:11.470> tablespoon<00:03:12.209> so<00:03:13.209> it<00:03:13.300> has<00:03:13.450> about

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
another 1/2 tablespoon so it has about

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.590 
another 1/2 tablespoon so it has about
one<00:03:13.959> full<00:03:14.200> tablespoon<00:03:14.770> of<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:16.120> sodium

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
one full tablespoon of the sodium

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.010 
one full tablespoon of the sodium
hydroxide<00:03:17.170> in<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:18.069> water<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:19.660> can<00:03:19.780> kind<00:03:19.989> of

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
hydroxide in the water you can kind of

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.550 
hydroxide in the water you can kind of
see<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:21.430> gas<00:03:21.610> coming<00:03:21.910> out<00:03:22.060> there

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.650

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
just to show you the bubbles that put

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.479 
just to show you the bubbles that put
out<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:28.010> look<00:03:28.130> at<00:03:28.220> that

out and look at that

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.510 
out and look at that
this<00:03:28.790> thing<00:03:29.000> is<00:03:29.270> cranking<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:30.190> mean<00:03:31.190> it<00:03:31.310> is

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
this thing is cranking I mean it is

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.980 
this thing is cranking I mean it is
putting<00:03:31.760> out<00:03:31.910> some<00:03:32.120> serious<00:03:32.450> gas

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.740 

I<00:03:35.140> need<00:03:35.710> to<00:03:36.180> definitely<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.300> make<00:03:37.420> some<00:03:37.570> type

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
I need to definitely to make some type

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.490 
I need to definitely to make some type
of<00:03:38.250> HH<00:03:39.250> o<00:03:40.290> meter<00:03:43.020> like<00:03:44.020> you've<00:03:44.140> seen<00:03:44.290> in<00:03:44.440> other

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
of HH o meter like you've seen in other

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.880 
of HH o meter like you've seen in other
videos<00:03:45.120> with<00:03:46.120> a<00:03:46.150> 2-liter<00:03:46.540> bottle<00:03:46.840> with<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:47.770> 1

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
videos with a 2-liter bottle with the 1

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.640 
videos with a 2-liter bottle with the 1
litre<00:03:48.040> bottle<00:03:48.310> in<00:03:48.400> it<00:03:48.520> or<00:03:48.670> whatever<00:03:49.080> but<00:03:50.080> I

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
litre bottle in it or whatever but I

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.070 
litre bottle in it or whatever but I
have<00:03:50.740> a<00:03:50.800> good<00:03:50.920> feeling<00:03:51.100> this<00:03:51.310> thing<00:03:51.840> is<00:03:52.840> really

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
have a good feeling this thing is really

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.300 
have a good feeling this thing is really
gonna<00:03:53.290> perform<00:03:53.470> well<00:03:53.680> I<00:03:53.800> mean<00:03:54.010> this<00:03:54.100> thing<00:03:54.280> is

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
gonna perform well I mean this thing is

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.530 
gonna perform well I mean this thing is
cranking<00:03:54.850> I<00:03:54.940> mean<00:03:55.060> look<00:03:55.150> at<00:03:55.210> that

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
cranking I mean look at that

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.280 
cranking I mean look at that
it's<00:03:56.230> just<00:03:56.440> going<00:03:56.560> crazy<00:03:56.770> in<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.160> water<00:03:58.260> so<00:03:59.260> I

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
it's just going crazy in that water so I

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.170 
it's just going crazy in that water so I
am<00:03:59.620> I'm<00:04:00.010> pretty<00:04:00.280> psyched<00:04:00.520> about<00:04:00.640> that<00:04:00.940> I

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
am I'm pretty psyched about that I

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.970 
am I'm pretty psyched about that I
definitely<00:04:02.140> want<00:04:02.260> to<00:04:02.320> get<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:03.660> DC<00:04:04.710> ant<00:04:05.710> meter

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
definitely want to get the DC ant meter

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.120 
definitely want to get the DC ant meter
so<00:04:06.670> I<00:04:06.700> can<00:04:06.880> measure<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.300> amps<00:04:07.770> being<00:04:08.770> drawn<00:04:08.980> by

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
so I can measure the amps being drawn by

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.780 
so I can measure the amps being drawn by
this<00:04:09.190> units<00:04:09.550> I<00:04:09.670> don't<00:04:09.850> overwork<00:04:10.600> alternator

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
this units I don't overwork alternator

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.250 
this units I don't overwork alternator
which<00:04:12.900> this<00:04:13.900> is<00:04:14.080> a<00:04:14.110> 2003<00:04:14.860> Chevy<00:04:15.130> Avalanche<00:04:16.260> and

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
which this is a 2003 Chevy Avalanche and

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.990 
which this is a 2003 Chevy Avalanche and
I<00:04:17.350> believe<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.860> stock<00:04:18.100> alternator<00:04:18.580> on<00:04:18.670> this

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
I believe the stock alternator on this

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.290 
I believe the stock alternator on this
one<00:04:19.180> is<00:04:19.360> a<00:04:19.390> hundred<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.020> five<00:04:20.170> amps<00:04:20.680> which<00:04:21.300> is

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
one is a hundred and five amps which is

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.120 
one is a hundred and five amps which is
not<00:04:22.600> gonna<00:04:22.780> be<00:04:22.840> sufficient<00:04:22.990> while<00:04:23.920> writing

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
not gonna be sufficient while writing

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.320 
not gonna be sufficient while writing
this<00:04:24.250> unit<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:24.730> everything<00:04:25.090> else<00:04:25.180> in<00:04:25.300> the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
this unit and everything else in the

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.930 
this unit and everything else in the
truck<00:04:25.480> AC<00:04:25.720> radio<00:04:26.340> power<00:04:27.340> windows<00:04:27.610> all<00:04:27.790> that

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
truck AC radio power windows all that

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.780 
truck AC radio power windows all that
good<00:04:28.390> stuff<00:04:28.600> so<00:04:28.900> I<00:04:29.530> will<00:04:29.770> also<00:04:29.980> probably<00:04:30.160> be<00:04:30.610> in

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
good stuff so I will also probably be in

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.090 
good stuff so I will also probably be in
a<00:04:30.850> future<00:04:31.030> upgrading<00:04:31.600> that<00:04:31.630> to<00:04:32.410> a<00:04:32.440> minimum<00:04:32.890> of

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
a future upgrading that to a minimum of

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.230 
a future upgrading that to a minimum of
a<00:04:33.250> 200<00:04:33.820> amp<00:04:33.940> alternator<00:04:34.300> if<00:04:34.660> not<00:04:34.900> bigger<00:04:36.240> but

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
a 200 amp alternator if not bigger but

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.230 
a 200 amp alternator if not bigger but
there<00:04:37.540> you<00:04:37.630> go<00:04:38.130> there<00:04:39.130> is<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.790> unit<00:04:40.060> just

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
there you go there is the unit just

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.030 
there you go there is the unit just
cranking<00:04:40.780> away<00:04:40.900> I<00:04:41.290> mean<00:04:41.410> it<00:04:41.500> is<00:04:41.620> just<00:04:41.650> bubble

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
cranking away I mean it is just bubble

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.909 
cranking away I mean it is just bubble
not<00:04:42.160> crazy

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.980 

I<00:04:44.949> would<00:04:45.789> guess<00:04:45.939> this<00:04:46.090> this<00:04:46.539> is<00:04:46.659> putting<00:04:46.900> out

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
I would guess this this is putting out

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.080 
I would guess this this is putting out
at<00:04:47.889> least<00:04:48.039> two<00:04:48.310> to<00:04:48.400> three<00:04:48.430> liters<00:04:48.789> a<00:04:49.060> minute

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
at least two to three liters a minute

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.420 
at least two to three liters a minute
right<00:04:49.419> now<00:04:49.650> just<00:04:50.650> by<00:04:50.860> eyeballing<00:04:51.039> it

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
right now just by eyeballing it

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.249 
right now just by eyeballing it
obviously<00:04:51.849> that's<00:04:52.120> just<00:04:52.180> a<00:04:52.330> guess<00:04:52.479> on<00:04:52.840> my<00:04:52.900> part

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
obviously that's just a guess on my part

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:58.090 
obviously that's just a guess on my part
but<00:04:53.529> but<00:04:54.340> it<00:04:54.460> is<00:04:54.610> this<00:04:55.120> really

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.800 

you<00:04:58.370> can<00:04:58.490> see<00:04:58.640> the

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.270 

just<00:05:04.230> working<00:05:04.530> like<00:05:04.620> crazy

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
just working like crazy

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.060 
just working like crazy
I'm<00:05:06.520> really<00:05:06.820> excited<00:05:07.000> about<00:05:07.330> this<00:05:07.570> I<00:05:08.530> hope<00:05:08.920> you

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
I'm really excited about this I hope you

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.240 
I'm really excited about this I hope you
