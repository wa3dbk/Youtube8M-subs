00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.500
 finally there is something new for you 

00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:06.629
 racing game drive works we made ourselves 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.460
 Worrying because there was last 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.889
 rather bad news to ps4 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.809
 exclusive title once as the launch title of 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.000
 Sony console was planned drive works 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.350
 namely delayed and ended 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.700
 march then left the game 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.160
 director paul rodgers that 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.660
 developer studio we are relieved 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.210
 that there is finally a release date 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.920
 gives the october 18 and the evolution 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.350
 finally scenes of a race with 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.360
 complete driver field shows in this 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.030
 clip a maserati gran turismo in 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.620
 chile over a winding mountain course 12 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.629
 cars on the way and on the way 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.879
 on top of that was the day night cycle and 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.710
 that speeds up 30 times that ensures 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.420
 a quick dawn a fancier 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.219
 Effect we have in addition to weather and city 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.010
 set the time of day for every race 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.449
 yes and because the video are scenes 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.100
 which were published by the developer 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.319
 if not judge to what extent 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.239
 the driving physics has changed well 

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:55.980
 but we noticed that the graphics 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.140
 since the last appearance of the game to 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.140
 gamescom in cologne has improved significantly 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.020
 particularly chic is the shadow 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.020
 the car succeeded before us 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.200
 We also dashboard of the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.450
 brake lights is lit in front of us 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.979
 looks great 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.049
 our scene is reflected in this scene 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.030
 dare even in the paint of the counterparty 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.250
 and here the complete game world on the 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.020
 bonnet on the lighting system 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.119
 as well as the huge credible ones 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.960
 evolution worlds can be real 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.210
 be proud 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.680
 but a little criticism must be ours 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.899
 The tracks are still too dull 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.420
 everywhere the same pennants and tribunes 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.369
 hardly striking sights that likes 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.200
 be realistic for our taste 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.729
 but it may like more spectacular around 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.590
 race gives something more impressive 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.840
 is in the second behind new clip from two 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.640
 fold on board a pagani zonda r 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.740
 we race into india into the twilight 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.500
 again with 30 times faster 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.479
 daytime this venue becomes india 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.369
 by the way, with eleven tracks and ten cars 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.289
 in the special ps plus version of the 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.909
 be included in the release game 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.080
 free for subscribers of the online 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.539
 service is available 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.100
 in it all modes are playable and also 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.679
 all online features included 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.150
 who stretch the complete 55 and 50 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.070
 cars of the full version wants to buy 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.290
 either the blu ray or evaluates the 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.170
 plus version for 50 euro to the full version 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.549
 fair trade in physics 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.410
 Incidentally, the developers want one 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.600
 balance of realism and accessibility 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.820
 achieve something like project gotham 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.860
 racing for xbox should all be possible 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.690
 play credible and idiosyncratic 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.180
 easy to learn but hard to do 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.070
 mastering just belongs to this concept 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.320
 By the way, that there is no tuning 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.640
 There are options for every dare you want 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.359
 even stand a certain character 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.359
 to have 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.049
 The game modes are the standard 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.819
 We race against other cars 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.099
 or the clock in a circle or whether 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.260
 Sprintstrecken are a special feature 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.599
 doing the spontaneous challenges each 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.430
 Everybody really just turns every curve 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.560
 stretch section can be a kind of mini 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.629
 challenge we show that 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.640
 one based on an old gamescon figures 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.379
 we race into a time trial 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.569
 ghost data of other players behind 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.340
 a normal time trial that way 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.860
 to end as soon as possible 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.349
 but these sections in front of us is blue 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.430
 there marks our ideal line in 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.230
 the curve measured 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.239
 we are doing that very well and we will 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.129
 curves best there are bonuspunkte 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.569
 but we still drive that time 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.549
 we can do this mini 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.709
 so ignore challenge if you 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.329
 We can not match our car 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.190
 do it by the way, or we can 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.409
 try to get us off the skid 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.329
 and hate ourselves great that no 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:35.010
 only keystroke is needed and 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.090
 that these tasks are always new on the 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.799
 route are distributed 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.510
 we can tell you to create it yourself 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.510
 based on our services 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.380
 Finally back to India where 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.880
 it really becomes clear that the graphics 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.700
 since the gamescom one took 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.650
 it has made a significant leap 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.720
 angry that it works almost ten 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.400
 months late but that seems 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.060
 at least the optics of the racing game good 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.890
 to do 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.390
 Let's hope that the gameplay on 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.400
 the end is true and that is the developers 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.870
 succeed the whole affair until the 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.540
 release a bit pepp too 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.950
 to lend 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.330
 just do not stop that moment 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.010
 the developers actually have in 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.170
 last second even more videos 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.480
 this time from Canada where one 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.910
 pagani huayra pulls his rounds and 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.250
 God make a great impression of it 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.330
 reflection and finally one 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.860
 daylight race 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.000
 I would say that we let ourselves 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.000
 Just walk a bit more
