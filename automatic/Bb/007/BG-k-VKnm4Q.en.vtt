00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.339
 that Jesus comes as someone who needs to be 

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:26.989

 then sought to eliminate the results 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:44.229
 how do people do 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.049
 when they refuse 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.139

 for these people jesus is someone like that 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:13.139
 Jesus himself had 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.979
 the awareness of it 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:16.680
 in verse 7 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.680
 of this chapter he said 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:23.879

 Baptist 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.919
 these people would not be able to 

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.599
 because the project 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.659
 to be suspended 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:48.150
 Jesus justifies that his works are 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.150
 marques 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:52.629

 cpg sus after these people 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:58.479
 besides these people 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.259
 makes them grow 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.759
 something that they commit sins 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.569
 that they are from each 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.569
 that their works are wrong 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.580
 to eliminate 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:19.560
 other people already 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.330
 two regions 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.229
 how someone 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.789
 it's not yet 

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.789
 Who does he say he is? 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:30.560
 disbelief paulo 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.490
 people 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.259
 the sedan version 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.479
 to know jesus said it is indeed 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:41.139
 he said 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.219
 bad 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:45.029

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:46.550
 Of Jesus 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.360
 in that same chapter 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.559
 verses 3 and 4 

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:52.889
 say so 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.199
 going to him later 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.110
 the scientist brothers 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.729
 he had said 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.729
 leave this place and go to help and 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.379
 we decided to come 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:07.569
 the works that make 

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:09.180
 because no one can stand 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.619
 in the municipality known in public 

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:12.960
 and as the muriel 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.710
 elizio your children in a tale 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.979
 if these things happen 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:20.020
 manifest 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.779
 and the south access 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:25.219
 with that not even his brothers 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:28.029
 dr 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:30.319
 - Of Jesus 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:33.509
 also suggests that it still needed 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:35.909
 what did he say 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:38.159
 jesus claimed to be the messiah 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:40.129
 the envoy 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:43.419
 so he broke his pass 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:45.460
 to the middle of the street 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.710
 and perform their miracles will be the signs 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.520
 and all 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.520
 they would come to believe 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:57.409
 they were not good 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:00.409
 some people like that 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.249
 they are unbelievers in jesus 

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:06.490
 and just want to believe in jesus 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.699
 if god wants some 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:10.819
 fantastic turkey 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:12.099

 Do you believe in Jesus? 

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:19.219
 in general if the majority of people 

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:23.550
 they know that 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.550
 but if this does not happen 

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:34.029
 another of the people 

00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:36.330
 just as curiosity 

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.069

 your mobile phone 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.639

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.099
 I'm going through some doubts. 

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:50.139
 What are you going to do 

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:52.679
 the next 

00:07:52.679 --> 00:07:54.149
 it was not long before leaving 

00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:55.379
 about you 

00:07:55.379 --> 00:07:57.550
