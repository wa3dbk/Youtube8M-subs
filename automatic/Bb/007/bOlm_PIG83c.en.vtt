to<00:01:14.049> conventional<00:01:14.229> electric<00:01:14.950> cars<00:01:15.159> like<00:01:15.640> the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
to conventional electric cars like the

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.090 
to conventional electric cars like the
Nissan<00:01:15.820> Elite<00:01:16.330> now<00:01:16.900> all<00:01:17.200> I've<00:01:17.320> got<00:01:17.350> to<00:01:17.470> do<00:01:17.650> is

get<00:01:18.369> in<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:20.350> easier<00:01:20.619> than<00:01:20.710> it<00:01:20.860> looks

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.230 

perfect

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.090 

so<00:01:37.240> inside<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.720> server<00:01:37.960> vault<00:01:38.200> eat<00:01:38.380> whelks

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
so inside the server vault eat whelks

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.490 
so inside the server vault eat whelks
like<00:01:39.460> a<00:01:39.490> normal<00:01:39.790> car<00:01:39.940> really<00:01:40.180> any<00:01:40.540> differences

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
like a normal car really any differences

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.260 
like a normal car really any differences
it's<00:01:41.740> electric<00:01:42.280> so<00:01:42.460> there's<00:01:42.640> no<00:01:42.850> gear<00:01:43.090> leaver

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
it's electric so there's no gear leaver

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.450 
it's electric so there's no gear leaver
because<00:01:43.570> there's<00:01:43.780> no<00:01:43.900> gears<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.410> also<00:01:45.070> you've

Heidfeld in a McLaren Formula One car he
did<00:02:07.960> it<00:02:08.050> in<00:02:08.290> just<00:02:08.740> under<00:02:09.010> 42<00:02:09.729> seconds<00:02:10.390> which

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
did it in just under 42 seconds which

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.320 
did it in just under 42 seconds which
means<00:02:11.080> an<00:02:11.200> average<00:02:11.620> speed<00:02:11.800> of<00:02:11.950> over<00:02:12.820> a<00:02:12.850> hundred

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
means an average speed of over a hundred

Wow<00:03:49.280> I<00:03:49.610> have<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:49.940> say<00:03:50.120> it<00:03:50.630> was<00:03:50.750> pretty<00:03:50.990> amazing

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
Wow I have to say it was pretty amazing

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.500 
Wow I have to say it was pretty amazing
the<00:03:51.920> servo<00:03:52.310> it<00:03:52.370> feels<00:03:52.610> far<00:03:52.910> more<00:03:53.120> of<00:03:53.240> a<00:03:53.300> real

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
the servo it feels far more of a real

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:54.820 
the servo it feels far more of a real
car<00:03:53.750> than<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:53.990> was<00:03:54.110> expecting<00:03:54.200> the

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
car than I was expecting the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.980 
car than I was expecting the
acceleration<00:03:55.670> is<00:03:55.790> phenomenal<00:03:56.270> it's

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
acceleration is phenomenal it's

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.900 
acceleration is phenomenal it's
important<00:03:57.350> remember<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.709> servo<00:03:57.950> is<00:03:58.220> just<00:03:58.819> a

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
important remember the servo is just a

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.760 
important remember the servo is just a
concept<00:03:59.300> car<00:03:59.510> so<00:03:59.750> it's<00:04:00.140> never<00:04:00.350> going<00:04:00.590> to<00:04:00.650> be

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
concept car so it's never going to be

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.230 
concept car so it's never going to be
built<00:04:01.069> but<00:04:01.490> it's<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.700> sort<00:04:01.970> of<00:04:02.030> car<00:04:02.180> that

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
built but it's the sort of car that

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.150 
built but it's the sort of car that
needs<00:04:02.450> to<00:04:02.569> be<00:04:02.690> shown<00:04:02.990> to<00:04:03.200> people<00:04:03.319> so<00:04:03.890> they<00:04:03.920> can

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
needs to be shown to people so they can

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.280 
needs to be shown to people so they can
see<00:04:04.400> just<00:04:04.580> how<00:04:04.970> fun<00:04:05.239> and<00:04:05.480> just<00:04:05.780> how<00:04:05.900> fast

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
see just how fun and just how fast

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.540 
see just how fun and just how fast
electric<00:04:07.160> cars<00:04:07.400> really<00:04:08.120> can<00:04:08.360> be
