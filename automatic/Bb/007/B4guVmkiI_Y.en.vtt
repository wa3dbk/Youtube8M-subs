playstation<00:01:44.300> button<00:01:47.590> um<00:01:48.730> I'll<00:01:49.730> prove<00:01:49.910> that<00:01:50.090> it

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
playstation button um I'll prove that it

00:01:50.240 --> 00:02:07.649 
playstation button um I'll prove that it
is<00:01:50.360> an<00:01:50.570> 80<00:01:51.140> gigabyte

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.710 

yeah<00:02:08.470> i<00:02:08.530> guess<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.940> playstation<00:02:09.940> system<00:02:10.479> much

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
yeah i guess the playstation system much

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.280 
yeah i guess the playstation system much
quality<00:02:10.959> will<00:02:11.379> take<00:02:11.739> six<00:02:12.069> gigs<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:14.140> that's

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
quality will take six gigs and that's

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.229 
quality will take six gigs and that's
the<00:02:14.349> internet<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:14.860> all<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.099> stuff<00:02:15.489> like<00:02:16.000> I

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
the internet and all that stuff like I

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.199 
the internet and all that stuff like I
guess<00:02:16.540> every<00:02:16.780> PlayStation<00:02:17.290> as<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.970> does<00:02:18.970> play

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
guess every PlayStation as a does play

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:28.020 
guess every PlayStation as a does play
games

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.870
