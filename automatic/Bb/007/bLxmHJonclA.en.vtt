00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.640
 people have a long time working for 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.040
 computer very often occur 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.880
 occupational diseases so 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.729
 called brush will be dealt damage 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:14.539
 where did he grow up 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:15.949
 when working ordinary flops 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.720
 traditional in which many 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.390
 our stores 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.499
 put users puts hand 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:26.859
 naturally and then should her 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:28.439
 turn out and so 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.249
 twisted wrist position he 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.249
 almost all day working with the mouse 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.230
 what happens when 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.860
 happens 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.740
 pinching of the median nerve 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.920
 wrist 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.060
 asymptomatic 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.120
 from anything 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.020
 us syndrome is usually pleasant 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.660
 feeling of closure 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.600
 sometimes no less than thumb 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.320
 weakened cope 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.970
 Well, yes, surely very many 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.970
 from those who work at the computer 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.110
 the symptoms 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.120
 is known 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.560
 I want to offer 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.900
 your attention, we are again Cyprus 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.450
 it is a myth to her so-called vertical 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.980
 mouse 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.920
 she looks like a stomach 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.200
 in this case it is a mockup sample 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.300
 inside built small 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.690
 small-sized 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.690
 but really existing mouse 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.420
 what we see 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.150
 in this mouse 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.920
 Ie hand now 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.580
 we put in front of the cameras and on 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.790
 do not 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.790
 veteran doctor festival turn 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.040
 but as falls naturally 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.620
 on this dream no further 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.870
 turn that is 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.560
 quite comfortable but all day 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.820
 enjoy 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.570
 buttons done left right bar 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.500
 thumb 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.350
 that is, push yarmolyuk could 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.240
 try that is 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.440
 just throw percents 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.460
 now there is a button apart indicative 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.300
 finger that can be assigned 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.480
 a function that any other is closer to 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.349
 vertical 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.179
 among representatives 

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:16.749
 ask now there is no need to throw mmk 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:18.159
 laser mouse 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.949
 and work 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.069
 such a mouse 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.359
 what i want to say we pay then he 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:28.599
 municipality 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.369
 and maybe a sample 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:32.039
 computer market manipulator 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:33.759
 remember 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:36.879
 according to the current priority 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.899
 December twenty sixth, 2007 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:41.999
 the validity of this 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:45.129
 2002 old year 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.290
 Of course this percentage of nervous tension but 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.649
 but 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:50.800
 unlike them 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.819
 for example there is clear that 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.589
 this thing can be done 

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:57.189
 quite 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:58.169
 i.e 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.739
 no question confirmation 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.019
 maybe years to make that 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.019
 usually happens 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.049
 in the case of inventions 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.020
 in principle ermakovu 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.449
 I have developed and inventions but there 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:17.909
 overall 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.099
 so the question is usually impossible 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.929
 evidence 

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:24.059
 we just need to fill 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:25.749
 What can I say 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:27.349
 so there is 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.229
 in the development of manufacturing 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:31.059
 Naturally I know the investment of cash 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:34.059
 investments which I do not have unfortunately 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:37.559
 I myself 

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:40.019
 our 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.469
 manufacturer 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:44.689
 foreign manufacturers 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:46.379
 offered 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.439
 no positive 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:49.959
 No answer 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.929
 i don't have any 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:54.359
 monetary claims i mean i 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.159
 ready to provide 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.040
 patent 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.229
 right to use patents to any person 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:01.140
 who will be 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.840
 really real organizes 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.149
 production of this niche 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:08.839
 shops behind full with such 

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:10.119
 mice 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:11.879
 slightly will 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.049
 so what 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.470
 obvious but there are such surely will 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.139
 to be popular 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:19.459
 so if 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.610
 does anybody want 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.809
 write to us 

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:26.449
 ready to offer 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.340
 it was necessary to do that is 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.900
 most likely three whales size on the right 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.540
 arm visibility sizes one 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.460
 room 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.460
 everything is solved 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.749
 by the way here's the innovation question all 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:44.599
 leave the fleet a typical example 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.110
 innovation ie innovation is not 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.800
 surely something over there is so difficult 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.169
 there are these simple things 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.319
 from the ends of a lot of new 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:56.199
 to develop 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:57.819
 still a lot of interesting things
