00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.020
 in this test, all clearly and clearly greed 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.290
 guilt 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.290
 and of course from bright 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.490
 scientists are conducting a test trying to understand 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.230
 human reaction to the reflection in the mirror 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.720
 that is, in the Paris school they gathered a group 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.789
 children ages seven to fourteen 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:20.949
 years who will take part in the test 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.689
 feeling guilty and greedy 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.250
 every child is difficult 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.759
 tasks allowing him to get the desired 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.680
 Goncharov's remuneration 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.930
 finish with lots a big bowl 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.710
 installed in the middle of the room and 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.720
 technology was told that the concert in 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.760
 one on each 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.420
 taking your particular 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.950
 children anonymously goes to another 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.430
 the group 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.800
 the result was not difficult to guess 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.530
 number of children who took more than one candy 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.530
 accounted for 30 percent 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.280
 however there are shekels thought nobody 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.280
 didnâ€™t take just an hour with shield 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.910
 experiment repeats this time 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.790
 in the mirror 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.440
 children fit in the bowl 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.040
 but now they face 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.550
 own reflection 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.890
 only 10 percent broke the rules and 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.740
 took more than one specific 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.030
 at the same time violators awarded their 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.740
 reflection tense and even 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.610
 scornful look to almost for 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.909
 all children are tempted to break the rules 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.240
 is obvious 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.500
 however, the reflection in the mirror plays a role 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.860
 moral guard 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.860
 reminding to conscience 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:29.169
 those who violate the rules 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.889
 acts more carefully when faced 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.889
 own reflections 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.499
 Markov 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:01.499
 cube 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.239
 the winners are that nobody in the room 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.239
 should the intruder think only about one thing 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:14.479
 but 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.909
 and third 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.430
 however, thanks to the bright 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.430
 suddenly comes to the rescue of guilt 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.759
 with them will be clear lines 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:41.039
 however there is no such system 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.900
 disappointments 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:42.810
 in the second part of the experiment 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.099
 some children are allowed to take them 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.449
 two specific 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:47.839
 however with these innovations 

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:49.860
 the situation does not change much 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.120
 as she breaks cheers existing 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.120
 regulations 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:02.539
 but 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.819
 the second 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:10.509
 and third 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:11.919
 however, this is not the story 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.719
 ends as our candidate probably 

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:17.099
 dissatisfied with their share invents 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.099
 new rules for this game 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.389
 he said mr 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:29.949
 I took one 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.229
 but he told me mr 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.430
 I took one 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.430
 but can two 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:42.050
 it turns out 3 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.050
 but I sat down once on thursday 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.090
 which I want the second but not 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.090
 Here, take it 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.470
 greed was stronger than virtue 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.270
 interpol james lawyers will not become 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.830
 a mirror will be extended for study 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.470
 the psychology of an adult male feels 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.409
 getting a price index and social 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:12.349
 psychology 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.300
 psychologically is experimental 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.930
 in all these areas the mirror reminds 

00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:20.060
 man need 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.060
 pounds on his conscience 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.900
 in the business world and mirrors are starting 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.780
 use to raise 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.780
 work productivity 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:39.790
 starting with the passive observation of colleagues 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.120
 one after another 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.440
 and ending with checks 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.240
 conducted by department heads 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.710
 m 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.759
 Different techniques are used for 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:52.759
 maintain the pace of work 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:56.669
 even when employees are in their 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.669
 cabinets manager to monitor their work 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.279
 However, there are times when an employee 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:14.059
 left without observation during 

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:16.749
 toilet visits smoking coffee purchase 

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:19.749
 in the machine 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:25.729
 and there they are waiting for the good old mirror always 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:28.729
 ready to cry how to combine 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.650
 statistics is amazing 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.620
 employee spends much less 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.620
 time off work 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:41.449
 technique is just as effective when 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:43.710
 used in a group of workers 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.199
 conversations with colleagues in the presence of a mirror 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:49.589
 end much faster 

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:52.639
 you know if in addition to the toilet mirror 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.279
 settled near your 

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:57.279
 workplace means there is a reason 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:05.050
 come out the most flawless mean 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:06.960
 able to get caught in a mirror trap 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.860
 every time we look at all the mirrors 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.749
 part of ours i follow us 

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:13.759
 ability to recognize your reflection 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:16.519
 ability to self without 

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.889
 enhancing yourself as individually gives 

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:20.679
 we have incredible opportunities for me 

00:07:20.679 --> 00:07:22.909
 Inter aspect to find your place 

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:25.189
 on earth and in the universe 

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:28.379
 Serbian helps us learn in ourselves 

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:31.609
 but only man is able to know himself
