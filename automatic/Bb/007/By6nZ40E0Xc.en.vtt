00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.410
 Hi, people today. I'll tell you. 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.120
 the measures that a fashion model has 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.190
 to have 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.920
 I made a point of calling a friend of mine. 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.529
 what is skal to have you know what it is 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.160
 scouts are the scouts the people who 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.960
 go to the gyms or mall or 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.140
 pumps for those cities that are 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.680
 beautiful women's barns to make 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:33.090
 search for new affection through the market 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:38.460
 So he gave me a class, he said. 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:42.450
 What is important is the model t proportion 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.510
 body she has to have clear measurements but 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.680
 she has to have a proportional body 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:53.670
 no use having a meter and seventy 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:58.160
 six which is the minimum with 89 of hip and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.739
 not having a proportion of well-cared hair 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.710
 and whenever you go for a test 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.830
 There are some things you can not do. 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.369
 forget hair clean make-up light 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.090

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:17.430
 bikini a slap-sex your stuff the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.360
 your book so the customer can see how 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:26.210
 you leave a cell various situations 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.530
 and a book or tablet for you to stay 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.920
 while waiting 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.799
 'This has something for you.' 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.250
 Do not be bored by the time you sometimes 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.329
 It takes time because all models 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.060
 to try on an outfit when it 's for a 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:47.009
 parade then usually where one is one is 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.320
 casting delayed for man the minimum 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.840

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.290

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.960
 skinny and not too skinny 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.970
 so I find these interesting 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.310

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.470
 way, you already know that 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.660
 below one meter and seventy-six did not 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.170
 It's good if you do not have a body. 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.280
 proportional to baking it stays 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.970
