micro cute ROM by electro-harmonix and
this<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.660> fantastic<00:00:10.290> little<00:00:10.710> pedal<00:00:11.070> I've

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
this is a fantastic little pedal I've

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.810 
this is a fantastic little pedal I've
been<00:00:11.550> using<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.389> hell<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.809> lot<00:00:12.960> recently

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820

as my or actually more than my wild
pedal<00:00:17.970> because<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.390> enables<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.869> kind<00:00:19.230> of

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
pedal because it enables you to kind of

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.970 
pedal because it enables you to kind of
switch<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.490> on<00:00:20.640> play<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.210> kind<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.980> disco

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
switch it on play that kind of disco

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.279 
switch it on play that kind of disco
ivar<00:00:23.369> type<00:00:23.880> stuff<00:00:24.240> but<00:00:24.269> without<00:00:24.960> having<00:00:25.109> to

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
ivar type stuff but without having to

ivar type stuff but without having to
keep<00:00:25.410> rocking<00:00:25.740> your<00:00:25.830> foot<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.220> pedal<00:00:26.369> and

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
keep rocking your foot on the pedal and

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.890 
keep rocking your foot on the pedal and
be<00:00:26.640> tied<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.060> pedal<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.539> can<00:00:27.689> get<00:00:27.810> out

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
be tied to the pedal so you can get out

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.370 
be tied to the pedal so you can get out
and<00:00:28.050> have<00:00:28.170> some<00:00:28.380> fun<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:29.130> stage<00:00:29.689> I<00:00:30.689> also<00:00:31.050> did<00:00:31.349> a

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
and have some fun on stage I also did a

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.170 
and have some fun on stage I also did a
couple<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.679> videos<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.009> put<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> link<00:00:32.759> here<00:00:32.850> to

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
couple of videos I put a link here to

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.660 
couple of videos I put a link here to
how<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.110> can<00:00:34.290> use<00:00:34.440> this<00:00:34.559> pedal<00:00:34.920> T<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.370> create

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
how you can use this pedal T to create

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.229 
how you can use this pedal T to create
an<00:00:35.760> almost<00:00:35.880> talked<00:00:36.270> boy<00:00:36.480> talk<00:00:36.989> box<00:00:37.230> effect<00:00:38.239> so

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
an almost talked boy talk box effect so

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.209 
an almost talked boy talk box effect so
like<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.660> Alice<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.079> Chains<00:00:40.110> man<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.010> box

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
like on Alice in Chains man in the box

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.000 
like on Alice in Chains man in the box
and<00:00:41.899> living<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> prayer<00:00:43.200> by<00:00:43.950> Bon<00:00:44.190> Jovi<00:00:46.010> yeah

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
and living on a prayer by Bon Jovi yeah

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.069 
and living on a prayer by Bon Jovi yeah
I<00:00:47.039> mean<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.700> way<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:47.969> pedal<00:00:48.570> works<00:00:48.780> it's

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
I mean the way this pedal works it's

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.270 
I mean the way this pedal works it's
very<00:00:49.620> simply<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.600> sweepable<00:00:51.649> eq<00:00:52.649> circuit

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
very simply it's a sweepable eq circuit

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.970 
very simply it's a sweepable eq circuit
or<00:00:53.370> sweepable<00:00:53.699> filter<00:00:54.210> with<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> variable<00:00:55.590> Q

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
or sweepable filter with a variable Q

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.560 
or sweepable filter with a variable Q
which<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.559> what<00:00:58.559> I'll<00:00:58.770> do<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> another<00:00:59.609> lesson

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
which is what I'll do a another lesson

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.219 
which is what I'll do a another lesson
on<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.160> whole<00:01:02.160> means<00:01:02.750> this<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.930> about<00:01:04.080> this

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
on that whole means this is about this

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.520 
on that whole means this is about this
pedal<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.619> I'll<00:01:04.769> get<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.040> with<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:06.350> this<00:01:07.350> is

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
pedal so I'll get on with it so this is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.220 
pedal so I'll get on with it so this is
my<00:01:07.710> clean<00:01:07.979> turn

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:30.480 

here<00:01:11.800> we<00:01:11.920> go<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:29.200> may<00:01:29.470> have<00:01:29.650> a<00:01:29.680> few<00:01:30.160> trouble

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
here we go you may have a few trouble

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.660 
here we go you may have a few trouble
seeing<00:01:30.790> where<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:32.160> switches<00:01:33.160> I've<00:01:33.280> got<00:01:33.520> this

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
seeing where the switches I've got this

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.030 
seeing where the switches I've got this
one<00:01:33.910> set<00:01:34.150> here<00:01:34.720> at<00:01:34.960> about<00:01:35.080> 11<00:01:35.500> o'clock<00:01:35.560> and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
one set here at about 11 o'clock and

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.250 
one set here at about 11 o'clock and
this<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.550> drive<00:01:36.820> is<00:01:37.120> set<00:01:37.300> at<00:01:37.480> about<00:01:37.750> one

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
this the drive is set at about one

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:49.170 
this the drive is set at about one
o'clock<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:46.750> is<00:01:47.050> a<00:01:47.290> band-passed<00:01:48.280> mode<00:01:48.640> so

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
o'clock this is a band-passed mode so

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.820 
o'clock this is a band-passed mode so
you<00:01:49.240> have<00:01:49.360> high-pass<00:01:49.780> BAM<00:01:50.080> possum<00:01:50.590> and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
you have high-pass BAM possum and

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.970 
you have high-pass BAM possum and
low-pass<00:01:51.580> high-pass<00:01:52.440> filter<00:01:53.440> will<00:01:53.710> filter

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
low-pass high-pass filter will filter

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.170 
low-pass high-pass filter will filter
out<00:01:54.130> all<00:01:54.400> of<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:56.130> high<00:01:57.130> frequencies<00:01:57.730> the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
out all of the high frequencies the

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.180 
out all of the high frequencies the
bandpass<00:01:58.480> is<00:01:59.110> like<00:01:59.410> a<00:01:59.440> little<00:01:59.710> box<00:01:59.920> which

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
bandpass is like a little box which

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.560 
bandpass is like a little box which
moves<00:02:00.460> up<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:00.700> down<00:02:00.790> across<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.300> frequency

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
moves up and down across the frequency

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.710 
moves up and down across the frequency
spectrum<00:02:01.900> and<00:02:02.700> low-pass<00:02:03.700> will<00:02:04.180> filter<00:02:04.480> out

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
spectrum and low-pass will filter out

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.740 
spectrum and low-pass will filter out
all<00:02:05.680> of<00:02:05.740> your<00:02:05.980> high<00:02:06.700> frequencies<00:02:09.480> that's<00:02:10.480> the

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
all of your high frequencies that's the

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.000 
all of your high frequencies that's the
different<00:02:11.050> modes<00:02:11.260> that<00:02:11.380> you<00:02:11.530> operate<00:02:11.710> it<00:02:11.950> in

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
different modes that you operate it in

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.440 
different modes that you operate it in
so<00:02:12.220> depends<00:02:12.610> on<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.730> sound<00:02:12.970> here<00:02:13.150> we<00:02:13.240> go<00:02:13.390> you

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
so depends on the sound here we go you

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.030 
so depends on the sound here we go you
can<00:02:13.570> see<00:02:13.840> this<00:02:13.960> is<00:02:14.080> in<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.230> high-pass<00:02:14.560> mode<00:02:14.830> so

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
can see this is in the high-pass mode so

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:48.229 
can see this is in the high-pass mode so
we're<00:02:15.160> going<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.340> lose<00:02:34.739> this<00:02:35.739> is

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:03:03.750 

and<00:02:49.239> then<00:02:49.450> flow<00:02:50.080> path<00:02:50.760> so<00:03:02.190> you<00:03:03.190> set<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:03.580> up

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
and then flow path so you set that up

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.180 
and then flow path so you set that up
kind<00:03:04.330> of<00:03:04.390> more<00:03:04.720> about<00:03:05.110> where<00:03:05.560> you're<00:03:05.799> playing

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
kind of more about where you're playing

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.770 
kind of more about where you're playing
where<00:03:06.519> you<00:03:06.610> want<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:06.879> use<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.150> auto<00:03:07.269> while<00:03:07.629> I

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
where you want to use the auto while I

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.289 
where you want to use the auto while I
leave<00:03:08.019> it<00:03:08.170> in<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:09.400> bandpass<00:03:09.940> because<00:03:10.180> that

being followed again watch out for a new
lesson<00:03:24.340> I'll<00:03:24.609> teach<00:03:24.819> you<00:03:24.970> all<00:03:25.090> about<00:03:25.120> EQ<00:03:25.780> is

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
lesson I'll teach you all about EQ is

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.059 
lesson I'll teach you all about EQ is
probably<00:03:26.140> the<00:03:26.290> easiest<00:03:26.530> way<00:03:26.680> whether<00:03:26.859> you

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
probably the easiest way whether you

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.589 
probably the easiest way whether you
trying<00:03:27.310> to<00:03:27.340> explain<00:03:27.700> in<00:03:27.879> this<00:03:27.940> video<00:03:28.090> but<00:03:28.480> as

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
trying to explain in this video but as

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:42.390 
trying to explain in this video but as
you<00:03:28.720> see<00:03:40.920> what<00:03:41.920> you've<00:03:42.040> done<00:03:42.069> there's

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
you see what you've done there's

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.920 
you see what you've done there's
basically<00:03:42.819> Korean<00:03:43.150> narrow<00:03:43.359> filter<00:03:43.780> you're

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
basically Korean narrow filter you're

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.589 
basically Korean narrow filter you're
narrowing<00:03:44.500> or<00:03:44.769> esri<00:03:45.549> they<00:03:45.910> were<00:03:46.060> increasing

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:46.599 
narrowing or esri they were increasing

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.420 
narrowing or esri they were increasing
the<00:03:46.720> width<00:03:46.930> of<00:03:47.109> our<00:03:47.260> our<00:03:47.680> cue<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.069> width<00:03:48.250> of

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
the width of our our cue the width of

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.280 
the width of our our cue the width of
the<00:03:48.579> filter

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.090 

the<00:03:55.290> drive<00:03:55.530> control<00:03:55.980> is<00:03:56.100> basically<00:03:57.920> how<00:03:58.920> much

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
the drive control is basically how much

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:40.870 
the drive control is basically how much
of<00:03:59.250> that<00:03:59.310> is<00:03:59.459> being<00:03:59.640> affected<00:04:07.640> this<00:04:08.989> kind<00:04:09.989> of

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.090 

instant<00:04:41.880> disco<00:04:42.360> he<00:04:42.510> kind<00:04:42.750> of<00:04:42.960> effect<00:04:43.650> going<00:04:43.950> on

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
instant disco he kind of effect going on

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.570 
instant disco he kind of effect going on
there<00:04:44.340> also<00:04:45.000> use<00:04:45.360> it<00:04:45.510> for<00:04:46.070> say<00:04:47.070> put<00:04:47.370> a<00:04:47.400> bit<00:04:47.550> of

there also use it for say put a bit of

00:04:47.580 --> 00:05:10.980 
there also use it for say put a bit of
distortion

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990

and there yo the electro-harmonix cuter

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:39.340 
and there yo the electro-harmonix cuter
on<00:05:30.250> a<00:05:30.280> great<00:05:30.610> little<00:05:30.849> pedal
