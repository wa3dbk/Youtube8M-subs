00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
go we achieve incentive on here so

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.930 

this<00:01:00.050> you<00:01:00.230> can<00:01:00.350> tell<00:01:00.500> immediately<00:01:00.980> this<00:01:01.130> is<00:01:01.760> an

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
this you can tell immediately this is an

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.210 
this you can tell immediately this is an
unusual<00:01:02.540> refrigerator<00:01:03.170> to<00:01:03.470> use<00:01:03.590> helium<00:01:03.920> as<00:01:04.190> a

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
unusual refrigerator to use helium as a

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.030 
unusual refrigerator to use helium as a
refrigerant<00:01:04.670> gas<00:01:04.910> and<00:01:05.810> not<00:01:06.050> one<00:01:06.890> of<00:01:06.980> the

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
refrigerant gas and not one of the

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.230 
refrigerant gas and not one of the
conventional<00:01:07.520> refrigerants

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.250 

and<00:01:10.420> this<00:01:10.600> is<00:01:10.720> quite<00:01:10.810> a<00:01:10.900> complicated

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
and this is quite a complicated

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.780 
and this is quite a complicated
compressor<00:01:11.890> but<00:01:12.070> of<00:01:12.159> course<00:01:12.310> it's<00:01:12.460> bit<00:01:12.610> more

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
compressor but of course it's bit more

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.289 
compressor but of course it's bit more
than<00:01:12.940> a<00:01:13.000> compressor<00:01:13.510> it's<00:01:13.990> a<00:01:14.080> compressor<00:01:14.650> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
than a compressor it's a compressor and

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.480 
than a compressor it's a compressor and
a<00:01:16.619> condenser<00:01:17.619> well<00:01:17.920> obviously<00:01:18.010> it's<00:01:18.310> not<00:01:18.430> a

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
a condenser well obviously it's not a

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.859 
a condenser well obviously it's not a
condenser<00:01:19.060> in<00:01:19.180> this<00:01:19.300> case<00:01:19.540> because<00:01:19.720> the

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
condenser in this case because the

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.190 
condenser in this case because the
helium<00:01:20.050> doesn't<00:01:20.470> actually<00:01:20.619> liquefy<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.810> it

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
helium doesn't actually liquefy but it

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.010 
helium doesn't actually liquefy but it
does<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.560> same<00:01:23.740> job<00:01:23.800> as<00:01:24.280> a<00:01:24.460> condenser

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
does the same job as a condenser

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.990 
does the same job as a condenser
so<00:01:27.020> we've<00:01:27.230> got<00:01:27.380> our<00:01:27.560> helium<00:01:28.220> lines<00:01:28.610> here

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
so we've got our helium lines here

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.410 
so we've got our helium lines here
returned<00:01:29.390> here<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.110> flow<00:01:31.040> here<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:31.850> float

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
returned here and flow here and float

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.900 
returned here and flow here and float
these<00:01:33.230> on<00:01:33.800> put<00:01:34.130> my<00:01:34.220> hand<00:01:34.430> on<00:01:34.580> it<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:34.820> it's

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
these on put my hand on it and it's

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.550 
these on put my hand on it and it's
actually<00:01:35.180> freezing<00:01:35.450> because<00:01:35.810> it's<00:01:36.200> just<00:01:36.380> been

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
actually freezing because it's just been

so<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.290> actual<00:02:23.819> compressor<00:02:24.819> doesn't<00:02:25.090> just

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
so the actual compressor doesn't just

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.420 
so the actual compressor doesn't just
provide<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.599> flow<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:26.140> gas<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:27.099> actually

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
provide a flow of gas it actually

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.449 
provide a flow of gas it actually
provides<00:02:27.790> control<00:02:28.780> control<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:30.010> actually<00:02:30.400> if

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
provides control control and actually if

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.870 
provides control control and actually if
you<00:02:30.489> listen<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.540> can<00:02:31.569> hear<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:32.019> squeaking

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
you listen you can hear that squeaking

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.870 
you listen you can hear that squeaking
and<00:02:33.880> that<00:02:34.810> is<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.170> pulsing<00:02:35.799> of<00:02:36.130> helium<00:02:36.670> as<00:02:36.760> it

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
and that is the pulsing of helium as it

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.970 
and that is the pulsing of helium as it
flows<00:02:37.120> through<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.569> kids<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.870> McMann<00:02:38.260> cold

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
flows through the kids of McMann cold

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.030 
flows through the kids of McMann cold
and<00:02:41.450> essentially<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:43.050> if<00:02:43.260> upon<00:02:43.709> unit

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
and essentially the if upon unit

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.130 
and essentially the if upon unit
contains<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.700> vowel<00:02:45.000> which<00:02:45.629> alternate

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
contains a vowel which alternate

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.220 
contains a vowel which alternate
alternately<00:02:46.970> pushes<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.239> pulls<00:02:48.540> on<00:02:48.900> a

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
alternately pushes and pulls on a

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.030 
alternately pushes and pulls on a
distant<00:02:49.800> using<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.519> helium<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.860> pushing<00:02:52.860> and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
distant using the helium and pushing and

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.100 
distant using the helium and pushing and
pulling<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.519> expansion<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.269> gas<00:02:54.510> and

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
pulling and expansion of the gas and

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.890 
pulling and expansion of the gas and
transferring<00:02:56.099> Heat<00:02:56.280> vilest<00:02:56.940> is<00:02:57.720> what

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
transferring Heat vilest is what

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.570 
transferring Heat vilest is what
actually<00:02:58.260> provides<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.739> refrigerant<00:02:59.280> effect

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
actually provides the refrigerant effect

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.199 
actually provides the refrigerant effect
so<00:03:00.510> this<00:03:00.599> is<00:03:00.750> not<00:03:00.900> just<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:01.380> simple<00:03:02.209> expansion

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
so this is not just a simple expansion

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.170 
so this is not just a simple expansion
of<00:03:03.480> gas<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.709> provide<00:03:05.160> cooling<00:03:05.430> is<00:03:05.849> in<00:03:06.000> your

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
of gas to provide cooling is in your

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.210 
of gas to provide cooling is in your
conventional<00:03:06.780> refrigerator<00:03:07.380> this<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.799> this

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
conventional refrigerator this is this

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.390 
conventional refrigerator this is this
is<00:03:08.340> a<00:03:08.400> bit<00:03:08.549> more<00:03:08.730> complicated<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:11.280> I'll

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
is a bit more complicated and I'll

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.800 
is a bit more complicated and I'll
explain<00:03:11.700> how<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.940> works<00:03:12.060> but<00:03:12.390> in<00:03:12.510> this<00:03:12.569> case

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
explain how that works but in this case

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.930 
explain how that works but in this case
it's<00:03:13.049> used<00:03:13.290> because<00:03:13.799> we're<00:03:14.489> looking<00:03:14.610> for<00:03:14.790> a

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
it's used because we're looking for a

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.970 
it's used because we're looking for a
very<00:03:15.090> low<00:03:15.269> temperature<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:16.440> in<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:16.709> case

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
very low temperature and in this case

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.640 
very low temperature and in this case
we're<00:03:17.220> looking<00:03:17.430> at<00:03:17.610> full<00:03:17.910> Kelvin<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:18.720> this<00:03:18.900> the

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
we're looking at full Kelvin so this the

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.289 
we're looking at full Kelvin so this the
cold<00:03:19.950> head<00:03:20.190> will<00:03:20.400> reach<00:03:20.549> temperature<00:03:21.030> for

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
cold head will reach temperature for

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.650 
cold head will reach temperature for
Kelvin<00:03:21.569> that's<00:03:21.900> minus<00:03:22.340> 269<00:03:23.340> Celsius<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.450> it

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
Kelvin that's minus 269 Celsius and it

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.720 
Kelvin that's minus 269 Celsius and it
has<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.930> cooling<00:03:25.230> power<00:03:25.590> of<00:03:25.920> one<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.489> what

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
has a cooling power of one of what

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.309 
has a cooling power of one of what
that's<00:03:27.450> right<00:03:27.630> one<00:03:28.200> watt<00:03:28.709> of<00:03:28.950> cooing<00:03:29.519> -<00:03:30.329> 269

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
that's right one watt of cooing - 269

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.620 
that's right one watt of cooing - 269
Celsius<00:03:31.769> then<00:03:31.920> it<00:03:32.040> uses<00:03:32.370> this<00:03:32.519> 10<00:03:33.269> horsepower

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
Celsius then it uses this 10 horsepower

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.930 
Celsius then it uses this 10 horsepower
scroll<00:03:34.700> compressor<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.849> run<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.360> it<00:03:36.930> takes

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
scroll compressor to run it and it takes

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.059 
scroll compressor to run it and it takes
several<00:03:38.940> gallons<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.599> minute<00:03:39.720> of<00:03:40.440> chilled

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
several gallons a minute of chilled

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.699 
several gallons a minute of chilled
water<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:42.060> evacuate<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.049> heat<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.500> it's<00:03:43.620> not

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
water to evacuate the heat so it's not

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.550 
water to evacuate the heat so it's not
particularly<00:03:44.130> efficient

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
particularly efficient

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.890 
particularly efficient
they'll<00:03:46.099> draw<00:03:46.760> you<00:03:46.819> a<00:03:46.910> diagram<00:03:46.940> how<00:03:47.510> different

they'll draw you a diagram how different
my<00:03:47.989> man<00:03:48.170> system<00:03:48.590> works<00:03:49.599> later<00:03:50.599> but<00:03:51.560> as<00:03:51.890> you<00:03:51.980> can

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
my man system works later but as you can

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.290 
my man system works later but as you can
see<00:03:52.130> maybe<00:03:52.670> we'll<00:03:52.880> have<00:03:53.000> a<00:03:53.030> bit<00:03:53.270> more

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
see maybe we'll have a bit more

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.020 
see maybe we'll have a bit more
information<00:03:53.690> here<00:03:54.290> a<00:03:55.040> bit<00:03:55.520> more<00:03:55.700> interesting

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030
