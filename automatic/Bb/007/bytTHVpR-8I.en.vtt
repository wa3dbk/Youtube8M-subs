00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
or Android headphone jack in order for

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.300 
or Android headphone jack in order for
it<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.909> sink<00:01:51.240> so<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.619> barrier<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:53.009> some

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
it to sink so that is a barrier for some

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.789 
it to sink so that is a barrier for some
people<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.210> means<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.079> battery<00:01:55.409> lasts<00:01:55.740> a

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
people but it means the battery lasts a

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.370 
people but it means the battery lasts a
lot<00:01:55.890> longer<00:01:55.950> here's<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.000> Nike<00:01:57.390> FuelBand<00:01:57.960> it

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
lot longer here's the Nike FuelBand it

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.850 
lot longer here's the Nike FuelBand it
goes<00:01:59.189> on<00:01:59.340> your<00:01:59.490> wrist<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.090> has<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.630> USB

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
goes on your wrist and it has a USB

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.319 
goes on your wrist and it has a USB
closure<00:02:01.860> right<00:02:02.490> here<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.210> would

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
closure right here so this would

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.850 
closure right here so this would
actually<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.869> plug<00:02:04.170> right<00:02:04.409> into<00:02:04.619> your

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
actually just plug right into your

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.950 
actually just plug right into your
computer<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.490> sync<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:06.299> also<00:02:06.570> has<00:02:06.719> bluetooth

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
computer to sync it also has bluetooth

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.139 
computer to sync it also has bluetooth
so<00:02:07.530> we<00:02:07.590> can<00:02:07.740> sink<00:02:08.039> through<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.399> phone<00:02:08.640> just

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
so we can sink through the phone just

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.080 
so we can sink through the phone just
like<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.629> Jawbone<00:02:09.989> Up<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.860> can<00:02:11.489> set<00:02:11.730> goals

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
like the Jawbone Up you can set goals

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.130 
like the Jawbone Up you can set goals

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
for the number of staff

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.890 
for the number of staff
but<00:02:13.470> Nike<00:02:13.740> Fuel<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.790> Nike<00:02:15.060> FuelBand<00:02:15.390> has<00:02:15.630> a
