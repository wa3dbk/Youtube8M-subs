cake<00:01:36.789> balls<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:38.170> these<00:01:38.319> are<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.560> balls<00:01:38.770> here

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
cake balls so these are the balls here

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.279 
cake balls so these are the balls here
and<00:01:39.219> they're<00:01:39.369> raw<00:01:39.729> so<00:01:40.390> they're<00:01:40.539> very<00:01:40.899> easy<00:01:40.990> to

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:41.289 
and they're raw so they're very easy to

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:43.289 
and they're raw so they're very easy to
make<00:01:41.679> and<00:01:41.920> we're<00:01:42.159> using<00:01:42.310> they're<00:01:42.819> totally

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
make and we're using they're totally

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:45.059 
make and we're using they're totally
sweetened<00:01:43.659> naturally<00:01:43.689> so<00:01:44.350> we're<00:01:44.499> using<00:01:44.649> dates

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
sweetened naturally so we're using dates

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:47.580 
sweetened naturally so we're using dates
which<00:01:45.340> are<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.549> good<00:01:45.789> source<00:01:45.999> of<00:01:46.179> fiber<00:01:46.409> we<00:01:47.409> have

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
which are a good source of fiber we have

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.289 
which are a good source of fiber we have
some<00:01:47.799> protein<00:01:48.069> powders<00:01:48.609> as<00:01:48.789> a<00:01:48.819> plant<00:01:49.210> based

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
some protein powders as a plant based

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.289 
some protein powders as a plant based
protein<00:01:49.539> powder<00:01:50.109> and<00:01:50.460> by<00:01:51.460> genuine<00:01:51.850> health<00:01:52.119> is

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
protein powder and by genuine health is

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.749 
protein powder and by genuine health is
called<00:01:52.509> vegan<00:01:52.840> proteins<00:01:53.289> plus<00:01:53.649> and<00:01:53.950> I<00:01:54.490> love<00:01:54.729> it

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
plant-based proteins and it's important

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.660 
plant-based proteins and it's important
to<00:01:57.850> cycle<00:01:58.329> your<00:01:58.479> proteins<00:01:59.079> we<00:02:00.009> also<00:02:00.159> have<00:02:00.459> some

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
protein and some coconut flakes and of

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.000 
protein and some coconut flakes and of
course<00:02:09.459> we<00:02:09.910> have<00:02:10.000> some<00:02:10.209> honey<00:02:10.509> too<00:02:10.869> now<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.470> mean

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.940 
proteins why is that important because
you<00:03:19.359> can<00:03:19.599> develop<00:03:19.959> in<00:03:20.290> tolerances<00:03:20.919> to

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
you can develop in tolerances to

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.460 
you can develop in tolerances to
proteins<00:03:21.549> so<00:03:22.120> what<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:22.540> find<00:03:22.870> a<00:03:22.989> lot<00:03:23.109> of<00:03:23.169> people

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
proteins so what I find a lot of people

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.770 
proteins so what I find a lot of people
do<00:03:23.709> is<00:03:24.459> that<00:03:24.760> they're<00:03:24.910> taking<00:03:25.359> they've<00:03:25.630> been

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
do is that they're taking they've been

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.080 
do is that they're taking they've been
taking<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:26.290> like<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.620> I<00:03:26.739> love<00:03:26.889> it<00:03:26.950> yay<00:03:27.280> they've

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
taking you like it I love it yay they've

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.909 
taking you like it I love it yay they've
been<00:03:28.209> taking<00:03:28.359> the<00:03:28.660> same<00:03:28.930> protein<00:03:29.410> powder<00:03:29.650> for

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:29.919 
been taking the same protein powder for

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.250 
been taking the same protein powder for
like<00:03:30.040> two<00:03:30.280> years<00:03:30.310> right<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.450> so<00:03:31.750> you<00:03:31.810> could

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
like two years right and so you could

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.259 
like two years right and so you could
develop<00:03:32.560> in<00:03:32.859> tolerances<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.400> that<00:03:33.700> so<00:03:33.940> what

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
develop in tolerances to that so what

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.580 
develop in tolerances to that so what
could<00:03:34.450> be<00:03:34.599> a<00:03:34.630> symptom<00:03:34.840> while<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:35.319> could<00:03:35.500> be

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
could be a symptom while you could be

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.729 
could be a symptom while you could be
bloated<00:03:36.160> after<00:03:36.459> you<00:03:36.609> eat<00:03:36.849> it<00:03:37.349> you<00:03:38.349> could<00:03:38.530> have

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
bloated after you eat it you could have

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.920 
bloated after you eat it you could have
eczema<00:03:39.310> acne<00:03:39.669> those<00:03:40.180> type<00:03:40.419> of<00:03:40.450> things<00:03:40.569> are

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
eczema acne those type of things are

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.930 
eczema acne those type of things are
actually<00:03:41.169> related<00:03:41.650> to<00:03:42.190> your<00:03:42.310> digestive

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
actually related to your digestive

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.089 
actually related to your digestive
health<00:03:43.180> your<00:03:43.419> gut<00:03:43.690> health<00:03:43.900> so<00:03:44.500> that's<00:03:44.769> why<00:03:45.069> I

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
health your gut health so that's why I

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.099 
health your gut health so that's why I
like<00:03:45.430> protein<00:03:46.030> powders<00:03:46.329> like<00:03:46.480> this<00:03:46.690> one<00:03:46.900> that

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
like protein powders like this one that

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.780 
like protein powders like this one that
has<00:03:47.230> five<00:03:47.620> different<00:03:48.130> proteins<00:03:48.519> so<00:03:48.669> it's

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
has five different proteins so it's

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.280 
has five different proteins so it's
highly<00:03:49.120> unlikely<00:03:49.450> that<00:03:49.870> you're<00:03:50.169> gonna

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
highly unlikely that you're gonna

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.620 
highly unlikely that you're gonna
develop<00:03:50.620> an<00:03:50.859> intolerance<00:03:51.489> of<00:03:51.669> it<00:03:51.940> and<00:03:52.180> it's

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
develop an intolerance of it and it's

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.559 
develop an intolerance of it and it's
plant-based<00:03:52.959> which<00:03:53.620> I<00:03:53.829> love<00:03:54.160> so<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:55.450> it

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
plant-based which I love so and it

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.509 
plant-based which I love so and it
tastes<00:03:55.840> good<00:03:55.989> too<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.620> has<00:03:56.829> like<00:03:57.069> a<00:03:57.099> nice<00:03:57.370> a

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
tastes good too it has like a nice a

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.580 
tastes good too it has like a nice a
nice<00:03:57.760> vanilla<00:03:58.030> flavor<00:03:58.480> as<00:03:58.660> well<00:03:58.690> do<00:03:59.349> you<00:03:59.410> use

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
nice vanilla flavor as well do you use

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.890 
nice vanilla flavor as well do you use
it<00:03:59.620> in<00:03:59.950> a<00:04:00.370> lot<00:04:00.639> of<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:00.849> stuff<00:04:01.030> yeah<00:04:01.269> so<00:04:01.599> we<00:04:01.720> also

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
it in a lot of the stuff yeah so we also

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.930 
it in a lot of the stuff yeah so we also
have<00:04:02.260> I<00:04:02.290> also<00:04:02.560> made<00:04:02.859> today<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.400> green<00:04:03.669> my

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
have I also made today the green my

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.940 
have I also made today the green my
Green<00:04:04.209> Goddess<00:04:04.419> smoothie<00:04:04.930> from<00:04:05.440> my<00:04:05.620> book<00:04:05.799> as

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
Green Goddess smoothie from my book as

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.089 
Green Goddess smoothie from my book as
well<00:04:05.980> and<00:04:06.459> i<00:04:07.239> made<00:04:07.720> homemade<00:04:08.109> almond<00:04:08.500> milk<00:04:08.709> now

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
well and i made homemade almond milk now

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.220 
well and i made homemade almond milk now
whenever<00:04:09.310> I<00:04:09.519> tell<00:04:09.910> people<00:04:10.150> that<00:04:10.720> you<00:04:10.870> can<00:04:11.019> make

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
whenever I tell people that you can make

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.229 
whenever I tell people that you can make
your<00:04:11.349> own<00:04:11.410> almond<00:04:11.950> milk<00:04:11.980> they<00:04:12.370> think<00:04:12.609> oh<00:04:12.730> do

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
your own almond milk they think oh do

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.509 
your own almond milk they think oh do
you<00:04:13.299> have<00:04:13.449> like<00:04:13.720> ours<00:04:14.410> and<00:04:14.620> they<00:04:14.709> go<00:04:14.889> every

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
you have like ours and they go every

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.729 
you have like ours and they go every
single<00:04:15.849> day<00:04:16.000> I'm<00:04:16.269> like<00:04:16.389> no<00:04:16.690> it's<00:04:16.959> actually<00:04:17.199> as

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
single day I'm like no it's actually as

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.490 
single day I'm like no it's actually as
fast<00:04:18.669> as<00:04:18.910> you<00:04:19.030> can<00:04:19.180> make<00:04:19.329> a<00:04:19.359> smoothie<00:04:19.840> almond

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
fast as you can make a smoothie almond

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.339 
fast as you can make a smoothie almond
milk<00:04:20.709> is<00:04:20.859> so<00:04:21.280> easy<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:22.060> make<00:04:22.090> so<00:04:22.810> this<00:04:23.199> is

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
milk is so easy to make so this is

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.380 
milk is so easy to make so this is
another<00:04:23.560> example<00:04:23.770> of<00:04:24.130> putting<00:04:24.460> protein<00:04:24.880> into

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
another example of putting protein into

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.450 
another example of putting protein into
your<00:04:25.539> smoothie<00:04:25.960> and<00:04:26.140> so<00:04:26.740> that's<00:04:27.099> really

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
your smoothie and so that's really

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.190 
your smoothie and so that's really
important<00:04:27.880> at<00:04:28.030> breakfast<00:04:28.510> to<00:04:28.690> always<00:04:29.020> make

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
important at breakfast to always make

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.180 
important at breakfast to always make
sure<00:04:29.229> you<00:04:29.560> get<00:04:29.680> into<00:04:29.950> good

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
sure you get into good

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.740 
sure you get into good
protein<00:04:30.460> because<00:04:30.640> that<00:04:30.790> really<00:04:31.120> balances

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
protein because that really balances

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.480 
protein because that really balances
your<00:04:31.900> blood<00:04:32.080> sugar<00:04:32.380> it<00:04:32.770> increases<00:04:33.310> your

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
your blood sugar it increases your

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.210 
your blood sugar it increases your
metabolism<00:04:33.870> so<00:04:34.870> you<00:04:34.900> know<00:04:35.440> burning<00:04:35.950> fat

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
metabolism so you know burning fat

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.410 
metabolism so you know burning fat
during<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.610> day<00:04:36.760> because<00:04:36.850> most<00:04:37.150> people

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
during the day because most people

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.000 
during the day because most people
they'll<00:04:37.570> just<00:04:37.750> have<00:04:37.810> a<00:04:37.930> quick<00:04:38.170> bowl<00:04:38.380> of<00:04:38.530> cereal

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
they'll just have a quick bowl of cereal

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.480 
they'll just have a quick bowl of cereal
and<00:04:39.190> then<00:04:39.610> they<00:04:39.730> burn<00:04:40.030> out<00:04:40.210> you<00:04:40.480> know<00:04:40.570> by<00:04:40.750> 10

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
and then they burn out you know by 10

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.060 
and then they burn out you know by 10
am-7<00:04:42.490> yeah<00:04:43.060> so<00:04:43.420> you<00:04:43.480> need<00:04:43.810> my<00:04:43.990> smoothie<00:04:44.560> so

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
am-7 yeah so you need my smoothie so

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.470 
am-7 yeah so you need my smoothie so
that's<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.370> whole<00:04:45.550> thing<00:04:45.730> plus<00:04:46.060> there's<00:04:46.300> you
