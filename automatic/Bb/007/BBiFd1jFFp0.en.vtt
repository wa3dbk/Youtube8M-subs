00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
all look at that a natural expansion

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.359 
all look at that a natural expansion
right<00:01:48.960> there<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.409> what<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.340> that

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
right there so what is that is that

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.950 
right there so what is that is that
destructible<00:01:50.850> rocks<00:01:50.909> yes<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.450> okay<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:51.840> you

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
destructible rocks yes it is okay so you

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.330 
destructible rocks yes it is okay so you
got<00:01:52.049> strippable<00:01:52.350> rocks<00:01:52.590> right<00:01:52.710> there<00:01:52.890> they're

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
got strippable rocks right there they're

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.830 
got strippable rocks right there they're
quite<00:01:53.790> hard<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.030> bring<00:01:54.270> down<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.689> they're

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
quite hard to bring down and they're

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.300 
quite hard to bring down and they're
also<00:01:54.960> really<00:01:55.320> really<00:01:55.470> close<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.009> edge<00:01:56.159> of

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
also really really close to the edge of

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.330 
also really really close to the edge of
that<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.729> then<00:01:57.509> you've<00:01:57.630> got<00:01:57.780> your<00:01:58.070> third<00:01:59.070> base

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
that and then you've got your third base

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.850 
that and then you've got your third base
right<00:01:59.640> here<00:01:59.700> or<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:00.990> one<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.590> want<00:02:01.619> to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
right here or this one if you want to

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.649 
right here or this one if you want to
pick<00:02:02.009> that's<00:02:02.520> an<00:02:02.610> undefended<00:02:02.969> gold<00:02:03.390> but

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
pick that's an undefended gold but

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.870 
pick that's an undefended gold but
there's<00:02:03.840> only<00:02:03.960> four<00:02:04.409> mineral<00:02:05.280> patches<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.759> it

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
there's only four mineral patches in it

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.270 
there's only four mineral patches in it
yeah<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.750> an<00:02:06.899> interesting<00:02:07.500> map<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.009> say

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
yeah this is an interesting map I say

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.859 
yeah this is an interesting map I say
I've<00:02:08.399> never<00:02:08.429> seen<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.940> before<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.390> believe<00:02:09.720> it's

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
I've never seen it before I believe it's

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.680 
I've never seen it before I believe it's
something<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.379> X<00:02:10.520> NASL<00:02:11.520> exclusively<00:02:12.120> users

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.869 

well<00:02:16.690> well<00:02:16.930> well<00:02:17.190> we'll<00:02:18.190> see<00:02:18.370> what<00:02:18.519> comes<00:02:18.670> of

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
well well well we'll see what comes of

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.479 
well well well we'll see what comes of
it<00:02:18.940> then<00:02:19.200> cast<00:02:20.200> barracks<00:02:20.560> on<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.069> way<00:02:21.220> of

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
it then cast barracks on the way of

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.820 
it then cast barracks on the way of
what's<00:02:21.730> he<00:02:21.790> gonna<00:02:21.879> do<00:02:22.180> with<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.709> this<00:02:23.709> is

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
what's he gonna do with it this is

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.860 
what's he gonna do with it this is
interesting<00:02:24.340> it's<00:02:24.790> gasps<00:02:25.000> count<00:02:25.330> is<00:02:25.450> minimal

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
interesting it's gasps count is minimal

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.780 
interesting it's gasps count is minimal
which<00:02:26.019> would<00:02:26.170> indicate<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.590> me<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:27.160> going<00:02:27.459> Wow

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
which would indicate to me is going Wow

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.140 
which would indicate to me is going Wow
yeah<00:02:28.360> that's<00:02:28.690> a<00:02:28.840> quick<00:02:29.050> CC<00:02:29.440> that's<00:02:29.620> CC<00:02:30.430> on<00:02:30.549> 17

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
yeah that's a quick CC that's CC on 17

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.820 
yeah that's a quick CC that's CC on 17
and<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.690> suppose<00:02:31.959> this<00:02:32.110> map<00:02:32.260> gonna<00:02:32.440> make<00:02:32.620> sense

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
and I suppose this map gonna make sense

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.130 
and I suppose this map gonna make sense
it<00:02:32.950> should<00:02:33.069> be<00:02:33.129> easy<00:02:33.310> enough<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.640> hold<00:02:33.819> this

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
it should be easy enough to hold this

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.839 
it should be easy enough to hold this
don't<00:02:35.140> see<00:02:35.319> why<00:02:35.500> not<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.400> change<00:02:36.700> in

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
don't see why not this is a change in

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.339 
don't see why not this is a change in
tactics<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.390> very<00:02:37.569> significant<00:02:38.049> change<00:02:38.260> in

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
tactics a very significant change in

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.320 
tactics a very significant change in
tactics<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.830> taking<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.370> edited<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:39.940> little

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
tactics you taking that edited a little

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.330 
tactics you taking that edited a little
bit<00:02:40.599> a<00:02:40.780> very<00:02:41.260> significant<00:02:41.830> change<00:02:42.040> in<00:02:42.129> tactics

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
bit a very significant change in tactics

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.190 
bit a very significant change in tactics

right here by empire Cass well well well
we<00:02:47.530> will<00:02:47.650> see<00:02:47.799> how<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:47.980> goes<00:02:48.660> borrow<00:02:49.660> having<00:02:49.930> a

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
we will see how it goes borrow having a

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.120 
we will see how it goes borrow having a
little<00:02:50.200> bit<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.349> a<00:02:50.440> nibble<00:02:50.590> right<00:02:50.829> here

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
little bit of a nibble right here

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.039 
little bit of a nibble right here
getting<00:02:51.459> some<00:02:51.970> obvious<00:02:52.299> minimal<00:02:52.599> count<00:02:52.780> going

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
getting some obvious minimal count going

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.009 
getting some obvious minimal count going
and<00:02:53.200> I'd<00:02:53.829> say<00:02:53.860> two<00:02:54.519> racks<00:02:54.790> expand<00:02:55.360> it's

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
and I'd say two racks expand it's

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.190 
and I'd say two racks expand it's
actually<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.290> three<00:02:56.530> racks<00:02:56.769> huh<00:02:57.310> there<00:02:57.579> you<00:02:57.640> go

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
actually a three racks huh there you go

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.410 
actually a three racks huh there you go
three<00:02:59.200> barracks<00:02:59.530> coming<00:02:59.739> up<00:02:59.829> right<00:03:00.010> here

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
three barracks coming up right here

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.410 
three barracks coming up right here
already<00:03:01.420> got<00:03:01.720> that<00:03:01.870> one<00:03:02.910> it's<00:03:03.910> not<00:03:04.060> uncommon

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
already got that one it's not uncommon

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.960 
already got that one it's not uncommon
it's<00:03:04.840> just<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.349> haven't<00:03:05.500> seen<00:03:05.799> four<00:03:06.549> barracks

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
play right this is a little bit uncommon

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.300

early tech lab and stem into expand but
he's<00:03:21.069> not<00:03:21.220> doing<00:03:21.519> that<00:03:21.549> not<00:03:22.389> at<00:03:22.510> all<00:03:23.760> I'd<00:03:24.760> also

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.330 
HuskyStarcraft isn't me either so it'd
be<00:03:32.290> kind<00:03:32.500> of<00:03:32.560> foolish<00:03:32.889> to<00:03:33.040> think<00:03:33.069> otherwise

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
be kind of foolish to think otherwise

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.930 
be kind of foolish to think otherwise
I'm<00:03:33.760> actually<00:03:33.910> the<00:03:34.329> top<00:03:34.900> right<00:03:35.170> here<00:03:35.849> and<00:03:36.849> I'm

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
I'm actually the top right here and I'm

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.430 
I'm actually the top right here and I'm
too<00:03:37.090> busy<00:03:37.239> to<00:03:37.420> ban<00:03:37.630> him<00:03:37.750> for<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.019> time<00:03:38.200> being

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
too busy to ban him for the time being

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.349 
too busy to ban him for the time being
so<00:03:38.680> I'm<00:03:38.920> sure<00:03:39.069> one<00:03:39.280> of<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.519> mods<00:03:39.880> can<00:03:40.090> do<00:03:40.209> that

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
so I'm sure one of the mods can do that

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.890 
so I'm sure one of the mods can do that
but<00:03:41.170> he<00:03:41.290> fools<00:03:41.560> fakers<00:03:42.220> gonna<00:03:42.340> fake<00:03:42.810> also<00:03:43.810> have

I mean I don't see why otherwise you'd
build<00:04:05.530> four<00:04:05.799> barracks<00:04:06.160> with<00:04:06.549> no<00:04:06.700> add-ons<00:04:06.880> that

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
build four barracks with no add-ons that

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.360 
build four barracks with no add-ons that
way<00:04:07.359> and<00:04:07.750> yes<00:04:08.380> of<00:04:08.590> course<00:04:08.799> it's<00:04:08.950> for<00:04:09.099> defense

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
way and yes of course it's for defense

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.830 
way and yes of course it's for defense
with<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:09.579> bunker<00:04:09.970> but<00:04:10.150> still<00:04:10.389> you'd<00:04:10.510> expect

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
with the bunker but still you'd expect

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.390 
with the bunker but still you'd expect
some<00:04:10.930> early<00:04:11.109> pressure<00:04:11.290> from<00:04:11.560> him

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.099 

hmm<00:04:15.560> maro<00:04:16.560> maro<00:04:16.979> what<00:04:17.850> you<00:04:18.000> up<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.329> roaches<00:04:18.959> on

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
hmm maro maro what you up to roaches on

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.140 
hmm maro maro what you up to roaches on
the<00:04:19.169> way<00:04:19.259> for<00:04:19.440> him<00:04:19.560> this<00:04:19.979> is<00:04:20.280> not<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:21.120> same

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
the way for him this is not the same

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.430 
the way for him this is not the same
thing<00:04:21.299> he<00:04:21.509> was<00:04:21.540> doing<00:04:21.660> last<00:04:21.870> time<00:04:22.109> certainly

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
thing he was doing last time certainly

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.379 
thing he was doing last time certainly
not<00:04:23.160> at<00:04:23.250> all<00:04:23.430> but<00:04:23.550> he<00:04:23.669> did<00:04:23.850> scout<00:04:24.060> our<00:04:24.210> fast

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
not at all but he did scout our fast

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:25.400 
not at all but he did scout our fast
expansion<00:04:24.720> so<00:04:24.960> it<00:04:25.050> just<00:04:25.199> makes<00:04:25.350> sense

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
expansion so it just makes sense

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.930 
expansion so it just makes sense
especially<00:04:25.830> with<00:04:26.220> a<00:04:26.280> lot<00:04:26.370> of<00:04:26.460> Marines<00:04:26.580> point

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
especially with a lot of Marines point

he's gonna need a lot of roaches to deal

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.600 
he's gonna need a lot of roaches to deal
