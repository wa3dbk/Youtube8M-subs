things that go on before the full moon

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.229 
things that go on before the full moon
then<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:49.109> would<00:00:49.319> be<00:00:49.499> a<00:00:49.739> very<00:00:50.129> easy<00:00:50.489> aspect<00:00:51.120> to

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
then that would be a very easy aspect to

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.049 
then that would be a very easy aspect to
Jupiter<00:00:51.960> during<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.859> morning<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.579> early

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
afternoon and what that does is that

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.789 
afternoon and what that does is that
will<00:00:56.309> bring<00:00:56.459> us<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.909> support<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:58.019> we<00:00:58.079> need

00:00:58.789 --> 00:00:58.799 
will bring us the support that we need

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:01.340 
will bring us the support that we need
is<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.159> water<00:00:59.639> trying<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.299> called<00:01:00.569> and<00:01:00.899> so

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
is a water trying it's called and so

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.319 
is a water trying it's called and so
that<00:01:01.499> will<00:01:01.649> give<00:01:01.679> us<00:01:01.799> the<00:01:01.979> support<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.760> if

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
that will give us the support and if

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.030 
that will give us the support and if
something<00:01:03.659> is<00:01:03.929> shifting<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.440> changing<00:01:04.470> or

alright<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.260> this<00:01:25.440> water<00:01:25.770> trine<00:01:26.130> between<00:01:26.160> the

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
alright so this water trine between the

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.120 
alright so this water trine between the
moon<00:01:26.940> and<00:01:27.120> Jupiter<00:01:27.600> before<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:28.650> moon<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.100> full

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
moon and Jupiter before the moon is full

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.740 
moon and Jupiter before the moon is full
is<00:01:29.810> intense<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:31.980> intense<00:01:32.550> energy<00:01:32.880> but

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
is intense so it's intense energy but

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.200 
is intense so it's intense energy but
it's<00:01:33.840> intense<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> positive<00:01:34.860> fashion<00:01:35.430> so

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
it's intense in the positive fashion so

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.120 
it's intense in the positive fashion so
make<00:01:36.480> sure<00:01:36.510> you<00:01:36.810> look<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.230> support<00:01:37.740> that

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
make sure you look for that support that

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.690 
make sure you look for that support that
is<00:01:38.520> out<00:01:38.820> there<00:01:38.850> if<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.780> need<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.250> then<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.520> have

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
is out there if you need it then we have

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.180 
is out there if you need it then we have
a<00:01:42.120> minor<00:01:42.540> aspect<00:01:43.050> to<00:01:43.170> chyron<00:01:43.620> Chiron's<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
a minor aspect to chyron Chiron's the

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.070 
a minor aspect to chyron Chiron's the
wounded<00:01:44.490> healer<00:01:44.730> so<00:01:45.120> if<00:01:45.450> there<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.840> something

water trying then the chyron aspect that
happens<00:01:51.210> after<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> Jupiter<00:01:52.170> aspect<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.860> all

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
happens after the Jupiter aspect is all

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.240 
happens after the Jupiter aspect is all
about<00:01:54.150> healing<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.050> finding<00:01:55.530> some<00:01:55.740> level<00:01:56.100> of

nothing new but the moon is full on the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.770 
nothing new but the moon is full on the
14th<00:02:43.950> in<00:02:44.129> May<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:44.579> as<00:02:44.760> it's<00:02:45.030> coming<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.540> its

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
14th in May so as it's coming to its

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.190 
14th in May so as it's coming to its
peak<00:02:46.230> as<00:02:46.610> it<00:02:47.610> makes<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.909> conjunction<00:02:48.390> to<00:02:48.690> Saturn

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
peak as it makes a conjunction to Saturn

meaning it's in the same place as savin

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.979 
meaning it's in the same place as savin
is<00:02:51.569> it<00:02:52.079> can<00:02:52.410> bring<00:02:52.739> up<00:02:52.980> some<00:02:53.280> old<00:02:53.519> issues<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:54.629> if

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
only will only be a couple of degrees

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.490 
only will only be a couple of degrees
away<00:04:01.530> from<00:04:01.669> Saturn<00:04:02.669> so<00:04:03.109> Tanya<00:04:04.109> wherever

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
away from Saturn so Tanya wherever

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
where this full moon is going to be and

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.879 
where this full moon is going to be and
that<00:04:11.370> means<00:04:11.760> this<00:04:12.120> full<00:04:12.480> moon<00:04:12.750> in<00:04:12.930> Scorpio<00:04:13.590> is

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
that means this full moon in Scorpio is

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:18.770 
that means this full moon in Scorpio is
going<00:04:14.639> to<00:04:14.849> be<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.269> deep<00:04:15.900> release<00:04:16.829> of<00:04:17.780> something

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
going to be a deep release of something

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.770

for<00:04:19.349> you<00:04:19.620> it's<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:20.070> water<00:04:20.340> sign<00:04:20.639> so<00:04:21.090> most<00:04:21.660> likely

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
for you it's a water sign so most likely

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.450 
for you it's a water sign so most likely
there<00:04:22.229> will<00:04:22.289> be<00:04:22.440> some<00:04:22.650> emotion<00:04:23.130> involved

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.060 
there will be some emotion involved
which<00:04:24.120> is<00:04:24.270> perfectly<00:04:24.660> fine<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:25.650> Sun<00:04:25.889> isn't

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
which is perfectly fine the Sun isn't

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.880 
which is perfectly fine the Sun isn't
Taurus<00:04:26.580> that's<00:04:27.090> what<00:04:27.390> do<00:04:27.450> we<00:04:27.599> value<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:28.680> moon

of values shift of what our structure is

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.180 
of values shift of what our structure is
because<00:04:38.750> of<00:04:38.780> Saturn<00:04:39.320> being<00:04:39.530> involved<00:04:39.890> and
