00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
nothing nothing big in there so we'll do

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.900 
nothing nothing big in there so we'll do
40<00:00:21.510> degrees<00:00:22.369> so<00:00:23.369> I'll<00:00:23.430> be<00:00:23.519> about<00:00:23.670> an<00:00:23.820> hour

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
40 degrees so I'll be about an hour

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.660 
40 degrees so I'll be about an hour
roughly<00:00:24.470> these<00:00:25.470> I'm<00:00:25.619> gonna<00:00:25.769> hang<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.160> dry<00:00:26.340> so

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
roughly these I'm gonna hang the dry so

00:00:26.670 --> 00:01:11.310 
roughly these I'm gonna hang the dry so
I'm<00:00:26.820> not<00:00:26.939> too<00:00:27.029> worried<00:00:27.150> about<00:00:27.180> drying

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.290 

so<00:01:11.830> right<00:01:11.980> now<00:01:12.070> just<00:01:12.100> filling<00:01:12.850> there's<00:01:13.150> no

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
so right now just filling there's no

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.750 
so right now just filling there's no
soap

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.270 

with<00:01:17.030> extreme<00:01:17.510> in<00:01:18.020> this<00:01:18.230> nightmare

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.040 

it's<00:01:23.700> not<00:01:23.850> different<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.270> ask<00:01:24.420> us<00:01:24.720> used<00:01:25.020> to

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
it's not different the ask us used to

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.540 
it's not different the ask us used to
fill<00:01:25.350> between<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.190> drum<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:27.600> outer<00:01:27.750> tub

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
fill between the drum and the outer tub

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.800 
fill between the drum and the outer tub
sprayed<00:01:30.210> on<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.510> clothes

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
sprayed on the clothes

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.580 
sprayed on the clothes
but<00:01:32.170> I<00:01:32.530> think<00:01:33.189> it's<00:01:33.369> better<00:01:33.520> than<00:01:33.670> just

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
but I think it's better than just

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:43.609 
but I think it's better than just
filling<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.710> drum<00:01:35.920> with<00:01:36.040> water

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.880 

that's<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.490> eagle

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.230 

right<00:01:47.820> there

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
right there

00:01:49.240 --> 00:02:26.360 
right there
the<00:01:49.540> phone

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:55.540 

such<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.400> funny<00:02:27.910> thing<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.750> jacket

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.330 

so<00:02:56.000> it<00:02:56.090> definitely<00:02:56.270> does<00:02:56.870> sense<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.950> weight

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
so it definitely does sense the weight

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.110 
so it definitely does sense the weight
and<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.390> amount<00:02:59.630> of<00:02:59.750> clothes<00:03:00.910> basically<00:03:01.910> what

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
and the amount of clothes basically what

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.890 
and the amount of clothes basically what
I've<00:03:02.270> read<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.690> I'm<00:03:02.810> seeing<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:04.900> amount

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
I've read and I'm seeing is the amount

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.750 
I've read and I'm seeing is the amount
of<00:03:06.020> water<00:03:06.290> that's<00:03:06.500> absorbed<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.490> it's<00:03:07.580> not

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
of water that's absorbed and it's not

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.160 
of water that's absorbed and it's not
left<00:03:07.940> in<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.150> bottom<00:03:08.480> there's<00:03:08.660> an<00:03:08.750> indicator

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
left in the bottom there's an indicator

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.170 
left in the bottom there's an indicator
in<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.470> body<00:03:09.710> then<00:03:10.580> needs<00:03:10.790> more<00:03:11.000> water

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
in the body then needs more water

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.000 
in the body then needs more water
because<00:03:11.540> there's<00:03:11.810> no<00:03:11.960> water<00:03:12.200> sitting<00:03:12.830> on<00:03:12.920> the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
because there's no water sitting on the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.350 
because there's no water sitting on the
bottom<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:13.490> we'll<00:03:13.580> actually<00:03:13.760> put<00:03:14.060> more<00:03:14.180> water

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
bottom and we'll actually put more water

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.150 
bottom and we'll actually put more water
in<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.660> drum<00:03:14.870> because<00:03:15.680> that<00:03:15.800> means<00:03:15.920> there's

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
in the drum because that means there's

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.690 
in the drum because that means there's
more<00:03:16.220> clothes<00:03:17.770> which<00:03:18.770> the<00:03:19.040> clothes<00:03:19.250> absorbs

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
more clothes which the clothes absorbs

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.310 
more clothes which the clothes absorbs
more<00:03:19.880> water<00:03:20.180> so<00:03:20.540> it's<00:03:20.780> actually<00:03:20.960> put<00:03:21.200> more

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
more water so it's actually put more

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:28.180 
more water so it's actually put more
water<00:03:21.530> in<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.830> drama<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:26.890> that<00:03:27.890> sound

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
water in the drama and that sound

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.670 
water in the drama and that sound
actually<00:03:28.430> is<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:29.000> Eco<00:03:29.300> bubble<00:03:29.600> working<00:03:30.530> as

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
actually is the Eco bubble working as

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.410 
actually is the Eco bubble working as
well<00:03:30.800> what<00:03:31.010> it<00:03:31.130> does<00:03:31.250> is<00:03:31.490> it<00:03:31.640> sucks<00:03:32.150> in<00:03:32.330> the

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
well what it does is it sucks in the

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.540 
well what it does is it sucks in the
water<00:03:32.630> in<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.870> bottom<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:34.010> puts<00:03:34.220> makes

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
water in the bottom and puts makes

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.610 
water in the bottom and puts makes
bubbles<00:03:34.790> of<00:03:35.030> it<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.330> squirts<00:03:36.290> it<00:03:36.410> back

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
bubbles of it and squirts it back

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.800 
bubbles of it and squirts it back
through<00:03:36.860> the<00:03:36.890> bottom<00:03:37.220> of<00:03:37.310> the<00:03:37.400> drum<00:03:37.810> so

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
through the bottom of the drum so

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.660 
through the bottom of the drum so
actually<00:03:39.080> I<00:03:39.230> know<00:03:39.410> is<00:03:39.530> actually<00:03:39.890> as<00:03:40.130> well<00:03:40.460> home

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
actually I know is actually as well home

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.360 
actually I know is actually as well home
from<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:41.770> oven<00:03:42.770> that<00:03:42.890> it's<00:03:43.070> completely

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
from that oven that it's completely

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:50.770 
from that oven that it's completely
silent

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.449 

you<00:03:51.319> can<00:03:51.470> see<00:03:51.709> it<00:03:51.800> here<00:03:51.920> in<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.069> bottom<00:03:52.280> that's

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
you can see it here in the bottom that's

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.110 
you can see it here in the bottom that's
kind<00:03:52.730> of<00:03:52.790> hard<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.180> see<00:03:53.569> that<00:03:54.440> bubbles

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
kind of hard to see that bubbles

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.280 
kind of hard to see that bubbles
actually<00:03:56.120> see<00:03:56.300> them<00:03:56.420> forming<00:03:56.870> when<00:03:56.990> the<00:03:57.080> drum

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
actually see them forming when the drum

00:03:57.290 --> 00:05:21.060 
actually see them forming when the drum
is<00:03:57.410> not<00:03:57.440> moving<00:03:59.800> there<00:04:00.800> is<00:04:01.010> tough<00:04:01.250> to<00:04:01.400> see<00:04:01.430> that

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.960 

I<00:05:22.350> also<00:05:23.350> was<00:05:23.650> reading<00:05:23.890> online<00:05:24.010> for<00:05:24.640> a<00:05:24.670> few

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
I also was reading online for a few

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.240 
I also was reading online for a few
independent<00:05:25.600> tests<00:05:25.840> between<00:05:26.290> the<00:05:26.830> diamond

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
independent tests between the diamond

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.910 
independent tests between the diamond
drum<00:05:27.580> of<00:05:27.880> the<00:05:28.480> Samsungs<00:05:29.110> and<00:05:29.440> the<00:05:29.680> Miele

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:29.920 
drum of the Samsungs and the Miele

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.490 
drum of the Samsungs and the Miele
honeycomb<00:05:30.580> drum<00:05:31.440> and<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:34.000> test<00:05:34.390> results

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
honeycomb drum and the test results

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.840 
honeycomb drum and the test results
actually<00:05:35.500> showed<00:05:35.800> that<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:36.160> diamond<00:05:36.610> room

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
actually showed that the diamond room

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.600 
actually showed that the diamond room
was<00:05:37.600> actually<00:05:37.780> gentler<00:05:38.500> than<00:05:38.920> the<00:05:39.100> honeycomb

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
was actually gentler than the honeycomb

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.840 
was actually gentler than the honeycomb
drum<00:05:40.110> on<00:05:41.110> the<00:05:41.170> clothes<00:05:41.590> I'll<00:05:42.400> post<00:05:42.670> those

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
drum on the clothes I'll post those

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.780 
drum on the clothes I'll post those
links<00:05:43.300> to<00:05:43.660> those<00:05:43.810> tests<00:05:44.290> as<00:05:44.380> well<00:05:44.640> but<00:05:45.640> what's

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
links to those tests as well but what's

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.300 
links to those tests as well but what's
quite<00:05:45.970> surprised<00:05:46.710> but<00:05:47.710> I<00:05:47.770> mean<00:05:48.010> it<00:05:48.130> does<00:05:48.280> look

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
quite surprised but I mean it does look

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.400 
quite surprised but I mean it does look
you<00:05:48.610> see<00:05:48.760> the<00:05:48.880> diamond<00:05:49.240> drum<00:05:49.510> I<00:05:49.810> mean<00:05:50.080> it's<00:05:50.350> a

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
you see the diamond drum I mean it's a

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.080 
you see the diamond drum I mean it's a
similar<00:05:52.320> technology<00:05:53.320> I<00:05:53.650> guess<00:05:53.890> as<00:05:54.100> the<00:05:54.130> Miele

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
similar technology I guess as the Miele

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.770 
similar technology I guess as the Miele
honeycomb<00:05:56.400> but<00:05:57.400> this<00:05:57.880> just<00:05:58.150> seems<00:05:58.420> to<00:05:58.630> be

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
honeycomb but this just seems to be

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:06.570 
honeycomb but this just seems to be
gentler<00:05:59.200> employed<00:05:59.590> than<00:05:59.830> the<00:05:59.980> Miele<00:06:00.990> so<00:06:05.580> and

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
gentler employed than the Miele so and

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.730 
gentler employed than the Miele so and
as<00:06:06.850> it<00:06:06.970> has<00:06:07.150> no<00:06:07.480> lint<00:06:07.780> filter<00:06:07.960> as<00:06:08.320> well<00:06:08.350> for<00:06:08.680> the

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:08.740 
as it has no lint filter as well for the

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:24.550 
as it has no lint filter as well for the
dryer

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.110 

it's<00:06:25.560> completely<00:06:26.070> silent<00:06:26.250> as<00:06:26.639> you<00:06:26.759> can<00:06:26.940> tell

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
it's completely silent as you can tell

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:33.820 
it's completely silent as you can tell
so<00:06:27.330> I<00:06:27.750> stopped<00:06:28.020> talking

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.190 

there's<00:06:34.830> just<00:06:34.950> absolutely<00:06:35.160> no<00:06:35.610> noise

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:36.200 
there's just absolutely no noise

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:42.840 
there's just absolutely no noise
completely<00:06:37.200> silent

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:42.850 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.440 

about<00:06:43.390> what<00:06:43.540> I<00:06:43.570> was<00:06:43.720> saying<00:06:43.780> was<00:06:44.380> the<00:06:45.450> between

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:46.450 
about what I was saying was the between

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.600 
about what I was saying was the between
honey<00:06:46.630> care<00:06:46.870> and<00:06:47.020> the<00:06:47.110> diamond<00:06:47.500> drama<00:06:48.220> the

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
honey care and the diamond drama the

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.860 
honey care and the diamond drama the
honeycomb<00:06:50.520> very<00:06:51.520> similar<00:06:51.880> technologies<00:06:52.540> but

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:52.870 
honeycomb very similar technologies but

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.010 
honeycomb very similar technologies but
like<00:06:53.020> I<00:06:53.110> said<00:06:53.170> this<00:06:53.410> is<00:06:53.560> a<00:06:53.590> dryer<00:06:53.890> as<00:06:54.160> well<00:06:54.190> and

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 
like I said this is a dryer as well and

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
like I said this is a dryer as well and
ever<00:06:56.020> dry<00:06:56.260> that<00:06:56.410> I've<00:06:56.530> got<00:06:56.680> in<00:06:56.770> clean<00:06:56.950> the

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.040 
ever dry that I've got in clean the

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.850 
ever dry that I've got in clean the
asko's<00:06:57.490> etc<00:06:58.060> and<00:06:58.150> me<00:06:58.270> like<00:06:58.480> I've<00:06:59.140> seen<00:06:59.440> people

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
asko's etc and me like I've seen people

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.500 
asko's etc and me like I've seen people
emptily<00:07:00.130> their<00:07:00.370> Lincoln<00:07:00.850> filters<00:07:01.150> after<00:07:01.390> the

emptily their Lincoln filters after the

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.160 
emptily their Lincoln filters after the
drying<00:07:01.750> cycle<00:07:01.840> and<00:07:02.230> there's<00:07:02.350> a<00:07:02.410> lot<00:07:02.620> of<00:07:02.770> lint

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.170 
drying cycle and there's a lot of lint

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.600 
drying cycle and there's a lot of lint
went<00:07:05.170> seems<00:07:05.710> to<00:07:05.770> be<00:07:05.860> the<00:07:05.980> wear<00:07:06.130> and<00:07:06.280> tear<00:07:06.460> on

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610 
went seems to be the wear and tear on

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.860 
went seems to be the wear and tear on
the<00:07:06.670> clothes<00:07:07.000> and<00:07:07.890> this<00:07:08.890> has<00:07:09.700> no<00:07:09.910> lint<00:07:10.150> and

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:10.870 
the clothes and this has no lint and

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:12.690 
the clothes and this has no lint and
whatever<00:07:11.170> very<00:07:11.590> little<00:07:11.890> it<00:07:12.040> that<00:07:12.190> has<00:07:12.310> a<00:07:12.340> has

the drum and out the drainage tube so

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.680 
the drum and out the drainage tube so
they're<00:07:17.950> very<00:07:18.670> very<00:07:18.880> gentle<00:07:19.300> and<00:07:19.390> close

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:19.690 
they're very very gentle and close

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.570 
they're very very gentle and close
otherwise<00:07:20.200> you'd<00:07:20.530> have<00:07:20.740> to<00:07:20.950> have<00:07:21.130> to<00:07:21.370> have<00:07:21.550> a
