 Apple presentation on March 9 was 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.469
 riveted on a new macbook many could

 touch processor intel core 5 generation and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.109
 other cool chips soon after 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.029
 events updated laptop already 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.789

 share with you your impressions 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.480
 well let's watch 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.820
 strongly focus on technical 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.910
 computer characteristics of its design 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.380
 we will not go so short in 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.180
 new macbook pro retina 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.790
 apple decided to use graphic 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.400
 intel iris 6100 new processor 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.260
 intel core processor and flash memory with 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.460
 two increased work speed by 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.340
 compared with the previous generation 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.720
 laptop about how this one got hold of on 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.970
 i computer performance we 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.260
 tell you later 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.150
 complete sets of the updated macbook pro 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.610
 retina is exactly the same as the past 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.979
 generations so long paint and and 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.590
 no need charger envelope 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.979
 screen cleaning cloth and brief 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.390
 instructions and of course the laptop itself 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.430
 computer design still causes 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.310
 admiration elegant aluminum case 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.220
 nice keyboard clicks glowing 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.110
 bullseye yes here it is yet well 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.690
 stunning display retina high 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.479
 clarity we have said this many times and 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.820
 again we need to see this screen 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.590
 the number of ports also has not changed 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.039
 two connectors on the left side 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.840
 thunderbolt 2 1 port yuesbi 30 connector for 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.500
 headphone two microphones and a port for 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.210
 charging another port yuesbi 30 hdmi and 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.280
 memory card slot you will find with 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.440
 right side but let's move on 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.780
 Unlike the new macbook pro retina from 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.020
 Force Touch Trackpad Precursors 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.369
 the same which is installed new 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.229
 12 inch macbook apple completely 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.869
 revised its approach to development 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.340
 trackpad now he's clipping abundant around 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.009
 perimeter and under its surface 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.560
 force sensors are located 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.450
 pressing thanks to this at any point 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.520
 truck fo to force touch provides 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.740
 clear click experience in macbook pro 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.990
 retina past generations there is no 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.760
 pressed trackpad with great effort you 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.740
 can you open a file or 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.700
 rename it all again depends 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.160
 by force pressing 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.140
 trackpad even vibrates slightly due to 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.850
 what is achieved the maximum degree 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.280
 sensations of what is happening on the screen 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.200
 laptop while all gestures multitouch 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.990
 which many have already got used perfectly 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.430
 work the same way with the new track 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.740
 fruit can control the speed 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.120
 actions in various astm applications 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.350
 for example to change the speed 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.270
 film rewind 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.370
 gradually enough effort 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.800
 After all, clicking on the trackpad in the end the movie 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.360
 will be rewound twice 10 times a 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.430
 even 60 times faster 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.010
 it can also be used to increase 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.200
 the desired object in the maps is implemented very 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.970
 cool forget double click 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.010
 view file finder 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.290
 you can now just clicking with the right strength 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.120
 on a treatise for example if you are with effort 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.790
 clicked on the date in the e-text 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.830
 Letters can create a new one click 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.900
 event in the calendar do the signature in 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.030
 mail can now be straight tips 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.220
 fingertip using sensor total 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.740
 press it draw lines of such thickness 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.090
 which you need more trackpad you can 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.850
 use for easy viewing 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.100
 Safari pages are now available. 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.780
 third-party internet application solutions 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.570
 for mac allows you to use everything 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.950
 the charms of force touch in applications like 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.410
 photoshop lightroom or pixelmator 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.600
 just take the stylus and start 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.140
 draw from simple lines to real 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.540
 masterpieces 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.180
 the harder you click on the track in order 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.010
 Thicker is a straight graphic line. 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.420
 the tablet 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.860
 edit photos small details with 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.570
 using force touch one 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.640
 pleasure is no longer necessary 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.220
 use the mouse just picked up 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.160
 stylus and forth new macbook pro retina 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.050
 will be a real boon for photographers 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.970
 artists and designers and maybe 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.850
 save them from the acquisition of many 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.770
 accessories let's be honest after the trackpad 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.600
 in the new macbook back to the old 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.459
 installed in macbook air 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.070
 or past generations of macbook pro 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.320
 retina no desire at all he publishes 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.980
 nice clicks but only when enabled 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.350
 condition 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.380
 if the computer is off click on the track 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.900
 Watt is generally not so interesting 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.540
 hardware limitation Well with 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.090
 performance at our disposal 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.400
 turned out to be the average ssd model at 256 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.230
 gigabyte and 8 gigabytes of RAM 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.050
 complete with dual core processor 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.690
 intel core i5 for these features 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.450
 utility geekbench gave a new macbook 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.490
 about 6000 points about the same 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.350
 how many previous generation laptop 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.570
 video tests conducted with 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.820
 using the utility blue bench new 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.620
 macbook pro retina showed 6 results 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.330
 which is very good for set in 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.850
 laptop graphics processor 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.979
 as for processor tests, here 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.410
 the computer is located only on the seventh 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.390
 location however for again it is good 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.850
 the result and these are above it 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.160
 more powerful core i7 processors 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.110
 but let's admit that if you and 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.910
 will buy a new macbook pro retina 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.100
 it is certainly not because of him 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.830
 performance main feature killer 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.260
 laptop remains trackpad force touch this 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.060
 truly revolutionary technology in 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.520
 which is a great promising future 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.680
 another important parameter when choosing 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.810
 laptop is battery life 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.120
 apple says 10 hours of work 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.460
 macbook pro retina battery but 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.520
 with active use, he barely lived 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.620
 five hours at medium loads this 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.110
 figure can be increased to seven or 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.010
 eight hours but no more that we have in 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.630
 the end 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.240
 stylish laptop modern stuffing 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.780
 retina display and unique technology 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.090
 force touch 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.130
 which you will not find anywhere else but 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:48.840
 unless in new macbook to the beginning 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.880
 whose sales wait a few more 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.250
 weeks, perhaps the only drawback 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.110
 this computer is its price in 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:59.039
 Russian online apple store it 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:01.950
 can be purchased at a price of 99 1990 rubles 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:04.530
 which is obviously expensive but it is not the fault 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.180
 only apple you understand it all 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.700
