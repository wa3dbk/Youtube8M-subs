00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
so that's how we get that kind of noise

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.660 
so that's how we get that kind of noise
and<00:01:19.659> I<00:01:20.829> actually<00:01:21.829> didn't<00:01:22.250> know<00:01:22.310> how<00:01:22.429> to<00:01:22.490> do

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
and I actually didn't know how to do

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.100 
and I actually didn't know how to do
that<00:01:22.850> for<00:01:23.119> the<00:01:23.179> first<00:01:23.390> time<00:01:23.539> when<00:01:23.780> i<00:01:23.810> first

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110

learned<00:01:24.229> that<00:01:24.500> i<00:01:24.560> learned<00:01:24.770> it<00:01:24.890> from

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
learned that i learned it from

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.419 
learned that i learned it from
horsepower<00:01:25.600> so<00:01:27.159> does<00:01:28.159> that<00:01:28.189> look<00:01:28.819> funny<00:01:29.119> back

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429

back<00:04:56.140> into<00:04:56.320> the<00:04:56.440> first<00:04:56.680> so<00:04:57.490> you're<00:04:57.700> going<00:04:57.820> to

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
back into the first so you're going to

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.820 
back into the first so you're going to
do<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.150> whole<00:04:58.300> thing<00:04:58.330> twice<00:04:59.140> it's<00:04:59.650> going<00:04:59.800> to
