00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.539
 welcome to a pinch 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.879
 building block lyrics classic follow what 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.199
 means that something we here see the 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:17.610
 you can not be that new anymore so easy 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.680
 You have to buy there already on ebay 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.750
 and consort the danny has it 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.910
 I worried, so I can fit 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.369
 to the new spongebob movie actually times 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.730
 introduce a spongebob lego set 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.040
 namely the big crab resp 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.860
 the whole is called in English krusty 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.059
 crÃªpes adventures 2009 was that 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.949
 appeared for just under 27 euros and 209 are 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.870
 that that she has to open that 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.969
 It is because of the use seller 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.280
 it with de with this again 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.590
 but nothing has been sealed the parts 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.510
 Almost everyone was there and that's how it is 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.730
 because even the possibility of this 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.840
 to imagine yes who with spongebob 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.629
 can not do anything 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.250
 he does not look any further anyway 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.629
 otherwise you will this square head 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.679
 probably right below 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.110
 have recognized 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.720
 We have the big crab that is 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.060
 a citizen load in which the boys 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.490
 work and then another 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.979
 Burger vehicle that we see on the left 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.360
 the credit partie 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.190
 that is, as I said just such a 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.780
 hamburger can drive around with the man 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.539
 Let's start with the types first 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.670
 is patrick hiob you can see from behind 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.550
 have bought dirty so used 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.619
 but you can see it too 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.989
 the killer crab to please and he 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.880
 had belly button also nice and 

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:34.950
 pretty long head that is now 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.170
 mister crepes and that belongs to the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.440
 Crosse crab speak so ours 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.479
 restaurant here and good he is too 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.459
 which has the money in hand should 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.369
 I also stick together and he had 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:49.709
 pretty soft head at least plastic 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.550
 and a few hobbit legs too 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.560
 can win 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.770
 the same can be done on spongebob 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.030
 By the way, in English square pence then 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.920
 what we have as a second name 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.770
 call square-headed is square with him 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.619
 pence only as a small cultural 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.690
 good refresher he laughs so that is 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.280
 the main actor of the 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.940
 cartoon series he is now in the 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.650
 cinema was even minted on real 3d 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.270
 I know I can not see it 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.879
 I do not have much to say here he is 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.680
 Freshly served with a crab burger 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.430
 few people put together and they share 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.069
 actually from the top 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.170
 in hamburger so should have his plate 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.129
 also and in addition a small stand 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.500
 very nice 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.299
 well we come to the big burger the 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.739
 Here's the credit , as I said 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:38.379
 party who likes to speak or vehicle so 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.909
 so you can drive around and that's why 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.090
 That's why there's a tax down there 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.889
 also bikes off and down around it 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.109
 we recognize as the small 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:49.139
 citizen grad just here again 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.909
 something colorful that could for example 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:53.799
 be so and salad leaves 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:55.239
 probably that green and there can 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.829
 if we want our spongebob 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.530
 then use it too 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.909
 that's how he is in the middle, though 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.829
 I can not handle the steering wheel properly 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:05.260
 grab between pressed in and out 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.510
 he can start driving already 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.269
 Looks like it's almost as if 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.629
 he created the place often right 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.349
 nice the part but because of the credit 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.030
 pettycoats buy that he probably does 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.760
 no one but because of the killer crab 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.709
 We got to see that here 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.750
 a big chimney next to it 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.519
 sign a flag the whole is supposed to yes 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.019
 actually play everything under water 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.819
 that's why here too 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:33.280
 these signs he attached to the area of 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.959
 to remember brickwork or shipping if 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.479
 you can also do the roof top 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.010
 Open up a bit if it happens 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:40.870
 again what is burned then you can 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.639
 times what is under water now too 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.959
 it is not that easy 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.459
 that are there we ask, I mean 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.639
 we have some kelche here with it 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.620
 Also what can drink under water here 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.569
 is synonymous where we have to go there is 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.509
 the entrance and actually the doors 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.560
 go on automatic doors should be 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:58.659
 you have to yet again hand Create 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.400
 For example, we can take something else 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:02.290
 There you can lie down nine cramps of burger 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.849
 There is a cash register and that looks like 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.919
 but there is no such thing as an oven 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.310
 according to the description that is namely the 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:11.650
 he still has safe from mister cancer 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.370
 to adorn a small coffee mug 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.290
 put on it 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.699
 Well that's not a quickie market right now 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.709
 He will be in the seventh soon 

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:19.329
 row again as big appear 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.699
 But that will only cost you 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.190
 or you have to say 720 euros 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:26.530
 Here we have the instructions now 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.960
 nothing surprising you build so 20 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.480
 minutes 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.260
 Book half an hour here 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.390
 we are put together like we are 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.180
 Surprisingly, with these staples 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.680
 here is not top left which parts 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.050
 you first have to search together for them 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.130
 then you have to put it together 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.310
 guess from the pictures themselves 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.650
 demanding 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.960
 we'll see it all again in lego 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.340
 printed form unsurprisingly it 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.380
 Of course there are also other sets 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.180
 and of course one has to say 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.580
 and I have two of those 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.320
 more worried can be seen that 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.700
 I will be here again in the near future 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.200
 corresponding presentation 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:07.060
 who is spongebob square pence fan ? 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.820
 he 'll probably still be on the set 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.460
 have if he by that time then because 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.690
 already fan was of lego or hunting right 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.210
 certainly somehow today 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.800
 worried otherwise maybe there is 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.780
 sometimes new sets I go now 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.690
 no rating is a classic set 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.430
 that eludes any rating 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.530
 could always rent his own 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.170
 Advantage then made easy of 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:32.520
 Apartments from dry to the next 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.520
 then and bye
