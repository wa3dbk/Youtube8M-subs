00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
sonic is an original

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.160 
sonic is an original
character<00:02:14.239> so<00:02:15.239> what<00:02:15.420> you're<00:02:15.569> going<00:02:15.659> to<00:02:15.720> do<00:02:15.900> is

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
character so what you're going to do is

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.140 
character so what you're going to do is
going<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.470> blur<00:02:16.709> out<00:02:16.739> all<00:02:17.159> the<00:02:17.489> white<00:02:17.700> parts

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.580 
going to blur out all the white parts
until<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.959> can<00:02:19.079> only<00:02:19.290> see<00:02:19.650> black<00:02:20.099> and<00:02:20.519> sonic

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
until you can only see black and sonic

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.850 
until you can only see black and sonic
isn't<00:02:22.590> sonic<00:02:23.040> beautiful<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.879> think<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.900> fill

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
isn't sonic beautiful I think the fill

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.339 
isn't sonic beautiful I think the fill
tool<00:02:26.129> actually<00:02:26.430> added<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.030> lot<00:02:27.299> to<00:02:27.360> him<00:02:27.750> he

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
tool actually added a lot to him he

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.490 
tool actually added a lot to him he
looks<00:02:28.590> pretty<00:02:28.920> fantastic<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:31.200> now<00:02:31.379> we're

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
looks pretty fantastic so now we're

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.770 
looks pretty fantastic so now we're
gonna<00:02:31.590> add<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:32.040> another<00:02:32.790> filling<00:02:33.209> tool<00:02:33.450> to

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
gonna add the another filling tool to

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.619 
gonna add the another filling tool to
his<00:02:33.900> arms<00:02:34.319> so<00:02:34.739> he<00:02:34.829> looks<00:02:35.010> more<00:02:35.250> realistic<00:02:35.629> Wow

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
his arms so he looks more realistic Wow

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.069 
his arms so he looks more realistic Wow
he<00:02:37.140> also<00:02:37.290> looks<00:02:37.620> like<00:02:37.709> he<00:02:37.859> should<00:02:38.040> be<00:02:38.069> in<00:02:38.250> Sonic

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
he also looks like he should be in Sonic

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.289 
he also looks like he should be in Sonic
so<00:02:40.079> now<00:02:40.650> we're<00:02:40.859> after<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.280> finish<00:02:41.670> done<00:02:41.879> filling

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
so now we're after a finish done filling

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.839 
so now we're after a finish done filling
in<00:02:42.510> all<00:02:42.659> this<00:02:43.079> parts<00:02:43.620> including<00:02:44.370> his<00:02:44.489> belly

in all this parts including his belly

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.240 
in all this parts including his belly
because<00:02:45.480> we<00:02:45.629> want<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.109> be<00:02:46.230> cool<00:02:46.440> we're

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
because we want that to be cool we're

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.039 
because we want that to be cool we're
going<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.430> add<00:02:47.609> a<00:02:47.639> spray<00:02:48.150> paint<00:02:48.480> tool<00:02:48.750> and

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
going to add a spray paint tool and

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.030 
going to add a spray paint tool and
color<00:02:49.620> him<00:02:49.889> green<00:02:50.310> right<00:02:51.590> gray<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:52.739> a<00:02:52.799> cool

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.520 
color him green right gray is a cool
color<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:54.060> I<00:02:54.120> decided<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.599> do<00:02:54.750> green<00:02:55.109> instead

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
color so I decided to do green instead

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.220 
color so I decided to do green instead
because<00:02:56.340> green<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:57.000> one<00:02:57.359> of<00:02:57.480> my<00:02:57.690> favorite

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
because green is one of my favorite

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.520 
because green is one of my favorite
colors<00:02:58.639> this<00:02:59.639> screen<00:02:59.970> is<00:03:00.000> not<00:03:00.180> only<00:03:00.569> green<00:03:01.079> but

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530

it's also neon green which adds a new

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.160 
it's also neon green which adds a new
