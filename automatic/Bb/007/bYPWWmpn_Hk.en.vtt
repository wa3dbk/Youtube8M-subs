00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.260
 love this fat because i take time and 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.800
 Just how we really hold it 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.930
 these yes get these splendid mane and 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.210
 What I wanted to say is the hair 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.449
 so are great in 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.000
 The park should be aware of tricks and 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.370
 I asked what else I wanted to say 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.330
 is when you hit her hairstyle 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.830
 if it looks even better than that 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.710
 language pictures if you are with this hairstyle 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.470
 it sleeps the next day but still 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.259
 much better than the first day but 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.560
 I think it looks so nice too 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.939
 when fresh culminate and coiffed and 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.930
 yes, before I continue to model great 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:29.189
 want to start then just with 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.380
 the tutorial and the wife so we catch as 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.689
 Eat it comes then as times a 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.930
 xxl volume chance that you can do it 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.380
 never 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.250
 I will put the product in my hair 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.259
 massage in so I just have mine 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.909
 hair washed and also a rinse 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.790
 and now we are with the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.710
 work and we will foam 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.710
 massage the product into our hair 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.740
 Very important is that you have the hair 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.080
 so it is not allowed to run through ski runs 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.360
 be hair and I always do that when 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.340
 the hair is still wet and then 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.959
 again the dry but as I said 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.989
 it is very important that we really 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.800
 no costs because it is very much later 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.590
 wants to disturb 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.690
 when we're curling and now 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.340
 we will do the hair that way 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.370
 they are really dry too 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.920
 you go out in this weather too 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.770
 can any of them be very important 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.290
 Hair may not be moist or 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.600
 otherwise something really dry and a 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.030
 small tip from me for her your hair 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.590
 Over head and then you have the craft 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.690
 on volume just so he know 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.700
 so now we split up our hair and 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.760
 Although I take the first part first 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.730
 going to be a clean separation 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.030
 and then we have the legal 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:13.019
 fix it on so that we down with the 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:16.290
 first with it the first strand of hair 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.060
 their very important to start 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.600
 gloves on because I already have 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.780
 badly burned with this curling iron 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.760
 therefore best cautious thus said 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.329
 I will turn the hair outwards 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.760
 develop and wait a bit and end up 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.500
 I will go through the back and forth states 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.670
 forth 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:41.239
 and only then the strand something 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.239
 let cool down 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.890
 this is what the whole thing looks like 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.050
 so-called corkscrew run 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.180
 I leave it as you see 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.560
 cool down a bit and in retrospect 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.440
 I will then with one 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.520
 fix hairspray 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.790
 but I make a strand 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.790
 strive 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.730
 so I will not do it all for now 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.079
 i will document it in the 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.569
 fast run now for the first time 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.909
 be played and I just look 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.379
 which technology I work with and how 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:16.769
 I split the hair then 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.769
 OK 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.600
 there comes the crisis 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.220
 By the way, just showered and makes 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.390
 now ready for the next one 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.690
 video what you turn yes yes yes next 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.690
 it's 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.470
 so now are already with the 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.810
 I'll discuss it all over again 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.460
 time with the hairspray 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:18.090
 I think it's a bit baroque 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.910
 endure not has something of baroque 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.490
 i'll look at my hard and you 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.410
 take something apart with your finger 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.520
 and they work a bit 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:33.270
 because it's the curious skeleton 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.350
 and I work with the fingers 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:39.000
 and there is my grandfather his grandfather 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.680
 bumps or smooth strands 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.990
 therefore I edit it again 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:50.550
 with the curling iron by putting it out 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:53.790
 search and you again I take so well 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.800
 pull wild pigs next number and 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:59.190
 then I'll do that in hindsight too 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:04.470
 The hair is copied and then we have 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:08.780
 already beautiful volume so is the 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:12.840
 Person already finished and still would like 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.610
 The hairstyle can also take time in the end too 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.010
 fix that looks very nice too 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.650
 but I think I will often 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.120
 wear but here is enormous and beautiful 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:31.340
 can look old because in the hair 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:31.340
 to make jaja story laterally 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.010
 we know that even before mine 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.900
 legality tutorial 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.210
 I hope you caught the video 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:45.220
 stinked and prevented me so 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.220
 love you never forget
