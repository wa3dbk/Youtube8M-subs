you're<00:02:05.969> going<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.600> where<00:02:06.750> they<00:02:06.869> could

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
you're going to have it where they could

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.800 
you're going to have it where they could
just<00:02:07.020> type<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.770> into<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.129> gps<00:02:08.550> system<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.690> it

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
just type it into a gps system and it

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.330 
just type it into a gps system and it
automatically<00:02:10.349> knows<00:02:10.679> where<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.009> needs<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.250> go

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
automatically knows where it needs to go

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.380 
automatically knows where it needs to go
deliver<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.090> paper

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
deliver the paper

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.720 
deliver the paper
person<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.810> come<00:02:13.110> back<00:02:13.350> and<00:02:13.710> then<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.610> know

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
person to come back and then you know

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.980 
person to come back and then you know
why<00:02:14.940> do<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.180> even<00:02:15.300> need<00:02:15.569> somebody

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
why do you even need somebody

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.800 
why do you even need somebody

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.790 
controlling it with an iPad at that
point<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.740> course<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.910> not<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.569> only

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
point and of course this is not the only

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.980 
point and of course this is not the only
company<00:02:22.800> who<00:02:22.980> is<00:02:23.130> looking<00:02:23.310> at<00:02:23.610> using<00:02:23.819> UAVs<00:02:24.270> in

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
company who is looking at using UAVs in

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.890 
company who is looking at using UAVs in
order<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.770> deliver<00:02:26.100> mail<00:02:26.430> in<00:02:26.670> fact<00:02:26.970> fedex<00:02:27.600> has

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
order to deliver mail in fact fedex has

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.070 
order to deliver mail in fact fedex has
made<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.410> known<00:02:28.620> that<00:02:28.650> they<00:02:29.190> want<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.760> also<00:02:30.080> be

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
made it known that they want to also be

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.660 
made it known that they want to also be
able<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.440> use<00:02:31.650> drones<00:02:31.920> in<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.250> future<00:02:32.520> because

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
able to use drones in the future because

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.240 
able to use drones in the future because
if<00:02:32.880> they<00:02:33.000> use<00:02:33.180> passenger<00:02:33.780> airplanes<00:02:34.320> as<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:35.130> is

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
if they use passenger airplanes as it is

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.490 
if they use passenger airplanes as it is
right<00:02:35.459> now<00:02:35.520> they<00:02:36.209> have<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.570> pressurize<00:02:37.050> the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
right now they have to pressurize the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.350 
right now they have to pressurize the
planes<00:02:37.800> in<00:02:38.010> order<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.310> do<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.910> that

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
planes in order to do that and that

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.180 
planes in order to do that and that
actually<00:02:39.840> costs<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.290> lot<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.500> money<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:41.040> it's

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
actually costs a lot of money and it's

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.220 
actually costs a lot of money and it's
time<00:02:41.370> consuming<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:41.910> all<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:43.020> if

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
time consuming and all that and so if

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.750 
time consuming and all that and so if
they<00:02:43.500> could<00:02:43.680> have<00:02:43.830> a<00:02:43.860> system<00:02:44.250> where<00:02:44.310> they're

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
they could have a system where they're

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.090 
they could have a system where they're
using<00:02:45.180> drones<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.660> deliver<00:02:45.900> your<00:02:46.680> mail<00:02:46.800> back

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
using drones to deliver your mail back

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.210 
using drones to deliver your mail back
and<00:02:47.310> forth<00:02:47.550> they<00:02:48.060> say<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:49.230> what<00:02:49.560> they

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
and forth they say that is what they

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.680 
and forth they say that is what they
want<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.760> course<00:02:50.970> then<00:02:51.209> they<00:02:51.390> don't<00:02:51.570> have

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
want and of course then they don't have

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.979 
want and of course then they don't have
to<00:02:51.840> pay<00:02:51.989> any<00:02:52.140> pilots<00:02:52.590> as<00:02:52.739> well<00:02:52.769> so<00:02:53.600> this<00:02:54.600> is<00:02:54.840> the

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
to pay any pilots as well so this is the

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.070 
to pay any pilots as well so this is the
future<00:02:55.200> guys<00:02:55.470> just<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:56.010> little<00:02:56.640> touch<00:02:57.269> at<00:02:57.660> what

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
future guys just a little touch at what

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.259 
future guys just a little touch at what
is<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.500> come<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:59.070> it<00:02:59.489> might<00:02:59.670> be<00:02:59.730> a<00:02:59.910> little<00:03:00.060> bit

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
is to come and it might be a little bit

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.150 
is to come and it might be a little bit
hard<00:03:00.480> for<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.989> see<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.680> future<00:03:01.980> where

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
hard for you to see the the future where

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.040 
hard for you to see the the future where
everything<00:03:02.700> is<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:03.330> know<00:03:03.450> automated

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
everything is you know automated

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.870 
everything is you know automated
machines<00:03:04.590> but<00:03:04.890> it's<00:03:05.100> it's<00:03:05.400> going<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.730> get

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
machines but it's it's going to get

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.580 
machines but it's it's going to get
there<00:03:06.150> I'm<00:03:06.300> telling<00:03:06.660> you<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:06.989> we're<00:03:07.470> gonna

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590

there I'm telling you and we're gonna
have<00:03:07.650> to<00:03:08.040> totally<00:03:08.310> change<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.940> way<00:03:09.090> we<00:03:09.420> look

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
have to totally change the way we look

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.360 
have to totally change the way we look
at<00:03:09.870> everything<00:03:10.260> in<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.560> way<00:03:10.650> our<00:03:10.830> system<00:03:11.070> and

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
at everything in the way our system and

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.070 
at everything in the way our system and
economy<00:03:11.820> is<00:03:11.940> built<00:03:12.120> up<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.540> it's<00:03:12.810> kind<00:03:13.019> of

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
economy is built up and it's kind of

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.600 
economy is built up and it's kind of
scary<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.890> in<00:03:14.610> some<00:03:14.970> sense<00:03:15.180> but<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.600> FAA<00:03:16.610> they

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610

drones personal drones can be used by
the<00:03:25.860> year<00:03:26.600> 2015<00:03:27.600> so<00:03:27.630> they're<00:03:28.200> coming<00:03:28.410> up<00:03:28.500> with

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
the year 2015 so they're coming up with

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.229 
the year 2015 so they're coming up with
all<00:03:28.739> these<00:03:28.860> rules<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.310> regulations<00:03:29.850> so<00:03:30.060> in

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
all these rules and regulations so in

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.120 
all these rules and regulations so in
the<00:03:30.630> future<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:31.140> are<00:03:31.290> going<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.620> start<00:03:31.799> seeing

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
the future you are going to start seeing

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.940 
the future you are going to start seeing
a<00:03:32.280> lot<00:03:32.730> more<00:03:33.079> stuff<00:03:34.079> in<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.470> sky<00:03:34.709> flying

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
a lot more stuff in the sky flying

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.430 
a lot more stuff in the sky flying
around<00:03:35.340> so<00:03:35.519> I'm<00:03:35.579> sure<00:03:35.730> UFO<00:03:36.239> reports<00:03:36.750> are<00:03:37.200> going

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
around so I'm sure UFO reports are going

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.560 
around so I'm sure UFO reports are going
to<00:03:37.530> also<00:03:37.680> increase<00:03:38.160> as<00:03:38.400> well<00:03:38.610> so<00:03:39.209> that<00:03:39.329> doesn't

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
to also increase as well so that doesn't

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.880 
to also increase as well so that doesn't
remain<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.959> red<00:03:40.170> dragon<00:03:40.350> if<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.650> want<00:03:40.799> to

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
remain the red dragon if you want to

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.350 
remain the red dragon if you want to
