00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
working on here at South by Southwest so

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.439 
working on here at South by Southwest so
how<00:00:28.650> does<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.830> how<00:00:29.490> does<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:29.789> technology

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
how does this how does this technology

patterns<00:00:46.260> just<00:00:46.860> show<00:00:47.280> people<00:00:47.309> cool<00:00:47.700> stuff<00:00:47.940> in

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
patterns just show people cool stuff in

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.779 
patterns just show people cool stuff in
general<00:00:48.180> really<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:50.070> an<00:00:50.340> example

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
general really and so like an example

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.160 
general really and so like an example
this<00:00:50.879> would<00:00:51.059> be<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.180> on<00:00:51.420> google<00:00:51.719> maps<00:00:51.899> so

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
this would be like on google maps so

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.170 
this would be like on google maps so
like<00:00:52.410> when<00:00:52.590> you're<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:53.010> get<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
like when you're you get on like the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.930 
like when you're you get on like the
satellite<00:00:54.870> street<00:00:55.199> level<00:00:55.410> whatever<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:56.160> it's

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
satellite street level whatever and it's

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.910 
satellite street level whatever and it's
the<00:00:57.059> middle<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.360> summer<00:00:57.600> only<00:00:58.170> your<00:00:58.320> your<00:00:58.649> view

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the middle of summer only your your view

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
time so well one of our cameras is

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.190 
time so well one of our cameras is
actually<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> still<00:01:09.360> camera<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.049> going<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
actually a still camera so it's going to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.840 
actually a still camera so it's going to
take<00:01:10.290> footage<00:01:10.950> similar<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.490> what<00:01:11.580> google

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
take footage similar to what google

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.609 
take footage similar to what google
earth<00:01:11.970> or<00:01:12.240> google<00:01:12.330> maps<00:01:12.810> will<00:01:13.170> give<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.409> as

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
earth or google maps will give you as

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.170 
earth or google maps will give you as
far<00:01:13.799> as<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> static<00:01:14.280> imagery<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:15.000> what's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
far as the static imagery but what's

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.550 
far as the static imagery but what's
cool<00:01:15.299> about<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.840> since<00:01:16.229> we're<00:01:16.380> on<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
cool about it is that since we're on the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.740 
cool about it is that since we're on the
ISS<00:01:16.979> will<00:01:17.670> be<00:01:17.790> able<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.970> image<00:01:18.299> some<00:01:18.509> places

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
ISS will be able to image some places

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.450 
ISS will be able to image some places
multiple<00:01:19.229> times<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.590> week<00:01:19.740> multiple<00:01:20.159> times<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
multiple times a week multiple times a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.100 
multiple times a week multiple times a
month<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.880> we'll<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.060> really<00:01:21.360> fresh<00:01:21.630> imagery

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
month so we'll have really fresh imagery

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.570 
month so we'll have really fresh imagery
so<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.619> won't<00:01:22.680> have<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.890> look<00:01:23.040> at<00:01:23.189> year<00:01:23.400> old

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
so you won't have to look at year old

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.399 
so you won't have to look at year old
data<00:01:23.909> or<00:01:24.150> data<00:01:24.299> when<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.840> was<00:01:24.930> winter<00:01:25.229> but<00:01:25.350> it's

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
data or data when it was winter but it's

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.470 
data or data when it was winter but it's
actually<00:01:25.560> summer<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.220> stuff<00:01:26.430> like<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.610> so

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:27.480 
actually summer and stuff like that so

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.330 
actually summer and stuff like that so
so<00:01:27.690> how<00:01:27.870> does<00:01:28.110> one<00:01:28.320> get<00:01:28.500> on<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.010> space<00:01:29.310> station

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
so how does one get on the space station

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.420 
so how does one get on the space station
do<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.240> get<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.510> go<00:01:30.540> down<00:01:31.380> there<00:01:31.560> absolutely<00:01:32.250> I

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
International Space Station they're

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.350 
International Space Station they're
willing<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.310> do<00:01:44.460> some<00:01:44.640> commercial<00:01:44.970> projects

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
about it we are too so that's great

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.810 
about it we are too so that's great
tells<00:01:49.380> more<00:01:49.620> about<00:01:49.650> on<00:01:50.010> earth<00:01:50.250> cast<00:01:50.550> and<00:01:50.730> like

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
tells more about on earth cast and like

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.300 
tells more about on earth cast and like
house<00:01:51.030> how<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.510> company<00:01:52.170> has<00:01:52.530> evolved<00:01:53.100> and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
house how the company has evolved and

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.730 
house how the company has evolved and
where<00:01:53.910> it's<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.120> well<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.170> been<00:01:55.440> a<00:01:55.470> huge

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
where it's going well it's been a huge

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.290 
where it's going well it's been a huge
evolutionary<00:01:56.490> process<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.970> pretty<00:01:57.150> much

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
evolutionary process it pretty much

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.260 
evolutionary process it pretty much
changes<00:01:57.780> weekly<00:01:58.260> with<00:01:59.040> with<00:01:59.370> space<00:01:59.670> space<00:02:00.060> is

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
changes weekly with with space space is

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.060 
changes weekly with with space space is
huge<00:02:00.660> overhead<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.470> there's<00:02:01.620> a<00:02:01.680> pretty<00:02:01.890> big

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
huge overhead and there's a pretty big

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.250 
huge overhead and there's a pretty big
barrier<00:02:02.400> to<00:02:02.520> entry<00:02:02.550> most<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.120> the<00:02:03.210> time<00:02:03.420> we

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
barrier to entry most of the time we

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.480 
barrier to entry most of the time we
have<00:02:04.380> some<00:02:04.500> really<00:02:04.530> good<00:02:04.800> partnerships<00:02:05.310> that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
have some really good partnerships that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.250 
have some really good partnerships that
make<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> little<00:02:06.450> bit<00:02:06.630> more<00:02:06.750> reasonable<00:02:06.900> for

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
make it a little bit more reasonable for

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.930 
make it a little bit more reasonable for
us<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.440> do<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.650> on<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.800> more<00:02:08.369> reasonable<00:02:08.520> budget

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
us to do it on a more reasonable budget

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.940 
us to do it on a more reasonable budget
so<00:02:09.930> gives<00:02:10.140> us<00:02:10.260> a<00:02:10.320> little<00:02:10.440> bit<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.649> an<00:02:10.770> advantage

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
so gives us a little bit of an advantage

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.470 
so gives us a little bit of an advantage
over<00:02:11.220> some<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.580> our<00:02:11.670> competition<00:02:11.850> it<00:02:12.210> makes<00:02:12.360> us

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
over some of our competition it makes us

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.850 
over some of our competition it makes us
able<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.810> view<00:02:12.990> stuff<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.410> no<00:02:13.530> one<00:02:13.560> else<00:02:13.710> can

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
able to view stuff that no one else can

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.980 
able to view stuff that no one else can
really<00:02:14.100> do<00:02:14.250> but<00:02:15.030> uh<00:02:15.090> there's<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:15.840> lot<00:02:15.960> of

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
really do but uh there's a lot of

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.690 
really do but uh there's a lot of
challenges<00:02:16.230> new<00:02:16.680> challenges<00:02:17.040> every<00:02:17.280> week<00:02:17.430> I

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
challenges new challenges every week I

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.040 
challenges new challenges every week I
mean<00:02:17.880> with<00:02:18.090> space<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.570> know<00:02:18.660> sometimes

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
mean with space you know sometimes

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.780 
mean with space you know sometimes
rockets<00:02:19.470> blow<00:02:19.770> up<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.250> know<00:02:20.340> sometimes

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
rockets blow up you know sometimes

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.760 
rockets blow up you know sometimes
equipment<00:02:21.690> fails<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.350> there's<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.590> lot<00:02:22.710> of

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
equipment fails so there's a lot of

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.320 
equipment fails so there's a lot of
stuff<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.070> you<00:02:23.310> have<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.550> account<00:02:23.790> for<00:02:23.910> so

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
stuff that you have to account for so

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.730 
stuff that you have to account for so
yeah<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:24.960> mean<00:02:25.050> that's<00:02:25.200> been<00:02:25.410> some<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.680> the

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
yeah I mean that's been some of the

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.110 
yeah I mean that's been some of the
biggest<00:02:25.890> challenges<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:26.490> far<00:02:26.550> but<00:02:26.940> it's

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
biggest challenges so far but it's

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.240 
biggest challenges so far but it's
working<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.570> far<00:02:27.600> so<00:02:27.960> and<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:28.830> what<00:02:29.010> did<00:02:29.100> you

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
working so far so and so what did you

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.340 
working so far so and so what did you
launch<00:02:29.400> here<00:02:29.850> at<00:02:29.910> South<00:02:30.480> by<00:02:30.600> Southwest<00:02:30.810> well

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
launch here at South by Southwest well

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.680 
launch here at South by Southwest well
we<00:02:31.500> created<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.010> custom<00:02:32.220> event<00:02:32.850> page<00:02:33.090> for<00:02:33.480> South

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
we created a custom event page for South

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.690 
we created a custom event page for South
by<00:02:33.870> Southwest<00:02:34.080> basically<00:02:34.950> one<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.580> big

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
by Southwest basically one of the big

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.220 
by Southwest basically one of the big
ideas<00:02:36.060> around<00:02:36.300> our<00:02:36.480> platform<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:36.990> that<00:02:37.140> we

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
ideas around our platform is that we

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.870 
ideas around our platform is that we
want<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.440> capture<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.890> Earth's<00:02:38.040> events<00:02:38.520> we

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
want to capture the Earth's events we

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.070 
want to capture the Earth's events we
want<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.090> capture<00:02:39.270> things<00:02:39.600> like<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:39.900> like

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
want to capture things like this like

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.050 
want to capture things like this like
South<00:02:40.290> by<00:02:40.440> Southwest<00:02:40.680> things<00:02:41.370> like<00:02:41.550> of

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
South by Southwest things like of

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.090 
South by Southwest things like of
hurricanes<00:02:42.989> you<00:02:43.290> know<00:02:43.380> things<00:02:43.620> like<00:02:43.739> burning

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
hurricanes you know things like burning

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.830 
hurricanes you know things like burning
man<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.459> know<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.880> Olympics<00:02:45.300> all<00:02:45.480> kinds<00:02:45.780> of

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
man you know the Olympics all kinds of

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.150 
man you know the Olympics all kinds of

platform what we're demoing here we've

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.290 
platform what we're demoing here we've
actually<00:02:50.130> integrated<00:02:50.700> with<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.820> lot<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.000> geo

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
actually integrated with a lot of geo

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.270 
actually integrated with a lot of geo
geo<00:02:51.720> layers<00:02:51.989> like<00:02:52.260> stuff<00:02:52.860> from<00:02:52.950> Twitter

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280

when<00:03:33.690> chest<00:03:34.690> borough<00:03:34.930> came<00:03:35.290> up<00:03:35.500> with<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.860> idea

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
when chest borough came up with the idea

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.580 
when chest borough came up with the idea
and<00:03:36.310> labeled<00:03:36.819> that<00:03:36.940> open<00:03:37.330> innovation<00:03:37.500> what<00:03:38.500> he

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
and labeled that open innovation what he

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.020 
and labeled that open innovation what he
was<00:03:38.739> really<00:03:38.980> trying<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.400> do<00:03:39.549> this<00:03:39.819> to

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
was really trying to do this to

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.820 
was really trying to do this to
basically<00:03:40.450> say<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:41.019> world<00:03:41.230> is<00:03:41.350> moving<00:03:41.560> too

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
basically say the world is moving too

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.640 
basically say the world is moving too
fast<00:03:42.040> us<00:03:42.340> too<00:03:42.730> much<00:03:42.959> technological<00:03:43.959> velocity

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
fast us too much technological velocity

fast us too much technological velocity
that<00:03:45.400> that<00:03:46.209> you<00:03:46.450> just<00:03:46.750> can't<00:03:47.049> keep<00:03:47.319> up<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:47.739> you

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
that that you just can't keep up and you

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.210
