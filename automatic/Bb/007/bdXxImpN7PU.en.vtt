in 43 and 35 all time know this is a guy

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.189 
in 43 and 35 all time know this is a guy
who<00:00:53.370> he<00:00:53.850> may<00:00:54.090> not<00:00:54.270> have<00:00:54.329> come<00:00:54.690> out<00:00:54.809> as<00:00:55.020> many

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
who he may not have come out as many

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.380 
who he may not have come out as many

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
times as some of his other peers but he

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.180 
times as some of his other peers but he
still<00:00:57.660> has<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.079> record<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.530> foreign<00:00:58.890> one<00:00:59.010> he's

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
still has that record a foreign one he's

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.910 
still has that record a foreign one he's
only<00:00:59.340> lost<00:00:59.730> one<00:01:00.329> game<00:01:00.359> here<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.379> probably

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
only lost one game here and probably

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.770 
only lost one game here and probably
it's<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.309> hard<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.579> do<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.359> States

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
it's so hard to do and this is States

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.590 
it's so hard to do and this is States
first<00:01:04.110> game<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:05.339> gonna<00:01:05.460> be<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> tough<00:01:05.850> one<00:01:06.119> it

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
first game it's gonna be a tough one it

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.050 
first game it's gonna be a tough one it
certainly<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.110> man<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:08.549> map<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.909> we<00:01:09.030> have

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
certainly is man the map that we have

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.090 
certainly is man the map that we have
this<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.479> too<00:01:09.720> as<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> map<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.409> state<00:01:10.650> probably

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
this on too as a map that state probably

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.190 
this on too as a map that state probably
hasn't<00:01:11.369> seen<00:01:11.610> all<00:01:12.090> too<00:01:12.270> often<00:01:12.420> his<00:01:12.689> other<00:01:12.900> term

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
hasn't seen all too often his other term

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.960 
hasn't seen all too often his other term
it's<00:01:13.470> gonna<00:01:13.619> be<00:01:13.710> on<00:01:13.799> decayed<00:01:14.340> King<00:01:14.729> Sejong

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
it's gonna be on decayed King Sejong

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.270 
it's gonna be on decayed King Sejong
station<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.049> bit<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.380> unique<00:01:16.590> map<00:01:16.979> and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
station so a bit of a unique map and

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.160 
station so a bit of a unique map and
this<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.790> first<00:01:18.180> time<00:01:18.420> playing<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.960> per

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
this is the first time playing in per

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.609 
this is the first time playing in per
league

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
league

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.410 
league
he's<00:01:20.159> probably<00:01:20.369> prepared<00:01:20.790> for<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.060> for<00:01:21.240> only

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
he's probably prepared for it for only

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.850 
he's probably prepared for it for only
about<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.750> week<00:01:22.020> when<00:01:22.380> he<00:01:22.439> found<00:01:22.680> out<00:01:22.830> that

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
about a week when he found out that

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.140 
about a week when he found out that
that's<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.159> map<00:01:23.310> who's<00:01:23.460> gonna<00:01:23.610> be<00:01:23.759> playing<00:01:24.030> on

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
that's the map who's gonna be playing on

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.640 
that's the map who's gonna be playing on
so<00:01:24.840> he's<00:01:24.990> got<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> little<00:01:25.259> bit<00:01:25.439> less

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
so he's got a little bit less

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.100 
so he's got a little bit less
familiarity<00:01:26.040> perhaps<00:01:26.580> than<00:01:27.390> classic<00:01:27.990> and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
familiarity perhaps than classic and

familiarity perhaps than classic and

this<00:03:52.840> is<00:03:52.959> not<00:03:53.109> going<00:03:53.379> to<00:03:53.469> kill<00:03:53.709> state<00:03:53.980> but<00:03:54.489> it

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
this is not going to kill state but it

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:55.890 
this is not going to kill state but it
may<00:03:54.700> do<00:03:54.909> a<00:03:54.939> significant<00:03:55.480> amount<00:03:55.659> of<00:03:55.719> damage

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
may do a significant amount of damage

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.599 
may do a significant amount of damage
let's<00:03:56.260> find<00:03:56.439> out<00:03:56.590> just<00:03:56.620> how<00:03:57.010> much<00:03:57.189> chrono

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
let's find out just how much chrono

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:58.920 
let's find out just how much chrono
boost<00:03:57.760> being<00:03:58.030> here's<00:03:58.239> tier<00:03:58.510> as<00:03:58.659> well<00:03:58.840> of

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
boost being here's tier as well of

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.220 
boost being here's tier as well of
course<00:03:58.989> and<00:03:59.909> if<00:04:00.909> he<00:04:01.150> skips<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.629> first<00:04:01.840> zealot

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
course and if he skips the first zealot

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.839 
course and if he skips the first zealot
that's<00:04:02.409> gonna<00:04:02.590> be<00:04:02.739> a<00:04:02.769> big<00:04:02.950> problem<00:04:03.159> it

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
that's gonna be a big problem it

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.550 
that's gonna be a big problem it
definitely<00:04:04.180> is<00:04:04.329> he<00:04:04.569> has<00:04:04.689> the<00:04:04.840> CyberKnife<00:04:05.290> spur

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
right away first and looking at classic

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.490 
right away first and looking at classic
he<00:04:08.950> had<00:04:09.040> re<00:04:09.280> rallied<00:04:09.760> his<00:04:10.170> zealot<00:04:11.170> actually
