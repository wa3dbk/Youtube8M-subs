00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.260 
hey what's up guys so in this video I'm
covering<00:00:21.200> the<00:00:21.320> paramedic<00:00:21.890> mission<00:00:22.220> and<00:00:23.029> this

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
covering the paramedic mission and this

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.269 
covering the paramedic mission and this
mission<00:00:23.480> is<00:00:23.720> actually<00:00:24.260> pretty<00:00:24.529> easy<00:00:24.619> compared

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
mission is actually pretty easy compared

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.269 
mission is actually pretty easy compared
to<00:00:25.400> the<00:00:25.490> paramedic<00:00:26.029> mission<00:00:26.360> and<00:00:26.570> in<00:00:26.660> gta3<00:00:27.279> so

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
to the paramedic mission and in gta3 so

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.800 
to the paramedic mission and in gta3 so
what<00:00:28.400> you<00:00:28.490> want<00:00:28.670> to<00:00:28.700> do<00:00:28.849> is<00:00:29.090> find<00:00:29.330> yourself<00:00:29.450> an

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
what you want to do is find yourself an

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.720 
what you want to do is find yourself an
ambulance<00:00:30.230> and<00:00:30.439> start<00:00:30.920> up<00:00:31.070> the<00:00:31.189> paramedic

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
ambulance and start up the paramedic

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.340 
ambulance and start up the paramedic
mission

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.590 

now<00:00:36.860> the<00:00:36.920> reason<00:00:37.430> why<00:00:37.580> our<00:00:37.850> this<00:00:38.000> paramedic

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
now the reason why our this paramedic

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.540 
now the reason why our this paramedic
mission<00:00:38.870> is<00:00:38.990> so<00:00:39.140> much<00:00:39.350> easier<00:00:39.800> than<00:00:40.010> the<00:00:40.190> gta3

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
mission is so much easier than the gta3

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.000 
mission is so much easier than the gta3
one<00:00:41.030> is<00:00:41.180> because<00:00:41.510> you<00:00:41.720> receive<00:00:42.080> a<00:00:42.290> time<00:00:42.530> bonus

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
one is because you receive a time bonus

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.480 
one is because you receive a time bonus
after<00:00:43.190> every<00:00:43.760> patient<00:00:44.240> that<00:00:44.360> you<00:00:44.480> pick<00:00:44.660> up<00:00:44.690> and

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
after every patient that you pick up and

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.360 
after every patient that you pick up and
that<00:00:46.490> wasn't<00:00:46.880> the<00:00:46.970> case<00:00:47.120> into<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:47.480> h3<00:00:48.370> makes

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
that wasn't the case into the h3 makes

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.660 
that wasn't the case into the h3 makes
things<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:49.910> much<00:00:49.940> easier<00:00:50.180> so<00:00:54.340> if<00:00:55.340> she<00:00:55.460> never

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
things so much easier so if she never

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.979 
things so much easier so if she never
played<00:00:55.880> the<00:00:56.090> paramedic<00:00:56.600> mission<00:00:56.870> before

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
played the paramedic mission before

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.700 
played the paramedic mission before
allow<00:00:57.410> me<00:00:57.560> to<00:00:57.680> explain<00:00:58.130> you<00:00:58.340> how<00:00:58.610> it<00:00:58.790> works<00:00:59.710> the

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
allow me to explain you how it works the

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.950 
allow me to explain you how it works the
objective<00:01:01.250> is<00:01:01.400> to<00:01:01.430> pick<00:01:01.940> up<00:01:01.970> a<00:01:02.180> patient<00:01:02.420> every

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
objective is to pick up a patient every

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.770 
objective is to pick up a patient every
time<00:01:03.200> and<00:01:03.440> take<00:01:03.800> it<00:01:03.950> to<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.160> hospital<00:01:04.670> so<00:01:05.630> this

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
time and take it to the hospital so this

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.600 
time and take it to the hospital so this
is<00:01:05.900> level<00:01:06.260> one<00:01:06.440> so<00:01:06.650> we<00:01:06.770> only<00:01:06.920> have<00:01:07.130> to<00:01:07.250> pick<00:01:07.430> up

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
is level one so we only have to pick up

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.700 
is level one so we only have to pick up
one<00:01:07.820> patient<00:01:08.300> and<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:09.110> next<00:01:09.350> level<00:01:09.500> we're

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
one patient and the next level we're

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.350 
one patient and the next level we're
gonna<00:01:09.860> have<00:01:10.040> to<00:01:10.160> pick<00:01:10.310> up<00:01:10.340> two<00:01:10.610> patients<00:01:10.880> only

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360

gonna have to pick up two patients only
level<00:01:11.690> three<00:01:11.990> we're<00:01:12.140> gonna<00:01:12.259> have<00:01:12.470> to<00:01:12.619> pick<00:01:12.770> up

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.469 
three patients and we're gonna have to
continue<00:01:15.800> that<00:01:15.830> way<00:01:16.250> until<00:01:16.610> level<00:01:16.940> 12<00:01:17.240> in

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
continue that way until level 12 in

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.210 
continue that way until level 12 in
which<00:01:17.660> we<00:01:17.900> have<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.140> pick<00:01:18.320> up<00:01:18.410> 12<00:01:18.710> patients<00:01:21.220> now

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
which we have to pick up 12 patients now

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.160 
which we have to pick up 12 patients now
you<00:01:22.340> can<00:01:22.550> fit<00:01:22.759> in<00:01:22.910> three<00:01:23.420> patients<00:01:23.690> at<00:01:24.050> a<00:01:24.080> time

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
you can fit in three patients at a time

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.260 
you can fit in three patients at a time
so<00:01:24.650> in<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.890> later<00:01:25.100> levels<00:01:25.340> you're<00:01:25.940> gonna<00:01:26.090> have

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
so in the later levels you're gonna have

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.690 
so in the later levels you're gonna have
to<00:01:26.390> think<00:01:26.540> in<00:01:26.720> groups<00:01:26.990> of<00:01:27.110> three<00:01:27.460> I'll<00:01:28.460> show

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
to think in groups of three I'll show

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.100 
to think in groups of three I'll show
you<00:01:28.759> that<00:01:28.940> later<00:01:29.000> on<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:32.119> advance<00:01:32.479> of<00:01:32.720> liberty

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
you that later on the advance of liberty

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.540 
you that later on the advance of liberty
City<00:01:33.290> Stories<00:01:33.380> is<00:01:33.830> that<00:01:33.979> you<00:01:34.070> have<00:01:34.250> an<00:01:34.369> in-game

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
City Stories is that you have an in-game

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.950 
City Stories is that you have an in-game
map<00:01:35.030> that<00:01:35.330> also<00:01:35.600> wasn't<00:01:36.080> a<00:01:36.320> present<00:01:36.830> in<00:01:36.950> gta3

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
map that also wasn't a present in gta3

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.270 
map that also wasn't a present in gta3
you<00:01:38.960> really<00:01:39.290> had<00:01:39.470> to<00:01:39.500> guess<00:01:39.860> where<00:01:40.160> the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
you really had to guess where the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.720 
you really had to guess where the
patients<00:01:40.729> were<00:01:40.880> at

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.790 

but<00:01:44.730> then<00:01:44.880> again<00:01:45.030> GTA<00:01:45.570> 3<00:01:45.900> kind<00:01:46.230> of<00:01:46.380> was<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
but then again GTA 3 kind of was the

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.360 
but then again GTA 3 kind of was the
pioneer<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:48.030> 3d<00:01:48.600> GTA<00:01:49.050> games<00:01:49.440> so<00:01:50.010> we<00:01:50.160> gotta

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
pioneer of the 3d GTA games so we gotta

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.200 
pioneer of the 3d GTA games so we gotta
cut<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.640> some<00:01:50.910> slack

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.090 

it<00:01:54.210> pays<00:01:54.480> off<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.780> do<00:01:55.080> this<00:01:55.200> mission<00:01:55.470> early<00:01:55.950> on

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
it pays off to do this mission early on

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.980 
it pays off to do this mission early on
in<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.370> game<00:01:56.520> because<00:01:57.330> sir<00:01:57.630> once<00:01:57.810> you're

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
in the game because sir once you're

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.630 
in the game because sir once you're
finished<00:01:58.140> level<00:01:58.590> 12<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:59.010> the<00:01:59.160> paramedic

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
finished level 12 of the paramedic

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.250 
finished level 12 of the paramedic
mission<00:01:59.970> you<00:02:00.120> receive<00:02:00.480> the<00:02:00.690> infinite<00:02:01.080> sprint

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
mission you receive the infinite sprint

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.610 
mission you receive the infinite sprint
just<00:02:01.680> like<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.160> GTA<00:02:02.340> 3<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.940> we<00:02:03.900> won't<00:02:04.110> tire<00:02:04.380> out

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
just like in GTA 3 and we won't tire out

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.430 
just like in GTA 3 and we won't tire out
while<00:02:05.130> running<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:06.990> that's<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.260> great

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
while running so that's a great

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.700 
while running so that's a great
advantage<00:02:07.650> to<00:02:08.070> have<00:02:11.030> another<00:02:12.030> reason<00:02:12.390> why<00:02:12.810> GTA

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
advantage to have another reason why GTA

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.770 
advantage to have another reason why GTA
3<00:02:14.040> paramedic<00:02:14.640> was<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.850> little<00:02:15.240> bit<00:02:15.330> harder<00:02:15.660> than

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
3 paramedic was a little bit harder than

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.400 
3 paramedic was a little bit harder than
the<00:02:15.930> one<00:02:16.050> on<00:02:16.170> liberty<00:02:16.500> City<00:02:16.680> Stories<00:02:16.770> is<00:02:17.280> that

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
the one on liberty City Stories is that

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.470 
the one on liberty City Stories is that
well<00:02:19.410> in<00:02:19.620> GTA<00:02:19.920> 3<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.340> will<00:02:20.550> pretty<00:02:20.940> much<00:02:21.030> had

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.820 
the way I think I didn't mention that
before<00:04:55.760> it's<00:04:56.660> because<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:57.139> cars<00:04:57.380> will<00:04:57.680> get

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
before it's because the cars will get

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.469 
before it's because the cars will get
out<00:04:58.010> of<00:04:58.039> your<00:04:58.190> way<00:04:58.610> well<00:04:58.910> most<00:04:59.330> of<00:04:59.449> the<00:04:59.539> time<00:05:01.479> so

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:08.410 
out of your way well most of the time so
here<00:05:02.840> we<00:05:02.960> are<00:05:02.990> at<00:05:03.410> back<00:05:03.710> at<00:05:03.860> the<00:05:03.949> hospital
