00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:10.580
 dear friend is wonderful September 21 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:15.680
 here and let's see what you 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:22.740
 happened to the bottom layer of mulch on 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:25.160
 the surface of the sand I did not pull 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.960
 Tomato tops because I am now 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:37.770
 I will pull out and there everything will be mixed up here 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:39.469
 let's do this to us here 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.829
 twigs 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:52.879
 do not interfere with giving an hour I will remove 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.879
 yes at least 2 and now see 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.910
 death number 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.549
 here look see here the bottom layer is already 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:19.280
 turned into dust 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:26.720
 and even lower and lower from foliage 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:35.300
 formed fiction layer disset roots from 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:39.950
 grow not look we can see this 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.950
 humus layer is the final product 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:50.429
 organic residue processing 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:55.110
 soil microorganisms here to 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:02:00.050
 proving that I'm here nothing 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:04.399
 not changed can be such people when 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.270
 he put sand in here then pulled him out 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.110
 poured black soil 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:18.000
 well, and so these tomatoes have grown 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:22.709
 here still will death number see yes 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.800
 this is pure sand. 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:33.569
 who did not doubt here he is 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:39.840
 here in such clear sand if available 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:46.890
 organic mulch grew but give 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:48.350
 tomatoes 6 . well and peppers yes they are 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.030
 a little bit 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.930
 tightened there well, especially tomatoes 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:00.410
 delayed in development and did not ripen well 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:03.070
 probably a week and a half later than 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.820
 here in the plots 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:11.420
 body us soil 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:16.640
 that is, these tomatoes and not ripe 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:27.320
 and then ripe tomatoes in 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:33.560
 sandy plot so look i have 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:38.090
 mean to tell you that having soil on 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:41.020
 cottage or how to become why 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:47.110
 substrate absolutely no matter what he is 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:49.280
 will be the main thing to lay mulch mulch 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.900
 all head 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:58.510
 like this with mulch 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:03.710
 at the expense of forest litter is growing and our forest 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:06.040
 see what age-old birch due 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.660
 why don't you grow there? 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:13.370
 never sprinkled mineral water 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.670
 not friable does not drip fed up and not for 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.670
 account of what 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:28.190
 the fact is that nature is all food 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:31.150
 for the plant already have this air on it 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:34.940
 nutrition accounts for 93 genes 4 percent on 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:38.930
 soil mineral natural 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:43.070
 food comes in just 67 percent so 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:48.250
 that keep in mind that in the soil 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:52.690
 a substrate that your plots will have 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.690
 does not play a special role
