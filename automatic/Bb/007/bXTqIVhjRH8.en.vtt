00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:06.140
 be achieved for years with a strike by nac 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.139
 on television 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.389
 because people get out of clothes or out of sight 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.169
 that has now come a solution that is not 8 moment 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:18.570
 and i can be to petroleum 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.570
 can 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.070
 Belgium has happened 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.770
 with this speaker 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.350
 we have tried attaching to developing in technology that are 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.630
 explained the creation 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.470
 and that is very successful 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.600
 we are already talking about 2004 2009 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.670
 but in 2006 a true one was discovered by chance 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.450
 that people are bad for 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.240
 with this speaker gentlemen music claim 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.040
 I discovered it myself when my client was 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.350
 his wife is a very bad example 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.750
 and she came to that conversation 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.270
 what I had with him 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.270
 and they said 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.540
 for example not believing of course when music orders play again 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.220
 with that science 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.570
 are we testing other people for me bad 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.390
 and it turned out 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.260
 that green was a resounding success 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.530
 well with the 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.550
 after that we have set up a company 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.550
 that they are close to fabricating these speakers with this technology 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.310
 and then the list leader 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.740
 then there were already many products on the market 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.609
 think of going leadership 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:51.630
 infra-red 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.480
 and the eim equipment 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.920
 but that was more for the individual following badly 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.350
 now suppose there is a set of which one is a bad example and the other one 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.610
 control of is 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.820
 then this speaker is the solution 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.290
 that was a problem 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.120
 the first time I came in contact with the sound speakers or like this one 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.479
 speakers with this technology 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:17.039
 was someone who enjoys very bad words 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:18.459
 of jazz music 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:19.939
 enjoyed jazz music 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.799
 that was no longer possible because the sound had to be so loud that the rest of the family 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.119
 not anymore 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:26.529
 could not go 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:29.819
 it was way too loud so each other could no longer exist he sent another 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:30.569
 not anymore 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.689
 the biggest advantage enormous 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:38.180
 with the new to players that now here you have finally tried 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:40.990
 it all works out that doesn't have to be that hard 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.269
 he enjoys it more 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.769
 He can collect his CD with all the DJs on it 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.789
 use it again and enjoy it 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.250
 these statements are applied each year 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.850
 for example, I think of the beautiful spaces the airports he walked through 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.530
 all public spaces speech intelligibility is important 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.529
 but also think of video conferencing 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:05.469
 with so many fewer traveling mingers to win two years start the tickets 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:06.769
 made from bamboo 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:07.569
 so also for mother
