00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.549
 waters but we are here again in 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:19.039
 minecraft we have is now and lighting 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:23.070
 perfectly to my Mayan creation 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.660
 Here I bring you one of my creations 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.430
 originally mine 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.950
 stone 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.060
 in her wall of stone walls 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.230
 it comes in the middle mossy stone walls 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.600
 and well in today's tutorial I 'm going to 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.760
 teach how to do it is a tutorial 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.100
 simple short easy and fast and good 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.750
 The first thing they have to do is 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.930
 get 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.240
 rock or cold stone depends on language in 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.610
 that they have in minecraft well 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.180
 in the college so it gets easy 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.800
 chopping this type of stone and this way 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.500
 creative so do not give me any block 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.710
 all right 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.840
 they do not sting can not with a wooden pick 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.420
 with a stone peak with a peak that 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.760
 I know good and good and the block of stone 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.060
 mosses or they get is not easy to 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.390
 get but you get 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.479
 in the spaces that is a space 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.159
 you have to look in the parts 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.340
 inferior as they seek lava 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.750
 diamonds the gold the network are all that 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.150
 they look for it in the lower parts of the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.670
 world there is going to find a place 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.470
 where there is like a box with fire the 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.840
 which is a monster generator is a 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.570
 monsters space may already be of 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.070
 spider skeletons are usually 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.190
 find more spiders in mines 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.740
 abandoned but it can be from spiders 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.280
 skeletons of zombies I have not seen of 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.470
 creepers that I know of 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.630
 lenderman so little seen but good that 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.420
 it does not matter what matters when 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.340
 let's find that let's see some drawers 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.680
 some trunks where there may be 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.690
 important materials and this kind of 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.729
 stone this type of stone can be 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.500
 hit a goal a stone peak I think no 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.720
 I know if with one of wood but with one 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.209
 stone can and good once 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.850
 get in enough minimum amount 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.959
 six to make the walls in the walls 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.970
 of rock 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.540
 they make a singing table in their house 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:29.080
 once they grab the kraft table in 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.900
 the secondary world and put like that and so you 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.200
 rock and it's going to give you six rock wall and 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.120
 with moss are good is not the same 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.120
 kraft eo nothing but the difference 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.330
 of the type of material with which it is made 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.130
 good and good youtube people that has 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.740

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.300
 I cut in and well I want to inform you 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.730
 that a lot of people have asked me to do 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.319
 series but unfortunately I 'm not going to 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:59.389
 to make series since 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:02.180
 I do not have time to do it well and if 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:03.970
 would a series be somewhat compromising 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.800
 for me 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.160
 Y 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.740

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.600
 tell them that capable a day in the 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.760
