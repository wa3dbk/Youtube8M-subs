00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.570
 I believe that the first transcendence is 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.040
 that is a party always the party that 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.679
 is halfway through the classification 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.660
 is usually important in your matches in 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:13.360
 pairs is obviously important 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.639
 let's get a good result in amsterdam 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.260
 and then the circumstances of the two 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.210
 league defeats also add that 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.009
 element but at the end in the game we 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.170
 they play the points of the classification of 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.880
 the champions believe also have know 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.070
 and we understand that the season is a 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.619
 continuous matches and not continue 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.200
 the last two we have lost therefore 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.539
 a positive result would be very very 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.039
 important because of how our 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:37.989
 objectives from that point of view from 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:40.300
 the start of the season and that's the level 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:43.180
 of demand is the one that makes 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.120
 when when you win or you win 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.010
 it seems like it's a normal process and 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.690
 When a defeat occurs, it does not 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.690
 They have been two, so it's good 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.460
 can open the element of controversy and 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.899
 I know what is important for us is that 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.329
 let's continue working with the conviction of 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.949
 that we are that we are well 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.690
 aligned with the ideas that we are 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.060
 working to know when 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.500
 also of the season 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.350
 what is it that we are because it is what 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.450
 we are looking for and from there to be 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.370
 true to our ideas be these 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.900
 conditions we have always said 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.150
 that style is not discussed Us 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.500
 we are a team that had lost it in 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.900
 madrid but but the first part 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.150
 we play a first part very similar to 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.550
 the one that muscular the last few years 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.080
 in madrid we go where we have the ball 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.040
 had the opportunities from 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.770
 domain the value of search 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.720
 superiorities on the outside inside 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.760
 just as we play from 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.860
 there that style develops because the 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.229
 rivals also are created are created 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.640
 situations are worked against you 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.560
 and they look for attractive systems to 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.170
 compensate what you do and within 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.869
 So, come on, let's create our 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.270
 own solutions for to do that 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.770
 the rival either be predictable 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.300
 for that rival that is also solid 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.830
 tell of us in our style that 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.450
 he made us a predictable cross team 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.940
 action team that was already known to play 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.380
 to handball and I did not have depth I 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.360
 I think that she is always brave me 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.070
 I think it's a team that has a 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.869
 football culture also very clear and 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.160
 have an idea also about playing 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.800
 football of young players who 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.300
 you know that this is a great club 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.370
 great showcase that is the champions 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.690
 it's always a team that dares 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.850
 he has players that he has warm 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.740
 individual who has a public that knows 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.050
 be at the important moments 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.360
 of these safe champions matches 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.860
 that we are going to have a team that is going to 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.210
 want to want to play football 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.440
 that will want to play football tails with 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.440
 the weapons that have to be ball
