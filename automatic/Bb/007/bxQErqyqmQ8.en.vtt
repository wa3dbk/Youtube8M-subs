00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:20.419
 st 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.009
 onstage and sneaking into the video game scene 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.860
 so it was with adrián blankets and it was counter 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.770
 and could not be less with the captain america 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.860
 the blockbuster arrives at the consoles days before the premiere in cinemas with the idea 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.810
 to take advantage of the pull of the box office 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.850
 take a look at this analysis and find out if the investment can be 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.850
 interesting 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.080
 others opted to do said 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.400
 honestly I have not seen the movie yet 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.110
 and that something is informed about it 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.249
 So I can not 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:05.100
 that is, if the game follows the same story 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.360
 in the video game discover this the red skull army has 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.800
 developed a very dangerous weapon technology 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.910
 and that they have every intention of using it against the United States 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.640
 more than enough reason for the captain to go out for a walk 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.390
 the cranium 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.730
 I present myself with humility 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.790
 at the time the perfected supersoldier 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.720
 at last 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.010
 a small clear amount but from here we can create 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.460
 you already know that we usually look for references to do these analyzes 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.490
 easier 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.800
 and this time we have taken very little time to realize that Captain America 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.799
 follow one by one the steps of batman arkham asahi 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.820
 that is to say, the same school of martial arts was impeded 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.470
 both investigate and collect enemy information and move around 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.500
 the heights with equal dexterity 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.490
 Captain America's development follows step by step the successful formula of what 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.539
 last of batman 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.299
 the environments allow the extraction of the player 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.659
 in fact they invite to it 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:17.749
 the normal thing is that you find between two and three secret objects per room 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:18.729
 there is everything 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:22.109
 new ceramic statue of virgin military records 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.190
 anything chain and surpassed pocket of this super soldier 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.209
 and the most normal thing is that you do not miss a single 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.180
 because there is a special vision identical to the detective vision of 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.869
 batman 

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:37.039
 that enhances the outline of the collectibles in each room 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.429
 In addition to other things of interest 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:45.079
 the main areas are connected to each other so that sometimes 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.339
 will allow you to retrace your steps in search of completing certain objectives 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.059
 although on more than one occasion he reaches that point of no return 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:54.989
 in which change said full location 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.299
 nevertheless the game takes place in a giant military base that does not favor 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.429
 too much change in the sets 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:04.750
 you are going to see industrial warehouses factories 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.109
 a mansion 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.469
 always with an indisputable Nazi touch and with a palette of colors and textures 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:11.349
 Similary 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.349
 so do not wait and 180 degree visual turns 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.010
 fights fights are about 70% of the set offered by this 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.279
 captain America 

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:35.069
 and the best way to describe the anses 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.779
 they are identical to those of arca friar 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:41.669
 the chapter of hitting in any direction and combining punches between 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:45.439
 different enemies intuitively whenever you see the signal that no 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:49.059
 enemy is about to hit them you have to press the dodge button 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:50.399
 to avoid the impact 

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:53.129
 what will also leave that enemy sold 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.129
 and ready to fit a good left foot 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.639
 two 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.599
 these impact notices do not only appear in the strong game 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.599
 there are snipers who shoot while I fight I wait for your enemies 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:16.680
 these shooters have their own impact index that will have this hurry to 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.919
 maximum to take out the shield if returning the endorsement its point of origin 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.499
 3 

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:30.439
 just above the life bar there is an energy divided into four blocks 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:33.809
 that are filled in according to the east controls to the capital 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:37.239
 that's what are the ones that allow us to execute the character improvements that 

00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:38.990
 you have previously bought 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.139
 among them something theater that is a kind of unstoppable finisher 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.860
 the possibility of turning an enemy that throws projectiles into a weapon 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.039
 staff with which to attack the rest 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.180
 today the shield launch with rebound 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.180
 a good way to get attention when nobody has seen them 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.990
 In summary the operation of the captain america is very correct 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.919
 say it clearly 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.900
 has been able to copy with great ease great work that Rothstein did and with 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.749
 batman 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:14.409
 the problem is that it works to be as precise as we would like 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:17.830
 and also this game is a lot looser technical level 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.870
 the constructions the modeled animations there is nothing that should not 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.110
 be improved 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.539
 not to mention the infamous translation work into Spanish that is what 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.639
 worst I've seen in my life 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:30.939
 I will give an opportunity 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:34.689
 missing local media without weapons is the best offer that can be made 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.309
 although with martyrdom 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:39.389
 likewise the norm s 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:40.240
 trust me 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.240
 josé martínez perza 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.009
 backstage 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:52.240
 ap the fat boy 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.979
 from the eve stronger 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.360
 It was big like a house and the double glass carlos arms 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.430
 remain alive the last time that the victimizers silva Luján and March in that 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.400
 address 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.990
 the sea games of the eleven films are always projects affected 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.680
 who seek to reach the stores while a premiere reaches the cinema 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.650
 If you are looking for it at any price 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.460
 the result in this case is an entertaining game that did not go from right in 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.499
 any section that we put to trial 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:20.519
 that is already much more than we could say in his day gone wrong
