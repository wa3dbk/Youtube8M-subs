project<00:00:26.849> that's<00:00:27.269> easily<00:00:27.420> done<00:00:27.689> well<00:00:28.109> you'd

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
project that's easily done well you'd

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.240 
project that's easily done well you'd
hope<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.590> because<00:00:28.710> they've<00:00:28.920> already<00:00:29.039> spent

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
about the universe go at them

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.040 
about the universe go at them
all<00:00:35.760> right<00:00:36.030> hand<00:00:36.270> since<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.719> thing<00:00:36.989> started

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050

all right hand since this thing started
in<00:00:37.649> 2008<00:00:38.460> yeah<00:00:39.090> nothing<00:00:41.480> nothing<00:00:42.530> waste<00:00:43.530> of

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
in 2008 yeah nothing nothing waste of

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.560 
in 2008 yeah nothing nothing waste of
money<00:00:43.980> they're<00:00:44.309> recreating<00:00:44.640> how<00:00:45.390> many

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
money they're recreating how many

money they're recreating how many
hovercrafts<00:00:46.200> we<00:00:46.289> could<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.559> bought<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.100> how

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
hovercrafts we could have bought and how

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.160 
hovercrafts we could have bought and how
odd<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.030> way<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.690> should<00:00:48.930> measure

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
odd the way you should measure

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.720 
odd the way you should measure
scientific<00:00:49.890> expenditure<00:00:51.530> it's<00:00:52.530> not<00:00:52.829> we<00:00:53.550> could

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
scientific expenditure it's not we could

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.610 
scientific expenditure it's not we could
buy<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.180> much<00:00:54.329> cool<00:00:54.629> stuff<00:00:54.660> with<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.350> six

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
buy so much cool stuff with that six

the<00:01:08.430> moon<00:01:08.640> okay<00:01:09.000> do<00:01:09.780> anything<00:01:10.140> with<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.320> you

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the moon okay do anything with it you

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.530 
the moon okay do anything with it you
know<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> internet<00:01:11.280> started<00:01:12.060> because<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.390> a

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
know the internet started because of a

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.880 
know the internet started because of a
system<00:01:12.869> they<00:01:12.960> put<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.229> place<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:13.680> people

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
system they put in place to get people

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.320 
system they put in place to get people
to<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> moment<00:01:14.250> no<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.820> didn't<00:01:15.210> know<00:01:15.299> that

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
to the moment no I didn't know that

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.210 
to the moment no I didn't know that
there<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.869> go<00:01:15.990> there's<00:01:16.229> one<00:01:16.290> development<00:01:17.040> do

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
there you go there's one development do

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.980 
there you go there's one development do
you<00:01:17.340> enjoy<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.790> internet<00:01:18.180> will<00:01:18.420> stay<00:01:18.689> down

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
you enjoy the internet will stay down

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.120 
you enjoy the internet will stay down
here<00:01:19.140> create<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> Internet<00:01:19.860> don't<00:01:20.040> say<00:01:20.960> well

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
here create the Internet don't say well

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.070 
here create the Internet don't say well
but<00:01:23.130> develop<00:01:23.610> time<00:01:23.880> into<00:01:24.360> doing<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.750> kind<00:01:24.990> of

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
but develop time into doing that kind of

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.109 
but develop time into doing that kind of
stuff<00:01:25.140> instead<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.740> sending<00:01:26.070> people<00:01:26.220> away<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
stuff instead of sending people away the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.969 
stuff instead of sending people away the
point<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:28.200> sent<00:01:28.530> out<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.770> do<00:01:28.860> these

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
point is you sent out to do these

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.590 
point is you sent out to do these
scientific<00:01:29.579> things<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.030> never<00:01:30.180> know<00:01:30.420> where

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
scientific things you never know where

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.120 
scientific things you never know where
I'll<00:01:30.750> be<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.170> were<00:01:31.320> allayed<00:01:31.650> but<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:32.100> it

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
I'll be you were allayed but you do it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.130 
I'll be you were allayed but you do it
for<00:01:32.369> them<00:01:32.729> for<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.060> sake<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.420> achievement<00:01:34.079> of

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
for them for the sake of achievement of

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.960 
for them for the sake of achievement of
accomplishment<00:01:34.829> furthering<00:01:35.490> our<00:01:35.579> scientific

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
accomplishment furthering our scientific

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.460 
accomplishment furthering our scientific
horizon<00:01:36.509> yeah<00:01:36.570> well<00:01:36.720> they've<00:01:36.810> cost<00:01:37.020> us

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.870 

imagine<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.560> amount<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.950> chip<00:01:44.280> flavors<00:01:44.759> we

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
imagine the amount of chip flavors we

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.910 
imagine the amount of chip flavors we
come<00:01:45.060> yes<00:01:45.299> Andy<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.200> four<00:01:46.380> words<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.710> think

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
come yes Andy the four words I think

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.010 
come yes Andy the four words I think
what<00:01:47.040> we<00:01:47.130> can<00:01:47.280> agree<00:01:47.460> on<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.729> 4.6<00:01:48.570> billion

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
what we can agree on is 4.6 billion

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.469 
what we can agree on is 4.6 billion
dollars<00:01:49.530> could<00:01:50.189> buy<00:01:50.549> some<00:01:50.850> terrific<00:01:51.240> things

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
dollars could buy some terrific things

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.300 
dollars could buy some terrific things
