00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
it's ridiculous um of course again I had

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.870 
it's ridiculous um of course again I had
to<00:03:09.830> do<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:09.950> little<00:03:10.100> sharpening<00:03:10.490> when<00:03:10.640> I<00:03:10.670> first

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
to do a little sharpening when I first

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.280 
to do a little sharpening when I first
got<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.180> but<00:03:11.360> a<00:03:11.510> little<00:03:11.780> sharpening<00:03:12.080> when<00:03:12.200> you

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
got it but a little sharpening when you

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.530 
got it but a little sharpening when you
first<00:03:12.410> get<00:03:12.530> a<00:03:12.590> knife<00:03:12.770> doesn't<00:03:13.070> hurt<00:03:13.540> unless

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
first get a knife doesn't hurt unless

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.270 
first get a knife doesn't hurt unless
you<00:03:14.690> got<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:14.930> like<00:03:15.050> supreme<00:03:15.740> sharp<00:03:16.070> then<00:03:16.220> I

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
you got it like supreme sharp then I

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.290

guess<00:03:16.400> you're<00:03:16.520> dulling<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:16.850> blade<00:03:16.940> when<00:03:17.240> you

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
guess you're dulling the blade when you

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.090 
guess you're dulling the blade when you
sharpen<00:03:17.450> it<00:03:17.660> but<00:03:17.810> you<00:03:17.960> know<00:03:18.050> usually<00:03:19.010> it

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
sharpen it but you know usually it

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.200 
sharpen it but you know usually it
doesn't<00:03:19.250> happen<00:03:19.460> um<00:03:21.790> another<00:03:22.790> thing<00:03:23.000> this<00:03:23.090> is

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
doesn't happen um another thing this is

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.660 
breaker and I know you're thinking my
god<00:03:30.590> it's<00:03:30.740> probably<00:03:31.040> not<00:03:31.130> too<00:03:31.310> great<00:03:31.460> of<00:03:31.520> a

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
god it's probably not too great of a

god it's probably not too great of a
bass<00:03:31.850> Baker<00:03:32.090> I<00:03:32.330> actually<00:03:32.660> tried<00:03:33.110> this<00:03:33.320> glass

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
bass Baker I actually tried this glass

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.710 
bass Baker I actually tried this glass
breaker<00:03:33.800> before<00:03:34.130> it's<00:03:34.850> extremely<00:03:35.510> it's

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
breaker before it's extremely it's

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.340 
breaker before it's extremely it's
extremely<00:03:36.110> good<00:03:36.260> um<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:38.720> has<00:03:38.870> that<00:03:38.990> design

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
extremely good um it has that design

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.990 
extremely good um it has that design
like<00:03:39.590> it's<00:03:39.710> a<00:03:39.770> kind<00:03:39.980> of<00:03:40.100> crappy<00:03:40.520> glass<00:03:40.730> breaker

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
like it's a kind of crappy glass breaker

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.670 
like it's a kind of crappy glass breaker
but<00:03:41.270> you<00:03:41.540> know<00:03:41.630> she's<00:03:41.840> a<00:03:41.870> smaller<00:03:42.230> version<00:03:42.620> of

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
but you know she's a smaller version of

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.100 
but you know she's a smaller version of
one<00:03:42.890> but<00:03:43.850> it's<00:03:43.970> it<00:03:44.240> does<00:03:44.390> do<00:03:44.540> its<00:03:44.690> job<00:03:44.840> it's

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
one but it's it does do its job it's

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.530 
one but it's it does do its job it's
actually<00:03:45.500> pretty<00:03:45.650> good

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
actually pretty good

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.820 
actually pretty good
so<00:03:47.540> I'm<00:03:47.660> gonna<00:03:47.810> show<00:03:47.990> the<00:03:48.140> other<00:03:48.290> way<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.530> open

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
so I'm gonna show the other way to open

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.590 
so I'm gonna show the other way to open
the<00:03:48.920> knife<00:03:49.040> as<00:03:49.220> well<00:03:49.250> instead<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:50.150> doing<00:03:50.390> the

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
the knife as well instead of doing the

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.770 
the knife as well instead of doing the
button<00:03:50.840> here<00:03:51.290> pulling<00:03:52.190> it<00:03:52.340> back<00:03:52.490> this<00:03:53.480> is<00:03:53.630> why

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
button here pulling it back this is why

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.330 
button here pulling it back this is why
it's<00:03:53.900> kind<00:03:54.020> of<00:03:54.110> cool<00:03:54.290> because<00:03:54.500> automatic

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
it's kind of cool because automatic

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.270 
it's kind of cool because automatic
knives<00:03:55.550> are<00:03:55.820> illegal<00:03:56.390> in<00:03:56.540> some<00:03:56.720> states<00:03:56.780> and

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
knives are illegal in some states and

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.100

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
that that little nub on you know most

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.390 
that that little nub on you know most
knives

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
knives

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.680 
knives
push<00:04:22.850> our<00:04:22.940> finger<00:04:23.150> on<00:04:23.180> you<00:04:23.330> then<00:04:23.630> that<00:04:23.750> nub<00:04:23.930> and

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
push our finger on you then that nub and

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.320 
push our finger on you then that nub and
keep<00:04:24.930> pushing<00:04:25.550> and<00:04:26.550> it<00:04:26.730> opens<00:04:26.970> up<00:04:27.030> like<00:04:27.120> that

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
keep pushing and it opens up like that

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.330 
keep pushing and it opens up like that
and<00:04:27.480> it<00:04:28.140> doesn't<00:04:28.290> have<00:04:28.470> as<00:04:28.560> much<00:04:28.680> force<00:04:28.980> which

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
and it doesn't have as much force which

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.610 
and it doesn't have as much force which
actually<00:04:30.150> makes<00:04:30.540> it<00:04:30.690> able<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.020> pass<00:04:31.200> off<00:04:31.440> as

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
actually makes it able to pass off as

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.820 
actually makes it able to pass off as
just<00:04:31.650> a<00:04:31.950> flip<00:04:32.310> knife<00:04:33.380> there<00:04:34.380> are<00:04:34.500> some<00:04:34.680> times

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
just a flip knife there are some times

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.050 
just a flip knife there are some times
when<00:04:34.950> you<00:04:35.040> can<00:04:35.130> get<00:04:35.250> some<00:04:35.370> pretty<00:04:35.640> good<00:04:35.820> force

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
when you can get some pretty good force

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.490 
when you can get some pretty good force
in<00:04:36.210> it<00:04:36.300> though<00:04:36.420> probably<00:04:37.170> get<00:04:37.260> it<00:04:37.350> one<00:04:37.470> right

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
in it though probably get it one right

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.180 
in it though probably get it one right
now<00:04:37.770> yeah<00:04:38.730> there<00:04:38.910> we<00:04:38.970> go

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
now yeah there we go

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.510 
now yeah there we go
that's<00:04:41.190> a<00:04:41.370> little<00:04:41.610> that's<00:04:41.880> that<00:04:42.240> I<00:04:42.450> that<00:04:43.520> what

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
that's a little that's that I that what

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.180 
that's a little that's that I that what
does<00:04:44.610> it<00:04:44.640> function<00:04:45.030> is<00:04:45.420> actually<00:04:46.140> a<00:04:46.590> little

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
does it function is actually a little

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.940 
does it function is actually a little
tough<00:04:48.120> at<00:04:48.330> first<00:04:48.360> when<00:04:49.200> the<00:04:49.290> knife<00:04:49.440> is<00:04:49.470> new

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
tough at first when the knife is new

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.790 
tough at first when the knife is new
it's<00:04:50.630> extremely<00:04:51.630> hard<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:52.080> actually<00:04:52.230> get<00:04:52.620> that

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
it's extremely hard to actually get that

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.360 
it's extremely hard to actually get that
to<00:04:52.860> work

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.250 

generally<00:04:56.370> just<00:04:56.490> because<00:04:56.850> of<00:04:57.000> you<00:04:57.870> know<00:04:57.900> new

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
generally just because of you know new

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.950 
generally just because of you know new
knife<00:04:58.440> it's<00:04:58.890> kind<00:04:59.220> of<00:04:59.280> a<00:05:01.250> just<00:05:02.250> you<00:05:02.940> know<00:05:03.030> like

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
knife it's kind of a just you know like

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.140 
knife it's kind of a just you know like
tight<00:05:04.230> parts<00:05:04.650> kind<00:05:05.400> of<00:05:05.550> needs<00:05:05.700> a<00:05:05.760> little<00:05:05.940> bit

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
tight parts kind of needs a little bit

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.670 
tight parts kind of needs a little bit
of<00:05:06.240> a<00:05:06.360> loosening<00:05:06.990> first<00:05:08.150> um<00:05:09.440> what<00:05:10.440> else<00:05:10.470> is

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
of a loosening first um what else is

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.270 
of a loosening first um what else is
there<00:05:11.070> to<00:05:11.190> say<00:05:11.340> about<00:05:11.370> this<00:05:11.670> knife<00:05:11.820> it's<00:05:12.630> I

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.650 

guess<00:05:17.280> I'll<00:05:17.400> go<00:05:17.460> on<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.670> pocket<00:05:18.000> clip<00:05:18.150> again

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
guess I'll go on the pocket clip again

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.720 
guess I'll go on the pocket clip again
it's<00:05:19.320> it's<00:05:19.770> not<00:05:20.010> about<00:05:20.190> pocket<00:05:20.520> up<00:05:20.610> it's

it's it's not about pocket up it's
actually<00:05:20.970> very<00:05:21.150> tight<00:05:21.480> which<00:05:22.110> kind<00:05:22.290> of<00:05:22.350> makes

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
actually very tight which kind of makes

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.080 
actually very tight which kind of makes
a<00:05:22.560> little<00:05:22.590> annoying<00:05:22.920> if<00:05:23.220> you<00:05:23.460> use<00:05:23.550> pod<00:05:23.730> Clips<00:05:24.030> a

a little annoying if you use pod Clips a

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.600 
a little annoying if you use pod Clips a
lot<00:05:24.290> it's<00:05:25.290> stuck<00:05:25.530> to<00:05:25.650> my<00:05:25.680> pocket<00:05:26.070> a<00:05:26.130> lot<00:05:26.340> but

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.390 

yeah<00:05:36.850> so<00:05:37.300> this<00:05:37.690> knife<00:05:37.930> actually<00:05:38.590> there<00:05:38.920> are<00:05:39.010> so

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
yeah so this knife actually there are so

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.680 
yeah so this knife actually there are so
many<00:05:39.580> different<00:05:40.000> versions<00:05:40.150> of<00:05:40.390> this<00:05:40.540> knife

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
many different versions of this knife

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.840 
many different versions of this knife
it's<00:05:41.260> ridiculous<00:05:41.890> they're<00:05:42.130> they're<00:05:42.640> all

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
it's ridiculous they're they're all

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.760 
it's ridiculous they're they're all
about<00:05:43.120> the<00:05:43.270> same<00:05:43.300> length<00:05:43.690> about<00:05:43.990> 7<00:05:44.380> inches<00:05:44.590> I

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
about the same length about 7 inches I

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.340 
about the same length about 7 inches I
think<00:05:44.800> most<00:05:45.700> of<00:05:45.820> them<00:05:45.940> are<00:05:46.030> 7.1<00:05:46.720> just<00:05:47.200> because

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
think most of them are 7.1 just because

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:48.870 
think most of them are 7.1 just because
the<00:05:47.470> blade<00:05:47.680> is<00:05:47.710> made<00:05:47.950> a<00:05:48.010> bit<00:05:48.160> different<00:05:48.490> tanto

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
the blade is made a bit different tanto

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.550 
the blade is made a bit different tanto
blades<00:05:49.150> on<00:05:49.300> this<00:05:49.420> knife<00:05:49.930> design<00:05:50.350> are

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
blades on this knife design are

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.220 
blades on this knife design are
relatively<00:05:51.400> small<00:05:54.360> yeah<00:05:55.360> there<00:05:55.570> are<00:05:55.690> so<00:05:56.020> many

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
relatively small yeah there are so many

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.580 
relatively small yeah there are so many
different<00:05:56.770> I<00:05:56.890> mean<00:05:57.370> there<00:05:57.580> are<00:05:57.670> like<00:05:58.590> hundreds

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
different I mean there are like hundreds

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.530

this knife all a little bit different

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.190 
this knife all a little bit different
from<00:06:08.320> the<00:06:08.410> other<00:06:08.560> ones<00:06:08.770> um<00:06:10.110> it's<00:06:11.110> really

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
from the other ones um it's really

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.500 
from the other ones um it's really
unlike<00:06:11.560> personal<00:06:12.100> standpoint<00:06:12.550> you<00:06:13.030> know<00:06:13.150> like

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
unlike personal standpoint you know like

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.870 
unlike personal standpoint you know like
it's<00:06:13.690> just<00:06:13.960> I<00:06:14.200> personally<00:06:15.010> like<00:06:15.190> black<00:06:15.580> blade

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
it's just I personally like black blade

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.890 
it's just I personally like black blade
tanto<00:06:16.860> and<00:06:18.180> that's<00:06:19.180> that's<00:06:19.390> really<00:06:19.690> all<00:06:19.780> they

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
tanto and that's that's really all they

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.080 
tanto and that's that's really all they
design<00:06:20.260> it<00:06:20.410> by<00:06:20.500> the<00:06:20.560> handle<00:06:21.310> is<00:06:21.460> almost<00:06:21.820> always

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
design it by the handle is almost always

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.670 
design it by the handle is almost always
the<00:06:22.390> same<00:06:22.570> with<00:06:22.780> all<00:06:22.900> of<00:06:22.990> these<00:06:23.110> knives<00:06:25.410> yeah<00:06:26.410> I

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
the same with all of these knives yeah I

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.040 
the same with all of these knives yeah I
mean<00:06:27.010> closing<00:06:27.970> the<00:06:28.120> knife<00:06:28.270> is<00:06:28.480> a<00:06:28.780> bit

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
mean closing the knife is a bit

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.160 
mean closing the knife is a bit
difficult<00:06:29.470> it's<00:06:29.950> you<00:06:30.610> know<00:06:30.730> it's<00:06:31.180> an<00:06:31.330> auto<00:06:31.630> so

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:32.170 
difficult it's you know it's an auto so

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.930 
difficult it's you know it's an auto so
it<00:06:32.290> has<00:06:32.440> you<00:06:32.740> has<00:06:32.920> to<00:06:33.100> build<00:06:33.400> up<00:06:33.580> with<00:06:33.700> a<00:06:33.760> little

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
it has you has to build up with a little

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.040 
it has you has to build up with a little
bit<00:06:34.030> of<00:06:34.120> the<00:06:34.180> spring<00:06:34.450> before<00:06:34.600> it<00:06:34.810> can<00:06:34.900> shoot

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
bit of the spring before it can shoot

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.570 
bit of the spring before it can shoot
out<00:06:35.170> again<00:06:35.640> do<00:06:36.640> the<00:06:36.760> other<00:06:37.060> way<00:06:37.330> again<00:06:38.580> that's

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
out again do the other way again that's

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.700 
out again do the other way again that's
what<00:06:39.790> the<00:06:39.910> that's<00:06:40.150> if<00:06:40.330> you<00:06:40.420> push<00:06:40.660> here<00:06:40.960> and<00:06:41.110> the

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
what the that's if you push here and the

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.370 
what the that's if you push here and the
other<00:06:41.830> way<00:06:42.010> to<00:06:42.070> get<00:06:42.310> it<00:06:42.400> is<00:06:42.520> there<00:06:43.260> again<00:06:44.260> the

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380 
other way to get it is there again the

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.170 
other way to get it is there again the
safety<00:06:44.590> is<00:06:44.860> very<00:06:45.010> reliable<00:06:45.340> which<00:06:45.760> is<00:06:45.880> it's

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
safety is very reliable which is it's

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.450
