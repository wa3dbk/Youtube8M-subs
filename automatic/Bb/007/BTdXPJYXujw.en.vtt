00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.450
 with the group 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.870
 discouraged and are too strong to drive every night 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.880
 so yes to 34 years 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.480
 m to 15 kilometers from the finish 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.929
 laurent gbagbo who is going to go on the offensive 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.780
 the peloton is a land 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.840
 little by little 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.780
 the pace set the ball very hot 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.060
 we can not see where we are going to attack in the coming months 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.320
 it's on such talk are abstinent beefy to dig a gap 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.640
 still km to go 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.360
 drone attack 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.510
 so be careful with retirees 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.170
 against various pieces 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.370
 siaka that starts now 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.220
 it's hectic at the bank 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:46.809
 the peloton has just taken over the group of escaped 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.140
 the courses have brought together their ideas they have just crossed the panel of 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:52.459
 Last 5 kilometers 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.369
 taken to expect 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:56.119
 if the bank made sense 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.119
 the list of wounded makes it grow 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:07.859
 and to watch in front of some runners trying to extricate themselves from the point 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:14.509
 we will attend 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:16.159
 the finish line 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.790
 hugo has to hang in this climb it cost recruited 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.319
 by hbo 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:23.479
 especially onudc 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.479
 taken by each 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.739
 obviously the looks of continuing to believe in some runners 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.739
 they are escaping at the front of the pack 

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:53.789
 this is the spitter launched m 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.529

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:00.019
