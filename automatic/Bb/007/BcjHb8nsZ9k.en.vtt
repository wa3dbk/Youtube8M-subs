00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.090

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.160
 the cowboy and this gentleman vibrated that no 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.200
 will speak to not do so much filling x 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.330
 good this video will deal with 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.849
 curiosities of zelda twilight princess 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.889
 before starting I will try not to tell you 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.930
 those curiosities like hitting a 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.750
 cuckoo or things like that because they are curiosities 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.750
 of which I assume everyone knows very well 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.880
 let's start something that I love is that 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.190
 starting and they already tell us something curious 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.170
 this initially I did not understand but at 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.660
 play it a second time I understood 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.940
 better this is the first dialogue when 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.969
 moi is talking with link in the dialogue 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.249
 he says tell me link do not you feel too 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.530
 a strange sadness when the sun falls 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:44.300
 they say it's the only time that 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.879
 our world is intertwined with the most 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.620
 there the only time we can feel 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.019
 the lament of those who left 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.819
 our world but still remain attached to 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:56.390
 him why the twilight hour 

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:58.789
 always brings this grief very well 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.469
 I'll explain to you today is talking about the 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.269
 relationship that the world of light has 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.400
 with that of the shadows by means of 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.670
 dusk and it's at this time when it 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.920
 remember those who were exiled 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.960
 kingdom of twilight but although I already know 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.479
 they were still having a connection with 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.280
 the kingdom of light itself speaks about the 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.860
 world of twilight as there are people 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.049
 that they were exiled there and that both 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.659
 worlds are connected by means of the mirror 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.280
 Twilight in the house inc 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.530
 We found some pictures about the 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.570
 characters in order something curious too 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.390
 they are some blankets that have some arrows 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.549
 but it really is not anything weird xd and in 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.700
 the basement there is a mirror that by the way 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.740
 worthy is not reflected in the mirror in the 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.110
 first days in order we can catch 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.840
 the goats that are loose do not be shit 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.479
 everyone did that could you say something 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.369
 more original, your fucking good mother at 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.380
 goats we can also caress them 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.450
 but if we can face them and 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.360
 we press the button to the goats 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.780
 they investigate the inc the order shield is 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.520
 only if we are burned or recovered 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.920
 The order shield design is a 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.619
 goat in the house today we can 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.690
 find a wooden horse 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.360
 a drawing apparently of iván where 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.450
 appear I'll juli iván and another child such 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.060
 time the baby that are waiting 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.370
 behind this house there is a blonde I think 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.129

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.290
 rotating attack there are also two blondes 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.360
 yellow on the roof of the house to 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.360
 to get there we just got on the sign and 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.390
 from there we jump to the roof the bees do not 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.030
 We persecute us if we throw overboard 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.030
 illia's theme is obviously the song 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.530
 of time but with more musicality 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.819
 someone likes to illia and end the 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.980
 same 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.739

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.810

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.170
 symbol I know and here I know that everyone 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.079
 they know but it is valid to say it no no it is 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.060
 I'm worth it if we shoot a 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.670
 pump arrow to the bell over the 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.790
 temple of qatar and coca was 200 rupees at 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.769

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.500
 function with wicks that sells you pumps 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.510

 stars resemble goddesses by 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.919
 its colors can occasionally be 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.000
 see someone get out of this minigame 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:12.030

 we can see some musicians on the pedestal 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.840
 from the master sword we can see the 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:18.180

 You realize that you are talking about 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.389
 twilight princess not from that other game 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.610
 Fuck if I'm talking about the relationship 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.440
 between you and shut up and go to 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.020
 look for someone to attack with 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.790
 luck and they kill you let's continue in the 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.310
 forgotten town there is a sign that in 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.160
 letters and alliance says welcome to the kk 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.380
 rich old it was planned that

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.030
 They left impact on the fishing pier 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.790
 every time you enter they change the 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.060
 seasons spring summer autumn e 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.220
 This may affect fishing in 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.290
 the boatman's house among the many 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.090
 things that we can see one is the fisherman 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.580
 of ocarina of time and a book that 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.560
 called the legend of the night of jairo the 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.600
 twilight fish maybe in reference 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.700
 to this same game since the story 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.830
 it's about a young fight that wild 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.830
 julie apparently the story is something 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.990
 sad the boatwoman says that the boat is 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.880
 for her and her boyfriend but if we talk 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.620
 with the little bird he tells us that she does not 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.060
 He has a boyfriend and Rosita gets angry at 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.250
 listen to that 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.040
 it is said that in the cemetery of the kingdom to 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.230
 is the headstone of the shadow of the hero the 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.810
 shadow of the heroes and slim of ocarina not 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:34.050
 I knew familiar songs and measured how 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.120
 two and a half meters xdddd in the sketches 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.090
 of the twilight princess this lord was going to 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.130
 have wings and only two horns between 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.440
 the many beta enemies of this game 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.690
 was going to include what looks like a mobile 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.910
 for some unknown reason do not 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.910
 they included maybe because they already had little 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.919
 billings bullying if the boss of them to 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.860
 difference of the list to the pit of gulfs 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:58.919
 the aedal fos have no teeth 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.780
 sketches of sheikh in the clothes of sant there 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.430
 a rough symbol but with certain 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.550
 differences 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.530
 sant is very similar to general box in 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.960
 the whole game to just be seen in 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:11.910
 twice your hands when you relive 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.790
 this Lord and in the last phase against him 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.370
 but what kind of curiosity is that look 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.350
 most original things so in no 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.900
 video of curiosities of this game I have 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.129
 seen that they mention it and now let me 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.319
 finish 

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:27.539
 the throne of the twilight kingdom has 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:29.399
 an eyes and ica as well as two snakes 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:32.189
 on the wall that look a lot like one 

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:34.199
 of the symbols of ganondorf holy the 

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:36.479
 die says that while Ganondorf is 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:38.159
 I can live it up this text has 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:40.199
 caused a lot to talk about because 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:43.229
 final before he won in die we see 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:45.419
 a scene of sant all the designs of 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:46.800
 mirna have something in common they all use 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:48.479
 mask 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.539
 amig does not like someone trying 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:53.489
 tell him but in the end he can not one of 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:55.439
 the final battles the battle to 

00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:57.449
 horse against ganondorf was 

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:59.039
 initially planned to do it in 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:02.039
 ocarina of time but in the end 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:04.080
 they decided to skip it and very well that was 

00:07:02.039 --> 00:07:06.479
