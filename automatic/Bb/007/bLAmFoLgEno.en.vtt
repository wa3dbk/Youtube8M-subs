forever 21
funny<00:02:12.060> story<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.870> thought<00:02:13.650> these<00:02:13.830> were<00:02:14.040> like

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
funny story I thought these were like

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.110 
funny story I thought these were like
chokers

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
chokers

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.470 
chokers
like<00:02:15.570> trophy<00:02:15.840> necklaces<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.740> she<00:02:16.860> put<00:02:17.070> on

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
like trophy necklaces that she put on

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.630 
like trophy necklaces that she put on
but<00:02:18.480> they're<00:02:18.930> like<00:02:19.140> bracelets<00:02:19.680> or<00:02:19.950> anklets<00:02:20.430> I

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
but they're like bracelets or anklets I

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.510 
but they're like bracelets or anklets I
guess<00:02:20.820> that<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.210> could<00:02:21.390> use<00:02:22.020> them<00:02:22.170> for<00:02:22.230> um<00:02:23.130> I

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
guess that you could use them for um I

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.280 
guess that you could use them for um I
might<00:02:23.730> get<00:02:23.850> those<00:02:24.000> like<00:02:24.210> chain<00:02:24.690> extension

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
might get those like chain extension

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.560 
might get those like chain extension
things<00:02:25.590> where<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.010> can<00:02:26.330> extend<00:02:27.330> your

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
things where you can extend your

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.200 
things where you can extend your
necklace<00:02:28.440> or<00:02:28.800> bracelet<00:02:29.370> or<00:02:29.490> whatever<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.120> is

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
necklace or bracelet or whatever it is

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.210 
necklace or bracelet or whatever it is
so<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.930> might<00:02:31.080> just<00:02:31.290> get<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.890> then<00:02:32.010> make

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
so I might just get that and then make

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.970 
so I might just get that and then make
it<00:02:32.400> into<00:02:32.580> chokers<00:02:33.210> I<00:02:33.450> mean<00:02:33.660> okay<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:34.830> not<00:02:34.920> a
