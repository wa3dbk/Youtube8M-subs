00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.640
 the town hall 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.099
 alas it was a game a little more complicated than expected 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.949
 we're really the complicated game because he played very well 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.119
 today 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.609
 he spent a qualifier elsewhere m she won four games here that means 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.989
 only at a strong moment 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.919
 is she really not easy I have such an agreement 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.360
 did the fact that she was left embarrassed you 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.090
 anxious he never stopped easy to play against someone in who's day 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.290
 infosat what is m for me what is really difficult 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.200
 because early in the morning a little problem to apple the beautiful race 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.850
 with serbia but m but after when I won the first place 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.680
 it was a pleasure 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.870
 a more trust for me 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.139
 you have often made the break first and then join him 

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:01.580
 what did it make you doubt the risk 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.920
 we told you that and I still have some small problems with 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.090
 my service will be better 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.090
 an after 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.380
 it was not easy because yes% 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.149
 there were a few flaws in the first scene m no but I was 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.400
 very positive today in the short because 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.810
 I know some pictures very well today on time 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.729
 aum even if I lost my service asp 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.690
 for 100 m he had tried to be aggressive and games and contests 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.870
 Caribbean very aggressive lunch 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.870
 we have an early season his shorts or the sensations amply 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.270
 and this form what is your state of form at the beginning of the season but it's 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.540
 hard to say it's the beginning of the year actually 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.600
 the second tournament that I played thoroughly of fears related to europe 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.409
 naj hope schemas better here because i love i did not like amk 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.659
 it will be a very difficult tournament and a lot of wind at adm and sailors 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.110
 are worried the step fadas won at their age 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.660
 To try 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.600
 it's hard to say that too late 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.220
 in the next round I would have either katerina bondarenko or unaf and sloppy 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.890
 do you have a preference what do you know them well do you 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.160
 you've already played one d2 she would never have if it's contrary to 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.069
 his destinies it was it will be a little the first 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.049
 once I'm going to play contract 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.079
 katarina go up the queues so I watched the members dying 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.039
 incidentally na 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.469
 gene 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:22.389
 I looked and I want 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.439
 farm in full employment for mac 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:26.999

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:28.589
 yes I kept a little 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:30.719
 who made you the strongest impression 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:31.889
 to I want 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:34.939
 I think it is midnight she spent a very good but this first return to 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:36.959
 their leader did not even really well 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.790
 and i think the find her trust and ml man fit 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.739
 thanks to the conflict 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:47.139
