00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:33.610
 important is to see how it shows that 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:37.800

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.210

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.190
 And the saturday 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.280
 good 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:20.960

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.569

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.170
 to the fall 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.170
 but not true 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.800
 so I get on the middle lever 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.630
 here we turn something 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.190
 a strategic site 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.110
 howard taft and left the post 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.110
 when the waters 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:25.280
 at the time of driving that man yes 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.470
 that are champion motifs 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.180
 manolo is that you do not realize that with 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.569
 this I put it like this more or less 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.569
 medium height 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.670
 I'm going 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:48.190
 and half height for the stage and we had 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.900
 the side and where the dead go 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.900
 they went with and worked worked care 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.310
 automatic 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.849
 and a tip to the head to the side and this 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:21.900
 ladies 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:21.900
 automatic lawyer now 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:33.250
 above 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.250
 It's worth another dead guy already killed me 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.110
 when walking and network 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.230
 I do not have ballast left because it does not have 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:05.860
 weapons to catch cheering and so that 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.860
 some collects for the east zone 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.730
 I had no shot 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.210
 25 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.110
 very bad aim 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.710
 and I have put the sensitive tour very 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.550
 slow but spinning time 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.550
 in security 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:53.670
 work team 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.790
 It does not matter 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:09.760
 again it's going up there 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.290
 second 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.460
 in 325 we go the sea on them 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:35.320
 and not changing the bottom of a truck 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.750
 pretty good 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.180
 plus 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:43.500
 but on a motorcycle 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.500
 and me too 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.960
 we lose we lose 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:00.000
 a low 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:05.389
 we go for later, yes, sir 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.389
 wait good good but a good team 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:11.629
 because they kill us 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:19.759
 because killing him three times or four times 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:28.939
 arrives at the triangle when they are dying 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:28.939
 and 7-5 the proportion of 140 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.860
 we are already in 0 20 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:44.710
 this 

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.690
 ah
