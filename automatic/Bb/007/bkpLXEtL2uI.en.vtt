00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
is abused by the computer into k12 I'm

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.310 
is abused by the computer into k12 I'm
talking<00:00:53.910> about<00:00:53.940> just<00:00:54.239> straight<00:00:54.510> exploited<00:00:55.199> by

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
talking about just straight exploited by

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.200 
talking about just straight exploited by
the<00:00:55.379> computer<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.489> i'll<00:00:56.640> know<00:00:56.850> what<00:00:57.000> they<00:00:57.059> need

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the computer so i'll know what they need

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.340 
the computer so i'll know what they need
to<00:00:57.270> do<00:00:57.510> maybe<00:00:57.719> they<00:00:57.870> need<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.109> turn<00:00:58.320> down

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
to do maybe they need to turn down

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.729 
to do maybe they need to turn down
tendencies<00:00:59.100> or<00:00:59.340> something<00:00:59.730> like<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.739> but

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
tendencies or something like that but

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.170 
tendencies or something like that but
hopefully<00:01:02.219> they<00:01:02.399> don't<00:01:02.520> do<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.910> all<00:01:03.120> over

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
hopefully they don't do that all over

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.899 
hopefully they don't do that all over

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
getting bumped knocked down and that's

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.010 
getting bumped knocked down and that's
one<00:01:11.790> thing<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.000> place<00:01:12.299> rated<00:01:12.570> me<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> most

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
one thing that place rated me the most

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.820 
one thing that place rated me the most
no<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:14.250> felt<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:15.020> 2k<00:01:16.020> which<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.320> teaming<00:01:16.710> you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
no it felt like 2k which is teaming you

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.530 
no it felt like 2k which is teaming you
like<00:01:17.130> they<00:01:17.280> don't<00:01:17.549> want<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.850> score<00:01:18.150> mainly

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.780 
like they don't want you to score mainly
because<00:01:18.659> close<00:01:18.930> contact<00:01:19.439> layups<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.070> it

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
because close contact layups and it

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.020 
because close contact layups and it
didn't<00:01:21.060> make<00:01:21.210> any<00:01:21.240> sense<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.960> be<00:01:22.350> honest<00:01:23.030> now

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
didn't make any sense to be honest now

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.240 
didn't make any sense to be honest now
you're<00:01:24.900> gonna<00:01:25.020> see<00:01:25.290> when<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.500> clip<00:01:25.710> restarts

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
you're gonna see when the clip restarts

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.980 
you're gonna see when the clip restarts
that<00:01:26.490> Russell<00:01:26.970> Westbrook<00:01:27.390> gets<00:01:27.659> out<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:27.960> a

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
fast-breaking you see they kept the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.100 
fast-breaking you see they kept the
animation<00:01:30.000> where<00:01:30.090> they<00:01:30.180> push<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.540> ball<00:01:30.689> out<00:01:30.930> I
