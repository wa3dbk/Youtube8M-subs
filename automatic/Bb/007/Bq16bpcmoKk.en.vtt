00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.850
 hi friends after a long break 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.890
 I have decided to upload this video to 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.629
 clarify certain issues that already have me 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.240
 fed up on the video of the worst 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.129
 controls the subject of this video is the 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.620
 next the criticisms that I received 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.310
 about my opinion of the command of nintendo 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.900
 64 and I reiterate is a personal opinion by 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.300
 that appears in the top five 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.190
 please do not continue with this tremendous 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.860
 scandal 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.530
 good reviewing what I said in that video 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.020
 I'm going to shred it in pieces starting 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.880
 by the shape and size of the command when 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.620
 I said that the command could have been 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.420
 better designed I was referring to the 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.239
 buttons you could have taken more 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.130
 advantage in terms of its location and that 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.410
 has a lot to do with the dif so the 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.500
 button l since these were used in very 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.629
 few games except for exceptions and if 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.610
 used was to put the options and 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.730
 other very tiny things of not much 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.589
 importance the button l many times was 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.500
 not very useful as to control the 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.449
 volume in the Mario Kart 64 or the map in 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.420
 the ocarina of time or the greeting in the 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.340
 smash bros well we already know that all 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.950
 they like to say hello while the opponent 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.800
 dies but otherwise the button does not 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.980
 nothing 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.960
 be honest if you ever had a 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.280
 Nintendo 64 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.280
 how many times did they use the grip 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.580
 that for me it subtracts points to the control 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.549
 because you already have a piece of the command that 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.680
 you're almost never going to use then such and 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.930
 as I said in the other video pretty much 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.119
 40 or 30 percent of the control does not 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.340
 what are you going to use, therefore, those of nintendo 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.140
 they could have saved a few thousand 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.990
 of dollars in materials and have 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.990
 designed a control like this or that way 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.109
 the other thing is the form of control 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.210
 tell me you prefer to play with a remote 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:01.640
 large that more or less has a part 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.920
 inert and in gangrene is or a control 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.219
 of more regular size and more friendly for 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.219
 hand 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.360
 well I can conclude that I do not like 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.860
 the control design for those reasons 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.170
 but considering that it was the first 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.780
 control with an analog and please look 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.480
 how big it was inside yet 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.220
 regarding the nintendo 64 with all 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.920
 those games that made me happy 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.960
 part of my life I say goodbye from my 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.850
 respective chair maybe in some 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.730
 more time upload other videos about 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.730
 consoles and other things left us os
