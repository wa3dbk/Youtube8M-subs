00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.529
 very good to all guys girls that such 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.690
 how are you welcome to apple 5 x 1 in 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.610
 this video I bring you something that will be very 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.440
 useful for all those who have a 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.389
 ios device like for example a 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.419
 iphone and I say it will be very useful 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.579
 because it does not hurt to know this that you 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:24.300
 I'm going to tell you very little 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:26.220
 appel on its official website of icloud.com has 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.890
 added the possibility of power 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.279
 recover both calendars notes 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.680
 reminders and contacts that we have 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.560
 erased by mistake and power 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.330
 recover them in a safe way to 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.010
 me for example a few months happened to me 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.330
 precisely this I lost all my 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.450
 contacts and there was no way to 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:48.090
 recover them and it seems to be good 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.640
 that I know someone will have prayed to apple that 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.990
 put it there's cloud now add the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.180
 possibility of being able to recover these 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.550
 contacts that for some reason have been 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.220
 been able to erase for it we have to 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.960
 go as I say icloud.com and how you have 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.640
 seen I got myself into the bar is 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.229
 of agreement adjustments so we're going 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.070
 to put but good for you to see 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.680
 everything better I will put full screen 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.440
 and we have to go down to the bottom 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.080
 where you put here has advanced you see that 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.020
 here puts different options to restore 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.910
 files restore contacts or restore 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.440
 your calendars and reminders 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.180
 we would have to logically choose the 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.770
 option because according to what we 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.530
 we look for me for example I'm going to give 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.410
 restore contacts and once we click 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.180
 here we get this little window here 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.860
 we would have to select the 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.509
 let's say the backup that is 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.400
 does automatically we do not have 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.869
 to do anything according to pola makes 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.270
 automatically if we give ourselves 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.190
 account then we have here for 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.560
 example the last copy was on 22 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.850
 August at 7 and 27 on August 15 to the 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.380
 same time on August 4 to the same 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.479
 hour that is to say is making a copy 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.789
 periodic as you always see the same 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.950
 time in choose a time then in which the 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.780
 iphone detects that it is the most appropriate 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.210
 depending on the use we have 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.920
 we'll just have to give it to restore 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.780
 to the copy that we want and 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.940
 automatically what we would do is 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.740
 load the contacts we have up to 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.869
 that date and eliminating those that we have 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.560
 currently so that having it very in 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.700
 account because if we remove something we do not go 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.470
 to be able to merge 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.790
 that is, if we load this copy, we are not going 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.920
 to be able to merge the with the 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.099
 Current contacts also agree 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.750
 here it is indicating perfectly and 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.459
 As you can see, it also applies to 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.260
 files of agreement here I for example 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.269
 I have some pdf files that 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.250
 I printed with byte riddle scanner 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.470
 I eliminated but I could recover them and I 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.870
 want and also like with the 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.250
 calendars and also with the theme of 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.140
 email address that does not 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.250
 I know what this means here is shown 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.319
 in the apps that allow others 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.030
 people hire for your air and apel 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.890
 the people who seek you will see your 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.200
 name and your last names, that gives me 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.750
 Equally important is both the 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.730
 calendars like contacts like 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.349
 files and as I say this you can 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.329
 do now from the icloud website 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.849
 this video I bring because many people 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:00.110
 I asked for it based on today's efe 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.290
 lost my contacts as I can 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.209
 recover so far redirected a lot 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.709
 people now programs that are responsible for 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.090
 retrieve there among the copies of 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.890
 security that you have before 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.500
 but since it allows us apple post 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.840
 hey, it's better that you know about it 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.459
 this video is nothing new to the best 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.900
 for many but it will be for 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.190
 so many others and I hope that at least 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.960
 useful for 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.060
 they need this information in the future 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.800
 if you liked guys, I would appreciate it 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.570
 really give me a I like that you
