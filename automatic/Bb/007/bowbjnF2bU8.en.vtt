kind of feels now obviously you can see
it's<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.040> fairly<00:00:14.190> regular<00:00:14.519> sort<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:14.969> sized<00:00:15.150> bike

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
it's a fairly regular sort of sized bike

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.000 
it's a fairly regular sort of sized bike
it's<00:00:16.010> same<00:00:17.010> size<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.279> lot<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.820> 50s<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.420> sort<00:00:18.600> of

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
it's same size a lot to 50s and sort of

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.679 
it's same size a lot to 50s and sort of
that<00:00:20.010> sort<00:00:20.220> of<00:00:20.369> thing<00:00:20.520> but<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:20.939> small<00:00:21.390> for<00:00:21.420> a

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
that sort of thing but it is small for a

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.590 
that sort of thing but it is small for a
400<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.410> have<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.590> say<00:00:22.880> let's<00:00:23.880> go<00:00:24.000> old-fashioned

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
400 I have to say let's go old-fashioned

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.359 
400 I have to say let's go old-fashioned
brakes<00:00:24.869> got<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> single<00:00:25.619> disc<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:25.980> front

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
brakes got a single disc on the front

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.029 
brakes got a single disc on the front
and<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.970> drum<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.420> back<00:00:27.689> it's<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.769> dagger

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
and a drum on the back it's a dagger

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.500 
and a drum on the back it's a dagger
because<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.340> isn't<00:00:29.490> actually<00:00:29.699> all<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.210> fast

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
because it isn't actually all that fast

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.820 
because it isn't actually all that fast
in<00:00:30.810> reality<00:00:31.199> he's<00:00:31.289> not<00:00:31.380> compared<00:00:31.710> with<00:00:31.769> a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
in reality he's not compared with a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.750 
in reality he's not compared with a
modern<00:00:31.890> bike<00:00:32.450> it's<00:00:33.450> kick<00:00:33.719> start<00:00:33.960> only<00:00:34.760> three

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
modern bike it's kick start only three

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.459 
modern bike it's kick start only three
cylinder<00:00:36.180> air<00:00:36.300> called<00:00:36.600> two-stroke<00:00:39.469> these

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
cylinder air called two-stroke these

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.639 
cylinder air called two-stroke these
bikes<00:00:40.800> are<00:00:41.010> sort<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.370> quite<00:00:41.579> rare<00:00:41.850> these<00:00:42.120> days

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
bikes are sort of quite rare these days

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.670 
bikes are sort of quite rare these days
so<00:00:43.649> getting<00:00:43.890> used<00:00:44.219> parts<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.379> bigger<00:00:46.379> job

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
so getting used parts on is a bigger job

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.250 
so getting used parts on is a bigger job
than<00:00:46.760> when<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.879> used<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.210> be

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.319 

I<00:00:53.320> would<00:00:54.039> maybe<00:00:54.370> a<00:00:54.550> towards<00:00:54.879> the<00:00:54.969> bike<00:00:55.149> you

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:55.329 
I would maybe a towards the bike you

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.439 
I would maybe a towards the bike you
would<00:00:55.420> want<00:00:55.629> to<00:00:55.690> go<00:00:55.870> to<00:00:56.910> work<00:00:57.910> on<00:00:58.180> every<00:00:58.420> day

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
would want to go to work on every day

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.740 
would want to go to work on every day
it's<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.489> bit<00:01:00.489> too<00:01:00.730> special<00:01:01.210> for<00:01:01.239> that<00:01:01.420> kind<00:01:01.659> of

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
it's a bit too special for that kind of

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.700 
it's a bit too special for that kind of
thing

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
thing

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.289 
thing
this<00:01:03.100> particular<00:01:03.430> on<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.760> speedo<00:01:04.059> has

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
this particular on the speedo has

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.080 
this particular on the speedo has
recently<00:01:04.510> stopped<00:01:04.960> working

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
recently stopped working

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.649 
recently stopped working
it<00:01:07.630> has<00:01:07.840> a<00:01:07.869> top<00:01:08.140> speed<00:01:08.170> of<00:01:08.770> a<00:01:09.159> hundred<00:01:10.090> miles<00:01:10.420> an

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
it has a top speed of a hundred miles an

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.740 
it has a top speed of a hundred miles an
hour<00:01:10.719> plus<00:01:11.109> a<00:01:11.579> bit<00:01:12.579> probably<00:01:13.240> not<00:01:13.479> allowed

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
hour plus a bit probably not allowed

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.719 
hour plus a bit probably not allowed
more<00:01:13.960> than<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.590> speed<00:01:14.890> only<00:01:15.280> thing<00:01:15.460> you<00:01:15.579> can

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
more than the speed only thing you can

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.950 
more than the speed only thing you can
never<00:01:15.880> rely<00:01:16.270> on<00:01:16.329> very<00:01:16.659> much

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.720 

I<00:01:19.990> think<00:01:20.680> what<00:01:20.800> I'd<00:01:20.920> have<00:01:21.040> to<00:01:21.130> say<00:01:21.370> about<00:01:21.430> is<00:01:21.700> a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
I think what I'd have to say about is a

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.690 
I think what I'd have to say about is a
great<00:01:22.060> looking<00:01:22.420> bike<00:01:23.190> that's<00:01:24.190> while<00:01:24.400> riding

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
great looking bike that's while riding

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:32.490 
great looking bike that's while riding
it<00:01:24.970> goes<00:01:25.180> I<00:01:28.380> don't<00:01:29.380> know<00:01:29.650> really

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.770 

it's<00:01:33.070> exciting<00:01:33.430> it's<00:01:33.940> finally<00:01:34.300> makes<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:34.570> great

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
it's exciting it's finally makes a great

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.910 
it's exciting it's finally makes a great
noise<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.800> then<00:01:35.950> I<00:01:36.070> 70s<00:01:36.610> feel<00:01:36.760> about<00:01:37.090> it<00:01:37.330> and<00:01:37.920> I

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
noise and then I 70s feel about it and I

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.140 
noise and then I 70s feel about it and I
don't<00:01:39.040> think<00:01:39.220> you<00:01:39.460> would<00:01:39.550> rate<00:01:39.790> it<00:01:39.820> only

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
don't think you would rate it only

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.330 
don't think you would rate it only
higher<00:01:40.360> than<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:40.750> as<00:01:40.930> regards<00:01:41.350> a<00:01:41.410> sort<00:01:41.620> of

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
bit hard on the front it's probably one
