00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.540
 mono here yes it's time for one 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.150
 last video to my winter balcony 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.219
 experiment or window sill experiment 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.469
 with the tomatoes and you can see it 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.529
 turns red 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.810
 not all are red but in a week 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.810
 or in two will be the rest 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.810
 be few red tomatoes 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.660
 everything is done right before harvest and here 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.210
 the little micro tom a bit more 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.550
 but more time and get something 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.870
 less sun the cucumber has me at least 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.489
 but two cucumbers produces after that 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.300
 gave up all her rest 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:51.480
 energy stuck in the last gargle 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:52.910
 there are still new ones 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.570
 leaves form look maybe 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:02.550
 yes what happens again and how the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.199
 tomatoes who fend off the beautiful and 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.380
 then it's enough for one 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.100
 tomato salad or a small one 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.890
 tomatosoup 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.560
 so i am very happy the winter 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.479
 also helped me was quite mild and 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.450
 There was quite a lot of sunshine in England 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.979
 pretty little rain 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.450
 but I'm pretty glad I could 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.549
 It does not necessarily show that way 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.340
 artificial light if you have the right one 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.509
 Tomato has so again of 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:36.170
 from left to right 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:39.180
 this is a rivet one for today's 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.740
 research for today's here the left 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.950
 who will not get 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.590
 I am very happy with that 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.420
 I should not know who to watch 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.950

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.100
 not get more but also asked 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.229
 as you can see and the microform 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.820
 This is really just right for the 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.950
 I would say sunny office table yes 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.020
 So much for my winter experiment 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.180
 with the tomatoes and cucumber so it 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.050
 has worked soon 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.360
 repeated in Germany 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.190
 so much for when spring comes soon 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.670
