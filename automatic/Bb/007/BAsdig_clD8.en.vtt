00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.580 
think all these halfbacks at this stage
are<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.280> same<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.820> any<00:01:51.659> half<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.259> comes<00:01:52.409> out

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
are the same so any half that comes out

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.230 
are the same so any half that comes out

catch the pretty much above league
average<00:03:05.050> barely<00:03:05.560> but<00:03:05.770> he<00:03:05.830> has<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:06.040> get

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
average barely but he has to get

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.310 
average barely but he has to get
tackling<00:03:06.490> as<00:03:06.610> well<00:03:06.790> so<00:03:07.030> this<00:03:07.540> safety<00:03:08.080> is<00:03:08.170> more

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
tackling as well so this safety is more

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.320 
tackling as well so this safety is more
