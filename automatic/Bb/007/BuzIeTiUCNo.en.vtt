00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
I hardly read anything in May and

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.889 
I hardly read anything in May and
started<00:00:44.940> looking<00:00:45.059> at<00:00:45.329> all<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.570> stuff<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.750> I

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
started looking at all the stuff that I

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.170 
started looking at all the stuff that I
really<00:00:46.260> actually<00:00:46.410> do<00:00:46.739> have<00:00:46.950> for<00:00:47.430> june<00:00:48.000> and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
really actually do have for june and

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.560 
really actually do have for june and
july<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:49.129> it's<00:00:50.129> become<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> much<00:00:50.760> scarier<00:00:50.940> pile

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
july and it's become a much scarier pile

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.850 
july and it's become a much scarier pile
so<00:00:52.079> i<00:00:53.149> probably<00:00:54.149> jinxed<00:00:54.360> myself<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.260> here's

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
so i probably jinxed myself but here's

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.760 
so i probably jinxed myself but here's
what<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.250> am<00:00:56.430> planning<00:00:56.930> hoping<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.350> read<00:00:58.559> in

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
rewind that there were two books that I

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.170 
rewind that there were two books that I
started<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.769> maybe<00:01:04.920> didn't<00:01:05.159> finish<00:01:05.309> yet<00:01:05.610> but

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
started and maybe didn't finish yet but

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.429 
started and maybe didn't finish yet but
I<00:01:06.240> wanted<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.540> finish<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.960> month<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.380> they

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
I wanted to finish this month and they

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.770 
I wanted to finish this month and they
are<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.890> blue<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.340> dark<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.299> witch<00:01:09.420> hunter

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
are a blue so dark and the witch hunter

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.950 
are a blue so dark and the witch hunter
I<00:01:09.990> am<00:01:10.590> about<00:01:11.220> halfway<00:01:11.490> through<00:01:12.210> both<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.659> these

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
I am about halfway through both of these

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.100 
I am about halfway through both of these
and<00:01:13.549> really<00:01:14.549> liking<00:01:14.850> both<00:01:15.030> moving<00:01:15.689> along<00:01:15.900> very

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
and really liking both moving along very

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.080 
and really liking both moving along very
quickly<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.799> don't<00:01:17.189> think<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.939> this

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
quickly so I don't think that this

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.890 
quickly so I don't think that this
should<00:01:18.270> take<00:01:18.390> up<00:01:18.630> too<00:01:19.229> much<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.409> my<00:01:19.560> jeans<00:01:19.860> DAC

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
should take up too much of my jeans DAC

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.990 
should take up too much of my jeans DAC
fingers<00:01:21.900> crossed<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.770> possible<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.640> would<00:01:23.670> like

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
fingers crossed if possible I would like

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.539 
fingers crossed if possible I would like
to<00:01:24.210> also<00:01:24.390> read<00:01:24.840> velvet<00:01:25.500> by<00:01:25.680> temple<00:01:26.070> West<00:01:26.280> which

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.190 
didn't because if I did it didn't make
it<00:01:38.070> back<00:01:38.310> my<00:01:39.000> guess<00:01:39.299> would<00:01:39.479> be<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:39.960> just

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
it back my guess would be that it's just

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.260 
it back my guess would be that it's just
wedged<00:01:40.439> somewhere<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.430> chaos<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:42.030> my

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
wedged somewhere in the chaos that is my

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.270 
wedged somewhere in the chaos that is my
room<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:42.960> if<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.380> don't<00:01:43.619> find<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.920> soon<00:01:43.979> it's

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
room but if I don't find it soon it's

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.429 
room but if I don't find it soon it's
not<00:01:44.490> gonna<00:01:44.610> be<00:01:44.729> red<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.090> I'm<00:01:45.780> hoping<00:01:46.200> I'm

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
not gonna be red but I'm hoping I'm

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.469 
not gonna be red but I'm hoping I'm
hoping<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.860> come<00:01:46.979> across<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.520> actually<00:01:47.670> it

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
hoping to come across it and actually it

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.910 
hoping to come across it and actually it
read<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.810> reviewed<00:01:49.079> because<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.409> think<00:01:49.770> it's

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
read and reviewed because I think it's

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.090 
read and reviewed because I think it's
actually<00:01:50.100> out<00:01:50.399> now<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.119> kind<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.869> late<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:52.920> that

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
actually out now so kind of late on that

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.429 
actually out now so kind of late on that
one<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.490> i<00:01:53.759> don't<00:01:54.360> know<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.689> m.i.a<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.409> i

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
one but i don't know it's m.i.a so i

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.010 
one but i don't know it's m.i.a so i
guess<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:56.130> will<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:56.729> that's<00:01:56.939> all<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.930> a

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
guess we will see but that's all it's a

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.830 
guess we will see but that's all it's a
