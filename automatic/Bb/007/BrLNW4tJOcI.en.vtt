00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.450
 I think verona class that's one 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.890

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.819

 as part of the advertising for my film 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.550
 of course, and of course, too 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.899
 addressed as the shooting at 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.610
 The Chinese were and there is this 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.929
 I do not name my name 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.330
 because the fallen I do not want to 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.130
 have invented a headline 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.440
 have those around a bit ins 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.789
 to talk about dpa over the 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.929
 Just let ticker out and now 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.310
 is it in every week this week 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.129
 women's magazine somehow tears it 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.459
 alexandra kamp colon i stood 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:15.440
 Verona grabbed the part I would 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.610
 never say something like that about 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.900
 a colleague or a colleague and 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.730
 I'll never say that, too 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.540
 that made me really angry that 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.040
 just to push something up 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.720
 things are invented so I think they are 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.970
 rohner class and it has great fun with 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.970
 you made with and with and with leslie 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.200
 Nielsen and I want that filth 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.430
 do not read and hear anymore 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.430
 well i think thats us 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.620
 times very briefly how it is with leslie 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.150
 nielsen also have a guest here 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.440
 shall i find him so weirdly funny 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.120
 if he just opens a door one has to 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.160
 already laughing or the incredible is 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.020
 also private so funny most of the time is yes 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.490
 so I heard that for 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.450
 for example, heinz rÃ¼hmann privat not at all 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.450
 been as a ulkiger 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.900
 private very funny and also a 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.140
 very very intellectual person with the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.020
 you can lead in-depth conversations 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.170
 that's the same with the comics, so I am 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.790
 not funny but that's that 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.170
 a facade and behind it the deep core 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.300
 my filming is really great 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.910
 and I hope I was often on set 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.620
 if I was not tuned to rotate me 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.180
 a little something to look at, I know 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.460
 we will not see if it is 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.420
 worked out in the near future 2000 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.800
 that's really what we have one 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.010
 foto here you also have a lot as a model 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:48.200
 work makes still has one 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.940
 especially when the head it's not there 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.890
 this leg anja that is for 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.630
 Stockings do you know how long his legs 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.800
 are there if that over my age 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.800
 a lot is written here 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.970
 a magazine a boulevard 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.560
 magazine says at times 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.000
 Kosovo war would be maybe 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.040
 to bring a double page about that 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.780
 true age of alexandra kamp like age 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.250
 be nice too because i have been there since 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.010
 say no more years, he served as 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:18.080
 meanwhile I was already 41 I was 47 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.080
 wife inviting years is different 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.819
 very simple thing that one so that 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.259
 I do not say my age has nothing to do with it 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:34.090
 to do cozetterie but with 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:37.120
 self-protection because watching TV in Germany 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.830
 is unfortunately that is because of the 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.539
 age is occupied on the paper and 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.770
 not due to the broadcast or 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.819
 I did sometime some years ago 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.379
 said good then I say my age 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:45.490
 Just not anymore and if you ask me 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:47.229
 ask how old I am since I write 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.819
 but just what you want and the 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.229
 gala, for example, has been writing now ever since 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:52.030
 to push more 1 1 always makes me 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.580
 a little older but so what 's up 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.470
 everyone should think so it is this the 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.270
 tv bosses so inhuman there 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.840
 just a woman would hardly enter 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:05.039
 a little older 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.039
 yes I would like to know how long are 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.460
 Do you know that now a dream to one 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.840
 Dream in fulfillment as she would like you to 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.449
 to have my feet lying 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.190
 that makes but that is why in one 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.810
 try it all but relaxed 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.639
 everyone has to stand so it has to be 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.639
 from the hip bone to the 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.090
 i just do it vision schneider 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.590
 You know, yes , but you do that 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:50.250
 do it from the inside like power off 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:50.250
 the help still worked a tanga 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:21.030
 alexandra i would say it for 112 cm 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.669
 oh yes, if that was not correct 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.660
 had his glasses on yes but it is 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.660
 a length that is very familiar to me 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:47.240
 I'm so happy in the dax 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.160
 tell me a word but the film is running 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.260
 only in the morning belongs to the billionaire 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.050
 comes on Tuesdays in the service of his jersey 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.820
 5 2 system is a very serious topic 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.510
 want to talk about the movie I watch 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:01.700
 it's about a kid with cancer 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:04.580
 and a nurse her to 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.440
 little sacrifices for family life 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.390
 this kid so you have to go to them 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.980
 to look at him and thereby so stuffy 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.510
 siblings i got the orchestra 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.590
 I am currently standing I have the 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.260
 made backwards I have the yes 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:20.900
 Doctor played and fever hot time 

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:21.860
 for young sluts and now I have 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.390
 the step back to the nurse 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.560
 I hope the spectator can do it 

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:26.740
 nevertheless somehow comprehensible 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:30.050
 happy if you turn on yes tuesday 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:31.730
 20.15 tomorrow the sky belongs to you me 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.460
 do you know so little of you with if 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.780
 you live is structured and do that 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.230
 The next time we do that 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.720
 next do not let this be the case 

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:43.010
 watch TV 

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:45.690
 rules of the game on you know anything 

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:48.210
 purely pushing into the great and we 

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:52.130
 will continue to puzzle how old can one 

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:52.130
 the wife is so fantastic
