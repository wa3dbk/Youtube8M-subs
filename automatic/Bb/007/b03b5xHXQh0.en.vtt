hey everybody it's flying Ryan here with
a<00:00:10.590> review<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.250> tactic<00:00:12.030> anylink

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
a review of the tactic anylink

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.029 
a review of the tactic anylink
-<00:00:13.400> now<00:00:14.400> this<00:00:14.670> is<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:15.389> upgraded<00:00:16.020> version<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:16.980> the

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
- now this is a upgraded version of the

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.840 
- now this is a upgraded version of the
anylink<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:18.689> the<00:00:18.869> original<00:00:19.380> any<00:00:19.590> link<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.310> here

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
anylink of the original any link is here

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.089 
anylink of the original any link is here
and<00:00:22.160> basically<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.999> main<00:00:24.900> first<00:00:25.589> difference

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
and basically the main first difference

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.849 
and basically the main first difference
you'll<00:00:26.310> notice<00:00:26.339> is<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.509> now<00:00:27.720> has<00:00:27.749> a<00:00:28.109> built

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
you'll notice is that it now has a built

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.800 
you'll notice is that it now has a built
in<00:00:29.449> battery

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
in battery

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.860 
in battery
whereas<00:00:31.619> before<00:00:31.800> on<00:00:32.460> some<00:00:32.940> models<00:00:33.420> with<00:00:33.720> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
whereas before on some models with the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.639 
whereas before on some models with the
any<00:00:34.110> linked<00:00:34.380> one<00:00:34.650> you<00:00:35.640> had<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.210> buy<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> separate

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
any linked one you had to buy a separate

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.220 
any linked one you had to buy a separate
little<00:00:37.980> battery<00:00:38.340> pack<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:38.940> like<00:00:39.120> for<00:00:39.300> my<00:00:39.420> dx8

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
little battery pack so like for my dx8

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.180 
little battery pack so like for my dx8
I<00:00:40.410> had<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.160> buy<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.400> extra<00:00:42.390> little<00:00:42.510> cable

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
I had to buy this extra little cable

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.400 
I had to buy this extra little cable
battery<00:00:44.190> pack<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.180> then<00:00:45.840> which<00:00:46.020> also

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
battery pack and then which also

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.090 
battery pack and then which also
required<00:00:46.830> a<00:00:47.100> separate<00:00:47.490> charger<00:00:48.710> so<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.740> would

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
required a separate charger so you would

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.310 
required a separate charger so you would
have<00:00:50.310> you<00:00:50.790> know<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.210> battery<00:00:51.630> powering<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
have you know the battery powering the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.970 
have you know the battery powering the
anylink

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
anylink

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.940 
anylink
and<00:00:53.160> then<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.780> whole<00:00:54.930> thing<00:00:54.960> plugged<00:00:55.710> into

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
and then the whole thing plugged into

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.160 
and then the whole thing plugged into
the<00:00:56.100> radio<00:00:56.490> so<00:00:57.240> you<00:00:57.300> just<00:00:57.630> had<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> bunch<00:00:58.020> of

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
the radio so you just had a bunch of

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.610 
the radio so you just had a bunch of
wires<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.650> extra<00:00:59.340> stuff<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.810> was<00:01:00.960> all<00:01:01.140> you

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620

wires and extra stuff and it was all you
know<00:01:01.680> velcroed<00:01:02.400> and<00:01:02.760> clamped<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.540> the<00:01:03.840> back<00:01:04.019> of

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
know velcroed and clamped on the back of

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.130 
know velcroed and clamped on the back of
the<00:01:04.320> radio<00:01:04.530> here<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.670> these<00:01:06.119> two<00:01:06.180> velcro<00:01:06.689> spots

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
the radio here on these two velcro spots

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.200 
the radio here on these two velcro spots
so<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.380> got<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.619> got<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.009> little<00:01:08.310> bit<00:01:08.430> messy<00:01:08.970> with

different cables you need and you can

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.430 
different cables you need and you can
basically<00:01:40.610> this<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.180> know<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.390> plug<00:01:43.290> it

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
basically this is you know you plug it

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.010 
basically this is you know you plug it
into<00:01:43.620> all<00:01:44.190> these<00:01:44.430> different<00:01:45.000> brand<00:01:45.330> radios

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
into all these different brand radios

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.810 
into all these different brand radios
that<00:01:46.620> are<00:01:47.460> non<00:01:47.940> s<00:01:48.510> LT<00:01:48.900> radios<00:01:49.620> and<00:01:50.100> then<00:01:50.670> it

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
that are non s LT radios and then it

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.530 
that are non s LT radios and then it
allows<00:01:50.940> you<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.540> fly<00:01:51.780> s<00:01:52.110> LT<00:01:52.409> models<00:01:53.190> with<00:01:54.000> these

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
allows you to fly s LT models with these

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.740 
allows you to fly s LT models with these
off-brand<00:01:55.290> radios<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.940> can<00:01:57.330> you<00:01:57.600> can

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
off-brand radios and so you can you can

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.109 
off-brand radios and so you can you can
bind<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.440> any<00:01:58.680> sort<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.070> tactic<00:01:59.580> receiver

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
bind it to any sort of tactic receiver

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.030 
bind it to any sort of tactic receiver
if<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.630> want<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.900> put<00:02:01.110> your<00:02:01.260> own<00:02:01.440> tactic

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
if you want to put your own tactic

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.240 
if you want to put your own tactic
receiver<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.760> a<00:02:02.850> model<00:02:03.270> or<00:02:04.020> any<00:02:04.619> like<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
receiver in a model or any like the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.440 
receiver in a model or any like the
heli-max

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
heli-max

you know get access to the board and hit

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.030 
you know get access to the board and hit
the<00:02:18.400> bind<00:02:18.640> button<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.750> can<00:02:19.960> bind<00:02:20.230> these<00:02:20.560> to

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
the bind button you can bind these to

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.190 
the bind button you can bind these to
the<00:02:21.160> any<00:02:21.340> link<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:21.850> I<00:02:21.880> can<00:02:22.000> fly<00:02:22.360> my<00:02:22.600> Helen<00:02:22.990> axe

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
the any link so I can fly my Helen axe

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.940 
the any link so I can fly my Helen axe
1sq<00:02:24.100> with<00:02:24.850> my<00:02:25.090> spectrum<00:02:25.510> DXA<00:02:26.230> which<00:02:26.530> is<00:02:26.710> just

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
1sq with my spectrum DXA which is just

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.640 
1sq with my spectrum DXA which is just
really<00:02:27.250> cool<00:02:27.630> because<00:02:28.630> these<00:02:29.080> are<00:02:29.290> two

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
really cool because these are two

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.470 
really cool because these are two
different<00:02:29.860> brands<00:02:30.370> two<00:02:30.820> different<00:02:31.150> companies

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
different brands two different companies

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.330 
different brands two different companies
products<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.380> they're<00:02:32.500> made<00:02:32.710> now<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.010> work

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
products and they're made now to work

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.820 
products and they're made now to work
together<00:02:33.550> so<00:02:33.820> I<00:02:34.060> can<00:02:34.420> pick<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.350> choice<00:02:35.620> of

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
together so I can pick the choice of

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.740 
together so I can pick the choice of
radio<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:36.190> want<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:36.850> you<00:02:36.940> can<00:02:37.120> see<00:02:37.330> here<00:02:37.570> there

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
radio I want and you can see here there

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.040 
radio I want and you can see here there
is<00:02:37.930> just<00:02:37.960> a<00:02:38.910> massive<00:02:39.910> list<00:02:40.210> of<00:02:40.540> different

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
is just a massive list of different

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.340 
is just a massive list of different
radios<00:02:41.560> that<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:42.070> can<00:02:42.310> use<00:02:43.150> different<00:02:43.720> brands

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
radios that you can use different brands

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.310 
radios that you can use different brands
and<00:02:44.500> just<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.740> bunch<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:45.070> different<00:02:45.340> models<00:02:46.320> and

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
and just a bunch of different models and

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.310 
and just a bunch of different models and
it<00:02:47.560> is<00:02:47.710> full<00:02:48.100> range<00:02:48.430> now<00:02:48.880> so<00:02:49.300> you've<00:02:49.480> got<00:02:49.810> a

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
it is full range now so you've got a

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.920 
it is full range now so you've got a
much<00:02:50.830> longer<00:02:51.460> range<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:52.210> can<00:02:52.360> fly<00:02:52.660> with

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
much longer range you can fly with

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.930 
much longer range you can fly with
confidence<00:02:53.560> fly<00:02:53.830> any<00:02:54.070> kind<00:02:54.400> of<00:02:54.460> model<00:02:54.820> you

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
confidence fly any kind of model you

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.490 
confidence fly any kind of model you
want<00:02:55.210> I<00:02:55.390> think<00:02:55.600> they<00:02:55.720> even<00:02:55.750> said<00:02:56.200> you<00:02:56.320> could

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
want I think they even said you could

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.860 
want I think they even said you could
fly<00:02:56.740> giant<00:02:57.340> scale<00:02:57.640> models<00:02:58.150> with<00:02:58.330> this<00:02:58.540> if<00:02:58.750> you

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
fly giant scale models with this if you

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.490 
fly giant scale models with this if you
wanted<00:02:59.200> to<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:01.060> it<00:03:01.210> does<00:03:01.420> come<00:03:01.720> with<00:03:01.750> a<00:03:01.960> USB

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
wanted to and it does come with a USB

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.120 
wanted to and it does come with a USB
charger<00:03:03.370> for<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:04.290> built-in<00:03:05.290> battery<00:03:05.860> there

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
charger for the built-in battery there

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.730 
charger for the built-in battery there
let<00:03:06.490> me<00:03:06.610> go<00:03:06.790> ahead<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.120> take<00:03:07.570> it<00:03:07.720> back<00:03:07.870> out<00:03:08.110> so

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
let me go ahead and take it back out so

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.410 
let me go ahead and take it back out so
you<00:03:08.800> got<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.310> just<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.520> little<00:03:09.730> hatch<00:03:09.940> here<00:03:10.270> that

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
you got it just a little hatch here that

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.790 
you got it just a little hatch here that
opens<00:03:10.750> up<00:03:10.960> and<00:03:11.110> then<00:03:11.200> you<00:03:11.230> can<00:03:11.440> take<00:03:11.620> the

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
opens up and then you can take the

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.680 
opens up and then you can take the
battery<00:03:12.190> out<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.700> plug<00:03:12.910> it<00:03:13.060> into<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.390> charger

battery out and plug it into the charger

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.590 
battery out and plug it into the charger
and<00:03:14.350> then<00:03:15.040> you<00:03:15.430> know<00:03:15.550> charge<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:16.030> back<00:03:16.150> up<00:03:16.420> and

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
and then you know charge it back up and

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.260 
and then you know charge it back up and
you're<00:03:16.690> good<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:16.960> go<00:03:17.520> and<00:03:18.520> then<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:18.700> also<00:03:18.910> has

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
you're good to go and then it also has

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.140 
you're good to go and then it also has
easier<00:03:20.020> programming<00:03:20.770> now<00:03:20.950> so<00:03:21.370> when<00:03:21.550> you<00:03:21.700> when

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
easier programming now so when you when

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.910 
easier programming now so when you when
you<00:03:22.240> plug<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:22.660> in<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:22.930> can<00:03:23.110> press<00:03:23.410> the<00:03:23.650> mode

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
you plug it in you can press the mode

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.130 
you plug it in you can press the mode
button<00:03:23.950> here<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:24.970> these<00:03:25.570> each<00:03:25.930> of<00:03:25.960> these

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
button here and these each of these

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.110 
button here and these each of these
letters<00:03:26.530> stand<00:03:27.070> for<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.430> different<00:03:27.820> brands

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
letters stand for the different brands

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.540 
letters stand for the different brands
of<00:03:28.480> radio<00:03:28.870> so<00:03:29.290> you<00:03:29.350> just<00:03:29.620> set<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:30.040> to<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.460> know

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
of radio so you just set it to you know

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.540 
of radio so you just set it to you know
s4<00:03:31.090> spectrum<00:03:31.690> set<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.650> to<00:03:32.800> your<00:03:32.920> model<00:03:33.280> radio

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
s4 spectrum set it to your model radio

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.150 
s4 spectrum set it to your model radio
and<00:03:33.790> all<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.000> programming<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:35.160> channel

and all the programming and channel
reversing<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:36.880> all<00:03:36.970> that<00:03:37.180> should<00:03:37.390> be<00:03:37.540> done

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
reversing and all that should be done

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.450 
reversing and all that should be done
for<00:03:38.140> you<00:03:38.550> one<00:03:39.550> thing<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:40.120> note<00:03:40.360> though<00:03:40.630> if<00:03:40.990> you

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
for you one thing to note though if you

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.850 
for you one thing to note though if you
if<00:03:42.460> you<00:03:42.670> were<00:03:42.880> using<00:03:43.240> the<00:03:43.570> SL<00:03:43.990> or<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.320> any<00:03:44.560> link

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
if you were using the SL or the any link

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.370 
if you were using the SL or the any link
1<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:45.820> you<00:03:45.970> have<00:03:46.000> models<00:03:46.690> set<00:03:46.960> up<00:03:47.080> on<00:03:47.230> your

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
1 and you have models set up on your

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.220 
1 and you have models set up on your
radio<00:03:47.710> for<00:03:47.980> that<00:03:48.210> the<00:03:49.210> reversing<00:03:49.930> was

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
radio for that the reversing was

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.020 
radio for that the reversing was
different<00:03:50.770> for<00:03:50.980> me<00:03:51.040> like<00:03:51.430> when<00:03:51.460> I<00:03:51.700> when<00:03:52.000> I

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
different for me like when I when I

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.520 
different for me like when I when I
first<00:03:52.120> set<00:03:52.660> up<00:03:52.810> my<00:03:53.080> 1sq<00:03:54.570> using<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:56.050> model<00:03:56.410> that

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
first set up my 1sq using the model that

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.290 
first set up my 1sq using the model that
I<00:03:56.590> already<00:03:56.950> had<00:03:57.160> in<00:03:57.340> my<00:03:57.460> radio<00:03:57.670> that<00:03:58.060> I<00:03:58.090> was

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
I already had in my radio that I was

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.350 
I already had in my radio that I was
flying<00:03:58.540> with<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:59.020> anylink<00:03:59.350> one<00:03:59.680> when<00:04:00.670> I<00:04:00.700> used

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
flying with the anylink one when I used

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.780 
flying with the anylink one when I used
it<00:04:01.540> with<00:04:01.630> any<00:04:01.870> link<00:04:02.140> to<00:04:02.230> a<00:04:02.920> bunch<00:04:03.520> of<00:04:03.670> the

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
it with any link to a bunch of the

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.790 
it with any link to a bunch of the
channels<00:04:04.240> were<00:04:04.390> reversed<00:04:04.990> but<00:04:05.350> I<00:04:05.410> had

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
channels were reversed but I had

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.500 
channels were reversed but I had
reversed<00:04:06.310> them<00:04:06.610> in<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.820> radius<00:04:07.120> so<00:04:07.240> I<00:04:07.300> had<00:04:07.450> to

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
reversed them in the radius so I had to

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.350 
reversed them in the radius so I had to
put<00:04:07.720> them<00:04:07.870> back<00:04:08.080> to<00:04:08.350> normal<00:04:08.860> because<00:04:09.820> you<00:04:10.210> know

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
put them back to normal because you know

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.580 
put them back to normal because you know
you<00:04:10.420> don't<00:04:10.600> have<00:04:10.720> to<00:04:10.870> do<00:04:11.020> that<00:04:11.170> in<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.350> radio

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
you don't have to do that in the radio

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.770 
you don't have to do that in the radio
anymore<00:04:11.740> because<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.550> any<00:04:12.880> link<00:04:13.209> to<00:04:13.450> does<00:04:13.750> it

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
anymore because the any link to does it

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.199 
anymore because the any link to does it
for<00:04:14.170> you<00:04:14.350> so<00:04:15.190> just<00:04:15.400> keep<00:04:15.580> that<00:04:15.610> in<00:04:15.880> mind<00:04:16.060> if

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
for you so just keep that in mind if

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.510 
for you so just keep that in mind if
you're<00:04:16.359> using<00:04:16.390> old<00:04:16.930> models<00:04:17.500> you'll<00:04:18.190> want<00:04:18.430> to

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
you're using old models you'll want to

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.180 
you're using old models you'll want to
check<00:04:18.790> all<00:04:19.060> your<00:04:19.390> you<00:04:20.350> know<00:04:20.440> all<00:04:20.470> your<00:04:20.770> channel

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
check all your you know all your channel

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.100 
check all your you know all your channel
reversing<00:04:21.790> first<00:04:22.150> before<00:04:22.600> you<00:04:22.750> go<00:04:22.900> flying

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
reversing first before you go flying

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.780 
reversing first before you go flying
because<00:04:23.680> there's<00:04:23.830> a<00:04:23.890> good<00:04:24.100> chance<00:04:24.370> something

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
because there's a good chance something

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.940 
because there's a good chance something
will<00:04:24.940> be<00:04:25.060> reversed<00:04:25.510> but<00:04:26.500> if<00:04:26.590> you're<00:04:26.710> setting

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
will be reversed but if you're setting

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.200 
will be reversed but if you're setting
up<00:04:27.160> a<00:04:27.280> new<00:04:27.490> model<00:04:27.940> that<00:04:28.720> you

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
up a new model that you

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.550 
up a new model that you
haven't<00:04:29.509> you<00:04:29.600> never<00:04:29.930> used<00:04:30.229> one<00:04:30.289> of<00:04:30.410> these

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
haven't you never used one of these

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.550 
haven't you never used one of these
before<00:04:31.310> it<00:04:31.520> should<00:04:32.060> all<00:04:32.270> be<00:04:32.300> taken<00:04:32.870> care<00:04:32.900> of<00:04:33.169> by

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
before it should all be taken care of by

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.640 
before it should all be taken care of by
just<00:04:33.620> selecting<00:04:34.250> your<00:04:34.850> your<00:04:35.330> brand<00:04:35.900> radio<00:04:36.380> on

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
just selecting your your brand radio on

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.790 
just selecting your your brand radio on
the<00:04:36.680> any<00:04:36.949> link<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.810> and<00:04:38.810> I<00:04:39.080> think<00:04:39.169> that's<00:04:39.530> about

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
the any link to and I think that's about

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.770 
the any link to and I think that's about
all<00:04:39.860> there<00:04:40.130> is<00:04:40.250> to<00:04:40.400> say<00:04:40.610> about<00:04:40.639> it<00:04:41.000> so<00:04:41.030> let's<00:04:41.389> go

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
all there is to say about it so let's go

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.270 
all there is to say about it so let's go
ahead<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.139> take<00:04:42.380> this<00:04:42.560> for<00:04:42.770> a<00:04:42.800> little<00:04:43.039> spin

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
ahead and take this for a little spin

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.730 
ahead and take this for a little spin
just<00:04:43.580> to<00:04:43.729> prove<00:04:43.970> that<00:04:44.120> it<00:04:44.270> actually<00:04:44.300> works<00:04:44.900> and

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
just to prove that it actually works and

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.430 
just to prove that it actually works and
let's<00:04:46.009> go<00:04:46.099> check<00:04:46.280> that<00:04:46.460> out<00:04:46.990> alright<00:04:47.990> this<00:04:48.199> is

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
let's go check that out alright this is

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.640 
let's go check that out alright this is
the<00:04:48.470> flight<00:04:48.979> demo<00:04:49.490> of<00:04:49.759> the<00:04:49.940> any<00:04:50.180> link<00:04:50.509> to<00:04:50.960> be

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
the flight demo of the any link to be

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.360 
the flight demo of the any link to be
using<00:04:52.099> my<00:04:52.280> spectrum<00:04:52.759> dx8<00:04:53.449> and<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:53.870> heli-max

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
using my spectrum dx8 and the heli-max

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.330 
using my spectrum dx8 and the heli-max
1sq<00:04:55.810> so<00:04:56.810> first<00:04:57.080> things<00:04:57.349> first<00:04:57.500> you<00:04:57.889> want<00:04:58.220> to

give<00:06:18.860> her<00:06:18.979> a<00:06:19.070> flight<00:06:19.340> now<00:06:20.120> I<00:06:20.150> haven't<00:06:20.389> flown<00:06:20.599> a

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
give her a flight now I haven't flown a

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.290 
give her a flight now I haven't flown a
3-axis<00:06:21.680> climb<00:06:21.979> in<00:06:22.190> a<00:06:22.219> while<00:06:22.430> so<00:06:22.849> hopefully<00:06:23.270> I

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
3-axis climb in a while so hopefully I

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.170 
3-axis climb in a while so hopefully I
don't<00:06:23.449> totally<00:06:23.780> botch<00:06:24.229> this<00:06:24.560> but<00:06:25.180> here's

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
don't totally botch this but here's

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.709 
don't totally botch this but here's
proof<00:06:26.659> of<00:06:26.870> that<00:06:27.380> the<00:06:28.360> any<00:06:29.360> link<00:06:29.690> to<00:06:29.780> will<00:06:30.409> fly

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:31.719 
proof of that the any link to will fly

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:35.290 
proof of that the any link to will fly
you<00:06:32.719> let<00:06:32.990> you<00:06:33.139> use<00:06:33.380> a<00:06:33.409> spectrum<00:06:34.400> radio<00:06:34.639> with<00:06:35.090> a

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
you let you use a spectrum radio with a

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.080 
you let you use a spectrum radio with a
heli<00:06:35.599> max<00:06:35.930> products

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:44.189 
heli max products
pretty<00:06:37.780> cool<00:06:38.320> oh<00:06:38.350> man<00:06:42.180> well<00:06:43.180> there<00:06:43.419> we<00:06:43.600> go<00:06:43.630> I<00:06:43.810> am

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199 
pretty cool oh man well there we go I am

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:46.230 
pretty cool oh man well there we go I am
flying<00:06:44.530> the<00:06:44.949> helmick's<00:06:45.430> with<00:06:45.729> the<00:06:45.850> spectrum

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
flying the helmick's with the spectrum

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.909 
flying the helmick's with the spectrum
radio<00:06:48.240> man<00:06:49.240> it's<00:06:49.449> amazing<00:06:49.600> how<00:06:50.290> rusty<00:06:50.800> I've

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919 
radio man it's amazing how rusty I've

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:53.370 
radio man it's amazing how rusty I've
gotten<00:06:51.310> a<00:06:51.370> 3-axis<00:06:52.120> flight<00:06:52.449> it's<00:06:52.690> been<00:06:52.900> so<00:06:53.139> long

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.380 
gotten a 3-axis flight it's been so long

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.040 
gotten a 3-axis flight it's been so long
I<00:06:53.830> used<00:06:54.639> to<00:06:54.760> be<00:06:54.910> able<00:06:54.970> to<00:06:55.090> fly<00:06:55.360> this<00:06:55.419> thing<00:06:55.600> like

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.050 
I used to be able to fly this thing like

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.270 
I used to be able to fly this thing like
it<00:06:56.199> was<00:06:56.290> nothing<00:06:56.740> knots

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
it was nothing knots

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:10.300 
it was nothing knots
feel<00:06:57.910> super<00:06:58.449> crazy

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.310 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.369 

all<00:07:11.310> right<00:07:11.580> well<00:07:11.969> I<00:07:11.999> think<00:07:12.210> that<00:07:12.569> shows<00:07:13.050> that

00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:13.379 
all right well I think that shows that

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:15.679 
all right well I think that shows that
it<00:07:13.530> does<00:07:13.770> work<00:07:14.069> go<00:07:14.699> ahead<00:07:14.909> and<00:07:15.029> take<00:07:15.240> it<00:07:15.389> in<00:07:15.509> for

00:07:15.679 --> 00:07:15.689 
it does work go ahead and take it in for

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:18.950 
it does work go ahead and take it in for
a<00:07:15.749> landing<00:07:15.930> before<00:07:16.259> I<00:07:16.499> destroy<00:07:17.039> it<00:07:17.210> and<00:07:18.210> that's

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 
a landing before I destroy it and that's

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.070 
a landing before I destroy it and that's
that<00:07:19.110> that<00:07:19.620> is<00:07:19.830> the<00:07:20.039> any<00:07:20.340> link<00:07:20.729> to<00:07:21.060> with<00:07:21.840> the

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 
that that is the any link to with the
