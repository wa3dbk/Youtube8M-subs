00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
existence and what is it powered by and

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.220 
existence and what is it powered by and
it's<00:02:45.580> super<00:02:46.120> heavy-duty<00:02:46.480> we're<00:02:46.870> going<00:02:46.989> to<00:02:47.049> pan

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
it's super heavy-duty we're going to pan

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.309 
it's super heavy-duty we're going to pan
over<00:02:47.260> here<00:02:47.739> to<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.580> roller<00:02:48.910> on<00:02:49.269> it<00:02:49.480> which

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
over here to the the roller on it which

00:02:50.319 --> 00:03:07.069 
over here to the the roller on it which
almost<00:02:50.920> looks<00:02:51.100> like<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.310> 55-gallon<00:02:51.790> steel<00:02:52.269> drum

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.069 

and<00:03:08.459> very<00:03:09.459> thick<00:03:09.760> conveyor<00:03:10.209> belt<00:03:10.540> on<00:03:10.810> there

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
and very thick conveyor belt on there

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.160 
and very thick conveyor belt on there
looks<00:03:11.680> like<00:03:11.769> it's<00:03:11.859> about<00:03:12.100> an<00:03:12.340> inch<00:03:12.459> thick<00:03:13.170> yeah

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
looks like it's about an inch thick yeah

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.990 
looks like it's about an inch thick yeah
and<00:03:14.470> what<00:03:14.769> is<00:03:14.859> it<00:03:14.980> right<00:03:15.250> on<00:03:15.519> what<00:03:15.760> is<00:03:15.910> this

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
and what is it right on what is this

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.920 
and what is it right on what is this
cushioning<00:03:16.390> between<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:17.079> belt<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.590> that's

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
cushioning between the belt and that's

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.030 
cushioning between the belt and that's
three<00:03:19.930> plates<00:03:20.290> of<00:03:20.519> UHMW

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
three plates of UHMW

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.099 
three plates of UHMW
TRADD<00:03:22.700> rides<00:03:23.030> home<00:03:23.329> right<00:03:24.049> and<00:03:25.480> it's<00:03:26.480> because

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
TRADD rides home right and it's because

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.199 
TRADD rides home right and it's because
because<00:03:27.500> really<00:03:28.069> whisper<00:03:28.459> quiet<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:29.060> that's

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
because really whisper quiet and that's

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.539 
because really whisper quiet and that's
one<00:03:29.420> of<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.629> positives<00:03:30.560> of<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:31.370> whole

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
one of the positives of the whole

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.119 
one of the positives of the whole
operation<00:03:31.849> is<00:03:32.480> that<00:03:32.510> it<00:03:32.810> goes<00:03:33.170> really<00:03:33.530> quietly

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
operation is that it goes really quietly

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.699 
operation is that it goes really quietly
because<00:03:34.430> he<00:03:34.549> has<00:03:34.730> don't<00:03:35.150> like<00:03:35.709> puritanical

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
because he has don't like puritanical

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.759 
because he has don't like puritanical
noises<00:03:37.189> that<00:03:37.370> whole<00:03:37.549> be<00:03:37.700> sure<00:03:38.209> what<00:03:39.109> what<00:03:39.650> are

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
noises that whole be sure what what are

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.619 
noises that whole be sure what what are
some<00:03:39.950> of<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.129> things<00:03:40.280> you're<00:03:40.849> hoping<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.329> find

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
some of the things you're hoping to find

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.569 
some of the things you're hoping to find
with<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.049> research<00:03:42.439> angle<00:03:42.890> of<00:03:43.010> this<00:03:43.189> I<00:03:43.220> mean<00:03:43.340> I

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
with the research angle of this I mean I

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.610 
with the research angle of this I mean I
know<00:03:43.819> you're<00:03:44.060> hoping<00:03:44.239> to<00:03:44.450> use<00:03:44.689> it<00:03:44.840> as<00:03:44.959> a

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
know you're hoping to use it as a

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.429 
know you're hoping to use it as a
bonafide<00:03:46.010> training<00:03:46.700> tool<00:03:46.909> also<00:03:47.150> but<00:03:47.599> on<00:03:47.780> the

00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:48.439 
bonafide training tool also but on the

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.170 
bonafide training tool also but on the
research<00:03:48.829> side<00:03:49.159> of<00:03:49.189> things<00:03:49.310> what<00:03:49.970> do<00:03:50.090> you

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
research side of things what do you

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.970 
research side of things what do you
think<00:03:50.420> you're<00:03:50.569> gonna<00:03:50.750> find<00:03:51.170> that<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:51.680> can't

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
think you're gonna find that you can't

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.509 
think you're gonna find that you can't
find<00:03:52.370> from<00:03:52.639> running<00:03:52.939> the<00:03:53.060> dogs<00:03:53.530> well<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.859> the

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
find from running the dogs well the the

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.610 
find from running the dogs well the the
runing<00:03:55.879> is<00:03:56.000> one<00:03:56.239> thing<00:03:56.480> but<00:03:56.659> what<00:03:56.930> we<00:03:57.139> can<00:03:57.349> do

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
runing is one thing but what we can do

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.979 
runing is one thing but what we can do
is<00:03:57.829> we<00:03:57.980> could<00:03:58.189> monitor<00:03:58.819> dogs<00:03:59.090> while<00:03:59.659> they're

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
is we could monitor dogs while they're

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.020 
is we could monitor dogs while they're
running<00:04:00.230> which<00:04:00.950> is<00:04:01.129> really<00:04:01.400> hard<00:04:01.609> to<00:04:01.730> do

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
running which is really hard to do

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.879 
running which is really hard to do
especially<00:04:02.659> when<00:04:03.169> they<00:04:03.319> start<00:04:03.560> wearing<00:04:03.709> the

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
especially when they start wearing the

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.559 
especially when they start wearing the
masses<00:04:04.370> that<00:04:04.519> output<00:04:06.519> the<00:04:07.519> true<00:04:08.150> measure<00:04:08.419> of

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
masses that output the true measure of

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.520 
masses that output the true measure of
how<00:04:08.930> many<00:04:09.730> oxygen<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:11.419> dogs<00:04:11.689> and<00:04:12.049> how<00:04:12.349> much

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
how many oxygen the dogs and how much

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.409 
how many oxygen the dogs and how much
co2<00:04:12.769> they<00:04:13.189> produce<00:04:13.430> is<00:04:13.879> really<00:04:13.909> hard<00:04:14.359> to

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:14.419 
co2 they produce is really hard to

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:15.970 
co2 they produce is really hard to
measure<00:04:14.720> in<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:14.959> field<00:04:15.349> yeah

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
measure in the field yeah

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.409 
measure in the field yeah
whereas<00:04:16.190> here<00:04:16.489> you<00:04:16.940> can<00:04:17.090> have<00:04:17.329> it

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
whereas here you can have it

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.629 
whereas here you can have it
environmentally<00:04:17.930> controlled<00:04:18.320> it<00:04:19.160> also<00:04:19.400> has

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
environmentally controlled it also has

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.460 
environmentally controlled it also has
an<00:04:19.759> inclined<00:04:20.180> feature<00:04:20.539> where<00:04:21.349> you<00:04:21.440> can

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
an inclined feature where you can

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.890 
an inclined feature where you can
actually<00:04:21.699> put<00:04:22.699> heart<00:04:22.910> rate<00:04:23.060> monitors<00:04:23.599> on<00:04:23.870> the

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
actually put heart rate monitors on the

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.529 
actually put heart rate monitors on the
dog<00:04:24.229> and<00:04:24.560> have<00:04:25.130> wires<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:25.820> pleads<00:04:26.090> attached

dog and have wires and pleads attached

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.480 
dog and have wires and pleads attached
to<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:26.960> dogs<00:04:27.199> while<00:04:27.740> they're<00:04:28.070> doing<00:04:28.250> their

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
to the dogs while they're doing their

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.210 
to the dogs while they're doing their
exercise<00:04:29.090> it<00:04:30.050> makes<00:04:30.380> it<00:04:30.560> a<00:04:30.680> lot<00:04:30.800> easier<00:04:30.860> for

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
exercise it makes it a lot easier for

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.300 
exercise it makes it a lot easier for
the<00:04:31.490> researchers<00:04:32.090> to<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.659> gather<00:04:32.930> their<00:04:33.229> data

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
the researchers to to gather their data

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.040 
the researchers to to gather their data
that<00:04:34.310> might<00:04:34.580> be<00:04:34.789> almost<00:04:35.240> impossible<00:04:35.900> to

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
that might be almost impossible to

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
yeah do you do you foresee with this

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.280 
yeah do you do you foresee with this
information<00:05:11.000> that<00:05:11.390> you're<00:05:11.510> gonna<00:05:11.600> get<00:05:11.900> do<00:05:12.230> you

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.290 
information that you're gonna get do you

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.690 
information that you're gonna get do you
foresee<00:05:12.740> it<00:05:13.450> leading<00:05:14.450> to<00:05:14.870> better<00:05:15.800> dog<00:05:16.190> care

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
foresee it leading to better dog care

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.750 
foresee it leading to better dog care
during<00:05:17.210> long-distance<00:05:17.780> racing<00:05:18.260> or<00:05:18.760> faster

records<00:05:20.270> or<00:05:20.740> ultimately<00:05:21.740> everything<00:05:22.550> we<00:05:22.670> do

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
records or ultimately everything we do

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.060 
records or ultimately everything we do
with<00:05:23.420> it<00:05:23.450> for<00:05:23.780> the<00:05:23.930> dogs<00:05:24.140> is<00:05:24.440> hopefully<00:05:24.890> not

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
with it for the dogs is hopefully not

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.820 
with it for the dogs is hopefully not
only<00:05:25.340> the<00:05:25.520> benefits<00:05:26.060> my<00:05:26.390> dog<00:05:26.690> but<00:05:27.080> ultimately

only the benefits my dog but ultimately

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.920 
only the benefits my dog but ultimately
translates<00:05:28.460> the<00:05:28.610> benefits<00:05:29.060> of<00:05:29.180> every<00:05:29.360> dog<00:05:29.570> you

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
translates the benefits of every dog you

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.440 
translates the benefits of every dog you
know<00:05:30.050> I<00:05:30.350> don't<00:05:30.650> think<00:05:30.970> it's<00:05:31.970> gonna<00:05:32.120> make<00:05:32.300> him

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
know I don't think it's gonna make him

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.470 
know I don't think it's gonna make him
any<00:05:32.570> faster<00:05:32.840> but<00:05:33.620> understanding<00:05:34.520> inside<00:05:35.180> to

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
any faster but understanding inside to

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
know what makes them tick and what what

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:38.890 
know what makes them tick and what what
what<00:05:38.270> it<00:05:38.390> takes

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
what it takes

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.800 
what it takes
always<00:05:39.800> ultimately<00:05:40.190> takes<00:05:40.850> you<00:05:41.450> know<00:05:41.570> at

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
always ultimately takes you know at

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.690 
always ultimately takes you know at
least<00:05:41.930> a<00:05:42.170> better<00:05:42.350> girl--<00:05:42.590> care<00:05:42.860> yeah<00:05:43.220> then<00:05:43.520> of

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
least a better girl-- care yeah then of

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.090 
least a better girl-- care yeah then of
course<00:05:43.940> not<00:05:44.210> only<00:05:44.480> my<00:05:44.660> dogs<00:05:44.900> benefit<00:05:45.410> but<00:05:45.920> the

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
course not only my dogs benefit but the

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.770 
course not only my dogs benefit but the
industry<00:05:46.820> benefits<00:05:47.300> who<00:05:47.420> needs<00:05:47.630> a

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
industry benefits who needs a

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.810 
industry benefits who needs a
trickle-down<00:05:48.200> effect<00:05:48.290> that<00:05:48.920> hopefully<00:05:49.580> every

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
trickle-down effect that hopefully every

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.690 
trickle-down effect that hopefully every
dog<00:05:50.030> eventually<00:05:50.600> will<00:05:50.750> benefit<00:05:51.200> from<00:05:54.640> do<00:05:55.640> you

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
put this thing together with I'm gonna

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.980 
put this thing together with I'm gonna
back<00:06:25.580> up<00:06:25.760> here<00:06:25.940> and<00:06:26.030> get<00:06:26.150> a<00:06:26.180> bigger<00:06:26.540> bigger

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
back up here and get a bigger bigger

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.810 
back up here and get a bigger bigger
shot<00:06:27.290> of<00:06:27.470> all<00:06:27.620> the<00:06:27.740> parts<00:06:28.100> and<00:06:28.250> they're

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
shot of all the parts and they're

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.610 
shot of all the parts and they're
hydraulics<00:06:29.600> that<00:06:29.690> are<00:06:29.900> on<00:06:29.990> the<00:06:30.110> ground<00:06:30.380> and

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
hydraulics that are on the ground and

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.960 
hydraulics that are on the ground and
they're<00:06:30.770> putting<00:06:30.980> the<00:06:31.130> roof<00:06:31.280> on<00:06:31.490> and<00:06:31.700> I<00:06:31.790> guess

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
they're putting the roof on and I guess

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.400 
they're putting the roof on and I guess
the<00:06:32.120> plan<00:06:32.270> is<00:06:32.510> to<00:06:32.570> try<00:06:32.810> and<00:06:32.870> get<00:06:33.050> this<00:06:33.200> thing

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
the plan is to try and get this thing

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.790 
the plan is to try and get this thing
all<00:06:33.560> enclosed<00:06:34.180> before<00:06:35.180> we<00:06:35.330> get<00:06:35.480> this<00:06:35.800> yeah

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
all enclosed before we get this yeah

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.800 
all enclosed before we get this yeah
great<00:06:37.280> well<00:06:37.520> thanks<00:06:37.850> thanks<00:06:38.120> a<00:06:38.420> lot<00:06:38.450> Martin
