00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.369

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.310
 they finished I had them 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.859
 in between once turned 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.390
 actually something cool would have something 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:37.109
 can be uniform evenly 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.570
 but be it 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:41.579
 then we take 1.2 kilo hack and season 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.690
 this with neat markus mafia 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.670

 Complete has quantity once covered 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.260
 and then knead properly 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.820
 if you knead it then 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.500
 can you see if i like the color 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.390

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.480
 much spice share because in there is if 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.469
 it is well mixed and if necessary also 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.469
 just spice it up again 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.069
 with me was that so I just times 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:18.039
 what is poured forth afterwards 

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:19.780
 kneaded and this is good 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.700
 the tool with which the sus the citizen 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.619
 is made to visit the grill 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.299
 shop in DÃ¼ren many thanks at the place 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.819
 my family gave me this for Father's Day 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.759
 that's pretty easy and 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:32.170
 that's super cool 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.349
 There was such a different system before 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.849
 ironing that was not that easy 

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:37.179
 to make a citizen but a uci 

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:38.679
 here 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.349
 that's really huge you take 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.239
 He just has a good handful gets 

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:46.090
 her later a feeling for hacker club 

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:48.759
 then you have to take the press from above 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.250
 with the hollow down and pushes 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:55.479
 this once laid down to pull out the 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.369
 then turning slightly helps too 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.890
 little bit if you wet it first 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.849
 the bag then you see what we already 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.469
 here's the hack we have a nice one 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:04.869
 edge more around a trough in the middle and 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.489
 This hollow can now stand moderate 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.869
 the uci to the citizens yes with cheese 

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:09.729
 filled in the case that is one 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.670
 mixture of three cheeses that 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.940
 parmesan gouda and mozzarella still calm 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.950
 a little something on top of it then 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.150
 After that, we shape ourselves out of another haag 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.500
 a little grandchild just so gross 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.720
 because he would be flattened now 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.260
 and then the press from the other 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.139
 page 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.940
 and this complete package has 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:35.940
 Closing filling that's what it looks like 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.099
 out 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.109
 now you can just from below 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.730
 Press the floor upwards and thus comfortably 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.160
 remove the hak mass with the filling 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.609
 to loosen the ground, too, that works 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.250
 easy 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:53.919

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.569
 Real kaventsmann are great 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:58.169
 but now the weber go anywhere 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.130
 prepared so that I have properly 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:03.010
 a total of three quarters almost 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.049
 einreiviertel an ignition fireplace in one 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.950

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:11.670
 preheated 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.879
 and now we grill the four events 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:19.010
 men uci lucy mafia style short for one 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.010
 few minutes in the direct heat 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.910
 after a few minutes then you see that 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.450
 when they form so easily upwards 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.450
 turn it over once 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.140
 in between can close the lid 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.310
 not hurt 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.260
 then a few minutes more direct 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.210
 Heat the monolith is random 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.220
 already prepared for indirect heat 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.690
 and there we can get citizens like that now 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.540
 let alone pull until they are 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.650
 desired core temperature or the 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.060
 desired even have the 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.690
 use remaining heat on the phone 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.690
 we just hunk something cerano directly 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.340
 and then we'll take care of it 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:34.560
 even for our sauce we take 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:37.830

 Brandy mix the whole thing well 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:15.159
 where you can get salt and pepper if 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.909
 you still want a splash of lime juice 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:20.019
 with pure or lemon juice 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:21.609
 fresh herbs can not 

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:23.979
 Damage in the case I just have 

00:05:21.609 --> 00:05:27.909
 leave it at that and some salt and 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:31.379
 integrate pepper as I said and 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:31.379
 finished is then already around the sum 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.789
 So we want to see what else 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.800

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.249
 case already finished we can do it shortly 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:58.719
 set aside to cool and then 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:06:00.639
 we build our citizens together we 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:02.199
 start with the bun that your symbol 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.150

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:13.659
 our mediterranean barbecue cocktail 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:15.520
 rose is also a bit rucola due 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:20.529

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:24.430
 as a normal salad on citizens then 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:30.669
