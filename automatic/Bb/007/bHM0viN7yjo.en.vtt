but<00:02:08.500> I<00:02:08.530> think<00:02:08.769> it's<00:02:08.860> because<00:02:09.009> it<00:02:09.130> just<00:02:09.429> did<00:02:09.549> it

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
but I think it's because it just did it

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.670 
but I think it's because it just did it
yesterday<00:02:09.819> and<00:02:10.239> it's<00:02:10.569> too<00:02:10.840> loose<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.200> really

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.350 
yesterday and it's too loose to really
