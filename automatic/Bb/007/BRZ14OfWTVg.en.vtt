00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.910
 and yes in the company of the young back 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.160
 side of reims he is 21 and he 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.259
 come on say hello aÃ¯ssa hello then 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.360
 what is your background in football 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.490
 was it chaotic where it got 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.190
 been rather quiet enough it was 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.110
 rather progressive we will say I 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.090
 started at the age of 8 at the stage of 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.160
 reims and I climbed the ladder in this 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.580
 sense this team dance in this club 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.530
 then I started in national 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.640
 modest since then now I have the 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.830
 chance to discover the links already 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.020
 last year so I am I am 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.650
 delighted are people who helped you 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.370
 in your path 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.920
 yes a lot my coaches with 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.800
 which I evolved in the categories 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.140
 inferior and the person who gave it to me 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.270
 more help it's my mother it's without her 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.829
 I will be I will not be here we will say she 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.930
 is your mother scrambling 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.810
 obviously 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.340
 so in this club at one time there 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.910
 had the national there was a club in 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.680
 difficulty 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.300
 when you were a kid and who was 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.089
 been trained here you could say that someday 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.520
 you would be in league 1 ben we get 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.290
 says it because it's a dream like 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.479
 like little ones, we dream of playing here 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.650
 I know that I have borne this 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.770
 team I was in the stands 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.060
 I was even the jetty on the on the 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.680
 terrain that I invaded the field when 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.440
 they went back to national I think 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.450
 so it's beautiful it's a dream 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.950
 realize and I try to enjoy at 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.270
 maximum and who have invaded the field 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.370
 in a slightly different way 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.070
 now precisely for the future 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.479
 what are your dreams one day at 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.850
 international level a club at 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.619
 abroad do not specifically have 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.729
 club if I could if I could everything 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.220
 to do with the stage of reims 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.200
 imagine with champions growing up 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.979
 with this club there and the world cup I 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.869
 think it is 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.729
 these two footballer dream raids 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.500
 champions and the world cup what 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.470
 ah it's really a deep attachment 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.570
 at the club oh yeah I'm starting my fourteenth 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.920
 year here it 's been a long time I 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.360
 am I am attached to this club this is 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.040
 normal 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.869
 after i hope i hope more club is going 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.509
 grow and already next year with 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.980
 one with a place of life so that will help 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.540
 the club to grow and 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.520
 maybe I 'll be part of that 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.030
 project the other to finish a model 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.730
 a reference in football before I loved 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.950
 well unraveled lenzo from paris and 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.620
