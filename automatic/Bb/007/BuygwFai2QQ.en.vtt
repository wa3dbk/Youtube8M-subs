good i suspected t-wave because prova
pass<00:02:07.160> almost<00:02:07.430> always<00:02:07.790> uses<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:08.210> but<00:02:08.360> he<00:02:08.420> uses

try<00:03:38.510> to<00:03:38.600> use<00:03:38.780> meteor<00:03:39.080> mash<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.500> get<00:03:39.680> up<00:03:39.799> to<00:03:40.190> get

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
try to use meteor mash to get up to get

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.190 
try to use meteor mash to get up to get
at<00:03:40.459> my<00:03:40.549> attack<00:03:40.880> it's<00:03:41.060> actually<00:03:41.390> a<00:03:41.420> good<00:03:41.989> amount

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
at my attack it's actually a good amount

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.410 
at my attack it's actually a good amount
of<00:03:42.440> a<00:03:42.739> good<00:03:43.010> chance<00:03:43.340> to<00:03:43.640> get<00:03:44.000> up<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.180> attack

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
of a good chance to get up the attack

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.449 
of a good chance to get up the attack
but<00:03:44.600> i'll<00:03:44.690> use<00:03:44.810> toxic<00:03:45.139> because<00:03:45.769> this<00:03:45.950> Ludicolo

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
but i'll use toxic because this Ludicolo

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.370 
but i'll use toxic because this Ludicolo
is<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:46.820> staller<00:03:47.510> and

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
is a staller and

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.230 
is a staller and
just<00:03:48.770> absolutely<00:03:49.250> critical<00:03:49.460> scholars<00:03:49.730> called

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
just absolutely critical scholars called

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.170 
just absolutely critical scholars called
I'm<00:03:50.510> I'm<00:03:51.350> really<00:03:51.830> hoping<00:03:52.160> to<00:03:52.340> not<00:03:52.550> get<00:03:52.910> burned

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
I'm I'm really hoping to not get burned

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.390 
I'm I'm really hoping to not get burned
because<00:03:53.510> that<00:03:53.810> would<00:03:53.930> just<00:03:53.960> be<00:03:54.400> terrible

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
because that would just be terrible

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.430 
because that would just be terrible
considering<00:03:55.820> me<00:03:56.150> Tang<00:03:56.390> has<00:03:56.600> already<00:03:57.020> set<00:03:57.320> up

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
considering me Tang has already set up

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.780 
considering me Tang has already set up
his<00:03:57.470> stealth<00:03:57.830> rocks<00:03:58.100> and<00:03:58.280> at<00:03:58.340> this<00:03:58.430> point<00:03:58.610> is

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
his stealth rocks and at this point is

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.250 
his stealth rocks and at this point is
just<00:03:58.820> sort<00:03:59.150> of<00:03:59.210> a<00:03:59.300> bulky<00:03:59.600> physical<00:03:59.990> attacker

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
just sort of a bulky physical attacker

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.710 
just sort of a bulky physical attacker
so<00:04:01.220> I'll<00:04:01.340> send<00:04:01.580> in<00:04:01.730> Quagsire<00:04:02.800> I<00:04:04.390> suppose<00:04:05.390> that

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
so I'll send in Quagsire I suppose that

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.440 
so I'll send in Quagsire I suppose that
I<00:04:05.750> forgot<00:04:06.200> that<00:04:06.230> Ludicolo<00:04:06.920> had<00:04:07.310> Giga<00:04:08.180> Drain

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
I forgot that Ludicolo had Giga Drain

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.430 
I forgot that Ludicolo had Giga Drain

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
will get hurt by the poisons increasing

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.530 
will get hurt by the poisons increasing

my<00:04:24.050> goal<00:04:24.290> my<00:04:24.560> my<00:04:24.890> point<00:04:25.340> was<00:04:25.550> to<00:04:25.580> get<00:04:25.790> up<00:04:25.940> a

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
my goal my my point was to get up a

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.760 
my goal my my point was to get up a
sunny<00:04:26.240> day<00:04:26.480> and<00:04:26.750> then<00:04:26.930> reduce<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.350> power<00:04:27.590> of

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
sunny day and then reduce the power of

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:28.870 
sunny day and then reduce the power of
skull<00:04:28.040> to<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.280> point<00:04:28.460> where<00:04:28.580> wouldn't<00:04:28.820> do

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
skull to the point where wouldn't do

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.940 
skull to the point where wouldn't do
serious<00:04:29.240> damage<00:04:29.390> but<00:04:29.720> it's<00:04:29.870> ok<00:04:30.140> here<00:04:30.680> with<00:04:30.860> the

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
serious damage but it's ok here with the

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.530 
serious damage but it's ok here with the
pincer<00:04:31.250> I<00:04:31.280> just<00:04:31.460> get<00:04:31.580> sunny<00:04:31.790> day<00:04:31.970> anyway<00:04:32.390> and

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
pincer I just get sunny day anyway and

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.380 
pincer I just get sunny day anyway and
I'm<00:04:32.630> faster<00:04:33.080> than<00:04:33.110> it<00:04:33.380> because<00:04:34.010> I<00:04:34.250> chose<00:04:35.210> at

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
I'm faster than it because I chose at

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.030 
I'm faster than it because I chose at
his<00:04:35.480> base<00:04:35.660> 100<00:04:36.050> speed<00:04:36.260> i<00:04:36.290> think<00:04:36.590> and<00:04:36.800> pincer

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
his base 100 speed i think and pincer

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.290 
his base 100 speed i think and pincer
has<00:04:37.160> base<00:04:37.310> 85<00:04:37.730> and<00:04:37.880> he<00:04:37.940> doesn't<00:04:38.120> have<00:04:38.150> a<00:04:38.270> choice

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
has base 85 and he doesn't have a choice

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.400 
has base 85 and he doesn't have a choice
scarf<00:04:38.660> so<00:04:39.590> pincer<00:04:39.890> will<00:04:40.100> go<00:04:40.340> down<00:04:41.140> alright<00:04:42.140> so

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
still trying to get that attack boost

still trying to get that attack boost
synthesis<00:05:07.610> will<00:05:07.790> do<00:05:07.940> will<00:05:08.750> heal<00:05:09.020> him<00:05:09.230> more

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
synthesis will do will heal him more

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.440 
synthesis will do will heal him more
than<00:05:09.500> usual<00:05:09.800> because<00:05:09.920> of<00:05:10.160> the<00:05:10.280> Sun<00:05:10.580> he<00:05:11.210> won't

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
than usual because of the Sun he won't

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.880 
than usual because of the Sun he won't
be<00:05:11.540> able<00:05:11.660> to<00:05:11.780> use<00:05:11.810> skull<00:05:12.200> because<00:05:12.410> of<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:12.710> Sun

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
be able to use skull because of the Sun

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.380 
be able to use skull because of the Sun
but<00:05:13.040> now<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.220> sunlight<00:05:13.640> is<00:05:13.670> gone<00:05:13.970> it's<00:05:14.300> a

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
but now the sunlight is gone it's a

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.150 
but now the sunlight is gone it's a
trade-off<00:05:14.630> for<00:05:14.750> him<00:05:14.960> because<00:05:15.110> synthesis<00:05:15.980> will

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
trade-off for him because synthesis will

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.300 
trade-off for him because synthesis will
do<00:05:16.280> les<00:05:16.550> vus<00:05:17.510> called<00:05:17.870> will<00:05:18.170> do<00:05:18.320> more<00:05:18.620> so<00:05:19.190> he

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
do les vus called will do more so he

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.640 
do les vus called will do more so he
uses<00:05:19.520> scald<00:05:19.970> and<00:05:20.240> I'm<00:05:20.690> just<00:05:21.350> gonna<00:05:21.470> keep

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
uses scald and I'm just gonna keep

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.860 
uses scald and I'm just gonna keep
meteor<00:05:21.980> mash<00:05:22.250> and<00:05:22.520> he<00:05:22.730> gets<00:05:22.970> he's<00:05:23.540> getting

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
meteor mash and he gets he's getting

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.760 
meteor mash and he gets he's getting
hurt<00:05:24.020> by<00:05:24.170> the<00:05:24.230> toxic<00:05:24.710> um<00:05:26.350> synthesis<00:05:27.350> again<00:05:27.590> but

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
hurt by the toxic um synthesis again but
