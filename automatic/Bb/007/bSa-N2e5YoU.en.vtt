00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
of the right so the move looks better

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.710 
of the right so the move looks better
more<00:01:58.049> natural

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
more natural

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.170 
more natural
or<00:01:59.020> glide<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:01.360> makes<00:02:01.840> it<00:02:02.050> better

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
or glide that makes it better
