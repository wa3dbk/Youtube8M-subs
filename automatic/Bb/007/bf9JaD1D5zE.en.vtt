now<00:00:50.339> hold<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.789> it's<00:00:51.059> turbocharged<00:00:51.899> same

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:52.499 
now hold on it's turbocharged same

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:55.189 
now hold on it's turbocharged same
horsepower<00:00:52.800> 138<00:00:53.609> but<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> 148<00:00:54.719> pound-feet<00:00:55.170> of
