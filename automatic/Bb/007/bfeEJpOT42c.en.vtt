with<00:01:30.119> big-time<00:01:30.930> fighters<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:32.189> just<00:01:32.850> got<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.090> go

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
with big-time fighters I just got to go

with Chavez let me just cut right to the
chase<00:01:35.369> Chavez<00:01:36.360> Jr<00:01:36.390> could<00:01:37.049> possibly<00:01:37.500> kod<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:38.880> I

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
chase Chavez Jr could possibly kod but I

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.910 
chase Chavez Jr could possibly kod but I
think<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:39.869> going<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> decision<00:01:40.530> it

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
think it's going to be a decision it

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.069 
think it's going to be a decision it
might<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:41.579> split<00:01:41.939> might<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.390> unanimous<00:01:42.899> I'm

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
might be split might be unanimous I'm

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.929 
might be split might be unanimous I'm
not<00:01:43.259> quite<00:01:43.530> sure<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:43.829> I'm<00:01:44.280> gonna<00:01:44.490> go<00:01:44.700> for
