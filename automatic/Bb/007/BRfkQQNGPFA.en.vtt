00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.280 
I don't know if it's gonna happen but
it's<00:04:30.180> what<00:04:30.300> it's<00:04:30.450> supposed<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.870> do<00:04:30.990> let's<00:04:31.229> see

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
it's what it's supposed to do let's see

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.850 
it's what it's supposed to do let's see
if<00:04:31.380> we<00:04:31.440> can<00:04:31.560> get<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:31.740> going<00:04:32.990> this<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.139> is<00:04:34.229> Plus

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
if we can get it going this it is Plus

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.930 
if we can get it going this it is Plus
this<00:04:34.889> is<00:04:35.070> just<00:04:35.310> really<00:04:35.490> good<00:04:35.550> against<00:04:35.820> that

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
this is just really good against that

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.430 
this is just really good against that
back<00:04:36.240> ad<00:04:36.419> because<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.750> more<00:04:36.900> you<00:04:37.020> attack<00:04:37.290> him

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
back ad because the more you attack him

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.340 
back ad because the more you attack him
the<00:04:37.560> more<00:04:37.710> damage<00:04:37.979> you<00:04:38.010> do<00:04:38.220> so<00:04:38.639> overall<00:04:38.850> just

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
the more damage you do so overall just

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.120 
the more damage you do so overall just
potentially<00:04:40.350> so<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:40.740> only<00:04:40.890> thing<00:04:41.039> I'm

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
potentially so the only thing I'm

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.890 
potentially so the only thing I'm
worried<00:04:41.370> about<00:04:41.430> is<00:04:41.669> if<00:04:42.510> she<00:04:42.630> keeps<00:04:42.780> sending

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
worried about is if she keeps sending

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.870 
worried about is if she keeps sending
him<00:04:43.110> back<00:04:43.140> the<00:04:43.979> tower<00:04:44.310> keep<00:04:44.580> sending<00:04:44.820> them

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
him back the tower keep sending them

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.159 
him back the tower keep sending them
back<00:04:44.940> and<00:04:45.270> back<00:04:45.390> and<00:04:45.419> back<00:04:45.660> and<00:04:45.720> back<00:04:45.930> and<00:04:45.990> back

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
back and back and back and back and back

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.350 
back and back and back and back and back
forever<00:04:46.669> maybe<00:04:49.160> it<00:04:50.160> like<00:04:50.400> won't<00:04:50.760> do<00:04:51.000> as<00:04:51.180> much

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
forever maybe it like won't do as much

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.670 
forever maybe it like won't do as much
damage<00:04:51.390> because<00:04:51.930> there's<00:04:52.080> not<00:04:52.229> technically

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
damage because there's not technically

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.260 
damage because there's not technically
attacking<00:04:53.100> it<00:04:53.160> like<00:04:53.280> in<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:53.580> row<00:04:53.820> I<00:04:54.060> don't<00:04:54.210> know
