00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.350 
played as a four and co-op actions co-op
mission<00:01:26.619> but<00:01:27.039> we<00:01:27.069> don't<00:01:27.789> have<00:01:27.819> any<00:01:27.940> excitement

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.600 
mission but we don't have any excitement
and<00:01:28.690> now<00:01:29.110> in<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.649> battle<00:01:29.920> mode<00:01:30.009> you<00:01:30.399> got<00:01:30.520> to

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
and now in the battle mode you got to

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.070

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
little bit how those mechanics work so

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.889 
little bit how those mechanics work so
there's<00:02:09.160> nail<00:02:09.399> ok<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.119> this<00:02:10.360> multiplayer

they combine in now in these new

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.430 
they combine in now in these new
configurations<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:03.700> there's<00:03:03.880> no<00:03:04.200> concoct<00:03:05.200> so

configurations so there's no concoct so

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.809 
configurations so there's no concoct so
of<00:03:05.620> course<00:03:05.799> there's<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.220> lot<00:03:06.580> of<00:03:06.610> lots

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
of course there's a lot of lots

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.820 
of course there's a lot of lots
capturing<00:03:07.269> there<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.600> then<00:03:08.080> you<00:03:08.590> know<00:03:08.680> an

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
capturing there and then you know an

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.830 
capturing there and then you know an
interesting<00:03:09.280> point<00:03:09.489> in<00:03:09.700> this<00:03:09.850> game<00:03:09.970> is<00:03:10.360> each

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
interesting point in this game is each

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.410 
interesting point in this game is each
capture<00:03:11.350> host<00:03:11.680> different<00:03:12.100> types<00:03:12.640> of<00:03:13.060> the

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
capture host different types of the

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.900 
capture host different types of the
battle<00:03:13.690> types<00:03:13.870> I<00:03:14.049> mean<00:03:14.410> so<00:03:15.220> there's<00:03:15.459> a<00:03:15.549> four

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
battle types I mean so there's a four

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.820 
battle types I mean so there's a four
different<00:03:16.269> battle<00:03:16.510> types<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:16.930> when<00:03:17.680> it's

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
different battle types and when it's

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.770 
different battle types and when it's
called<00:03:18.010> midi<00:03:18.250> type<00:03:18.549> and<00:03:18.790> keep<00:03:19.299> blood<00:03:19.510> type

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
called midi type and keep blood type

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.210 
called midi type and keep blood type
support<00:03:20.410> type<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.860> also<00:03:21.400> interfere<00:03:21.760> type<00:03:21.970> so

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
support type and also interfere type so

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.410 
support type and also interfere type so
based<00:03:24.220> on<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.459> different<00:03:24.820> type<00:03:24.940> of<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.209> arm

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
media types its give you more and you

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.349 
media types its give you more and you
know<00:03:35.230> like<00:03:35.350> easier<00:03:35.739> to<00:03:36.160> perform<00:03:36.340> em<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:37.269> know

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
know like easier to perform em you know

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.750 
know like easier to perform em you know
and<00:03:37.600> you<00:03:38.049> can<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.440> co-op<00:03:39.100> action<00:03:39.280> it's<00:03:39.579> called

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
and you can a co-op action it's called

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.550 
and you can a co-op action it's called
synchronized<00:03:40.180> dash<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.780> seagull<00:03:41.109> you<00:03:41.320> and

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
synchronized dash the seagull you and

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.530 
synchronized dash the seagull you and
your<00:03:41.769> teammate<00:03:42.730> could<00:03:43.060> attack<00:03:43.299> the<00:03:43.450> opponent

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.990 
your teammate could attack the opponent
from<00:03:43.959> sight<00:03:44.260> at<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.530> same<00:03:44.680> time<00:03:44.890> so<00:03:45.459> you<00:03:45.970> can

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
from sight at the same time so you can

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.099 
from sight at the same time so you can
think<00:03:46.269> about<00:03:46.420> you<00:03:46.630> know<00:03:46.660> how<00:03:46.810> you<00:03:46.870> want<00:03:47.079> to

post it how you want it'll take
advantage<00:03:49.030> in<00:03:49.150> this<00:03:49.209> game<00:03:49.269> and<00:03:49.570> so<00:03:50.380> you<00:03:50.440> can

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
advantage in this game and so you can

same stage so what you of course made a

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.450 
same stage so what you of course made a
lot<00:04:28.360> of<00:04:28.390> Dragon<00:04:29.140> Ball<00:04:29.289> said<00:04:29.530> set<00:04:29.860> games<00:04:30.099> over

the<00:04:30.550> years<00:04:30.789> what<00:04:31.030> do<00:04:31.090> you<00:04:31.120> think<00:04:31.419> it's<00:04:31.599> is<00:04:31.780> key

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:32.529 
the years what do you think it's is key

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:34.739 
the years what do you think it's is key
capturing<00:04:32.859> this<00:04:33.549> this<00:04:33.849> fraction<00:04:34.389> I<00:04:34.449> mean<00:04:34.599> it's

00:04:34.739 --> 00:04:34.749 
capturing this this fraction I mean it's

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:36.689 
capturing this this fraction I mean it's
lent<00:04:35.229> itself<00:04:35.619> so<00:04:35.859> well<00:04:36.069> to<00:04:36.249> a<00:04:36.279> fighting<00:04:36.669> game

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
lent itself so well to a fighting game

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.509 
lent itself so well to a fighting game
but<00:04:37.119> but<00:04:37.539> what<00:04:37.689> do<00:04:37.779> you<00:04:37.809> think<00:04:38.049> is<00:04:38.289> key<00:04:38.829> to<00:04:39.129> sort

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:39.519 
but but what do you think is key to sort

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:41.459 
but but what do you think is key to sort
of<00:04:39.579> making<00:04:39.999> that<00:04:40.239> make<00:04:40.779> it<00:04:40.899> giving<00:04:41.199> it<00:04:41.289> that

00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:41.469 
of making that make it giving it that

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:45.119 
of making that make it giving it that

game<00:05:10.539> too<00:05:10.689> we're<00:05:11.319> watching<00:05:11.769> for<00:05:12.249> different

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
games here and I think in common with

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.329 
games here and I think in common with
them<00:05:15.249> is<00:05:15.459> that<00:05:15.699> they<00:05:16.269> show<00:05:16.539> that<00:05:17.309> you<00:05:18.309> are

00:05:18.329 --> 00:05:18.339 
them is that they show that you are

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:20.639 
them is that they show that you are
really<00:05:18.609> taking<00:05:18.879> a<00:05:19.179> fan<00:05:19.449> service<00:05:19.689> seriously
