00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.040
 still at the music fair in one 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:15.309
 something louder hall changed 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.920
 I stand here beside old well-known and 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.980
 Although we have the manufacturer on here 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.410
 caron manufactory very nice cartons 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.070
 very nice new instruments to the 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:30.580
 have come here just like that 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.940
 stylish on the things on it who 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.500
 maybe the evolution caron of that 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.660
 I think Christmas was still around 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.520
 who knows her has been lucky times 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.070
 They were quickly gone who the 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.539
 knows who knows that there are quite a few 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.320
 nice little things are on the man 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.239
 can pay attention 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.010
 they're all in the new ones, too 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.960
 cartons win the quasi in series 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.949
 but are available to the details 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.629
 you are welcome 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.770
 yes hello hi session right here our 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.649
 two new models 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.649
 we have the fine name vision sp 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.470
 come in at the sp stands for sound 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.240
 chambers and pitch converter what's up 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.430
 we could show right now 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.900
 Here you can see the pitch converter of 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.240
 bitkom words has the property that 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.340
 I mean what sound vision can do that 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.670
 Depending on how big the scarf is 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.720
 is also the bass changes 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.750
 fundamentally smaller the sound hole 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.910
 destructive or bass just when you're in 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.080
 a small band plays along with 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.550
 a bassist and not on the 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.800
 same or random at the same level 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.480
 what is not easy with this patch 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.980
 is a bit high and since yet 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.800
 just change my bass frequency 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.150
 is just pretty handy in the game 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.010
 really our evolution the last 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.570
 limited edition was as you say 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.340
 ratzfatz sold out and that was also 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.290
 the main reason why we here this 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.000
 two new models now on the 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.100
 Frankfurt Music Fair present 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.350
 10 from now you get in part 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.670
 our range differs from ours 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.860
 standard instruments is that we are here 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.630
 on the front surface as 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.550
 middle layer use a beech 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.990
 we simply get one 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.760
 to be deeper ground that is to say straight 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.070
 People over the deep bass plankton 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.200
 you are certainly right with the model 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.970
 done 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.020
 just the clap corners as with all 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.619
 Of course, our models are as well 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.459
 there 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.860
 your favorite function is 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.739
 the sound, of course, we necessarily 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.360
 also wanted to pack in and what 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.120
 now just when the model is if 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.040
 but you still want more klenk sounds 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:31.450
 have to give to the classic game 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:33.280
 I just left these sound chambers here 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.200
 on the left and on the right just mean 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.860
 my rhythm more sonic 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.739
 to allow variations 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.510
 That sounds great and because the guys 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.670
 Yes, it would be so super spontaneous 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.989
 I just say a degree 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.660
 little because you have her one 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.829
 Nice plant built and then would 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.680
 I say simply doing us a times 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.530
 Bit out and what you hear now 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.819
 is also a very fine thing 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:03.660
 So that's good on a system 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:06.760
 Sounds gives new business cards of pure 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.230
 the whole thing looks like it's over 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.329
 the last year a really common 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.700
 with the brothers rumberger am chiemsee 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:15.340
 they are a very fine little one 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.680
 microphone forge and in principle that is 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.540
 a small interface through one 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.620
 active chorus has gone through this quietly 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.630
 means what we just allow 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.370
 wanted is so is a plug and play 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.250
 character that means so well here 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.700
 that everything is flat everything is on 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.470
 zero 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.780
 we just have this microphone in 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.730
 our customers directly into with 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.069
 directly into the system without having much 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.150
 been tuned around so that's the reason 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.920
 whether one has of course then the 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.299
 possibilities its own taste 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.340
 to set the medium but was us 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.889
 important that just for not professionals 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.310
 from time to time take off this garonne 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.150
 want to find a simple solution 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.620
 yes and I think it's pretty nice 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.660
 We have decided to go 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.340
 the beautiful clou is the thing it is 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.019
 not only good as a cajon microphone 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.639
 but as you can see from here we 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.730
 have a pretty bassdrum stand 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:02.349
 and though that may be strange 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.690
 sounds like a cook and we'll go here 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.519
 Metal hearts could beat faster because 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.799
 just said that in tokyo built there 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.349
 is who conjures such a nice click 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.910
 get into this bass drum over the patch 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.109
 Age of the built-in is one can 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.389
 All very well in the easy 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.880
 bassdrum just put the iq down 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.400
 get rid off get started and finished 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.780
 that actually works and look 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.250
 let's just say that over with it 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.960
 coming 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.880
 it just puts the microphone down and 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.630
 then let's have a look here 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.630
 the plant is coming
