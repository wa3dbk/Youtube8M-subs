he'll stay inside the inside and the
wall<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.659> base<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:32.009> well<00:01:32.189> there's<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.460> little

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
wall the base so well there's a little

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.020

generate<00:01:46.140> as<00:01:46.380> much<00:01:46.560> power<00:01:46.860> or<00:01:47.310> we<00:01:47.729> could<00:01:47.970> be

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
generate as much power or we could be

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.389

when they killing troop a stop for a

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.160 
second and attack another troop because
I<00:01:53.130> know<00:01:53.280> it's<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> fan<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.700> towels<00:01:53.970> when<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.020> is

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
I know it's a fan of towels when this is

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.899 
I know it's a fan of towels when this is
kind<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.530> troop<00:01:55.950> there<00:01:56.130> go<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.490> next<00:01:56.579> Riven

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
kind of troop there go to the next Riven

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:57.980 
kind of troop there go to the next Riven
go<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.119> next<00:01:57.299> troop<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:57.810> almost

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
go to next troop and it's almost

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.050 
go to next troop and it's almost
impossible<00:01:58.439> because<00:01:59.280> if<00:01:59.549> you're<00:01:59.700> maxed<00:01:59.969> out

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
impossible because if you're maxed out

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.730 
impossible because if you're maxed out
inferno<00:02:00.360> towers<00:02:00.630> they'll<00:02:01.049> take<00:02:01.320> down<00:02:01.560> your

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
inferno towers they'll take down your

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.550 
inferno towers they'll take down your
troops<00:02:02.009> really<00:02:02.549> fast<00:02:02.930> so<00:02:03.930> we're<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.439> there's

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
troops really fast so we're and there's

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.649 
troops really fast so we're and there's
new<00:02:04.740> update<00:02:04.979> as<00:02:05.100> well<00:02:05.280> troops<00:02:05.969> work<00:02:06.360> together

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
new update as well troops work together

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.800 
new update as well troops work together
to<00:02:07.079> break<00:02:07.409> through<00:02:07.740> smaller<00:02:08.310> wall<00:02:08.640> pieces<00:02:08.970> so

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
to break through smaller wall pieces so

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.080 
to break through smaller wall pieces so
for<00:02:10.050> example<00:02:10.140> if<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.860> put<00:02:11.160> down<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.730> lot<00:02:12.060> of

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
for example if you put down a lot of

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
for example if you put down a lot of
barbarians<00:02:12.780> or

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
barbarians or

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.110 
barbarians or
arches<00:02:13.590> instead<00:02:14.220> I'm<00:02:14.370> going<00:02:14.520> for<00:02:14.790> different

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
arches instead I'm going for different

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.540 
arches instead I'm going for different
walls<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.840> should<00:02:16.170> attack<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.860> same<00:02:17.070> mold<00:02:17.370> so

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
walls it should attack the same mold so

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.370 
walls it should attack the same mold so
you'll<00:02:17.700> take<00:02:17.940> down<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.180> walls<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.690> lot<00:02:18.900> faster

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
you'll take down the walls a lot faster

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.110 
you'll take down the walls a lot faster
so<00:02:19.890> that's<00:02:20.010> one<00:02:20.220> good<00:02:20.370> update<00:02:20.550> they<00:02:21.000> have
