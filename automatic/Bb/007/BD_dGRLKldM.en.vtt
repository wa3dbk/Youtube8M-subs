00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:19.080
 different modes once the battle 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:21.090
 Mode in the duel mode and it's extreme 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.400
 unstable meester already five times 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.720
 record crashed while although it 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.949
 actually quite funny I have 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.289
 now only difficult despite apparently 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.690
 the last time with this knight castle mod 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.200

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.760
 flight ticket music but I had to 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.809
 Exhibit because gema and so I will 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.510
 have no trouble with the people 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.309
 These fucking assholes have something like that 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.050
 as the gema no idea what 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.030
 I do not need something like that 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.629
 Well, I do not want it now 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.550
 to discuss 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.670
 curse of the caribbean and so on that is 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:06.390
 the setting in the two ships 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.710
 this huge chair may 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.180
 Can you show it somewhere? 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.350
 Here you do not see that is the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.860
 probably on the other side 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.860
 better to see 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:23.720
 after the lazy sow the comenius school 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:38.100
 come here that pistol you can me 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:48.049
 Nothing like the protection of you 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:50.159
 Defense does not strengthen davy jones and so 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:56.189
 Jack sparrow live through somewhere 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:57.060
 the region let me but I do not know 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:05.959
 I do not think so now 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:11.190
 combines have here so now agreed 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:13.860
 Zack Zack Zack Zack Zack Zack Zack is 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.900
 David Jones and there is one too 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.069
 pistole here I show you once and one 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.569
 court in reste troops quickly through 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.349
 before the recording crashes again 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.349
 sorry but that must be 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.920
 a pistol you have ten shot must 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.730
 after each shot you can reload one time 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.690
 could think that has the coalition 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.010
 had gone out fast but the enemies 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.780
 the drop male ammo as you can see here 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.069
 now looks every ten bullet so go 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.800
 you do not hurry because one does 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:47.769
 a lot of harm with the link and 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.060
 the crazy do not meet they want like 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.110
 The guy just right next to it 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.000
 shot and again next to it 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:59.019
 shot 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:01.870
 and the power , it shows that everything 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.940
 every attack is done here by the one 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:13.590
 I'm supposed to make ten people here again 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:17.319
 Shot hit 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:22.060
 nor was the weapon I received 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:27.910
 better now but you can me 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:31.209

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.810

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:39.790
 we were better and 6 problems again 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.109
 I think there's no special one here 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.900
 skills or something could be that 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.510
 the damage does but that was it 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.890
 already 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.660
 extremism here I can again 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.049

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.930

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.940

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.930

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:34.380

 There is no interesting we can 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.890
 try the number because of a 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:44.270
