back hand like that and the right way to

back hand like that and the right way to
do<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.680> is<00:02:23.950> actually<00:02:24.130> not<00:02:24.460> to<00:02:24.610> just<00:02:24.820> move<00:02:25.150> the

do it is actually not to just move the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.510 
do it is actually not to just move the
glove<00:02:25.570> because<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:26.680> hand<00:02:26.920> alone<00:02:27.220> is<00:02:27.400> not

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
glove because the hand alone is not
