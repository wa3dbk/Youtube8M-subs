00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 welcome back reviews hd friends for 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.980
 this nightlife we are going to do 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.860
 review of earphones 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:12.450
 phillips and sci 8500 a pair of headphones 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.360
 which I recently purchased in 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.250
 replacement of other headphones and so I have 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.070
 decided to share mine with you 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.449
 feelings about this model 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.099
 I also bought another model of the 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.720
 philips earphones leshi 9000 ma 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.840
 I'll show them in another video today 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.850
 let's focus on this 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.370
 this we start by saying that the model is 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.649
 presented in this pack that a 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.719
 my opinion is a little penalized already since 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.399
 principle because the headphones came 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.960
 set in here 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:48.809
 and it is a bit difficult to remove the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.809
 it was necessary to remove them by pulling the thread 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.969
 and and it is a bit dangerous because like 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.980
 see here this thread is enough 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.930
 thin and is already at risk from the first 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.840
 first moment to compromise them anyway 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.130
 maybe we say so a tip for 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.869
 phillips concerning the next ones 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.330
 packages that will go to draw for 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.119
 overcome this problem anyway 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.770
 let's start first of all from the packaging 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.080
 very compact package there is nothing 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.140
 until in here as you see it is not there 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.210
 nothing here that are shown there 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.189
 some 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.150
 so let's say education for use 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.259
 then we have three different types of 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.940
 headphones and earphones that you can 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:39.899
 insert are all gel so not 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.940
 we have sponge headphones 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.670
 are three types one is already inserted 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.320
 inside the real headphones 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.110
 as you see here and this is a measure 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.180
 average we have a slightly more measure 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.590
 large and a bit more 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.920
 small headphones come with one 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.440
 quite remarkable style promises the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.759
 design with this back in 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.679
 metal is very beautiful to see also the 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.979
 headphones in and of itself in the here 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:13.319
 under the headset I am in this white 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.680
 he with this shiny white plastic e 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.319
 they are great to see that gives a lot 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.569
 read to hold but obviously 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.910
 the opposite was not expected 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.560
 one of the faults of these headphones is 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.450
 first of all the thread that already like 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.090
 you see it's getting a little intertwined but 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.019
 however that is a classic of almost 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.140
 all earphones 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.239
 as you can see there is one more headset 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.070
 short of the other this because it was 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.920
 adopted a solution that allows 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.019
 connect headphones by moving infilo 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.070
 on the back then doing the 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.959
 turn around your shoulders not 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.049
 taking it in front not to have it done 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.150
 dangle being molded as best as possible 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.010
 he believes 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.409
 this is something that I don't 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.689
 I like it anyway I don't know 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.730
 tell you if it will give me problems in the next 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:02.689
 five or six months, however, we will see it in 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.489
 followed by a three and a half jack connector 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.500
 standard so all is fine 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.159
 earphones with sorry to all 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.849
 smartphone with all computers is not there 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:17.000
 an adapter for 6 mm, but oh well it is 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:20.540
 one is a plus that few offer 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.239
 the price of these headphones is around 14 euros 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.290
 so I tried a good deal 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:29.659
 from a sound point of view and I am 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:33.290
 then discreet of the headphones for a 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:35.389
 normal listening to any music 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.549
 generally they can certainly go well 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.829
 as written here on the box there 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.959
 they are the ex - low ex- trambus that though 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.180
 don't feel that much with a 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.670
 epolysis of the standard ones 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.989
 extrapass feel more the 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.019
 low perhaps compared to others 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:55.010
 purchased headphones has really low 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.840
 price then at 5 to 10 euros maximum yes 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.629
 they feel more but it is nothing like that 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.099
 exceptional the bass sounds are good 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.109
 quite possibly present in others 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.299
 headphones feel the most is that 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.889
 a flaw because they go to cover the 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.109
 the rest of the sounds here seem to me instead 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:11.150
 very balanced sound so for a 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:13.760
 I listen to any kind you can 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.599
 absolutely rest assured 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.639
 I promote these headphones with 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:21.400
 let's say a 7 report card for how much 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.510
 concerns the quality of the audio because 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.520
 obviously compared to earphones 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.599
 these professional headphones are not the 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.639
 maximum 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.409
 if I have to confront others instead 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.960
 models in the same price range 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:36.979
 we can absolutely go to a 9 in 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:40.310
 report card because the frequency of 6 23 e 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:43.460
 half hearts are 23 thousand and a half then 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.650
 earth are absolutely excellent for both 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.199
 appreciate the bass on both frequencies 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:52.040
 high then headphones here hover these 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:53.690
 phillips c8 c8500 absolutely 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.120
 recommended for those who want one 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.730
 headphone from people exaggerated and that 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.830
 I listen to any kind of good 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.900
 so let's see music in tones 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.900
