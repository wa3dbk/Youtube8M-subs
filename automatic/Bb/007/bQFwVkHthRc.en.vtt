00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
called Simon del Monte and it is

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.350 
called Simon del Monte and it is
confusing<00:00:35.070> because<00:00:35.520> they<00:00:35.610> keep<00:00:35.820> changing<00:00:36.090> his

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
first name in the gates I think a

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.250 
first name in the gates I think a

when<00:02:00.670> I<00:02:00.759> was<00:02:00.910> a<00:02:00.940> kid<00:02:01.119> because<00:02:01.300> my<00:02:01.450> mum<00:02:01.810> would

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
when I was a kid because my mum would
