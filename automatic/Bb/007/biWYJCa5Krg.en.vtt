00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.710
 we go 

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:18.870
 the lie when we are going to win 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.039
 from this bar 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:26.279
 and do not see 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.279
 the final result is how are you 3 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:38.100
 and I know I'm going to do them in these two 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:42.870
 to see the process I already apply 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.500
 Two layers of white enamel active vial 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.309
 and let you dry well then let's 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:54.690
 need a tape can be any 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.750
 tape and let's cut with the scissors 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.690
 a band-aid of the measure that you 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.289
 want to do the little part of the middle of 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.289
 the flag 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:10.150
 in this case I'm going to use an average 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:13.570
 wide for the big toe and we're going to 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:17.640
 hit here in the middle where you 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:22.640
 they want the little white piece to go 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.640
 and the same thing we're going to do on the other finger 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:38.300
 once we have it stuck we are going to 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.300
 go with the celestial sky blue glaze 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.450
 and we're just going to paint because 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.210
 total is the ribbon 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.210
 let's paint on the top 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.360
 and we are going to paint also in the part of 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.360
 down 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.929
 the same thing we do with the other finger 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.620
 this polish really boast me 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:34.040
 amazement because it's pretty opaque in 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.480
 one hand achieved 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.120
 a 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.650
 a good finish but good if you 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.890
 they have some other celestial one that does not have 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.580
 so good finish you can give two hands 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.760
 before it dries I'm going to remove 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:53.159
 the band 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.159
 elastic is this median of chiringa 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.720
 it happens like me 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.480
 retire 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.480
 the excess 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.160
 with a cotonete 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.800
 but it's mostly for them to see the 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.800
 effect as it succeeds 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:35.430
 let's let it dry once it's 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.430
 dry with transparent glaze let's 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.080
 pass it over 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:02.310
 and we are going to take a stick 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:06.770
 I'm going to dip the tip in the enamel 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.680
 transparent and I will take a strass 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:13.250
 golden color and I'll apply it in the 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:17.239
 half of the nail simulating being the solcito 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.900
 of the Argentine flag the same thing I'm going to 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.660
 do with this other 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:26.520
 in these extras is so they come 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:29.780
 they can get almost anywhere today 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.949
 They are in golden color and we seal 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.949
 again so that it does not come out 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:42.550
 with transparent enamel if you do not 

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:45.550
 they have the enamel at hand right now 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.129
 can also use another option is a 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.599
 yellow enamel or rather golden I would say 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:51.190
 me because the Argentine flag is average 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.850
 a gold color 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:59.950
 or mix these two and just do 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:01.780
 with a stick and paint the solcito instead 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.060
 to apply it extras but good 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.910
 it seemed that the idea of 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:11.980
 apply in strass 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.980
 this is the final result 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:22.259
 I hope you liked it and well 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:24.719
 It seemed like a nice option to be able to 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:27.839
 encourage our team in this global 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:28.830
 that is going to be done in that already 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:31.020
 is actually doing in 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:35.360
 Brazil-2014 if they want the week 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.360
 which is already playing our team 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:41.139
 Argentina 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.539
 well that's all for now I leave them and 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:47.340
 see you in the next video very many 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.340
 thanks for watching and sharing
