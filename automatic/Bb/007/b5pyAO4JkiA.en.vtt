00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Hey, everyone is welcome to the 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.259
 teams to start row 15 and well 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.540
 we started with the 352 formation that stops 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.580
 I'm going to be the best in the game I've been 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.920
 testing the demo and I think with 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.960
 three fast power plants we will be able to 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.449
 solve all problems in defense 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.490
 and two fast and forward ends 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.289
 fast so let's choose this 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.960
 training and we go with the first player 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.900
 for me the most important thing a goalkeeper are 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.300
 the reflections and that ochoa with these 86 yo 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.980
 I think it will perfectly fulfill what 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.770
 that scared me a little bit maybe in his 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.140
 height is 185 and I do not know if you can 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.850
 penalize a little but to be our 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.260
 first team for me eight is a 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.850
 very good alternative 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.789
 our first plant is going to be bar and 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.770
 in the center of 1352 is fundamental 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.360
 have the central fast and barán will be 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.430
 the fastest of the three so what 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.410
 let's fix here on your right is going to 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.449
 have to mussachio a slower central 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.699
 but with better positioning that vary 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.590
 so we're going to have it there and the last 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.570
 of our plants is the contribution that 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.640
 this year has hit a huge rush and 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.470
 has an authentic graffiti so what 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.570
 let's set here in the line of 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.210
 defensive midfielders I like 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.310
 one more defensive and the other more offensive 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.710
 so thiago is our option for 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.870
 defend and to attack we are going to have to 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.670
 beñat that thanks to his great step and his 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.710
 great shot as it will arrive in second 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.020
 line and it will give us many chances to 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.360
 goal here I have had many doubts since 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.310
 I do not know if deulofeu is going to be very expensive 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.680
 so let's make sure and let's put 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.540
 álex vidal that is very fast and I think that 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.240
 is going to have four skills and that's a 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.940
 puntazo and here I have also had many 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.410
 doubts because I think that at the beginning 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.509
 of the game is going to be very expensive so 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.330
 let's also insure and let's put 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.850
 a paco montañés that has 86 rhythm and 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.670
 I think they will also put 4 skills 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.680
 so that kicks our midfielder 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.390
 offensive is the player who is going to link 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.430
 all the attack moves is going to be 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.680
 muniáin that this year has a rhythm 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.479
 incredible has an incredible dribble 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.850
 he has an incredible has and a pass 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.130
 amazing so he has received an improvement 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.619
 spectacular and we're going to have it there yes or 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.660
 yes and we start with the team sauce 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.119
 the front centers we have for the 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.730
 right part a player that year 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.610
 last we marveled at all that little girl 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.140
 with that shooting power 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.180
 and I think this year will be equal 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.849
 even better so we're going to have it 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.310
 yes or yes and finally we have Rodrigo 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.590
 that in fifa 13 already amazed us and if 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.110
 fifa 15 looks like fifa 13 it goes to 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.150
 be a real show this is 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.680
