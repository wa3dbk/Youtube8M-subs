the timber construction a retail store

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.939 
the timber construction a retail store
as<00:00:22.710> he<00:00:23.580> stays<00:00:23.850> in<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.420> steel<00:00:25.050> or<00:00:25.199> concrete<00:00:25.470> store

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
as he stays in a steel or concrete store

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.089 
as he stays in a steel or concrete store
so<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.000> definitely<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.750> better<00:00:28.019> benefit<00:00:28.500> for

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
so it is definitely a better benefit for

metres<00:00:47.070> timber<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.789> more<00:00:48.210> competitive<00:00:48.750> if<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
metres timber is more competitive if the

span is wider the strength of the timber
is<00:00:53.539> much<00:00:54.539> better<00:00:54.750> than<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.350> heavier<00:00:55.800> material

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
is much better than a heavier material

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.549 
is much better than a heavier material
like<00:00:56.430> steel<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.300> have<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.629> use<00:00:58.079> less

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
like steel so you have to use less

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.389

Frankfurt at the beginning of the
hardest<00:01:25.680> challenge<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.759> project<00:01:27.180> always

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
hardest challenge of the project always

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.660 
hardest challenge of the project always
if<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.290> are<00:01:28.350> doing<00:01:28.530> such<00:01:29.070> things<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.490> first

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
if you are doing such things the first

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.090 
if you are doing such things the first
time<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.840> need<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.110> test<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.710> therefore

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
time you need to test it and therefore

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.940 
time you need to test it and therefore
we<00:01:32.280> went<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.180> university<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:33.990> did<00:01:34.710> some

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
we went to university and did some

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.460 
we went to university and did some
testing<00:01:35.490> start<00:01:35.820> our<00:01:35.939> testings<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
testing start our testings and the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.940 
testing start our testings and the
result<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.939> testing<00:01:39.329> was<00:01:40.110> much<00:01:40.710> much

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
result of the testing was much much

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.620 
result of the testing was much much
better<00:01:41.159> than<00:01:41.310> expected

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
better than expected

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.530 
better than expected
timber<00:01:43.020> or<00:01:43.350> cleanliness<00:01:43.680> is<00:01:44.220> much<00:01:44.540> cost

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
timber or cleanliness is much cost

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.330 
timber or cleanliness is much cost
effective<00:01:45.990> than<00:01:46.350> steel<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.070> there<00:01:47.220> are

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
effective than steel so there are

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.760 
effective than steel so there are
several<00:01:47.610> several<00:01:48.060> effects<00:01:48.570> which<00:01:49.049> make<00:01:49.530> a

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
several several effects which make a

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.940 
several several effects which make a
timber<00:01:50.159> more<00:01:50.460> interesting<00:01:50.939> than<00:01:51.649> steel<00:01:52.649> or

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
timber more interesting than steel or

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.300 
timber more interesting than steel or
concrete<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.899> shape<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.799> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
concrete it is the shape it is the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.940 
concrete it is the shape it is the
suspend<00:01:56.820> figure<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.390> span<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.899> better<00:01:58.680> for

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
suspend figure the span is better for

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.030 
suspend figure the span is better for
the<00:01:59.009> timber<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.520> the<00:02:00.390> third<00:02:00.630> thing<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.890> it

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
the timber and the third thing is if it

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.580 
the timber and the third thing is if it
is<00:02:02.100> required<00:02:02.610> architectural<00:02:03.090> protection

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
is required architectural protection

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.029 
is required architectural protection
these<00:02:04.890> are<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.189> three<00:02:05.820> reasons<00:02:06.600> using<00:02:07.140> timber

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
these are the three reasons using timber

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:19.530 
these are the three reasons using timber
of<00:02:08.220> food<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:09.020> our<00:02:10.020> buildings
