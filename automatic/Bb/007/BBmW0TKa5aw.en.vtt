00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:09.789 
so this is a unique product from solar

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:12.049 
so this is a unique product from solar
it's<00:00:10.150> called<00:00:10.959> the<00:00:11.049> up-and-down<00:00:11.379> mix

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
it's called the up-and-down mix

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.419 
it's called the up-and-down mix
absolutely<00:00:13.059> fantastic<00:00:13.540> I'm<00:00:13.690> using<00:00:13.900> it<00:00:14.139> today

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
absolutely fantastic I'm using it today

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.640 
absolutely fantastic I'm using it today
in<00:00:15.429> conjunction<00:00:15.700> with<00:00:16.059> Zig<00:00:16.390> rigs<00:00:16.630> but<00:00:17.110> what<00:00:17.560> it

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:17.650 
in conjunction with Zig rigs but what it

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.609 
in conjunction with Zig rigs but what it
is<00:00:17.800> is<00:00:18.039> an<00:00:18.610> incredibly<00:00:19.270> active<00:00:19.619> groundbait

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
is is an incredibly active groundbait

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.769 
is is an incredibly active groundbait
some<00:00:21.369> of<00:00:21.490> the<00:00:21.580> ingredients<00:00:21.730> are<00:00:22.449> much<00:00:22.630> more

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
some of the ingredients are much more

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.269 
some of the ingredients are much more
buoyant<00:00:23.199> than<00:00:23.260> others<00:00:23.650> you'll<00:00:23.859> find<00:00:24.130> them

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
buoyant than others you'll find them

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:25.740 
buoyant than others you'll find them
coming<00:00:24.550> up<00:00:24.699> in<00:00:24.849> the<00:00:24.939> water<00:00:25.119> column<00:00:25.390> and<00:00:25.660> then

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
coming up in the water column and then

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.140 
coming up in the water column and then
coming<00:00:26.050> back<00:00:26.080> down<00:00:26.230> again<00:00:26.710> so<00:00:27.250> on<00:00:27.519> waters

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
coming back down again so on waters

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.089 
coming back down again so on waters
where<00:00:28.449> you're<00:00:29.050> trying<00:00:29.289> to<00:00:29.439> draw<00:00:29.679> the<00:00:29.740> fish

down in the water column all these very

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.560 
down in the water column all these very
heavily<00:00:33.129> stopped<00:00:33.550> waters<00:00:34.030> it<00:00:34.269> works

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
heavily stopped waters it works

creating all kinds of activity in the
swim<00:00:44.250> as<00:00:45.250> I'm<00:00:45.489> doing<00:00:45.850> today<00:00:46.000> you<00:00:46.180> can<00:00:46.540> put<00:00:46.720> it

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
swim as I'm doing today you can put it

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.500 
swim as I'm doing today you can put it
in<00:00:46.900> a<00:00:46.989> PVA<00:00:47.440> stocking<00:00:48.070> or<00:00:48.309> even<00:00:48.790> in<00:00:48.909> a<00:00:49.000> solid<00:00:49.330> bag

in a PVA stocking or even in a solid bag
but<00:00:49.839> I'm<00:00:49.989> using<00:00:50.199> it<00:00:50.409> in<00:00:50.440> a<00:00:50.530> stocking<00:00:50.949> today<00:00:51.250> on

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
but I'm using it in a stocking today on

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.670 
but I'm using it in a stocking today on
a<00:00:51.519> quick-change<00:00:52.059> swivel<00:00:52.839> in<00:00:53.110> conjunction

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
a quick-change swivel in conjunction

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.740 
a quick-change swivel in conjunction
with<00:00:53.890> zig<00:00:54.280> rig<00:00:54.489> so<00:00:54.879> to<00:00:54.970> use<00:00:55.180> the<00:00:55.360> up-and-down

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
with zig rig so to use the up-and-down

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.829 
with zig rig so to use the up-and-down
mix<00:00:56.260> you<00:00:56.920> can<00:00:57.100> either<00:00:57.280> use<00:00:57.549> it<00:00:57.580> dry<00:00:58.030> and<00:00:58.390> that

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
mix you can either use it dry and that

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.140 
mix you can either use it dry and that
creates<00:00:59.260> huge<00:00:59.920> amounts<00:01:00.309> of<00:01:00.369> activity<00:01:00.939> in<00:01:01.030> the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
creates huge amounts of activity in the

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.880 
creates huge amounts of activity in the
swim<00:01:01.360> it<00:01:01.540> will<00:01:01.659> literally<00:01:02.019> explode<00:01:02.140> up<00:01:02.710> off

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
swim it will literally explode up off

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.620 
swim it will literally explode up off
the<00:01:03.070> bottom<00:01:03.430> you<00:01:04.210> can<00:01:04.449> then<00:01:04.830> mix<00:01:05.830> it<00:01:06.390> with<00:01:07.390> the

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
the bottom you can then mix it with the

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.840 
the bottom you can then mix it with the
with<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.590> liquid<00:01:08.950> that<00:01:09.070> comes<00:01:09.280> in<00:01:09.579> the<00:01:09.700> bag

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
with the liquid that comes in the bag

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.300 
with the liquid that comes in the bag
with<00:01:10.270> this<00:01:10.450> up<00:01:10.630> with<00:01:10.899> dolphin<00:01:11.259> down<00:01:11.500> mix<00:01:11.770> that

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
with this up with dolphin down mix that

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.940 
with this up with dolphin down mix that
will<00:01:12.429> actually<00:01:12.579> make<00:01:13.000> it<00:01:13.170> sink<00:01:14.170> so<00:01:14.409> if<00:01:14.500> you<00:01:14.649> mix

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
will actually make it sink so if you mix

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.649 
will actually make it sink so if you mix
it<00:01:15.070> up<00:01:15.159> together<00:01:15.369> to<00:01:15.789> create<00:01:16.090> a<00:01:16.119> groundbait

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
it up together to create a groundbait

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.319 
it up together to create a groundbait
and<00:01:16.689> boil<00:01:17.049> it<00:01:17.079> up<00:01:17.380> it<00:01:17.859> will<00:01:18.070> sink<00:01:18.399> down<00:01:18.460> if<00:01:19.090> you

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
and boil it up it will sink down if you

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.989 
and boil it up it will sink down if you
mix<00:01:19.630> it<00:01:19.810> with<00:01:19.990> water<00:01:20.249> then<00:01:21.249> it<00:01:21.579> will<00:01:21.820> actually

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:21.999 
mix it with water then it will actually

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:24.810 
mix it with water then it will actually
float<00:01:22.600> somewhat<00:01:23.079> so<00:01:23.590> mixing<00:01:24.249> it<00:01:24.399> around<00:01:24.520> a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
float somewhat so mixing it around a

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.429 
float somewhat so mixing it around a
method<00:01:25.179> feeder<00:01:25.420> it's<00:01:25.689> going<00:01:25.869> to<00:01:25.929> explode<00:01:26.409> up

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
method feeder it's going to explode up

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.770 
method feeder it's going to explode up
from<00:01:26.920> that<00:01:27.039> method<00:01:27.429> feeder<00:01:27.670> cage<00:01:27.999> to<00:01:28.539> create
