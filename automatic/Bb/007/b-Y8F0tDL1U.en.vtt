00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.849
 climate change 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.139
 I went

 but because 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:58.589
 I am happy that I came as a cyclist 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:01.589
 great atmosphere the weaver wants you to work and that affects 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.840
 I am sure most

 making out 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:07.129
 to work 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:08.279
 in Spain 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:10.529

 horticulture completely separate 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.560
 stand on it 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:26.469
 here you can see that i also have another example 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.939
 also look for new things 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:32.189
 that was 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:34.969
 2 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:37.849
 anyway what is that for 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.209

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.279
 colors 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:44.279
 who drowned in the incident 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:47.079
 do you agree 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.230
 the 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.459
 camp 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:50.979
 I can 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:54.209
 turn away the traps in a wardrobe with ropes 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.619
 that is also important 

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:01.619
 but you have and you come here the review here 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.450
 different generally do it concerns me 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.819
 actually I like it 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.819
 wait 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.199
 a fairly small number of markets 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.400
 it's alright 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.569
 it's a weird kind 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:39.069
 to go 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.029
 always 

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:43.319
 they must create or 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.139
 I notice that I get continuity 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.160
 there the tub has all day coming all day long 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.550
 we have to move forward 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.110
 I have to do something with that 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.169
 so wait 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.169
 whoever wants the old room 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.509
