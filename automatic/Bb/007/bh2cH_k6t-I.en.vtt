00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
line form of a figure and then what you

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.790 
line form of a figure and then what you
do<00:01:46.090> once<00:01:46.300> you<00:01:46.509> have<00:01:46.540> this<00:01:46.930> figure<00:01:47.259> then<00:01:47.770> you

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
do once you have this figure then you

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.130 
do once you have this figure then you
place<00:01:48.369> a<00:01:48.400> piece<00:01:48.790> of<00:01:49.210> tracing<00:01:49.420> paper<00:01:49.600> over<00:01:50.110> it

place a piece of tracing paper over it

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.040 
place a piece of tracing paper over it
and<00:01:50.530> you<00:01:51.460> create<00:01:51.850> your<00:01:51.970> garment<00:01:52.509> on<00:01:52.630> top<00:01:52.899> of

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
and you create your garment on top of

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.900 
and you create your garment on top of
the<00:01:53.140> figure<00:01:53.380> so<00:01:54.160> I<00:01:54.399> will<00:01:54.580> be<00:01:54.700> demonstrating

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
the figure so I will be demonstrating

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.420 
the figure so I will be demonstrating
how<00:01:55.450> I<00:01:55.570> do<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:56.050> and<00:01:56.320> then<00:01:56.440> you<00:01:56.649> can<00:01:56.830> transfer

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
how I do that and then you can transfer

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.240 
how I do that and then you can transfer
that<00:01:57.460> drawing<00:01:57.910> onto<00:01:58.570> your<00:01:59.080> onto<00:01:59.830> your<00:01:59.950> collage

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
that drawing onto your onto your collage

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.050 
that drawing onto your onto your collage
piece<00:02:00.640> we<00:02:00.880> work<00:02:01.060> from<00:02:01.360> there<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.160> and<00:02:03.160> there's

piece we work from there and and there's

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.880 
piece we work from there and and there's
a<00:02:04.149> couple<00:02:04.330> other<00:02:04.570> videos<00:02:05.080> where<00:02:05.380> I'll<00:02:05.649> be

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
a couple other videos where I'll be

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.710 
a couple other videos where I'll be
working<00:02:06.340> with<00:02:06.369> different<00:02:06.640> strips<00:02:07.210> of<00:02:07.479> fabric

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
working with different strips of fabric

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.770 
working with different strips of fabric
and<00:02:08.320> this<00:02:09.160> is<00:02:09.369> pretty<00:02:09.670> much<00:02:09.789> to<00:02:10.239> either<00:02:10.420> come

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
and this is pretty much to either come

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.430 
and this is pretty much to either come
up<00:02:10.810> with<00:02:11.080> like<00:02:11.260> different<00:02:12.100> orders<00:02:13.320> for<00:02:14.320> the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
up with like different orders for the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.580 
up with like different orders for the
pieces<00:02:14.890> or<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:15.730> can<00:02:15.940> incorporate<00:02:16.870> them<00:02:17.350> into

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
pieces or you can incorporate them into

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.050 
pieces or you can incorporate them into
your<00:02:17.890> into<00:02:18.430> your<00:02:18.550> piece<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:20.550> and<00:02:21.550> what's<00:02:21.850> fun

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
your into your piece and and what's fun

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.410 
your into your piece and and what's fun
about<00:02:22.090> this<00:02:22.540> is<00:02:22.750> that<00:02:23.670> just<00:02:24.670> if<00:02:24.880> this<00:02:25.060> is<00:02:25.180> time

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
about this is that just if this is time

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.120 
about this is that just if this is time
for<00:02:25.570> you<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.780> play<00:02:25.959> into<00:02:26.530> play<00:02:26.739> with<00:02:26.950> all<00:02:27.100> your

different<00:02:27.760> materials<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.110> techniques<00:02:29.620> and

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
different materials and techniques and

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.120 
different materials and techniques and
all<00:02:31.360> kinds<00:02:31.750> of<00:02:31.810> things<00:02:32.049> would<00:02:32.170> happen<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:32.920> and

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
all kinds of things would happen and and

so<00:02:33.459> when<00:02:33.579> I<00:02:33.640> was<00:02:33.820> doing<00:02:34.239> this<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.810> started

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
so when I was doing this I started

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.740 
so when I was doing this I started
creating<00:02:36.010> these<00:02:36.340> little<00:02:36.720> these<00:02:37.720> little

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
creating these little these little

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.180 
creating these little these little
figures<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:40.049> have<00:02:41.049> a<00:02:41.079> video<00:02:41.410> on<00:02:41.440> how<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.829> did

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
figures and I have a video on how I did

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.250 
figures and I have a video on how I did
her<00:02:42.430> and<00:02:43.209> it<00:02:43.360> just<00:02:43.390> started<00:02:43.870> out<00:02:44.049> with<00:02:44.200> just

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
her and it just started out with just

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.080 
her and it just started out with just
finding<00:02:44.769> that<00:02:44.890> a<00:02:44.950> simple<00:02:45.430> little<00:02:45.549> garment

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
finding that a simple little garment

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.320 
finding that a simple little garment
that<00:02:46.209> I<00:02:46.269> liked<00:02:46.600> online<00:02:47.079> or<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.730> mannequin<00:02:48.730> and

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
transferring onto the fabric and then

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.260 
transferring onto the fabric and then

out of just like playing with all my
little<00:03:10.570> strips<00:03:10.960> and<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:12.370> also<00:03:13.120> have<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.690> video<00:03:13.900> of

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
little strips and I also have a video of

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.630 
little strips and I also have a video of
how<00:03:15.280> I<00:03:15.700> did<00:03:16.060> this<00:03:16.270> piece<00:03:16.690> here<00:03:17.380> using<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.430> same

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
how I did this piece here using the same

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.340 
how I did this piece here using the same
kind<00:03:18.910> of<00:03:19.000> technique<00:03:19.420> with<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.870> started<00:03:20.230> with<00:03:20.320> a

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
kind of technique with I started with a

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.400 
kind of technique with I started with a
mannequin<00:03:20.860> and<00:03:21.160> I<00:03:21.310> I<00:03:21.670> felt<00:03:22.150> from<00:03:22.360> there<00:03:22.600> the

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
mannequin and I I felt from there the

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.640 
mannequin and I I felt from there the
video<00:03:23.710> take<00:03:23.980> this<00:03:24.160> process<00:03:24.990> but<00:03:25.990> only<00:03:26.200> up<00:03:26.470> to

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
video take this process but only up to

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.670 
video take this process but only up to
the<00:03:26.770> point<00:03:26.980> where<00:03:27.280> I<00:03:27.310> did<00:03:27.900> more<00:03:28.900> sepia<00:03:29.380> tones

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
the point where I did more sepia tones

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.860 
the point where I did more sepia tones
and<00:03:30.040> so<00:03:30.370> I<00:03:30.400> put<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:30.790> piece<00:03:30.970> aside<00:03:31.300> I<00:03:31.600> thought

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
and so I put the piece aside I thought

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.200 
and so I put the piece aside I thought
she<00:03:32.080> was<00:03:32.200> done<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.980> she<00:03:33.070> wasn't<00:03:33.490> and<00:03:33.940> I<00:03:34.000> went

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
she was done and she wasn't and I went

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.910 
she was done and she wasn't and I went
ahead<00:03:34.300> and<00:03:34.480> started<00:03:34.660> putting<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.410> Pink's<00:03:35.770> and

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
ahead and started putting the Pink's and

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.730 
ahead and started putting the Pink's and
all<00:03:36.040> these<00:03:36.190> other<00:03:36.370> colors<00:03:36.640> into<00:03:37.060> it<00:03:37.180> and

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
all these other colors into it and

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.490 
all these other colors into it and
realize<00:03:38.740> that<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.190> didn't<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.900> know<00:03:40.990> I<00:03:41.230> didn't

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
realize that I didn't you know I didn't

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.860 
realize that I didn't you know I didn't
tape<00:03:41.710> it<00:03:41.890> so<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:42.070> give<00:03:42.760> you<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:43.000> process<00:03:43.270> of<00:03:43.510> how

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
tape it so I give you the process of how

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.720 
tape it so I give you the process of how
I'm<00:03:44.080> doing<00:03:44.470> how<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:44.680> did<00:03:45.070> this<00:03:45.280> with<00:03:45.580> the

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
I'm doing how I did this with the

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.260 
I'm doing how I did this with the
coloring<00:03:46.060> which<00:03:46.780> is<00:03:46.990> pretty<00:03:47.530> easy<00:03:47.800> and<00:03:48.700> lastly

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270
