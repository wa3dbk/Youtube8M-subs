00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.720
 Hello my name is Alexey Trifonov 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.620
 In this issue I will talk about how I 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.099
 tune snare remove old 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.529
 plastic 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.300
 so that the drum hoop does not twist the bolts 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.810
 spin the cross over a quarter 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:35.969
 turnover 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:36.710
 times two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and so on 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.379
 round 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.030
 we remove old plastic and we dress new 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.399
 I prefer either double-layer plastic 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.109
 either plastic from the mid spot they give 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.089
 more dense and focused sound 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:50.370
 make sure that the plastic lies flat 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.170
 when installing new plastic first 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.329
 hand-tighten the bolts without 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.159
 key and only then take the key and 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.609
 twist a quarter across 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:58.920
 turnover 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:03.390
 after you tighten all the bolts 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.549
 plastic need to be precipitated check accuracy 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.259
 sound settings in front of each screw 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.329
 must be the same if the sound 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.430
 different adjust the setting 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.439
 to avoid loosening the bolts 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.689
 always tune by method 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.460
 tension they are loosening that is if 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.950
 you need to loosen the plastic tension 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.320
 loosen up more than you need and then 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.310
 pull the bolts i never pull 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.229
 strongly lower plastic 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.899
 this setting allows the drum 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.060
 breathe if the bottom plastic drag something 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.740
 the sound of the drum will be squeezed if i 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.420
 need to get a low drum sound i 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.549
 I tune the top plastic in unison with 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.979
 lower if i need a high sound 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.810
 I lift the top plastic in any 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.030
 case when installing the top plastic i 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.680
 I tune it higher than I do not need 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.680
 so that he stretches out and a cell 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.030
 completely relax the spring and then 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:59.810
 stretch it until 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:01.789
 get the required sound do not over tighten 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.630
 the spring is too much different in the sounds 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.700
 the drum volume disappears if the drum 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.440
 too much rings it needs for 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:19.370
 damping is suitable for this 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:23.230
 demper ring here such stickies 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.230
 which are called bundles 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.120
 you can use one or two velcro 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.250
 if you do n't have any stickies 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:42.769
 you can use just a piece of thick 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:44.390
 scotch also a good result can 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.760
 give a piece of napkin folded in 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.390
 several times and sealed on top of the usual 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.390
 transparent scotch 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.600
