00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
I'm a usually tired I think I was the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.889 
I'm a usually tired I think I was the
one<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.590> be<00:00:40.710> given<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> dog<00:00:41.899> responsibilities

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
one to be given the dog responsibilities

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.170 
one to be given the dog responsibilities
because<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.680> really<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.340> dogs<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.969> I

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
because I really like dogs and I

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.750 
because I really like dogs and I
actually<00:00:45.480> had<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.440> great<00:00:46.559> pyrenees<00:00:47.129> when<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.640> was

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
actually had a great pyrenees when I was

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.150 
actually had a great pyrenees when I was
younger<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:49.020> think<00:00:49.289> those<00:00:49.559> combined

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
younger so I just think those combined

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.700 
younger so I just think those combined
really<00:00:50.550> made<00:00:50.789> me<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.149> ideal<00:00:51.570> caretaker<00:00:52.410> for

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
really made me that ideal caretaker for

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.010 
really made me that ideal caretaker for
them<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.190> think<00:00:54.000> Fletcher<00:00:54.329> was<00:00:54.449> chosen<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.899> work

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
them I think Fletcher was chosen to work

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.510 
them I think Fletcher was chosen to work
with<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.289> dogs<00:00:55.500> because<00:00:55.739> he's<00:00:56.010> much<00:00:56.219> more<00:00:56.399> of

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
with the dogs because he's much more of

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.580 
with the dogs because he's much more of
a<00:00:56.579> dog<00:00:56.789> person<00:00:56.820> than<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> go<00:00:57.539> person<00:00:57.960> he<00:00:58.289> prefers

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
a dog person than a go person he prefers

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.069 
a dog person than a go person he prefers
working<00:00:58.800> with<00:00:59.160> them<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.640> he<00:01:00.270> loves<00:01:00.449> him<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.660> lot

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
working with them and he loves him a lot

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.789 
working with them and he loves him a lot
Fletcher<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.219> had<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.609> bathe<00:01:02.789> him<00:01:02.969> once

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
Fletcher and I had to bathe him once

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.230 
Fletcher and I had to bathe him once
let's<00:01:04.799> say<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.220> didn't<00:01:05.489> go<00:01:05.670> very<00:01:05.700> well

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
let's say it didn't go very well

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.770 
let's say it didn't go very well
Fletcher<00:01:06.840> didn't<00:01:07.560> want<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.860> do<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.130> because<00:01:08.780> he

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
Fletcher didn't want to do it because he

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.270 
Fletcher didn't want to do it because he
didn't<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.650> when<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> doggy

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.950 
dogs but Fletcher from a very young age
has<00:01:46.009> always<00:01:46.250> been<00:01:46.729> very<00:01:47.090> interested<00:01:47.630> in<00:01:47.810> dogs

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
has always been very interested in dogs

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.510 
has always been very interested in dogs
so<00:01:48.590> it<00:01:48.680> just<00:01:48.830> seemed<00:01:48.950> kind<00:01:49.190> of<00:01:49.220> makes<00:01:49.430> sense

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
so it just seemed kind of makes sense

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.400 
so it just seemed kind of makes sense
that<00:01:49.820> he<00:01:50.090> would<00:01:50.180> be<00:01:50.300> the<00:01:50.390> one<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:51.050> take<00:01:51.200> care<00:01:51.380> of

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
that he would be the one to take care of

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.950 
that he would be the one to take care of
the<00:01:51.530> dogs<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:52.130> lot<00:01:53.060> of<00:01:53.210> people<00:01:53.479> think<00:01:53.780> that<00:01:53.899> I

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
the dogs a lot of people think that I

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.930 
the dogs a lot of people think that I
got<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.410> Great<00:01:54.590> Pyrenees<00:01:54.920> dog's<00:01:55.310> fur<00:01:55.670> the

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
got the Great Pyrenees dog's fur the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.609 
got the Great Pyrenees dog's fur the
goats<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:56.450> that's<00:01:56.600> true<00:01:56.869> I<00:01:56.899> did<00:01:57.140> want<00:01:57.350> them<00:01:57.470> to

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
goats and that's true I did want them to

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.830 
goats and that's true I did want them to
protect<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:58.130> goats<00:01:58.340> but<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.149> bigger<00:01:59.420> reason

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
protect the goats but the bigger reason

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.130 
protect the goats but the bigger reason
I<00:01:59.899> got<00:02:00.110> them<00:02:00.350> was<00:02:00.680> for<00:02:01.009> my<00:02:01.160> son<00:02:01.220> Fletcher<00:02:01.820> and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
I got them was for my son Fletcher and

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.020 
I got them was for my son Fletcher and
Fletcher's<00:02:03.140> my<00:02:03.320> child<00:02:03.619> who<00:02:04.070> has<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:04.820> most

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
Fletcher's my child who has the most

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.270 
Fletcher's my child who has the most
difficult<00:02:05.570> time<00:02:05.780> growing<00:02:06.020> up<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.710> I<00:02:06.950> think<00:02:07.190> a

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
difficult time growing up and I think a

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.650 
difficult time growing up and I think a
big<00:02:07.399> part<00:02:07.670> of<00:02:07.729> that<00:02:07.789> is<00:02:08.000> because<00:02:08.149> he's<00:02:08.479> so

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
big part of that is because he's so

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.100 
big part of that is because he's so
sensitive<00:02:09.259> so<00:02:09.950> he<00:02:10.340> feels<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:11.600> hurts<00:02:11.900> and

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
sensitive so he feels the hurts and

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.780 
sensitive so he feels the hurts and
slights<00:02:12.470> of<00:02:12.770> you<00:02:13.070> know<00:02:13.160> being<00:02:13.459> in<00:02:13.550> a<00:02:13.610> large

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
slights of you know being in a large

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.340 
slights of you know being in a large
family<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.270> have<00:02:14.480> siblings<00:02:14.750> that<00:02:15.080> don't

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
family and have siblings that don't

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.890 
family and have siblings that don't
always<00:02:15.500> get<00:02:15.770> along<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.310> most<00:02:16.489> deeply<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.209> so

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
always get along the most deeply and so

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.060 
always get along the most deeply and so
