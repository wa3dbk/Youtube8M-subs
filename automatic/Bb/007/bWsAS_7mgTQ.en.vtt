automobile there have been some
foolproof<00:04:46.650> ways<00:04:47.310> of<00:04:47.700> making<00:04:48.150> a<00:04:48.210> car<00:04:48.510> go<00:04:48.720> faster

foolproof ways of making a car go faster

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.090 
foolproof ways of making a car go faster
and<00:04:49.860> Buick<00:04:50.310> knew<00:04:50.790> every<00:04:51.360> one<00:04:51.570> of<00:04:51.750> them<00:04:52.100> the

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
and Buick knew every one of them the

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.310 
and Buick knew every one of them the
easiest<00:04:53.520> way<00:04:53.760> of<00:04:53.790> course<00:04:54.180> was<00:04:54.780> to<00:04:54.960> build<00:04:55.170> a

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
easiest way of course was to build a

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.000 
easiest way of course was to build a
bigger<00:04:55.530> engine

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
bigger engine
