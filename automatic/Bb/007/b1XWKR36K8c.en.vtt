00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.519
 all automobiles and motorcycles 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.460
 Today's time own efficient switching 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.889
 or automatic transmission a gearbox 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.980
 serves primarily to an input 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.680
 speed in a higher or lower 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.510
 output speed to convert 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.250
 First, this fact better 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.350
 to understand a very simple one 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.490
 gearbox with only two gears 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.859
 be shown 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.630
 the output shaft is with two 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.390
 different sized gears 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.820
 Equipped with the entrance shaft 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.440
 on a wedge balls profile on the itself 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.050
 two gears are located 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.010
 the gears are to a shipowner blog 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.170
 summarized 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.950
 who moved to the wedge profile 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.840
 can be because entrance change through 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.270
 the shifting of gears possible 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.600
 is such a gear as well 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.120
 slide valve gear designated a 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.920
 Motor generated in this example a 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.219
 rotational speed of the input shaft 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.809
 of 2000 revolutions per minute the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.119
 first step of the operation has one 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.159
 Translation of 2 since the driven 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.460
 Gear is twice as big as that 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.950
 driving gear that means that the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.229
 Input speed of the engine from 2000 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.280
 turns per minute to 1000 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.049
 turns per minute is reduced 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.680
 the second gear can only be engaged 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.810
 become 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.520
 when the gears of the second gear the 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.240
 same speed to each other 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.670
 respectively 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.509
 in this case the standstill of 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.640
 incoming and outgoing goods the 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.250
 turns at the second gear 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.909
 through the translation ratio of 0.5 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.909
 increased 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.100
 because this gear is difficult under load 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.690
 could be switched under 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.240
 other synchronized gear 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.580
 developed 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.530
 in today's automobiles own these 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.060
 five or more longer also under 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.460
 load can be switched 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.950
 at a simple synchronized 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:10.229
 Four-speed gearbox should clarify this 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:11.730
 First, here is the beginning 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.130
 to name cases from the engine 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.960
 the kinetic energy is driven 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.150
 The wave at the beginning is to the 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.950
 so-called pre-transmission wave transmitted 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.810
 which turn the energy into the 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.660
 gears on the output shaft 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.600
 transmits the output cases is with the 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.460
 four wheels of the car joined the 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.320
 Power flow between the input shaft 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.880
 and the engine can help with one 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.880
 clutch be interrupted 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.700
 the gears on the beginning and in front 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.769
 Shaft are with the respective 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.410
 wave fixed and turn 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.180
 accordingly, with the gears on the other hand 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.500
 the gears on the output 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.810
 shaft can rotate freely 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.330
 a positive connection of 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.690
 Gear and output shaft is only 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.000
 via a switchable possible under her 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.830
 there is a toothing which 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.799
 firmly connected to the output shaft 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.599
 is the first gear can through the 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.049
 move the switching moped inlaid 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.239
 become 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.489
 For this, the clutch must be entered 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.290
 so that the engine initially no energy 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.810
 can pass to the gearbox 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.940
 as soon as the switchboard or gear 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.500
 is inserted, the coupling of the 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.959
 driver are let go 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.629
 The engine now manages the generated 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.150
 movement energy to the gearbox 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:37.730
 the gear again passed over before 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.250
 lay wave and exit wave this 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.670
 energy to the wheels further causing the 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.739
 Now the vehicle starts to roll 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.709
 second gear must be inserted 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.489
 First, the clutch to be kicked 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.560
 then the second gear 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.299
 be inserted here are the 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.370
 switching toothing of the gear wheel 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.620
 and the interlocking of the initial cases 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.200
 First, the speed is synchronized 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.540
 is therefore adapted to each other so that the 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.090
 mesh teeth without problems 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.549
 can jonas be the clutch pedal 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.859
 The driver can let go again 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:13.540
 engine the energy to the gear and 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.540
 finally forward to the wheels 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.090
 in this way can also the 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.720
 third and fourth gear engaged 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.720
 become 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.490
 As a rule, this happens 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.770
 via a so-called h circuit the 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.500
 today is installed in many automobiles 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.030
 this circuit is therefore called because 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.730
 the shift stick at the full 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.320
 switching gears through the letter h 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.320
 almost draws
