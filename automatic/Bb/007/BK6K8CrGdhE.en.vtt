00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.259
 Welcome back to me in this short 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.690
 I'm going to show you how to deactivate 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.910
 Screen rotation in Microsoft Lumia 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.880
 640 gelete the procedure is very easy 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.049
 and very simple by default the phone 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.960
 Measure with screen rotation 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.270
 activated people say for example if 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.160
 entered here to the photo gallery or 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.840
 anything that allows rotation 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.720
 for example the photos that 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.420
 they take 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.090
 if you look with the phone like this if it's 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.270
 broken 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.700
 we can see that the photo rotates 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.800
 in another part where we can see that the 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.130
 screen rotation is activated by 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.630
 example in the explorer browser 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.390
 we enter in the flower browser 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.720
 here I am browsing the website of 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.220
 us tricks for dotcom cell phones 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.800
 that is inviting you to visit the 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.230
 tricks for dotcom cell phones where 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.250
 You can find all the videos that 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.050
 we have done from the different 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.719
 cell phones 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.000
 then for example if the rotation of 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.710
 screen is activated by rotating the 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.070
 phone automatically on the screen 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.960
 broken if we do not want this rotation of 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.630
 screen what we're going to do is 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.700
 the following 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.039
 let's go up here with the nut 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.140
 configuration by notifications all the 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:21.020
 configuration us settings 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.020
 we look for screen rotation 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.790
 and in this case blocking the rotation 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.740
 is disabled this allows the 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.830
 cedant rotation so I do not want that 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.710
 the rotation is seen I must activate it 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.150
 activating the blocking of the rotation 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.550
 disabled the rotation is something like 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.040
 tangled but that's the way then if I get 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.180
 to take any picture they will see that 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.730
 this is no longer going to rotate 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.540
 we have this picture if I bounced the 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.490
 phone no longer there rotation we have 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.010
 any other photo the phone is not 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.680
 rotating right now let's go back to 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.860
 browser that is where you walk the most 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.850
 screen rotation 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.680
 in the explorer 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.590
 we have the page tricks to do 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.200
 lares dotcom is still broken the cell a 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.690
 and rotation like this is easy and simple 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.459

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.620
