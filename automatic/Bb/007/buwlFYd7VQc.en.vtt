hey<00:00:00.750> guys<00:00:00.960> in<00:00:01.230> this<00:00:01.350> story<00:00:01.709> I'm<00:00:01.800> going<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.010> be

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
hey guys in this story I'm going to be

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.230 
hey guys in this story I'm going to be
teaching<00:00:02.460> you<00:00:02.610> how<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.760> switch<00:00:03.060> between

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
teaching you how to switch between

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.110 
teaching you how to switch between
different<00:00:03.629> scenes<00:00:04.140> so<00:00:05.100> if<00:00:05.460> you<00:00:05.640> have<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:05.819> main

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
different scenes so if you have a main

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.849 
different scenes so if you have a main
menu<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.779> you<00:00:06.899> want<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.140> press<00:00:07.290> button<00:00:07.649> and

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
menu and you want to press button and

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.560 
menu and you want to press button and
loan<00:00:08.069> into<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.400> different<00:00:08.760> scene<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.179> can<00:00:09.360> do

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
loan into a different scene you can do

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.089 
loan into a different scene you can do
that

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
that

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.539 
that
so<00:00:11.400> scenes<00:00:11.700> are<00:00:11.880> pretty<00:00:12.030> much<00:00:12.210> just<00:00:13.130> each<00:00:14.130> area

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
so scenes are pretty much just each area

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.880 
so scenes are pretty much just each area
of<00:00:15.059> your<00:00:15.660> game<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:16.170> if<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.379> had<00:00:16.529> different

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
of your game so if you had different

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.590 
of your game so if you had different
maps<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.580> stuff<00:00:17.730> they<00:00:18.119> would<00:00:18.270> be<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.510> a

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
maps and stuff they would be in a

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.920 
maps and stuff they would be in a
separate<00:00:18.960> scene<00:00:19.430> so<00:00:20.430> people<00:00:20.880> like<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.390> make<00:00:21.869> a

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
separate scene so people like to make a

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.179 
separate scene so people like to make a
bunch<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.289> different<00:00:22.410> levels<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.100> different

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
bunch of different levels and different

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.150 
bunch of different levels and different
scenes<00:00:23.699> or<00:00:24.119> make<00:00:25.019> different<00:00:25.410> menus<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.070> stuff

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
scenes or make different menus and stuff

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.359 
scenes or make different menus and stuff
that<00:00:26.519> can<00:00:26.699> load<00:00:26.910> up<00:00:26.939> different<00:00:27.510> scenes<00:00:27.779> or

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
that can load up different scenes or

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.659 
that can load up different scenes or
anything<00:00:29.369> along<00:00:29.580> those<00:00:29.849> lines<00:00:30.000> um<00:00:31.250> so<00:00:32.250> if<00:00:32.520> we

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
anything along those lines um so if we

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.880 
anything along those lines um so if we
go<00:00:32.790> file<00:00:33.090> open<00:00:33.270> scene<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.110> see<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.500> map

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
go file open scene you can see that map

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.819 
go file open scene you can see that map
1<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.850> scene<00:00:36.120> right<00:00:36.149> here<00:00:36.710> but<00:00:37.710> we

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
1 this is the scene right here but we

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.920 
1 this is the scene right here but we
are<00:00:37.860> going<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.250> want<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.730> create<00:00:39.120> just<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.719> new

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
are going to want to create just a new

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.260 
are going to want to create just a new
scene<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:41.309> only<00:00:41.460> thing<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.969> will<00:00:42.059> be<00:00:42.090> in

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
scene and the only thing that will be in

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.959 
scene and the only thing that will be in
our<00:00:42.300> new<00:00:42.510> scene<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.020> camera<00:00:43.440> for<00:00:43.620> now<00:00:43.969> so

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
our new scene is a camera for now so

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.779 
our new scene is a camera for now so
this<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.539> where<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.809> could<00:00:46.129> build<00:00:47.129> an<00:00:47.399> area

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
this is where you could build an area

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.670 
this is where you could build an area
for<00:00:48.300> your<00:00:48.480> main<00:00:48.719> menu<00:00:48.930> if<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.260> want<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.559> make

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
for your main menu if you want to make

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.470 
for your main menu if you want to make
it<00:00:49.800> look<00:00:49.980> all<00:00:50.160> cool<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.489> stuff<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.180> have<00:00:51.300> your

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
it look all cool and stuff and have your

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.900 
it look all cool and stuff and have your
different<00:00:51.780> buttons<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.230> stuff<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.399> went

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
different buttons and stuff so I went

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.689 
different buttons and stuff so I went
and<00:00:54.059> made<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.809> simple<00:00:55.230> main<00:00:55.860> menu<00:00:56.190> script<00:00:56.520> it's

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
and made a simple main menu script it's

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.720 
and made a simple main menu script it's
nothing<00:00:57.030> fancy<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.170> loading<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.430> our

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
nothing fancy it's just loading to our

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.299 
nothing fancy it's just loading to our
next<00:01:00.090> level<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:01.500> we're<00:01:01.710> going<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.070> be<00:01:02.160> creating

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
next level so we're going to be creating

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.429 
next level so we're going to be creating
a<00:01:02.550> GUI<00:01:02.789> button<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.420> we've<00:01:03.930> done<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.229> before

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
a GUI button and we've done this before

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.070 
a GUI button and we've done this before
screen<00:01:05.280> with<00:01:05.489> divided<00:01:06.060> by<00:01:06.150> two<00:01:06.210> screen<00:01:06.900> height

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
screen with divided by two screen height

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.530 
screen with divided by two screen height
divided<00:01:07.530> by<00:01:07.560> two<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:10.040> we<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.189> probably<00:01:11.540> get

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
divided by two and we can probably get

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.390 
divided by two and we can probably get
rid<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.990> that's<00:01:13.260> no<00:01:13.439> big<00:01:13.650> deal

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
rid of that that's no big deal

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.380 
rid of that that's no big deal
and<00:01:15.490> we<00:01:16.360> just<00:01:16.600> have<00:01:16.780> it<00:01:17.260> labeled<00:01:17.650> startgame<00:01:18.390> so

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
and we just have it labeled startgame so

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.810 
and we just have it labeled startgame so
application<00:01:20.260> download<00:01:20.710> level<00:01:21.100> this<00:01:21.280> is<00:01:21.490> for

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
application download level this is for

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.350 
application download level this is for
loading<00:01:22.150> a<00:01:22.360> scene<00:01:22.660> and<00:01:23.220> then<00:01:24.220> you<00:01:24.280> want<00:01:24.730> the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
loading a scene and then you want the

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.000 
loading a scene and then you want the
name<00:01:25.570> of<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.930> scene<00:01:26.140> you<00:01:26.260> want<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.470> load<00:01:26.770> in

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
name of the scene you want to load in

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.580 
name of the scene you want to load in
here<00:01:27.340> so<00:01:27.580> make<00:01:27.760> sure<00:01:27.970> that<00:01:28.240> all<00:01:28.480> the<00:01:28.750> letters

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
here so make sure that all the letters

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.560 
here so make sure that all the letters
are<00:01:29.950> capitalized<00:01:30.460> in<00:01:30.610> lowercase<00:01:30.880> exactly

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
are capitalized in lowercase exactly

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.260 
are capitalized in lowercase exactly
like<00:01:31.720> how<00:01:31.900> you<00:01:31.960> have<00:01:32.290> it<00:01:32.320> set<00:01:32.470> up<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.820> that's

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
like how you have it set up so that's

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.370 
like how you have it set up so that's

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
you can go and throw the main menu

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.160 
you can go and throw the main menu

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.290 
building in a new want your main menu to
be<00:02:08.710> the<00:02:08.920> first<00:02:09.160> one<00:02:09.369> you<00:02:09.550> want<00:02:09.730> to<00:02:09.820> click<00:02:10.119> and

vertex GUI Tex

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:09.220 
vertex GUI Tex
me<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.459> don't<00:02:55.940> know<00:02:56.120> what<00:02:56.299> happened<00:02:56.690> there

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.060 

oh<00:03:14.690> because<00:03:15.690> we're<00:03:15.960> creating<00:03:16.230> a<00:03:16.440> GUI<00:03:16.770> button

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
oh because we're creating a GUI button

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.410 
oh because we're creating a GUI button
that's<00:03:17.820> totally<00:03:18.240> my<00:03:18.690> mistake<00:03:19.110> there

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
that's totally my mistake there

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:39.380 
that's totally my mistake there
we'll<00:03:21.420> go<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:21.780> fix<00:03:21.960> that<00:03:22.200> real<00:03:22.410> quick

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.710 

yep<00:03:39.960> so<00:03:40.320> you<00:03:40.380> see<00:03:40.680> here<00:03:41.040> it<00:03:41.370> starts<00:03:41.760> up<00:03:41.970> we

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
yep so you see here it starts up we

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.360 
yep so you see here it starts up we
probably<00:03:42.870> want<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.350> extend<00:03:43.680> this<00:03:43.890> if<00:03:44.070> we<00:03:44.190> want

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
probably want to extend this if we want

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.860 
probably want to extend this if we want
to<00:03:44.430> add<00:03:44.550> more<00:03:44.580> text<00:03:45.000> because<00:03:45.330> it<00:03:45.360> was<00:03:45.570> set<00:03:45.750> at

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
to add more text because it was set at

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.900 
to add more text because it was set at
80<00:03:46.110> for<00:03:46.470> length<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:46.980> it<00:03:47.070> might<00:03:47.190> need<00:03:47.610> to<00:03:47.790> be

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
80 for length so it might need to be

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.870 
80 for length so it might need to be
like<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.150> hundred<00:03:48.330> to<00:03:48.660> fit<00:03:48.840> in<00:03:48.960> all<00:03:49.110> that<00:03:49.290> text

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
like a hundred to fit in all that text

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.480 
like a hundred to fit in all that text
but<00:03:50.880> yeah<00:03:51.090> if<00:03:51.240> we<00:03:51.360> just<00:03:51.510> click<00:03:51.750> here<00:03:52.490> it'll

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
but yeah if we just click here it'll

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.360 
but yeah if we just click here it'll
load<00:03:54.300> right<00:03:54.690> into<00:03:55.050> our<00:03:55.080> game<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.860> start

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
load right into our game and start

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.870 
load right into our game and start
playing<00:03:57.620> so<00:03:58.620> that's<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:59.040> simple<00:03:59.370> way<00:03:59.550> to<00:03:59.580> make

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
playing so that's a simple way to make

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.000 
playing so that's a simple way to make
like<00:04:00.300> a<00:04:00.390> main<00:04:00.600> menu<00:04:01.050> and<00:04:01.350> switch<00:04:01.800> between

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
like a main menu and switch between

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.789 
like a main menu and switch between
stuff<00:04:03.220> like<00:04:03.430> that<00:04:03.670> maybe<00:04:04.480> one<00:04:04.930> in<00:04:05.080> here<00:04:05.319> main

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
stuff like that maybe one in here main

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.440 
stuff like that maybe one in here main
menu<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:06.250> load<00:04:07.239> into<00:04:07.480> a<00:04:07.750> characters<00:04:08.409> function

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
menu to load into a characters function

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.360 
menu to load into a characters function
scene<00:04:10.450> likely<00:04:11.409> character<00:04:11.860> and<00:04:11.980> how<00:04:12.040> to<00:04:12.099> float

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
scene likely character and how to float

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.590 
scene likely character and how to float
into<00:04:12.640> here<00:04:13.049> they<00:04:14.049> probably<00:04:14.349> want<00:04:14.709> to<00:04:15.540> make<00:04:16.540> a

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
into here they probably want to make a

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.740 
into here they probably want to make a
CD<00:04:16.870> transfer

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.840 

I<00:04:19.810> think<00:04:20.739> in<00:04:20.829> another<00:04:20.920> before<00:04:21.459> I'm<00:04:21.609> going<00:04:21.790> to

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
I think in another before I'm going to

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.900 
I think in another before I'm going to
show<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.090> guys<00:04:22.300> how<00:04:22.690> to<00:04:23.370> make<00:04:24.370> it<00:04:24.520> so<00:04:24.670> you<00:04:24.700> can

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
show you guys how to make it so you can

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.570 
show you guys how to make it so you can
transfer<00:04:25.330> variables<00:04:25.900> if<00:04:26.080> you<00:04:26.200> wanted<00:04:26.560> so<00:04:27.430> if

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
transfer variables if you wanted so if

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.800 
transfer variables if you wanted so if
you<00:04:27.700> wanted<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:29.340> save<00:04:30.340> your<00:04:30.640> variables<00:04:31.180> into

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
you wanted to save your variables into

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.870 
you wanted to save your variables into
like<00:04:32.470> a<00:04:32.500> certain<00:04:32.920> slot<00:04:33.250> like<00:04:33.520> you<00:04:33.640> know<00:04:33.760> how

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
like a certain slot like you know how

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.870 
like a certain slot like you know how
some<00:04:34.240> games<00:04:34.450> have<00:04:34.660> like<00:04:34.840> three<00:04:35.200> save<00:04:35.500> slots<00:04:35.880> we

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
some games have like three save slots we

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.110 
some games have like three save slots we
can<00:04:37.060> make<00:04:37.210> it<00:04:37.360> so<00:04:37.540> it<00:04:37.720> could<00:04:37.840> grab<00:04:38.200> some

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
can make it so it could grab some
