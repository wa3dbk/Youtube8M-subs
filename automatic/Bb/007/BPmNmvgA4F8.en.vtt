00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 in which everything shrinks the incredible 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.180
 homes of the future will also be more 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.730
 little ones 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.129
 in the future we will have to think 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.930
 conscientiously about the density 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.930
 of population on this planet 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.910
 the extravagant designer louis y colán 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.150
 and is best known as a designer of 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.380
 cars and trucks 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.000
 design large cars and small cars 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.129
 with regard to the households of the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.059
 future has no doubts about how the 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:38.550
 you prefer is not necessarily better than 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.870
 they are small but if they are small and 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.489
 smart is much better the vision of 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.769
 future of colán and the one that calls house 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.280
 rotor makes the small be highly 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.280
 efficient 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.190
 designed a house that only occupies 36 meters 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.160
 square the approximate size of two 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.460
 garages but it made it look like a lot 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.110
 larger 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.489
 and let's see a resource 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.300
 so that the square meters 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.090
 available double in the size of the 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.880
 footprint of the house 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.920
 the trick colán and dispensed with the space 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.719
 unusable as that of the corridors of 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.740
 opinion the main facilities in 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.740
 a rotating cylinder 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.850
 nobody did anything similar 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:30.119
 inside the cylinder he designed a 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.119
 small bedroom a kitchen and a bathroom 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.430
 if you want to prepare dinner makes the 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.430
 kitchen to nap makes the 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.680
 bedroom if you want to bathe marks the 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.340
 bathroom 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.409
 It is the smallest big house in the world 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.789
 the toilet is on a separate path and 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.009
 has like other artifacts 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.759
 the soft and lobed shapes of 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.759
 tail cars ni 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.540
 all the elements installed in the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.670
 rotor house are sculpted 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.060
 meticulously to adapt to being 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.060
 human 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.289
 and you can expand the space by adding 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.640
 more houses 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:15.400
 can be stacked or grouped to make 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.349
 a big house made with broken houses 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.109
 golán and hopes that his small house 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.939
 inspires big ideas and stimulates others 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:24.390
 designers to propose their own 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.390
 designs 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.480
 I am convinced that good design 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.569
 has a profound influence on the 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.140
 people who inhabit it and that's what I 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.319
 I propose desperately to achieve 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.280
 that people are better than they are 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:46.730
 making them live in homes 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.730
 wonderful calm and inspiring 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.730
 and wichí colán and he's not the only one 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.920
 inspired by the beauty of the small 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.230
 as well as the automotive industry 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.299
 you have to reduce the size of the cars 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.940
 the construction industry will have 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.860
 that reduce the architect's houses 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.049
 English 20 order believes that the pressures 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.819
 economic and environmental will make 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.489
 the architects of the future build 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.640
 smaller houses the more calls 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.790
 mansions are obscene is obscene that 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.150
 we need to express our wealth to 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.799
 through size and dimensions 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.970
 design order the opposite of mansions 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:29.130
 what he calls micro compact house 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.980
 I travel a lot by plane between london and 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.350
 munich and I was very inspired by the way 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.990
 the aviation industry developed 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.650
 sophisticated ways of inhabiting spaces 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.650
 little ones 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.130
 It is a small cube of 2.7 meters 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.640
 side but it's designed with precision 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.650
 of a Swiss army knife 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.590
 household appliances and furniture 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.870
 they are built-in 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.739
 and here is the espresso machine 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:02.040
 here is a fridge with freezer and 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.890
 here a microwave and three these for the 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.170
 trash underneath and there are drawers that 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.750
 Gently slide the sprinkler and 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.950
 setback are arranged as a unit 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.950
 shower over the water 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.709
 anchor cow rent one of the seven houses 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.799
 micro compact that order built in 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.599
 the technical university of munich 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.690
 I love it because it is in contact with 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:27.190
 nature and it's my own home the 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.960
 house looks bigger than it is 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.740
 because it is divided into spaces 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.620
 separated the kitchen the bathroom and the shower 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.770
 on one side the desk and dining room 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.479
 another side and the area to sleep on 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.759
 of the latter there is nothing less 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.490
 psychologically advisable to see your 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:47.650
 bed when you try to work so 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.680
 that one of the main elements was 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.110
 separate the bed from the living room 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.770
 the compact micro houses do not generate 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.770
 claustrophobia 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.720
 I do not want more space because you can 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:05.680
 open the window sit outside close 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.539
 of the English garden right there in winter 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.639
 you feel a little lonely sometimes but in 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:12.069
 Summer is fabulous could not be better 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:15.009
 that invites us to reflect on 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:17.229
 how much we really needed why 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:18.970
 do not build smaller houses I think that 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.550
 it's okay that you can live in a house 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.620
 little one does not need as much space to 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.810
 despite everything after living a year the 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.050
 year-round micro house has a complaint 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.050
 less 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.580
 I do not have a placar for my clothes only 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:35.750
 I have drawers 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.750
 but it's fine like that
