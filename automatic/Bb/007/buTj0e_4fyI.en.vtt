enable battery percentage on checked but

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.490 
enable battery percentage on checked but
you<00:01:57.149> can<00:01:57.360> check<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.750> other<00:01:57.869> ones<00:01:58.049> if<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.320> want

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500

something<00:02:03.840> different<00:02:04.740> than<00:02:05.040> just

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
something different than just

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.920 
something different than just
jailbreaking<00:02:05.820> your<00:02:05.850> device<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:06.600> if<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.780> just

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
jailbreaking your device but if you just

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:07.969 
jailbreaking your device but if you just
jailbreak<00:02:07.229> your<00:02:07.350> device<00:02:07.439> just<00:02:07.799> have
