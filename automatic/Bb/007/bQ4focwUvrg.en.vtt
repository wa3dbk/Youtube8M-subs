00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.929 
general and unit frames you're going to
just<00:01:37.799> make<00:01:37.890> this<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.490> can<00:01:38.610> put<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.850> to

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
just make this you can put it to

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.670 
just make this you can put it to
whatever<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.869> negative<00:01:40.259> zero<00:01:40.290> that

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
whatever that is negative zero that

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.469 
whatever that is negative zero that
means<00:01:40.770> no<00:01:41.009> color<00:01:41.250> at<00:01:41.400> all<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:42.090> will<00:01:42.240> get<00:01:42.390> rid

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
means no color at all that will get rid

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.270 
means no color at all that will get rid
of<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.630> black<00:01:42.840> background<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.950> other<00:01:43.979> thing

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
of the black background the other thing

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.429 
of the black background the other thing
I<00:01:44.399> like<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.729> do<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.240> comes<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:45.750> default<00:01:45.960> two

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
I like to do it comes with default two

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.770 
I like to do it comes with default two
groups<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.009> like<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.490> disable<00:01:47.759> group<00:01:48.210> two<00:01:48.420> so

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
groups I like to disable group two so

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.510 
groups I like to disable group two so
remove<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.229> group<00:01:49.560> that's<00:01:50.189> going<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.399> leave

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
remove this group that's going to leave

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.039 
remove this group that's going to leave
you<00:01:50.610> with<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:50.909> right<00:01:51.210> here<00:01:51.270> now<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:51.930> can

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
you with this right here now you can

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.069 
you with this right here now you can
drag<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.770> put<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:52.979> underneath<00:01:54.079> just

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
drag this and put this underneath just

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.899 
drag this and put this underneath just
like<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.950> can<00:01:55.979> also<00:01:56.189> format<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.850> a

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
like that you can also format it a

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.999 
like that you can also format it a
little<00:01:57.090> bit<00:01:57.210> if<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.420> doesn't<00:01:57.659> fit<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.079> also<00:01:58.619> make

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
little bit if it doesn't fit I also make

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.709 
little bit if it doesn't fit I also make
my<00:01:59.159> Gladius<00:01:59.610> actually<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> little<00:02:00.270> bit<00:02:00.479> bigger

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
my Gladius actually a little bit bigger

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.920 
my Gladius actually a little bit bigger
than<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.009> default<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.240> but<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.570> just<00:02:03.750> type

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
than the default so but you just type

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.020 
than the default so but you just type
forward<00:02:04.320> slash<00:02:04.350> Gladius<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.460> bring<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.790> up

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
forward slash Gladius to bring this up

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.999 
forward slash Gladius to bring this up
and<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:07.079> can<00:02:07.170> actually<00:02:07.290> make<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.649> bottom

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
and you can actually make the bottom

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.889 
and you can actually make the bottom
margin<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.429> little<00:02:08.670> bit<00:02:08.789> bigger<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.780> gives

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
margin a little bit bigger so that gives

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.170 
margin a little bit bigger so that gives
you<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.020> little<00:02:10.140> bit<00:02:10.259> more<00:02:10.410> room<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.800> add<00:02:11.180> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
you a little bit more room to add the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.780 
you a little bit more room to add the
cooldowns<00:02:13.050> in

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
cooldowns in

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.030 
cooldowns in
but<00:02:14.390> that's<00:02:14.810> really<00:02:15.019> all<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.290> have<00:02:15.349> to<00:02:15.530> do<00:02:15.769> and

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
but that's really all you have to do and

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.479 
but that's really all you have to do and
you<00:02:16.790> can<00:02:16.909> also<00:02:17.060> go<00:02:17.329> to<00:02:17.360> gland<00:02:17.629> ECX<00:02:17.989> and<00:02:18.370> if<00:02:19.370> you

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
you can also go to gland ECX and if you

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.160 
you can also go to gland ECX and if you
want<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.730> really<00:02:20.150> make<00:02:20.299> it<00:02:20.329> perfect<00:02:20.900> you<00:02:20.989> want

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
want to really make it perfect you want

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.199 
want to really make it perfect you want
to<00:02:21.230> make<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.469> like<00:02:22.099> I<00:02:22.340> I'm<00:02:22.579> pretty<00:02:22.849> anal<00:02:23.000> about

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
to make it like I I'm pretty anal about

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.009 
to make it like I I'm pretty anal about
is<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:24.170> know<00:02:24.609> you<00:02:25.609> can<00:02:25.760> also<00:02:25.909> see<00:02:26.629> if<00:02:26.840> I<00:02:26.870> could

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
is you know you can also see if I could

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.940 
is you know you can also see if I could
fight<00:02:27.200> it<00:02:27.319> here<00:02:27.439> for<00:02:27.680> you<00:02:27.859> a<00:02:29.680> group<00:02:30.680> them<00:02:30.859> you

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
fight it here for you a group them you

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.589 
fight it here for you a group them you
can<00:02:31.040> ungroup<00:02:31.189> them<00:02:31.489> so<00:02:31.970> that<00:02:32.120> way<00:02:32.299> you<00:02:32.359> can

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
can ungroup them so that way you can

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.199 
can ungroup them so that way you can
drag<00:02:32.840> them<00:02:33.079> separately<00:02:33.859> so<00:02:34.790> if<00:02:35.000> you<00:02:35.090> really

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
drag them separately so if you really

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.670 
drag them separately so if you really
want<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.480> make<00:02:35.569> it<00:02:35.659> exact<00:02:36.019> you're<00:02:36.379> all<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.590> can

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:41.389 
put it here your let's put Gladius here

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.530 
put it here your let's put Gladius here
for<00:02:41.540> now<00:02:41.709> drag<00:02:42.709> that<00:02:42.950> one<00:02:43.159> there<00:02:43.400> drag<00:02:44.299> that

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
that that's all it is is it's it's super

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.050 
that that's all it is is it's it's super
easy<00:02:50.659> as<00:02:51.139> I<00:02:51.739> was<00:02:51.889> saying<00:02:52.220> that<00:02:52.370> way<00:02:52.549> when

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
easy as I was saying that way when

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.909 
easy as I was saying that way when
you're<00:02:53.180> in<00:02:53.209> arenas<00:02:53.720> you<00:02:53.989> can<00:02:54.139> see<00:02:54.379> the<00:02:54.620> enemy's

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:54.919 
you're in arenas you can see the enemy's

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:58.300 
you're in arenas you can see the enemy's
cooldowns<00:02:55.540> it's<00:02:56.540> kind<00:02:56.750> of<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:56.900> trick<00:02:57.200> but<00:02:57.560> again

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
cooldowns it's kind of a trick but again

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.759 
cooldowns it's kind of a trick but again
as<00:02:58.939> you<00:02:59.030> can<00:02:59.120> see<00:02:59.299> it's<00:02:59.419> fairly<00:02:59.540> easy<00:02:59.689> so<00:03:00.049> try

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
as you can see it's fairly easy so try

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.000 
as you can see it's fairly easy so try
that<00:03:00.799> out<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.069> hopefully<00:03:01.370> that<00:03:01.700> helps<00:03:01.939> you
