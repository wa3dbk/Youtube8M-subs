00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
bit not very much cleaning and this once

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.560 
bit not very much cleaning and this once
you<00:02:12.830> pulled<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.130> main<00:02:13.430> skin<00:02:13.790> skin<00:02:14.210> off<00:02:14.330> there

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
and you pull it out you just rip

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.770 
and you pull it out you just rip
straight<00:02:16.400> out<00:02:16.580> you<00:02:17.090> get<00:02:17.270> that<00:02:17.390> end<00:02:17.630> result

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
straight out you get that end result

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.330 
straight out you get that end result
tiny<00:02:18.230> little<00:02:18.410> bit<00:02:18.590> of<00:02:18.620> clean<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.070> you<00:02:19.160> get<00:02:19.250> the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
tiny little bit of clean and you get the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.010 
tiny little bit of clean and you get the
end<00:02:19.460> result<00:02:19.580> of<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.850> flame<00:02:20.090> so<00:02:20.600> you<00:02:20.660> see<00:02:20.870> where

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
end result of the flame so you see where

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.790 
end result of the flame so you see where
that<00:02:21.110> came<00:02:21.350> from

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
that came from

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.370 
that came from
that's<00:02:22.400> basically<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.480> end<00:02:23.510> of<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:23.960> belly<00:02:24.170> of

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
there's the edge of it and once again

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:09.080 
there's the edge of it and once again
like<00:04:56.260> the<00:04:56.380> flank<00:04:56.650> it'll<00:04:56.919> just<00:04:57.039> pull<00:04:57.220> out

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.470 

so<00:05:09.690> they<00:05:09.840> would<00:05:09.960> pull<00:05:10.139> out<00:05:10.169> a<00:05:10.260> whole<00:05:10.560> Babbitt

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
what makes this muscle tender is that or

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.650 
what makes this muscle tender is that or
tender<00:05:23.460> it<00:05:23.520> shows<00:05:23.730> a<00:05:23.850> tender<00:05:24.180> enough<00:05:24.270> to<00:05:24.570> be

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
able to grill well is the fact that it's

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.740
