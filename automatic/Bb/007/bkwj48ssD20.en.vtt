from<00:00:20.800> benefit<00:00:21.280> I<00:00:21.400> know<00:00:21.700> it's<00:00:22.240> been<00:00:22.450> out<00:00:22.570> for<00:00:22.600> I

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:23.440 
from benefit I know it's been out for I

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.860 
from benefit I know it's been out for I
say<00:00:23.890> maybe<00:00:24.520> probably<00:00:24.820> about<00:00:25.180> a<00:00:25.240> year<00:00:25.300> now<00:00:25.510> but

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:25.870 
say maybe probably about a year now but

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.380 
say maybe probably about a year now but
I'm<00:00:26.410> I<00:00:26.860> money<00:00:27.370> getting<00:00:27.640> my<00:00:27.730> hands<00:00:27.940> on<00:00:28.090> it<00:00:28.150> now

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
I'm I money getting my hands on it now

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.050 
I'm I money getting my hands on it now
because<00:00:28.720> I'm<00:00:28.840> a<00:00:28.870> little<00:00:29.170> behind<00:00:29.260> it<00:00:30.040> is<00:00:30.430> a<00:00:30.670> gel

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
because I'm a little behind it is a gel

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.830 
because I'm a little behind it is a gel
liner<00:00:31.660> so<00:00:32.170> it's<00:00:32.560> really<00:00:33.400> it's<00:00:34.270> long<00:00:34.810> lasting

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
liner so it's really it's long lasting

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.580 
liner so it's really it's long lasting
and<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:36.670> lasts<00:00:36.910> it's<00:00:37.210> quick<00:00:37.750> to<00:00:37.780> drives<00:00:38.200> us<00:00:38.380> was

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
and it lasts it's quick to drives us was

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.610 
and it lasts it's quick to drives us was
instantly<00:00:39.160> drying<00:00:39.520> and<00:00:39.790> it<00:00:40.630> basically<00:00:41.110> you

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
instantly drying and it basically you

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.920 
instantly drying and it basically you
push<00:00:41.980> up<00:00:42.250> the<00:00:42.310> the<00:00:43.030> top<00:00:43.210> I<00:00:43.360> think<00:00:43.510> about<00:00:43.660> two

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
push up the the top I think about two

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.260 
push up the the top I think about two
klicks<00:00:44.200> should<00:00:44.860> kind<00:00:45.070> of<00:00:45.160> do<00:00:45.280> it<00:00:45.400> and<00:00:46.030> make

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
klicks should kind of do it and make

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.050 
klicks should kind of do it and make
sure<00:00:46.300> you<00:00:46.990> scrape<00:00:47.860> off<00:00:48.040> the<00:00:48.100> top<00:00:48.520> because<00:00:48.970> you

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.060 
sure you scrape off the top because you

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.090 
sure you scrape off the top because you
want<00:00:49.270> to<00:00:49.329> keep<00:00:49.750> the<00:00:49.810> tip<00:00:50.200> of<00:00:50.230> it<00:00:50.410> as<00:00:50.560> sharp<00:00:50.890> as

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
want to keep the tip of it as sharp as

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.850 
want to keep the tip of it as sharp as
possible<00:00:51.520> and<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:52.750> actually<00:00:53.110> really<00:00:53.560> liked<00:00:53.710> it

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
possible and I actually really liked it

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.040 
possible and I actually really liked it
that's<00:00:54.040> what<00:00:54.160> I<00:00:54.190> have<00:00:54.400> on<00:00:54.430> today<00:00:54.730> it<00:00:55.329> does<00:00:55.810> take

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
that's what I have on today it does take

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.370 
that's what I have on today it does take
a<00:00:56.079> little<00:00:56.260> bit<00:00:56.440> to<00:00:56.620> get<00:00:56.739> used<00:00:56.800> to<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:57.840> as<00:00:58.840> I

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
a little bit to get used to and as I

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.710 
a little bit to get used to and as I
like<00:00:59.770> an<00:01:00.040> angle<00:01:00.370> brush<00:01:00.489> I<00:01:00.850> like<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.329> fact<00:01:01.480> it's

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
like an angle brush I like the fact it's

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.590 
like an angle brush I like the fact it's
like<00:01:01.840> a<00:01:01.870> pen<00:01:02.200> as<00:01:02.380> well<00:01:02.530> so<00:01:02.710> I<00:01:02.739> really<00:01:03.130> can<00:01:03.340> I

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
like a pen as well so I really can I

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.110 
like a pen as well so I really can I
cook<00:01:04.600> it<00:01:04.809> right<00:01:04.960> into<00:01:05.199> my<00:01:05.440> eye<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.820> only

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
cook it right into my eye the only

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.090 
cook it right into my eye the only
downside<00:01:07.330> is<00:01:07.750> I<00:01:08.080> find<00:01:08.440> too<00:01:08.740> much<00:01:08.830> product

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
downside is I find too much product

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.210 
downside is I find too much product
comes<00:01:09.790> out<00:01:10.030> when<00:01:10.870> even<00:01:11.260> with<00:01:11.409> two<00:01:11.680> pumps<00:01:12.040> it

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
comes out when even with two pumps it

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.370 
comes out when even with two pumps it
kind<00:01:12.490> of<00:01:12.520> keeps<00:01:12.729> spreading<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:14.140> make<00:01:14.350> sure

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
kind of keeps spreading but make sure

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.170 
kind of keeps spreading but make sure
before<00:01:14.860> you<00:01:15.100> use<00:01:15.370> it<00:01:15.400> just<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:15.700> kind<00:01:15.909> of<00:01:15.940> clean

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
before you use it just to kind of clean

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.110 
before you use it just to kind of clean
off<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.510> top<00:01:16.690> because<00:01:16.840> it<00:01:17.020> does<00:01:17.200> dry<00:01:18.120> but

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
off the top because it does dry but

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.399 
off the top because it does dry but
that's<00:01:19.299> the<00:01:19.390> only<00:01:19.450> downside<00:01:19.900> of<00:01:20.020> it<00:01:20.110> I<00:01:20.140> did

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
that's the only downside of it I did

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:21.870 
that's the only downside of it I did
like<00:01:20.590> it<00:01:20.620> it<00:01:20.979> does<00:01:21.130> take<00:01:21.370> a<00:01:21.400> little<00:01:21.490> while<00:01:21.729> to

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
like it it does take a little while to

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.850 
like it it does take a little while to
get<00:01:21.940> used<00:01:22.150> to<00:01:22.330> but<00:01:22.840> for<00:01:23.049> those<00:01:23.380> of<00:01:23.440> you<00:01:23.680> that

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
actually like a little

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.270 
actually like a little
earlier<00:02:08.330> on<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.539> top<00:02:08.720> but<00:02:09.319> basically<00:02:09.890> with

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
earlier on the top but basically with

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.809 
earlier on the top but basically with
the<00:02:10.310> Wanda<00:02:10.940> bitch<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:11.920> don't<00:02:12.920> know<00:02:13.040> can<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:13.250> see

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
the Wanda bitch I don't know can you see

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.170 
the Wanda bitch I don't know can you see
I'll<00:02:14.450> zoom<00:02:14.810> right<00:02:15.049> in<00:02:15.230> on<00:02:15.319> that<00:02:15.379> and<00:02:15.830> it<00:02:16.459> curves

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
I'll zoom right in on that and it curves

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.259 
I'll zoom right in on that and it curves
so<00:02:17.659> it's<00:02:17.810> like<00:02:17.930> add<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.260> dip<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:20.150> it

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
so it's like add a dip and and it

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.789 
so it's like add a dip and and it
basically<00:02:20.420> hooks<00:02:20.840> right<00:02:20.989> into<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.530> lash<00:02:21.650> and

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
basically hooks right into the lash and

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.199 
basically hooks right into the lash and
kind<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:21.950> blow<00:02:22.340> dryers<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.909> hair<00:02:23.060> is

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
kind of blow dryers the hair is

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.149 
kind of blow dryers the hair is
basically<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:23.989> really<00:02:24.500> curls<00:02:24.739> them<00:02:24.980> and

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
basically and really curls them and

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.069 
basically and really curls them and
defines<00:02:25.489> them<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.000> because<00:02:26.629> each<00:02:26.840> little

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
defines them and because each little

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.140 
defines them and because each little
spoke<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:28.280> coming<00:02:28.519> out<00:02:28.610> of<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.790> brush<00:02:28.940> will

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
spoke to coming out of the brush will

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.630 
spoke to coming out of the brush will
just<00:02:29.360> kind<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.569> grab<00:02:29.870> each<00:02:30.560> little<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.280> lash

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.970 
just kind of grab each little and lash
and<00:02:32.030> its<00:02:32.390> really<00:02:32.629> really<00:02:32.870> defines<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:33.769> it

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
and its really really defines so it

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.559 
and its really really defines so it
really<00:02:34.190> i<00:02:34.280> have<00:02:34.579> it<00:02:34.700> on<00:02:34.760> Ezeli<00:02:34.879> and<00:02:35.269> actually

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
really i have it on Ezeli and actually

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:36.970 
really i have it on Ezeli and actually
like<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.930> because<00:02:36.019> to<00:02:36.260> rod<00:02:36.500> doesn't<00:02:36.650> come<00:02:36.890> on

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
like it because to rod doesn't come on

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.369 
like it because to rod doesn't come on
the<00:02:37.040> brush<00:02:37.190> as<00:02:37.370> well<00:02:37.549> and<00:02:37.819> it<00:02:38.690> just<00:02:39.079> gives<00:02:39.349> that

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
the brush as well and it just gives that

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.770 
the brush as well and it just gives that
really<00:02:39.709> nice<00:02:39.829> little<00:02:40.310> curl<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:41.060> instant<00:02:41.510> lift

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
really nice little curl and instant lift

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.220 
really nice little curl and instant lift
and<00:02:42.170> that<00:02:43.160> is<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.519> roller<00:02:43.879> lash<00:02:44.209> from<00:02:44.540> benefit

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
and that is the roller lash from benefit

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.309 
and that is the roller lash from benefit
now<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.799> would<00:02:45.980> be<00:02:46.010> they<00:02:46.609> have<00:02:46.790> their<00:02:47.120> real<00:02:47.390> la

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
now it would be they have their real la

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.140 
now it would be they have their real la
mascara<00:02:48.859> as<00:02:49.010> well<00:02:49.190> I<00:02:49.250> think<00:02:49.430> that's<00:02:49.549> more<00:02:49.790> full

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
mascara as well I think that's more full

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.210 
mascara as well I think that's more full
coverage<00:02:50.540> for<00:02:50.780> a<00:02:50.810> nice<00:02:51.019> out<00:02:51.290> this<00:02:51.769> snow<00:02:52.010> would

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
coverage for a nice out this snow would

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.430 
coverage for a nice out this snow would
be<00:02:52.340> for<00:02:52.579> more<00:02:52.819> I<00:02:53.120> would<00:02:53.629> think<00:02:53.659> kind<00:02:54.049> of<00:02:54.079> every

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
be for more I would think kind of every

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.229 
be for more I would think kind of every
day<00:02:54.620> or<00:02:54.950> even<00:02:55.519> if<00:02:55.670> you're<00:02:55.760> going<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.090> wedding

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
day or even if you're going to a wedding

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.449 
day or even if you're going to a wedding
or<00:02:56.599> an<00:02:56.720> event<00:02:56.810> but<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:57.650> can<00:02:57.799> build<00:02:57.980> it<00:02:58.159> up<00:02:58.250> as

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
or an event but you can build it up as

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.800 
or an event but you can build it up as
well<00:02:58.609> so<00:02:58.849> it<00:02:58.909> doesn't<00:02:59.120> kind<00:02:59.269> of<00:02:59.329> comp<00:02:59.480> together

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
well so it doesn't kind of comp together

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.309 
well so it doesn't kind of comp together
so<00:03:00.409> that<00:03:00.440> is<00:03:00.920> this<00:03:01.250> guy<00:03:01.459> as<00:03:01.879> then<00:03:02.510> I<00:03:02.690> also<00:03:02.930> have

hydration<00:04:13.910> arraignment<00:04:14.449> it<00:04:14.930> has<00:04:15.079> coconut<00:04:15.290> oil

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
hydration arraignment it has coconut oil

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.069 
hydration arraignment it has coconut oil
in<00:04:15.949> it<00:04:16.039> which<00:04:16.310> really<00:04:16.700> gives<00:04:16.969> an<00:04:17.150> intense<00:04:17.719> high

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
in it which really gives an intense high

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.279 
in it which really gives an intense high
eration<00:04:18.439> and<00:04:18.709> it<00:04:19.280> also<00:04:19.489> has<00:04:19.900> orange<00:04:20.900> honey

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:24.259 
blossom and as many things with orange

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:25.899 
blossom and as many things with orange
they<00:04:24.710> give<00:04:24.860> that<00:04:24.979> room<00:04:25.159> radiance<00:04:25.639> to<00:04:25.789> the<00:04:25.819> skin

they give that room radiance to the skin

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:27.820 
they give that room radiance to the skin
so<00:04:26.240> it<00:04:26.300> gives<00:04:26.389> a<00:04:26.509> true<00:04:26.539> radiance<00:04:27.169> and<00:04:27.349> glow<00:04:27.409> and

my facebook and I got a lot of real
mixed<00:05:10.580> reviews<00:05:10.940> on<00:05:11.120> it<00:05:11.150> so<00:05:11.750> I<00:05:11.779> used<00:05:12.319> it<00:05:12.529> at<00:05:12.680> the

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
mixed reviews on it so I used it at the

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.790 
mixed reviews on it so I used it at the
weekend<00:05:13.219> of<00:05:13.550> my<00:05:13.729> birthday<00:05:13.789> and<00:05:14.360> I<00:05:15.020> actually

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
weekend of my birthday and I actually

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.749 
weekend of my birthday and I actually
quite<00:05:16.520> like<00:05:16.580> dish<00:05:17.090> and<00:05:17.509> it<00:05:18.050> isn't<00:05:18.590> oil<00:05:18.830> so<00:05:19.430> I

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 
quite like dish and it isn't oil so I

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.550 
quite like dish and it isn't oil so I
think<00:05:19.909> that's<00:05:20.210> what<00:05:20.509> really<00:05:20.719> sold<00:05:21.080> it<00:05:21.259> for<00:05:21.409> me

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
think that's what really sold it for me

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.189 
think that's what really sold it for me
it<00:05:22.460> was<00:05:22.669> really<00:05:22.729> hydrating<00:05:23.509> on<00:05:23.569> the<00:05:23.659> skin<00:05:23.990> and

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:24.199 
it was really hydrating on the skin and

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.920 
it was really hydrating on the skin and
when<00:05:24.800> it<00:05:24.919> went<00:05:25.069> on<00:05:25.159> it's<00:05:25.370> basically<00:05:26.300> soaked<00:05:26.690> in

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
when it went on it's basically soaked in

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.709 
when it went on it's basically soaked in
within<00:05:27.259> I'd<00:05:27.650> say<00:05:27.680> a<00:05:28.159> minute<00:05:28.639> or<00:05:28.759> two<00:05:28.909> it<00:05:29.330> didn't

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:29.719 
within I'd say a minute or two it didn't

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:31.930 
within I'd say a minute or two it didn't
smell<00:05:29.900> I<00:05:30.409> suppose<00:05:30.830> classes<00:05:31.250> quite<00:05:31.400> right<00:05:31.610> it

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
smell I suppose classes quite right it

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.029 
smell I suppose classes quite right it
didn't<00:05:32.240> smell<00:05:32.360> like<00:05:32.539> most<00:05:33.139> of<00:05:33.500> the<00:05:33.680> cream

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
didn't smell like most of the cream

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:38.350 
didn't smell like most of the cream
based<00:05:34.310> tans<00:05:34.789> and<00:05:35.089> I<00:05:35.900> found<00:05:36.259> and<00:05:36.909> it<00:05:37.909> worked

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
based tans and I found and it worked

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.589 
based tans and I found and it worked
really<00:05:38.539> well<00:05:38.659> that<00:05:38.900> the<00:05:38.990> only<00:05:39.169> downside<00:05:39.949> I

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
really well that the only downside I

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:44.110 
really well that the only downside I
thought<00:05:41.599> that<00:05:42.050> when<00:05:42.440> I<00:05:42.469> showered<00:05:43.250> maybe<00:05:43.940> I

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
thought that when I showered maybe I

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.749 
thought that when I showered maybe I
didn't<00:05:44.629> like<00:05:45.229> using<00:05:45.560> off<00:05:45.800> soap<00:05:46.159> or<00:05:46.430> something

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 
didn't like using off soap or something

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.279 
didn't like using off soap or something
share<00:05:47.000> it<00:05:47.089> off<00:05:47.180> because<00:05:47.389> I<00:05:47.509> suppose<00:05:47.750> oil<00:05:48.020> and

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
share it off because I suppose oil and

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.249 
share it off because I suppose oil and
water<00:05:48.469> don't<00:05:48.589> mix<00:05:48.800> and<00:05:49.240> I<00:05:50.240> found<00:05:50.870> it<00:05:51.020> kind<00:05:51.139> of

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:51.259 
water don't mix and I found it kind of

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:53.800 
water don't mix and I found it kind of
developed<00:05:51.740> a<00:05:52.009> bit<00:05:52.400> more<00:05:52.699> throughout<00:05:53.449> the<00:05:53.509> day

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
developed a bit more throughout the day

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.809 
developed a bit more throughout the day
and<00:05:54.080> it<00:05:54.680> went<00:05:54.860> a<00:05:54.889> little<00:05:55.009> bit<00:05:55.190> kind<00:05:55.339> of<00:05:55.430> orangey

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:55.819 
and it went a little bit kind of orangey

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:57.730 
and it went a little bit kind of orangey
on<00:05:55.909> my<00:05:56.029> hands<00:05:56.240> but<00:05:56.419> maybe<00:05:56.629> that<00:05:56.779> my<00:05:57.139> fault<00:05:57.529> I

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
on my hands but maybe that my fault I

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.769 
on my hands but maybe that my fault I
should<00:05:58.099> probably<00:05:58.250> used<00:05:58.940> a<00:05:59.120> bit<00:05:59.240> more<00:05:59.270> so<00:05:59.629> but

00:05:59.769 --> 00:05:59.779 
should probably used a bit more so but

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:01.300 
should probably used a bit more so but

never really work by the myths but this
I<00:06:40.689> absolutely<00:06:41.689> thought<00:06:41.930> it<00:06:42.110> was<00:06:42.229> just

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:42.529

fantastic<00:06:42.919> I<00:06:43.610> had<00:06:44.210> a<00:06:44.449> bit<00:06:44.659> like<00:06:44.900> around<00:06:45.080> my

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:45.349 
fantastic I had a bit like around my

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:47.320 
fantastic I had a bit like around my
hand<00:06:45.680> from<00:06:46.219> the<00:06:46.370> town<00:06:46.520> organic<00:06:46.969> as<00:06:47.120> it

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
developed a little bit too much for me

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.839
