00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
access to the hands-free control that

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.580 
access to the hands-free control that
hands-free<00:01:06.090> with<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.330> controls<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.439> can

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
hands-free with the controls so you can

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.010

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
to go ahead and plug this in here and

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.170 
to go ahead and plug this in here and
plug<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.540> into<00:01:18.689> ciliary<00:01:22.070> herring

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.580 

let's<00:01:25.840> try<00:01:25.990> to<00:01:26.050> pair<00:01:26.200> so<00:01:26.320> we're<00:01:26.410> going<00:01:26.500> to

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
let's try to pair so we're going to

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.870 
let's try to pair so we're going to
pause<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.920> video<00:01:27.010> just<00:01:27.190> for<00:01:27.460> a<00:01:27.490> second<00:01:27.790> while

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
pause the video just for a second while

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.870 
pause the video just for a second while
we<00:01:27.910> pick<00:01:28.650> all<00:01:29.650> right<00:01:29.800> so<00:01:30.100> we're<00:01:30.280> paired<00:01:30.550> up<00:01:30.700> now

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
we pick all right so we're paired up now

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.310 
we pick all right so we're paired up now
there's<00:01:31.270> a<00:01:31.330> little<00:01:31.630> blue<00:01:31.750> light<00:01:31.810> it's<00:01:32.110> hard<00:01:32.260> to

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
there's a little blue light it's hard to

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.230 
there's a little blue light it's hard to
see<00:01:32.500> so<00:01:32.800> stretchy<00:01:33.010> just<00:01:33.160> you're<00:01:33.310> paired<00:01:33.550> under

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
see so stretchy just you're paired under

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.570 
see so stretchy just you're paired under
them<00:01:34.390> on<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:34.900> hands-free<00:01:35.410> device<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:36.070> you

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
them on the hands-free device and you

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.070 
them on the hands-free device and you
just<00:01:36.760> basically<00:01:36.910> surly<00:01:37.300> three<00:01:37.450> controls<00:01:37.810> one

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
just basically surly three controls one

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.850 
just basically surly three controls one
is<00:01:38.200> playing<00:01:38.470> pause<00:01:38.650> one<00:01:39.250> is<00:01:40.470> next<00:01:41.470> track

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
is playing pause one is next track

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.960 
is playing pause one is next track
previous<00:01:42.420> track<00:01:43.420> okay<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:44.590> then<00:01:44.890> so<00:01:45.640> go<00:01:45.760> good

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
previous track okay and then so go good

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:55.110 
previous track okay and then so go good
and<00:01:46.060> pip<00:01:46.240> play<00:01:51.150> pause<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:54.250> then<00:01:54.610> again<00:01:55.030> this

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
and pip play pause and then again this

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.220 
and pip play pause and then again this
is<00:01:55.180> all<00:01:55.390> streaming<00:01:55.690> through<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.050> phone

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
is all streaming through the phone

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:12.200 
is all streaming through the phone
itself

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.550 

and<00:02:13.210> then<00:02:13.360> this<00:02:13.480> is<00:02:13.660> skipping<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.170> next

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
and then this is skipping to the next

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.320 
and then this is skipping to the next
track<00:02:14.740> on<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.070> phone<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.610> takes<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.910> second<00:02:16.240> our

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
track on the phone it takes a second our

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.970 
track on the phone it takes a second our
connection<00:02:16.840> here<00:02:17.020> isn't<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.410> great

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
connection here isn't that great

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.980 
connection here isn't that great
so<00:02:18.370> we're<00:02:18.670> going<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.880> head<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.090> wait<00:02:19.210> but<00:02:19.480> it

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
so we're going to head and wait but it

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.690 
so we're going to head and wait but it
does<00:02:20.200> work<00:02:20.380> we're<00:02:21.070> going<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.220> try<00:02:21.400> one<00:02:21.430> more

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
does work we're going to try one more

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.980 
does work we're going to try one more
time<00:02:21.910> really<00:02:22.180> quickly<00:02:22.240> with<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.690> hands-free

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
time really quickly with the hands-free

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.280 
time really quickly with the hands-free
phone<00:02:23.650> call<00:02:23.890> option<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.460> see<00:02:24.550> how<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.730> works

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:36.680
