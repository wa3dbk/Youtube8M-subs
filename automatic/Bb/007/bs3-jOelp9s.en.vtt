00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.039
 friends farmers friends farmer hello 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.779
 welcome to the farm welcome to 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.260
 cocotte tv today I present to you 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.080
 the corsair revenge only at 65 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.640
 he is none other than the little brother of the cac 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.199
 77 of 95 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.149
 I was eager to receive it 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.739
 since it is a compact keyboard and 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.540
 as you know I like them 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.070
 keyboards that do not take a place in 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.010
 because of our offices especially 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.629
 cluttered it's all about corsair here 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.710
 so much to tell you that the competition 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.629
 will take dear 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.770
 I think in particular of my topo by 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.930
 example which is an excellent keyboard 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.640
 it's undeniable but in terms of 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.559
 finish for example takes an old 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.680
 old cap at the holes of 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.480
 nose there is nothing to say we are on 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.430
 something akin to the dock 70 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.129
 it's ok 95 which so far we 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.670
 have praised the look as at the level of 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.680
 bundle 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.030
 as you see start guide 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.500
 quick warranty clause that's all so 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.830
 this is we are going to find jean the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.220
 little carton the cable so which is when 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.110
 you see detachable so mini usb 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.909
 on one side usb of the other not plated 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.909
 blue as mentioned this tradition 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.890
 with the series emergencies necessarily of this 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.810
 nice blues but do not sulk our 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.100
 pleasure the cable is detachable which 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.159
 only for transport in lan 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.600
 it's royal and above all it's secure at 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.280
 level of the technique there is no 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.079
 great thing to say just a keyboard 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.210
 relatively simple but as you 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.150
 note we really find the look 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.630
 little big brothers forgiveness with 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.310
 the famous anodized plate of gray which 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.079
 is beautiful and beautiful every time 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.119
 on the top banner we have the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.009
 anodized corsair button again 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.610
 to turn off the volume the button for 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.829
 go down 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.240
 turn up the volume the button that goes 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.280
 allow to block the windows key 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.250
 good there is pretty much everything you need 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.930
 indication LEDs for blocking 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.350
 uppercase and scroll doc no 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.550
 numilog since there is no pavement 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.200
 strong digital morning that it requires 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.030
 at the level of lettering not much 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.350
 it's rather classic to bring 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.480
 a little bit of color helps 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:23.000
 escutcheon and arrows are gray with a 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.600
 white marking the space bar possesses 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.540
 a small this yard to st to decorate 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.800
 all summer capes are a bit 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.970
 less qualitative than on the big 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.470
 brothers since they do not have the 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.550
 particularly soft coating they 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.290
 are a little more granular 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.420
 this being not so bad either 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.730
 we find on the line of functions 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.890
 some new multimedia commands 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.230
 stop previous pieces but you 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.540
 next piece we have pretty much 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.670
 go around what the case was proposing 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.510
 65 in terms of features at 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.160
 slice level 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.640
 nothing particular no rest mans 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.440
 this time the right side slice 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.920
 and the left lateral edge does not bring 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.510
 nothing on the one above we find the 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.940
 system we had on others to 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.860
 know the setting of the print by a button 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.269
 slider with a good bios setting 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.180
 practical like your motherboard does not 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.090
 do not recognize all this below us 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.280
 have a location on which you 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.900
 can I put it in the light come 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.420
 connect the cable with a small channel 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.579
 in order to pass the braided cable 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.610
 on the front of the rubber pads on 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.630
 the back of non-plastic pasta 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.010
 rubberized which is a little bit 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.660
 pity because for having used 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.640
 slip a little bit is not good 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.280
 naughty but good and as he is more 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.840
 nice not too uplifted good rated is 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.060
 not reach derrien if you do not use 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.010
 not the cable I think I have to little 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.109
 close does the trick he has no flaws 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.359
 the only flaw I would tend to 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:47.030
 give it back i'll show you from 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:49.010
 next it will allow you to discover the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.760
 red sweatshirt underneath that I you 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.220
 presents a little more detail the 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.700
 only one defect he has is that 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.380
 some keys are not in the format 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.570
 standard 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.850
 so you will not be able to put a set 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.250
 from heike personal case I would have put in 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.440
 box bench above for example the 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.780
 space key is not the same I 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.070
 was looking for my shift key that is not 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.049
 no longer the same focus 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.789
 they are not quite the same 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.739
 sizes so obviously will change 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:20.239
 everything else but on the keys of 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.430
 operate the double keys forgiveness 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.979
 it will not necessarily 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.130
 at the tariff level is 90 euros 89 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.120
 dollars or 89 euros exactly 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.560
 clearly it's quite 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.169
 competitive in so far as points 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.880
 of pau you will get for 88 90 euros and 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.729
 to take him a little bit more 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.949
 big but at the level of the finish there 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.780
 has nothing to do so really corsairs to 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.120
 my sense hits a big blow on the 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.320
 compact keyboard if they are very likely 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.050
 to replace permanently 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.090
 no to the pot so here I invite you to 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.310
 come the reee read forgiveness the real rest 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.930
 decidedly the written test that will allow 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.030
 on cowcotland.com and I wish you 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.800
 a very good day in our 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.250
 company and tell you see you soon 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.250
 goodbye
