 I'm afraid for old consoles the 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.739

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.750

 such a facebook site and everything so I 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.760
 wanted to tell you something about me year 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.959
 last I tested something for this 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.180
 that they have the old ones finally I did 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.970
 that on the old consoles after I 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.760
 do not know if it works on the news 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.799
 in fact it was the 27th of June 27th of October 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.470
 pardon and the game was out to the states 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.720
 united I too wanted to be the 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.549
 tran for to buy it what does that 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.000
 I had I had in mind I thought 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:05.239
 and why not put our console 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.090
 united states did you put your region states 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.870
 united i do that i create an account because 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.150
 that we have to create an account 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.940
 if not the story in itself that you have 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.859
 created normally it's finally Norman 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.930
 this is the region by ditches France 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:20.090
 and created an account and well your account 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.160
 it's logically France is so that in 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.210
 time when you put it on us 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.720
 object to create an account 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:30.800
 here and after you can do for example 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.080

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.120
 the beginning and saw that they showed us 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.320
 the superstars maybe this is one 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.700
 of them that will be on the fact that every 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.260

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:04.540
 be careful we can know that 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.720
 can say that too because 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.890
 normally the six pros 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.810
 last but not each time they are 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.950
 denounce they unveil first 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.090
 super late that's what there is at 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.690
 least one who are worried about the 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.340
