00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.330
 in saceur is one of the must applications 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.690
 have to have without a doubt about 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.700
 your iphone and ipad devices with 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.259
 obviously the collaboration of yours 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.320
 mac 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.940
 unfortunately for our windows friends 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.609
 momentarily this is not available 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.340
 application through stage air 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.519
 share a text an image or a 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.830
 document even even a video not 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.769
 will be more a titan business but vi 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.329
 just a simple drag and drop 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.149
 taking advantage of your wifi networks 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.309
 obviously you always have to be under the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.170
 same network and failing that 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.450
 we're going to take advantage of the technology 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.550
 bluetooth 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.050
 once the app is installed on 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.270
 all your devices 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.090
 we will move inside the mac 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.550
 we will go to open the silent and in the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.590
 menubar we will find the circular icon 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.360
 of our application 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.390
 at the same time we will move 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.789
 inside our iphone or ipad in the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.630
 which we will have our application of 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.740
 in stage so as to allow 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.110
 switching on the share 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.990
 we could also safely use them 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.580
 both at the same time as this 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.710
 point the game is done 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.290
 and it is really easy all you need 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.990
 drag your file into the menu a 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.290
 drop down on the mac and then find it for you 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.750
 directly into the chosen device one 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.939
 Once the file has finished loading 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.040
 we could easily open it with i 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.490
 stage or through the menu of 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.869
 sharing located at the top right 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.780
 open it through our application 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.270
 installed inside iphone or ipad 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.640
 in such a way as to have a more visual 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.649
 complete but it is also the possibility of 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.170
 modify our file if it is 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.130
 can advise you for example for a 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.530
 pdf file to use pdf expert for one 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.079
 reverse transmission or pass the 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.979
 files from iphone or ipad to your mac 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.530
 I remind you that the app will have to use 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.420
 grant free access to yours 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.000
 photo library giving you the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.330
 ability to move one or more photos 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.850
 on the mac 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.660
 you can also move a 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.780
 files from your dropbox in it share 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.960
 through the tab sharing a primis il 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.730
 which will then send it to the mac 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.490
 from now on share any kind of 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.830
 file will really be a breeze 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.590
 never again will we look for useless guides 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.850
 scattered around the web but grace hince to be 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.280
 sog drag and drop 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.080
 we will bring a user experience of how 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.230
 division is maximum levels within 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.660
 of our devices pass a movie 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.180
 within them also in quality vi 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.890
 it will even be really simple and 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.540
 fast 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.510
 you will find on stage was inside 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.400
 the app store without any expense 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.450
 obviously being an application 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.520
 Free 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.570
 only drawback we have the famous banners 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.520
 advertising inside 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.950
 application quietly 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.030
 removable with 89 cents is a 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.130
 purchase in the app 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.570
