a gluten-free white flour blend that's a
bread<00:00:35.820> one<00:00:36.090> I'm<00:00:36.450> going<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.989> add<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.730> some

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
bread one I'm going to add to this some

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.360 
bread one I'm going to add to this some
salt<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.480> then<00:00:40.290> I've<00:00:40.410> got<00:00:40.590> some<00:00:40.620> yeast<00:00:41.100> and

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
salt and then I've got some yeast and

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.970 
salt and then I've got some yeast and
I'm<00:00:42.300> going<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.570> mix<00:00:42.930> these<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.559> really<00:00:44.070> well<00:00:44.600> in

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
I'm going to mix these in really well in

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.860 
I'm going to mix these in really well in
this<00:00:46.980> bread<00:00:47.370> flour<00:00:47.730> mix<00:00:48.090> there's<00:00:48.600> already

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
this bread flour mix there's already

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.430 
this bread flour mix there's already
xanthan<00:00:49.739> gum<00:00:50.210> but<00:00:51.210> if<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.629> bread<00:00:51.870> flour<00:00:52.050> mix

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
xanthan gum but if the bread flour mix

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.959 
xanthan gum but if the bread flour mix
that<00:00:52.649> you're<00:00:52.770> using<00:00:53.039> doesn't<00:00:53.610> contain

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
that you're using doesn't contain

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.939 
that you're using doesn't contain
xanthan<00:00:54.539> gum<00:00:54.570> then<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.410> think<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.800> good

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
xanthan gum then I think it's a good

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.490 
xanthan gum then I think it's a good
idea<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.399> add<00:00:56.579> some<00:00:56.940> I'm<00:00:57.270> going<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.930> add<00:00:58.079> water

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
idea to add some I'm going to add water

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.189 
idea to add some I'm going to add water
and<00:00:59.039> I'm<00:00:59.579> going<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.850> add<00:01:00.000> more<00:01:00.329> water<00:01:00.600> than

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and I'm going to add more water than

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.399 
and I'm going to add more water than
normal<00:01:01.969> you<00:01:02.969> want<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.300> get<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.480> consistency

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
normal you want to get a consistency

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.789 
normal you want to get a consistency
whereby<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.070> literally<00:01:05.909> just<00:01:06.240> drops<00:01:06.810> off<00:01:07.200> your

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
whereby it literally just drops off your

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.390 
whereby it literally just drops off your
whisk<00:01:09.080> so<00:01:10.080> see<00:01:10.350> here<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:10.890> literally

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
whisk so see here it's just literally

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.820 
whisk so see here it's just literally
falling<00:01:12.060> off<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.570> that's<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.650> right

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
falling off and that's the right

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.899 
falling off and that's the right
consistency<00:01:14.310> for<00:01:15.110> this<00:01:16.110> bread<00:01:16.700> there's<00:01:17.700> no

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
consistency for this bread there's no

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.120 
consistency for this bread there's no
gluten<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.630> here<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.229> there's<00:01:19.409> no<00:01:19.530> need<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.979> do

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
gluten in here so there's no need to do

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.609 
gluten in here so there's no need to do
any<00:01:20.280> kneading<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.970> all<00:01:21.630> I'm<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.080> do<00:01:22.350> is

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
any kneading and all I'm going to do is

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.460 
any kneading and all I'm going to do is
whisk<00:01:23.189> whisk<00:01:23.520> vigorously<00:01:24.290> for<00:01:25.290> about<00:01:25.320> a

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
whisk whisk vigorously for about a

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.390 
whisk whisk vigorously for about a
minute<00:01:25.710> or<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:27.590> then<00:01:28.590> I'm<00:01:28.740> going<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:28.979> add<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
minute or so then I'm going to add the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.090 
minute or so then I'm going to add the
seeds

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
seeds

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.640 
seeds
and<00:01:31.820> I'm<00:01:32.000> going<00:01:32.180> to<00:01:32.390> whisk<00:01:32.630> those<00:01:32.960> in<00:01:34.150> and<00:01:35.650> then

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
and I'm going to whisk those in and then

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.590 
and I'm going to whisk those in and then
simple<00:01:37.159> I'm<00:01:37.370> going<00:01:37.580> to<00:01:37.700> pour<00:01:38.000> this<00:01:38.150> into<00:01:38.420> a

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
simple I'm going to pour this into a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.800 
simple I'm going to pour this into a
loaf<00:01:38.870> tin<00:01:42.040> then<00:01:43.040> I'm<00:01:43.190> going<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:43.729> smooth<00:01:44.210> this

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
loaf tin then I'm going to smooth this

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.980 
loaf tin then I'm going to smooth this
out<00:01:45.080> and<00:01:45.650> then<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.790> final<00:01:47.270> trick<00:01:47.510> which<00:01:47.720> again

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
out and then the final trick which again

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.050 
out and then the final trick which again
might<00:01:48.260> seem<00:01:48.530> slightly<00:01:49.040> strange<00:01:49.430> but<00:01:49.850> bear

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
might seem slightly strange but bear

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.660 
might seem slightly strange but bear
with<00:01:50.090> me<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:50.660> works<00:01:51.050> is<00:01:51.710> I'm<00:01:51.920> going<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:52.250> do<00:01:52.400> a

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
with me it works is I'm going to do a

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.200 
with me it works is I'm going to do a
spoon<00:01:53.270> dipped<00:01:53.660> in<00:01:53.869> cold<00:01:54.200> water<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:55.220> then<00:01:55.940> just

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
spoon dipped in cold water and then just

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.770 
spoon dipped in cold water and then just
run<00:01:56.509> that<00:01:56.720> along<00:01:57.940> so<00:01:58.940> effectively<00:01:59.450> you<00:01:59.600> get

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
run that along so effectively you get

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.029 
run that along so effectively you get
like<00:01:59.990> a<00:02:00.020> film<00:02:00.440> of<00:02:00.650> water<00:02:01.240> over<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.360> top<00:02:02.600> and

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
like a film of water over the top and

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.109 
like a film of water over the top and
this<00:02:04.039> helps<00:02:04.399> give<00:02:04.580> you<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.789> really<00:02:05.119> nice<00:02:05.330> crust

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
this helps give you a really nice crust

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.400 
this helps give you a really nice crust
finally<00:02:08.119> I'm<00:02:08.330> going<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.600> sprinkle<00:02:08.899> some<00:02:09.200> more

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
finally I'm going to sprinkle some more

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:18.360 
finally I'm going to sprinkle some more
seeds<00:02:09.709> over<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.160> top

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.790 

and<00:02:18.550> into<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.330> oven<00:02:19.420> for<00:02:19.810> about<00:02:19.900> an<00:02:20.019> hour<00:02:20.260> and

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
and into the oven for about an hour and

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.640 
and into the oven for about an hour and
there<00:02:21.700> you<00:02:21.849> have<00:02:22.060> it<00:02:22.269> my<00:02:22.660> gluten-free<00:02:23.170> bread
