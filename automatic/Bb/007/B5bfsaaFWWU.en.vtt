00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.100
 by sharing this video with me there is the

 AndrÃ© also participated in that 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:19.509
 that customer of reputation for can

 be there there is a caring and has 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.920
 Fuck you guys and whistle. 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.920
 Come on, let's go. 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:36.460
 opÃ¡ a lap sleep cover that has 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:42.369
 two places there that we have to go 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.420
 there the guys there i believe it will be 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.909
 difficult 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.909
 - It will not be difficult here 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.409
 costinha 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:02.729
 I'm going to get into that face that even put 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.729
 rocks the snapper here call the guys already 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.549
 the other there another 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:13.180
 the other position so that someone died 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:17.380
 badly created car left it just that 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.730
 It was me and one more tip that the others 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:24.299
 They've fallen but I'm going to finish the recording. 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.299
 so even if the car leave come 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.120
 it will get old because he was 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.400
 Playing with me, I had a little time. 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.870
 I was already recording when I solved it. 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.310
 he crashed and was able to complete the 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.040
 mission if I complete the mission that I 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.030
 I leave right here and I record a close with 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:50.790
 he then does not get upset does not help 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:54.660
 because the time I decided to record 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:59.790
 internet resolves to speak seriously 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.790
 here because there are people hell deals 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.310
 let's go here in caution because it has 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.310
 many people 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:17.680
 opa with that unique attitude of having read 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:21.700
 and not from a wacky little box 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:26.290
 late 2012 line will take effect 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.110
 this here was mole that was soft 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.460
 I think the last one is over. 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.560
 So this was personal 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.510
 this is video today then prepare 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.490
 that'll do but said to bring 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.260
 the channel inviting you there to be 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.870
 participating in some missions with me 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.459
 But that's a hug, stay in peace. 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.530
 I hope you liked it if you liked it already. 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.190

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.760
