00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.059
 all the time before - no to describe the ports back 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.159
 in mathematics it can start to rise slowly 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:20.400
 and who knows the man in the retirement home 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.079
 steeper up what's in the works 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.279
 Expense concerns 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.699
 the PROGEN 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.349
 intensity 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.349
 and the occurring ones 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.300
 After several our increased 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.550
 Freestyle like others like that 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.550
 Euro is illuminated 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.060
 Helpful because it is every year now it is so that the top of 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.590
 three events 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.590
 be introduced 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.640
 For example, what was represented at the beginning we claim is the 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.760
 see red bull box 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.760
 that did not exist then 1 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.290
 The then first price for the viewer does not really work out anyway 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.400
 more and more and the world was really very proud 87 1 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.410
 not give this year 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.410
 no matter how good their performance 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.570
 the youngest are 4 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.290
 Pölten become 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.100
 logically 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.070
 are important 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.250
 will be about 180 children at the first concert 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.740
 that is now in the meantime 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.700
 We can not climb that any more. Waldeck 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.260
 only 28 hours they have long been a logistical limit is simply not more 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.030
 possible 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.260
 it is in the meantime at 7001 it is not even that a whole 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.660
 very big goal 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.479
 SMA 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.649
 We want to keep Berlin at the top of the Velden 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.940
 thus showing understanding for the entire planning 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.930
 want to go a way 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.449
 still is 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:15.059
 as the first still down to the lowlands according to rarities and when he was at 75 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:17.030
 I said than in the city 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.799
 finish a small circus 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.209
 it just followed from 550 on 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.359
 this pattern for this year 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:30.479
 instead of wild guys we go from number one to the main character 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.890
 world 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.219
 matching color is set 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.269
 Dogs have 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.779
 for your own customers 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:39.999
 that was enough for the mother of the group of the middle 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:43.309
 Of course, we have several monstrous outcomes 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:45.400
 we are fine 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.429
 many and Konstantin Rivkin 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:49.459
 not everything is and seeks 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.959
 the device again 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.319
 and Feel and 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.700
 The auxiliary periods GM namely namely the Bundesliga 1 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.870
 Meanwhile, we have helped Peter Haiti build the day itself 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.810
 Scenes 7 We have the studio to look after the children with their studio 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.170
 make-up century then it pulls the length 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:16.869
 Pave the way if you do not have your own account 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.969
 Hertha be another 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.170
 then we will want to get together «around us 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.969
 while being 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.199
 There is hope that they will get fit 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.369
 At the moment, it just so it just works 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:37.110
 the fists 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.359
 It started the first 5 million 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.899
 I know with which functions 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:44.899
 the first group is on the run 

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:51.259
 "That has not been fair right now 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.469
 they were scared is just not going to be put off 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.860
 Analyst Christoph Schultes harvest time after one and a half years 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.279
 boost again 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:03.409
 Review 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.209
 that was maybe she can sort of 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.939
 I work 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:09.959
 it's always a pity both are going to be the event percent
