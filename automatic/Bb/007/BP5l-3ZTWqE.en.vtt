 so it's there for today's tip 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.990
 Good stuff, this tip is pretty simple. 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.849
 be executed but it needs to be 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.000
 you have a little stock of 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.380
 dogs to achieve is to perform the beauty 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.020
 I'm looking for Alex here before 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.390
 letter updated 85 for those who do not know 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.160
 find the right player in here 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.540
 market I will leave here the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.469
 also a video explaining the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.570
 How do you do this technique is to search there for 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.190
 30 million at the banal and found only three 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.500
 little boxes before then I'm 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.660
 placing several other letters from the antis 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.399
 I will be able to pay the minimum not 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.530
 I'm putting it on is that daniel 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.120
 It's green and I'm going to put diego 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.609
 You're going to come there. 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.769
 following the logic of this 3 day 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.540
 Next I'm looking for the goal I'm going 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.450
 cite that the saints as an example 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.250
 costs at least 25 million 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.049
 You'll see that the time I went to 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.939
 This is transference right here, I 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.369
 I can pay some houses that are not 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.930
 I paid 25 million in 5 million also 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.720
 here a little bit more 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.909
 So people, the sum is the next one is you. 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.640
 player there for the minimum you 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.070
 able to draw conclusions for 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.840
 You make one of mine is the letter of 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.250
 hunting style at the expense 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.470
 at least if you want to buy 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.229
 separated by at least nine thousand and 500 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.270
 millions to 10 million people are paying 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.780
 this in her then you do that fominha 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.369
 and tries to profit at least half of it 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.329
 half of these 10 million is what I 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.009
 I always try 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.079
 sometimes the exaggerated but you 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.780
 will see that I will now be some 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.439
 letters and I always put a profit of 3 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.049
 to 5 million on top of each box I 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.600
 get hawk is kind of reality 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.700
 get focus on the truth as a hunter 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.979
 because it already has a high price and does not 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.899
 It has so much load on the Falcon 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.640
 market he does not have as much to leave 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.679
 like the other three I mentioned earlier 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.629
 but I got it and you will see that 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.069
 in the end i can sell the purchase 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.340
 she 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.400
 7 million and I will now be the falcon for 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.950
 10,000 coins beauty and I'll try to do 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.010
 this 3d event 3 thousand run on top of it 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.810
 since the old antis going simple is 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.219
 Very easy, I'll leave it up, running. 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.049
 video here for you to see the price 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:32.750
 I'm studying but I bought the most 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.340
 of the saints I paid 25 to 26 thousand coins 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.950
 had some who would pay a little more and 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.019
 to make less profit on it 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.030
 but I can put all of the saints and 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.790
 for 33 to 34 million 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.709
 and you will see that it sells very fast 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.250
 guys is I'm doing this tragedy is 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.829
 that on Saturday I did already today 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.419
 people are on wednesday and I made her 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.099
 Do not know why it's a long day. 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:57.560
 So I'm buying several letters. 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.419
 during the week and I told them all 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.000
 on the weekend that it sells there 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:04.939
 very fast so make a good inventory 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.310
 great and then seeing and easy this three 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.870
 of beauty so let's now check for 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.879
 How much did these letters sell Diego? 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.909
 coastline sold for 15 million 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.230
 the Santista also for 33 if it is that 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.599
 galley history if you can not 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.609
 nor for 35 if you want to risk it 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.040
 I'll put the German dilma now, I'll try 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.810
 do 12 hours here at auction and leave it there 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.939
 sells not going to do after several 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.650
 auctions around an hour each 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:29.479
 so you can see there that 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.759
 they are joined by the only three cards that 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:32.629
 were sold were three small boxes of 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.099
 standard 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.840
 But it's simple, as it says to you. 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.340
 I've just been here to cut a 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.799

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.259
 I put 8 500 and haha 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.000
 Surely this letter will come out and I'll go. 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:45.229
 make a legal profit 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.030
