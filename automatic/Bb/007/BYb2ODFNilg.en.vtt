00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.250
 squid with onions we need 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:13.240
 tossed minced onion salt paprika 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.990
 soy sauce species a glass of wine 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.490
 white and of course the baby squid 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.029
 now we go on to explain how they are cleaned 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:26.230
 the chilies please saul to see josefa 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:31.150
 we take the cookies first and see 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.699
 how is it going by removing the skin we throw away vale 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.970
 we let it separate and then the fins 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:39.060
 we keep removing what is the skin 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.690
 although I had 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.960
 OK 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.410
 and now the little head we throw the 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.590
 head so that all the little body comes out 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.830
 we leave the baby squid here and cut 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:01:00.489
 the tentacles that will later serve us 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:02.600
 to do this this in the garbage and 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:08.320
 we just took off his little mouth 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:12.350
 filed and left the legs there 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:19.440
 then once he has removed what is the 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:22.440
 skin then we do as if it were a balloon 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.240
 to turn it over and finish removing 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.930
 what you have inside 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.930
 OK 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.670
 and since we have cleaned the squid more or 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.670
 less the good thing is to give it a little 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.649
 you can present the endings 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.800
 It's a little nothing more nothing more than 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.760
 mark 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.760
 a little bit 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.260
 there the little gift of jumps 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.800
 and in four slave children the three 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.800
 brothers 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.310
 Once we have the squid gas 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.030
 reserved 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.030
 we are the agitated 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.470
 This is fast because I take my lady 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.470
 quick voucher 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:29.890
 so we give you a quick turn around the 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.890
 shortly and immediately 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.020
 of the whale 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.520
 and better 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.080
 salt component 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.890
 for pons once we have the 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.810
 soft onion we add 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.230
 a teaspoon of coffee more or less than 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.230
 spices 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.250
 a teaspoon coffee of sweet paprika 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:16.720
 and once the paprika is poured 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.720
 to move era with the Chinese 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.319
 once 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.499
 that this has caught a little bit of 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.499
 and me 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.920
 we are already the baby squid 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:40.290
 squid the same one fast lap 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:43.190
 now if we throw a little more 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:47.030
 when and tonight but do 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.810
 a quick turn that takes the color 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.790
 that we have everything that has been cooked 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:58.170
 remember a little spin 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:00.290
 Carlos, we're going to take the little glass of 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.290
 wine 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.100
 a glass of wine 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:14.110
 about a teaspoon or two of 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:17.520
 soy sauce to the thigh of each 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.520
 we give it a little spin 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:26.540
 so that it fits here yes very 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:32.140
 important we lower the fire 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.140
 to a point less than half 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:40.020
 and once this was all right 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:44.639
 he already makes his club 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:47.520
 we're not going to talk less than half 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:50.930
 from 15 to 20 minutes you have to be watching 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:54.070
 until I look for it I have reduced it 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:58.720
 we will have the plate seen 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:02.170
 well when this has already reduced 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.390
 we cut in the game and pretending something 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:07.590
 residual we give you two more minutes 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.590
 and ready to eat
