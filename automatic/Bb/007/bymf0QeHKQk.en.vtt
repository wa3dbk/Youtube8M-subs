00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
with windows 8 and this is caused due to

it is the gamer additional book or this
could<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.110> happening<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.590> other<00:00:37.739> users<00:00:37.980> using

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
could be happening to other users using

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.970 
could be happening to other users using
one<00:00:38.730> as<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.059> as<00:00:39.180> well<00:00:39.390> 64-bit<00:00:40.079> operating

can<00:00:43.739> see<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:43.980> flickering<00:00:44.550> issue<00:00:44.910> why<00:00:45.059> here

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
can see this flickering issue why here

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.020 
can see this flickering issue why here
it<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.559> concern<00:00:46.980> that's<00:00:47.610> going<00:00:47.820> around

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
it is is the concern that's going around

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.380 
it is is the concern that's going around
and<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.079> caused<00:00:49.410> by<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.680> driver<00:00:50.390> so

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
and that is caused by the driver so

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.299 
and that is caused by the driver so
there's<00:00:51.870> two<00:00:52.110> alternative<00:00:52.710> approaches<00:00:53.070> to

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
there's two alternative approaches to

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.369 
there's two alternative approaches to
this<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.879> figure<00:00:54.329> out<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.079> first

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
this that I figure out the first

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.630 
this that I figure out the first
approach<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:56.570> upon<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.719> system<00:00:58.050> loading<00:00:58.379> up

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
approach is upon the system loading up

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.369 
approach is upon the system loading up
you<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.789> either<00:01:00.059> revert<00:01:00.510> back<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.870> driver<00:01:01.109> to

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
you can either revert back the driver to

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.020 
you can either revert back the driver to
one<00:01:01.559> of<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.770> work<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.129> drivers<00:01:02.550> before

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
one of the work and drivers before

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.140 
one of the work and drivers before
install<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> latest<00:01:03.809> driver<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:05.580> my<00:01:05.790> working

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
install the latest driver so my working

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.310 
install the latest driver so my working
driver<00:01:06.360> was<00:01:06.830> 3<00:01:07.830> 14<00:01:08.460> points<00:01:09.000> something<00:01:09.540> coming

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
geforce driver and i can assure that was

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.240 
geforce driver and i can assure that was
the<00:01:17.280> driver<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.640> worked<00:01:17.880> successfully

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
the driver that worked successfully

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.109 
the driver that worked successfully
whereas<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.369> driver<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.729> i'm<00:01:20.850> using<00:01:20.909> right

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
whereas this driver that i'm using right

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.490 
whereas this driver that i'm using right
now<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.450> 3<00:01:21.900> for<00:01:22.170> 3<00:01:23.070> 49<00:01:23.369> point<00:01:24.030> no<00:01:24.780> sorry<00:01:25.049> 32<00:01:25.470> 9.49

flickering on that screen no flickering
over<00:04:29.130> here<00:04:29.340> so<00:04:29.970> there<00:04:30.120> is<00:04:30.300> no<00:04:30.450> flickering

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
over here so there is no flickering

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
loaded up you will see it just go into

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.490 
loaded up you will see it just go into
the<00:05:17.700> initial<00:05:18.060> startup<00:05:18.450> stage<00:05:18.690> where<00:05:19.200> you<00:05:19.230> must

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
the initial startup stage where you must

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.250 
the initial startup stage where you must
login<00:05:19.770> so<00:05:20.370> there<00:05:20.520> is<00:05:20.670> no<00:05:20.820> flickering<00:05:21.240> goal<00:05:21.450> no

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
login so there is no flickering goal no

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:36.330 
login so there is no flickering goal no
flickering<00:05:22.680> whatsoever

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.860 

okay<00:05:37.240> now<00:05:37.870> we<00:05:37.930> can<00:05:38.169> see<00:05:38.380> it's<00:05:39.220> it's<00:05:39.690> it<00:05:40.690> has

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
okay now we can see it's it's it has

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.490 
okay now we can see it's it's it has
just<00:05:41.080> put<00:05:41.260> it<00:05:41.350> up<00:05:41.470> fine<00:05:41.889> and<00:05:42.870> this<00:05:43.870> is<00:05:43.960> the<00:05:44.260> same

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
just put it up fine and this is the same

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.689 
just put it up fine and this is the same
way<00:05:44.710> that<00:05:44.949> it<00:05:45.190> would<00:05:45.430> with<00:05:45.610> three<00:05:46.860> 14.2<00:05:47.860> to<00:05:48.040> a

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
way that it would with three 14.2 to a

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.750 
way that it would with three 14.2 to a
driver<00:05:49.150> version<00:05:49.660> so<00:05:50.350> here<00:05:50.560> we<00:05:50.680> go<00:05:50.710> and<00:05:51.160> here<00:05:51.610> is

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760 
driver version so here we go and here is

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.570 
driver version so here we go and here is
our<00:05:51.940> two<00:05:52.270> fixes<00:05:53.280> alternative<00:05:54.280> fixes<00:05:55.410> to<00:05:56.410> the
