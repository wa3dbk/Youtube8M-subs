II like good rock and roll 50 sound to
it<00:00:41.079> so<00:00:41.350> but<00:00:41.890> you<00:00:42.280> can<00:00:42.399> crank<00:00:42.640> it<00:00:42.790> and<00:00:43.290> lots<00:00:44.290> of

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
it so but you can crank it and lots of

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:55.650 
it so but you can crank it and lots of
distortion<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:48.100> comes<00:00:54.360> well<00:00:55.360> it's<00:00:55.540> pretty

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
distortion it comes well it's pretty

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.020 
distortion it comes well it's pretty
much<00:00:55.780> exactly<00:00:56.020> like<00:00:56.440> Floyd<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.520> guitar<00:00:57.820> that

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
much exactly like Floyd the guitar that

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.600 
much exactly like Floyd the guitar that
I<00:00:58.059> used<00:00:58.930> mainly<00:00:59.140> in<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.680> studio<00:01:00.010> and<00:01:00.340> on<00:01:00.520> stage

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
I used mainly in the studio and on stage

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.510 
I used mainly in the studio and on stage
except<00:01:01.570> for<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:01.840> neck<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.620> neck<00:01:02.649> is<00:01:02.980> more<00:01:03.190> of

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
except for the neck the neck is more of

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.380 
except for the neck the neck is more of
a<00:01:03.989> 60s<00:01:04.989> neck<00:01:05.229> so<00:01:05.590> it's<00:01:05.770> a<00:01:05.830> bit<00:01:06.340> easier<00:01:06.670> to<00:01:06.970> play

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
a 60s neck so it's a bit easier to play

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.450 
a 60s neck so it's a bit easier to play
and<00:01:07.840> get<00:01:07.930> your<00:01:08.049> hands<00:01:08.260> around<00:01:08.470> where<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:09.040> 50s

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
and get your hands around where the 50s

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.010 
and get your hands around where the 50s
next<00:01:09.580> we're<00:01:09.790> a<00:01:09.820> bit<00:01:09.970> thicker<00:01:10.270> so<00:01:12.270> I'm<00:01:13.270> kind<00:01:13.930> of

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
next we're a bit thicker so I'm kind of

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.950 
next we're a bit thicker so I'm kind of
based<00:01:14.229> on<00:01:14.409> the<00:01:14.619> p90<00:01:15.159> pickup<00:01:15.520> but<00:01:15.820> it's<00:01:16.750> hum

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
based on the p90 pickup but it's hum

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.230 
based on the p90 pickup but it's hum
canceling<00:01:17.530> so<00:01:17.680> you<00:01:17.770> can<00:01:17.890> play<00:01:18.070> it<00:01:18.189> on<00:01:18.280> stage<00:01:18.580> so

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
canceling so you can play it on stage so

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.300 
canceling so you can play it on stage so
you<00:01:19.330> just<00:01:19.689> kind<00:01:19.930> of<00:01:19.990> get<00:01:20.140> what<00:01:20.409> basically<00:01:21.130> what

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
you just kind of get what basically what

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.280 
you just kind of get what basically what
the<00:01:21.400> guitar<00:01:21.670> sounds<00:01:22.060> like<00:01:22.240> yeah<00:01:22.810> I<00:01:22.840> mean<00:01:23.020> it's

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
the guitar sounds like yeah I mean it's

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.560 
the guitar sounds like yeah I mean it's
you<00:01:23.650> know<00:01:23.710> we<00:01:23.830> basically<00:01:24.369> Gibson<00:01:24.909> took<00:01:25.390> the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
you know we basically Gibson took the

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.840 
you know we basically Gibson took the
exact<00:01:25.869> specs<00:01:26.170> of<00:01:26.350> that<00:01:26.500> and<00:01:26.710> designed<00:01:27.640> around

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
exact specs of that and designed around

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.170 
exact specs of that and designed around
it<00:01:29.820> well<00:01:30.820> for<00:01:31.479> me<00:01:31.600> I<00:01:31.630> think<00:01:31.840> that<00:01:32.049> you<00:01:32.560> know<00:01:33.189> Les

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
it well for me I think that you know Les

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.490 
it well for me I think that you know Les
Paul<00:01:34.360> juniors<00:01:34.720> have<00:01:34.869> more<00:01:35.020> of<00:01:35.080> a<00:01:35.140> rock<00:01:35.290> and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
Paul juniors have more of a rock and

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.340 
Paul juniors have more of a rock and
roll<00:01:35.729> sound<00:01:36.729> just<00:01:36.970> because<00:01:37.330> it's<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:38.080> true

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
roll sound just because it's the true

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.100 
roll sound just because it's the true
sound<00:01:38.710> of<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.340> guitar<00:01:39.430> and<00:01:39.970> Schaick<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.869> sound

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.749 
sound of a guitar and Schaick the sound
that<00:01:41.229> I<00:01:41.290> go<00:01:41.530> for<00:01:41.770> is<00:01:41.920> that<00:01:42.100> you<00:01:42.280> know<00:01:42.369> that<00:01:42.520> real

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
that I go for is that you know that real

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.200 
that I go for is that you know that real
punchy<00:01:43.600> sort<00:01:43.990> of<00:01:44.430> mid-range<00:01:45.430> kind<00:01:45.909> of<00:01:46.000> sound

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
and the first time I ever picked up a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.870 
and the first time I ever picked up a
Les<00:01:49.720> Paul<00:01:49.750> jr.<00:01:50.290> -<00:01:50.470> one<00:01:51.100> that<00:01:51.250> I<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.549> know<00:01:51.670> which

Les Paul jr. - one that I you know which

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.569 
Les Paul jr. - one that I you know which
it<00:01:52.000> was<00:01:52.090> my<00:01:52.720> guitar<00:01:53.290> but<00:01:53.590> which<00:01:53.799> I<00:01:53.920> called

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
it was my guitar but which I called

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.749 
it was my guitar but which I called
Floyd<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.600> I<00:01:56.200> plugged<00:01:57.159> it<00:01:57.250> in<00:01:57.369> and<00:01:57.399> it<00:01:57.640> was

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
Floyd and I plugged it in and it was

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:58.070 
Floyd and I plugged it in and it was
just

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
just

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.410 
just
the<00:01:58.380> sound<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.070> was<00:01:59.160> in<00:01:59.310> my<00:01:59.430> head<00:01:59.580> for<00:01:59.910> so

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
the sound that was in my head for so

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.510 
the sound that was in my head for so
many<00:02:00.510> years<00:02:00.870> it<00:02:01.080> would<00:02:01.200> exactly<00:02:01.740> fit<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.280> and

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
many years it would exactly fit that and

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.670 
many years it would exactly fit that and
then
