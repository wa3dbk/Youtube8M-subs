00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 as for second it should be for 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.759
 Battlefield 4 I do that too 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.059
 same again for level strike that 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.880
 next dlc for the multiplayer shooter 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.280
 yes the first in advance directly is like that 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.470
 error that the deister made 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.930
 who the poster times closer 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.630
 looked there has a or 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.949
 several f18 and in the main game 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.910
 Battlefield 4 is still there 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.960
 no f 18 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.539
 or there is no that can mean that 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.850
 maybe star in part 4 now 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.530
 in the picture cf 18 there is that have 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.070
 I miss a bit then the f35 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.420
 is actually shit you can say 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.040
 or maybe it's just one 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.340
 stupid mistakes do not know we will 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.480
 See now for the information that 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.260
 is actually there are this 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.960
 previews that should be on the sea 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.309
 end of march 2014 'come out now it is 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.260
 still good month towards the end 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.850
 February 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.649
 if there is a hero you do not know 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.420
 I already believe that now 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.809
 announced for a long time announced 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.969
 to have 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.010
 but one has seen that today it has 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.030
 yes a bit of a small 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.750
 Delay given 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.530
 so what's new so first time there are 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.930
 There are four new maps that all somehow 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.640
 to play in the south chinese sea 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.650
 So it's just a bit too much 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.390
 much what the name also suggests 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.909
 lets on more trimmed so the maps 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.680
 once forgotten islands once 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.500
 lancia attack i hope i speak 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.320
 only really from breakwater 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.770
 operations moerser the maps are known 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.090
 so not so they are all new and that 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.250
 not bad 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.939
 then there is a new vehicle that 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.990
 hovercraft amphibious vehicle knows 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.329
 maybe one or the other of you 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.430
 that's just such an amphibious vehicle 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.110
 which probably in the water as well as ashore 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.299
 I'm pretty excited 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.380
 look at it and how it will be then 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.630
 There are five new weapons from infantrymen 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.759
 which are the ones I do not even see 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.750
 how will my all about orders 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.759
 free to play 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.100
 then there are two gadgets there 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.710
 funny grenade launcher and dates for 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.470
 pioneers jan aircraft paralyze 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.720
 I am also looking forward to it 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.489
 they say it will be funny then 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.440
 There is a new game mode called 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.209
 lazily attack where you are new to the 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.690
 case is also exaggerated because knows 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.730
 you already 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.489
 so at least similar chains out 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.550
 battlefield 21 42 so be titan 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.769
 Mode there is an aircraft carrier 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.150
 I understand and you have to 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.209
 take somehow 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.799
 yes I think so I know 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.380
 but not yet 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:39.110
 yes that was the information stand of me 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.569
 for the dlc where still too 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.360
 speculate and where does it go? 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.030
 not sure yet if it's these big ones 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.470
 sea battle that battlefield in 1942 have 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.349
 I already put a finite 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.410
 said that has something to do with it that I do 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.760
 just because it would look good if 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.950
 they announce it now 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.120
 Do not do it can mean one hand 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.760
 that they will not exist at all 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.470
 it would be a pity then you can do it 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.700
 actually in battlefield 4 too 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.010
 completely forgotten because what other 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.440
 dlc if that was not the case 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.420
 On the other hand, it can, however, contain 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.700
 also mean that 30 have to be in 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.859
 the backhand keeps and that before 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.319
 the fans think maybe there will be 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.670
 yes, not or probably even 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.709
 and then it comes right there at once 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.540
 around the corner and then says yes we do 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.549
 but still sea battles and will be cool 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.859
 with destructive aircraft carrier the man 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.510
 You can not drive what I drive there 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.730
 I think I'm definitely 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.500
 there are still strained trailer 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.019
 not so here you see here also 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.430
 just a statue when in trailer 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.560
 I watch I do with trailer 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.600
 analyze it and look at it and say 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.530
 so a little something 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.120
 and of course I will do it again 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.230
 a review if then outside is the dlc 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.230
 until then
