I<00:03:29.400> think<00:03:30.000> one<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.390> lie<00:03:30.569> because<00:03:34.670> so<00:03:35.670> here's

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
I think one of the lie because so here's

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.550 
I think one of the lie because so here's
the<00:03:36.030> power<00:03:36.920> of<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.160> light

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
the power of the light

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.350 
the power of the light
