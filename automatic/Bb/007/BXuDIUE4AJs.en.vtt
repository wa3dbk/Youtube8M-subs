 integrity of Ukraine 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.189
 you need to take it in words and do so 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.840
 for this to be realized i think we 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.670

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.150
 since russia and ukraine closely 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.220

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.770
 maybe we will all see in the spring we all 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.960

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.720
 look around first on washington 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.120

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.070
