let's look at the next most common form
of<00:00:08.550> attack<00:00:08.880> this<00:00:09.450> can<00:00:09.599> be<00:00:09.690> very<00:00:09.870> tricky<00:00:10.400> hockey

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
of attack this can be very tricky hockey

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.589 
punching every Candian grows up watching
this<00:00:13.769> every<00:00:14.070> Canadian<00:00:14.250> grows<00:00:14.670> up<00:00:14.880> using<00:00:15.360> it

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
this every Canadian grows up using it

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.050 
this every Canadian grows up using it
again<00:00:16.379> it's<00:00:16.680> considered<00:00:17.070> crude<00:00:17.369> by<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.699> lot<00:00:17.940> of

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
again it's considered crude by a lot of

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.340 
again it's considered crude by a lot of
martial<00:00:18.359> arts<00:00:18.510> instructors<00:00:18.930> because<00:00:19.080> they

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
martial arts instructors because they

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.019 
martial arts instructors because they
don't<00:00:19.590> understand<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.279> reality<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.880> and

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
don't understand the reality of it and

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.609 
don't understand the reality of it and
they've<00:00:21.119> never<00:00:21.300> actually<00:00:21.660> faced<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.529> the

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
they've never actually faced it in the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.500 
they've never actually faced it in the
street<00:00:22.890> being<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.550> Canadian<00:00:23.820> we've<00:00:24.180> all<00:00:24.330> been

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
street being a Canadian we've all been

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.620 
street being a Canadian we've all been
hockey<00:00:24.840> punched<00:00:25.170> either<00:00:25.320> on<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.710> ice<00:00:25.890> her<00:00:26.220> off

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
hockey punched either on the ice her off

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.550 
hockey punched either on the ice her off
so<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.750> ideas<00:00:28.140> here

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
so the ideas here

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.019 
so the ideas here
the<00:00:28.710> bride's<00:00:28.980> gonna<00:00:29.220> grab<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.550> with<00:00:29.670> his<00:00:29.789> hand

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the bride's gonna grab you with his hand

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.849 
the bride's gonna grab you with his hand
probably<00:00:30.510> as<00:00:30.599> we<00:00:30.779> can<00:00:31.080> because<00:00:31.289> he<00:00:31.470> wants<00:00:31.769> to

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
probably as we can because he wants to

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.130 
probably as we can because he wants to
shovel<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.399> some<00:00:32.579> shots<00:00:32.850> with<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.300> good<00:00:33.870> hand

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
shovel in some shots with this good hand

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.229 
shovel in some shots with this good hand
this<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.649> really<00:00:34.950> dangerous<00:00:35.160> because<00:00:35.610> he<00:00:36.090> can

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
this is really dangerous because he can

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.150 
this is really dangerous because he can
do<00:00:36.329> both<00:00:36.540> things<00:00:36.899> at<00:00:37.200> once<00:00:37.469> even<00:00:37.860> stroke

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
do both things at once even stroke

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.910 
do both things at once even stroke
balance<00:00:39.230> and<00:00:40.230> he's<00:00:40.379> hitting<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
balance and he's hitting it with the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.010 
balance and he's hitting it with the
other<00:00:41.160> hand<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.480> idea<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.780> I'm<00:00:42.899> gonna

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
other hand so the idea is I'm gonna

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.569 
other hand so the idea is I'm gonna
block<00:00:43.260> these<00:00:43.500> punches<00:00:43.980> becomes<00:00:44.340> really

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
block these punches becomes really

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.610 
block these punches becomes really
problematic<00:00:44.820> if<00:00:45.450> I'm<00:00:45.600> unstable<00:00:45.989> because

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
problematic if I'm unstable because

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.889 
problematic if I'm unstable because
where<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:46.800> think<00:00:46.920> my<00:00:47.520> hands<00:00:47.789> gonna<00:00:48.059> be<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.510> split

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
where I think my hands gonna be a split

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.119 
where I think my hands gonna be a split
second<00:00:49.260> later<00:00:49.289> when<00:00:49.649> he<00:00:49.710> throws<00:00:49.860> me<00:00:50.039> off

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
second later when he throws me off

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.100 
second later when he throws me off
balance<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:50.820> not<00:00:51.000> there<00:00:51.270> anymore<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
balance it's not there anymore and the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.080 
balance it's not there anymore and the
punch<00:00:52.350> gets<00:00:52.620> through<00:00:52.860> now<00:00:53.520> we've<00:00:53.699> looked<00:00:53.879> at

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
punch gets through now we've looked at

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.549 
punch gets through now we've looked at
how<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.239> deal<00:00:54.449> with<00:00:54.480> lapel<00:00:54.870> grabs<00:00:55.199> we've

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
how to deal with lapel grabs we've

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.290 
how to deal with lapel grabs we've
looked<00:00:55.770> at<00:00:55.890> how<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.039> deal<00:00:56.250> with<00:00:56.280> punches<00:00:56.789> now

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
looked at how to deal with punches now

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.330 
looked at how to deal with punches now
we<00:00:57.360> need<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.870> combine<00:00:58.050> those<00:00:58.500> concepts<00:00:59.129> and

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
we need to combine those concepts and

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.790 
we need to combine those concepts and
put<00:00:59.609> them<00:00:59.730> together<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.329> one<00:01:00.800> self-defense

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
put them together in one self-defense

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.560 
put them together in one self-defense
situation<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.640> that's<00:01:02.760> difficult<00:01:02.969> we're

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
situation and that's difficult we're

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.870 
situation and that's difficult we're
gonna<00:01:03.719> look<00:01:03.870> at<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.199> once<00:01:04.890> again<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.580> pressure

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
gonna look at it once again the pressure

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.240 
gonna look at it once again the pressure
is<00:01:06.119> divided<00:01:06.600> into<00:01:06.810> two<00:01:07.320> types

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
is divided into two types

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.520 
is divided into two types
he's<00:01:08.549> either<00:01:08.729> pushing<00:01:09.060> me<00:01:09.299> away<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:10.350> make

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
he's either pushing me away to make

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.410 
he's either pushing me away to make
space<00:01:10.830> for<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.159> bigger<00:01:11.369> punch<00:01:11.700> always<00:01:12.150> pulling

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
space for a bigger punch always pulling

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.620 
space for a bigger punch always pulling
me<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:13.159> to<00:01:14.159> make<00:01:14.340> space<00:01:14.640> for<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.909> closer<00:01:15.210> punch

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
me in to make space for a closer punch

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.840 
me in to make space for a closer punch
and<00:01:15.930> he<00:01:16.590> may<00:01:16.740> switch<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> middle<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.759> it

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and he may switch in the middle of it

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.700 
and he may switch in the middle of it
and<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.090> becomes<00:01:18.180> dangerous<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.990> way<00:01:19.200> let's

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
and it becomes dangerous that way let's

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.920 
and it becomes dangerous that way let's
look<00:01:19.979> at<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.400> first<00:01:20.610> concept<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.689> need<00:01:21.869> to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
look at the first concept is I need to

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.620 
look at the first concept is I need to
protect<00:01:22.290> my<00:01:22.560> head<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.310> as<00:01:23.430> he<00:01:23.549> starts<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.970> punch

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
protect my head so as he starts to punch

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.039 
protect my head so as he starts to punch
at<00:01:24.840> me<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.350> only<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.580> cover<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.450> side<00:01:27.659> of

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
at me I only have to cover one side of

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.630 
at me I only have to cover one side of
my<00:01:28.200> head<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:28.740> use<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.009> other<00:01:29.220> hand<00:01:29.460> to

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
my head and I can use this other hand to

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.730 
my head and I can use this other hand to
feel<00:01:29.909> whatever<00:01:30.329> else<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.810> need<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.259> because

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
feel whatever else I need to do because

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.670 
feel whatever else I need to do because
in<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.369> case<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.939> know<00:01:33.540> what<00:01:34.170> this<00:01:34.290> hand<00:01:34.530> is

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
in this case I know what this hand is

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.230 
in this case I know what this hand is
he's<00:01:34.860> using<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.460> throw<00:01:35.700> me<00:01:35.820> around<00:01:36.030> but<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
he's using it to throw me around but the

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.609 
he's using it to throw me around but the
punches<00:01:36.570> are<00:01:36.659> only<00:01:36.780> gonna<00:01:36.930> come<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.380> side

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
punches are only gonna come on one side

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.289 
punches are only gonna come on one side
so<00:01:38.070> instead<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.369> trying<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.610> block<00:01:38.880> him<00:01:39.090> I'm

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
so instead of trying to block him I'm

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.830 
so instead of trying to block him I'm
gonna<00:01:39.630> cover<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:41.180> also<00:01:42.180> need<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.420> try<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.750> get

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
gonna cover I also need to try and get

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.630 
gonna cover I also need to try and get
as<00:01:42.899> close<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.140> him<00:01:43.409> as<00:01:43.439> possible<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:44.340> he's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
as close to him as possible if he's

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.399 
as close to him as possible if he's
doing<00:01:44.939> some<00:01:45.180> kind<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.450> side-to-side<00:01:45.869> motion

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
doing some kind of side-to-side motion

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.859 
doing some kind of side-to-side motion
or<00:01:46.799> pulling<00:01:47.130> me<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.520> that's<00:01:48.090> fairly<00:01:48.420> easy<00:01:48.540> to

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
or pulling me in that's fairly easy to

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.910 
or pulling me in that's fairly easy to
do<00:01:49.110> if<00:01:49.439> he's<00:01:49.740> pushing<00:01:50.130> me<00:01:50.250> away<00:01:51.799> we're<00:01:52.799> gonna

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
do if he's pushing me away we're gonna

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.870 
do if he's pushing me away we're gonna
have<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.189> look<00:01:53.340> at<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.579> little

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
have to look at that a little

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.249 
have to look at that a little
differently<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:54.630> let's<00:01:54.810> look<00:01:54.899> at<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.079> more

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
differently but let's look at a more

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.929 
differently but let's look at a more
common<00:01:55.710> scenario<00:01:55.829> where<00:01:56.430> he's<00:01:56.579> trying<00:01:56.759> to

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
common scenario where he's trying to

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.030 
common scenario where he's trying to
augment<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.719> force<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.200> punch<00:01:58.469> by

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
augment the force of the punch by

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.429 
augment the force of the punch by
pulling<00:01:59.490> me<00:01:59.700> into<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.659> that's<00:02:00.869> very<00:02:01.020> very

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
pulling me into it that's very very

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.889 
pulling me into it that's very very
common<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.579> can<00:02:02.820> generally<00:02:03.329> treat<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.750> the

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
common so I can generally treat this the

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.120 
common so I can generally treat this the
same<00:02:04.110> way<00:02:04.259> as<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.439> would<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.619> regular

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
same way as I would a regular

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.740 
same way as I would a regular
I<00:02:05.400> just<00:02:05.580> have<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.790> be<00:02:05.880> very<00:02:05.909> careful<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.570> my

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
I just have to be very careful of my

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.410 
I just have to be very careful of my
balance<00:02:07.170> as<00:02:07.560> he<00:02:07.680> pulls<00:02:07.950> me<00:02:08.130> in<00:02:08.310> I'm<00:02:09.149> gonna

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
balance as he pulls me in I'm gonna

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.600 
balance as he pulls me in I'm gonna
wedge<00:02:09.660> him<00:02:09.899> here<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.830> make<00:02:11.009> sure<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.310> punch

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
wedge him here to make sure that punch

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.910 
wedge him here to make sure that punch
misses<00:02:12.090> me<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.420> lot<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.080> time<00:02:13.319> I'm<00:02:13.560> gonna<00:02:13.739> be

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
misses me a lot of the time I'm gonna be

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.920 
misses me a lot of the time I'm gonna be
able<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.250> pull<00:02:14.489> this<00:02:14.640> arm<00:02:14.850> into<00:02:15.239> me<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.630> if<00:02:15.810> I
