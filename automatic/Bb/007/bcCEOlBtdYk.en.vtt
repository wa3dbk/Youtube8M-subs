 launch in the xbox one and the net is 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.550
 that I think in the end if 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.469
 ends up meeting expectations and 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.570
 the time they faced big 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.100
 technical difficulties because you have to 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.629
 severe problems with the first one 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.530
 relate to your experience I think it's 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.809
 very 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.600
 if it's cool right clear right you can

 my bouquets phone is super cool 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.440
 that's also this if you have two cars 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.080
 you can do them like a combo like that 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.240
 is a motorbike with a bulldozer or can you 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.790
 join weapons or you can convert things 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.310
 that the garmins are not arms weapons 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.840
 stalin with a huge one a huge 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.280
 possibility of weapon combination 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.280
 explore a world 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:33.340
 and be on a team with the gamers

 christine the rising 3 men are 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.170
 have become enemies through 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.600
 preference in video games after 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.840
 to appear in so many games one would believe 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:47.020
 that we would be tired of them but 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.149
 games like dead rising 3 make all 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.610
 the experience of facing these 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:55.030
 awkward undead again be 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.950
 fun despite the repetitive to 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.380
 be one of the launch games of 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.840
 the xbox one the capcom studio 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.390
 kubert had the pressure to convert a 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.850
 saga that was very popular and take it to the 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.450
 new generation the result is 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.090
 positive carried out 10 years later 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.800
 of what happened in the class sing 2 now 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.590
 we are in the city 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.500
 Californian of the lost a parody 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.470
 of the angels we take the role of a 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.390
 mechanic called nick bouquets a character 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.819
 that fits perfectly into madness 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.160
 zombie of the series and that could well have 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.430
 out of a movie by robert 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.560
 Rodriguez has seven days to escape 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.680
 of the city ​​otherwise you'll be 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.560
 within it when you bombed 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.930
 company in this city will be thousands of 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.540
 undead who want to eat you 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.880
 as a snack but despite being 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.489
 surrounded by them the streets look 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.970
 emptiness that the humans left making you 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.670
 feel in a true apocalypse the 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.739
 city is huge and you can travel it to 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.690
 your craving even if you open doors and 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.540
 buildings where you will need a 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.969
 special key to enter them 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.250
 from time to time you will run into others 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:11.200
 survivors who will ask you favors to 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.629
 change of rewards or that will help you 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.819
 at certain times but have 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.989
 companion you will have to help him too 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.939
 otherwise the character will die 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.489
 permanently the zombies keep the 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:27.489
 classic stereotype seen in the cinema and 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.950
 in other games they are slow awkward and 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.769
 weak but in large numbers they reach 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.469
 be dangerous but that's not much 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.510
 concern for you as it literally 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:40.150
 Any object that you find can 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.239
 be used as a weapon there are zombies that you 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.120
 they clarify others were policemen with pistols 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.430
 and other firefighters with sturdy axes 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.010
 to the fire that add variety to 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.200
 enemies plus there are several bosses 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.620
 called psychopaths with battles 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.079
 entertaining and diverse but if all you 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.389
 it sounds serious so far you're very 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.939
 wrong since it is one of the games 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:06.519
 more fun of the last years 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.769
 maintaining the humor of the series 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.480
 you can use different costumes that 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.400
 They take away the fire 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.819
 besides that killing zombies in 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.859
 reality is very funny on the road 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.780
 you will find planes with which 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.910
 you can create combined weapons in 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.930
 anywhere without the need of 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.970
 go to a workshop or a bank 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.400
 you can also use vehicles and 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.919
 combine them with weapons is very 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.900
 entertaining the run over hundreds of 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.150
 zombies at a time without the game being 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.009
 lens on this occasion the game will 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.680
 presents in a simpler way for 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.840
 attract more players do not run the 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.300
 danger of you running out of time and 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.970
 you can do things at your own pace but 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.220
 for hardcore fans there is the 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.800
 nightmare mode with which you'll have to 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.930
 look for bathrooms to save the progress and 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.780
 You will have a limited time in each 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.090
 mission in terms of graphics excels the 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.130
 power of the xbox one when showing in 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.380
 screen at the same time hundreds of 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.050
 zombies in the streets something that there was not 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.330
 been possible before in addition to that we 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.000
 promise not to repeat even a single 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.220
 zombie in the game but we did not stay 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.099
 to count one by one to see if it was 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.960
 true although sometimes there are details 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.449
 as textures or animations of the 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.300
 characters that jump out of place or 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.310
 appear from nowhere you can use 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.620
 kinect to scream and draw attention 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.750
 of the zombies or to move the control and 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.580
 push them with your hands though 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.340
 actually they are not functions that are 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.410
 really necessary to play and 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.880
 we even had the game caused 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.520
 when someone in the same room 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.400
 will talk since kinect detected it as 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.530
 the pause command the game is 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.860
 doubled to Latin American Spanish and 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:52.350
 Portuguese with an acceptable job where 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.350
 you will recognize some familiar voices 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:58.350
 to all this there is much to do in dead 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.570
 rising 3 you will usually find yourself 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:03.000
 rambling on side missions or 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.880
 simply exploring the world before 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.220
 return to the main campaign you can 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.680
 play cooperatively and there are hundreds 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:14.100
 of hidden objects and things to discover 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.919
