00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.440
 Hello, literally today 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:12.530
 mounted and began to fill the canal 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.180
 video about some homemade discs 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.189
 more precisely not even self-made about some 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.339
 ways how you can hold hold 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:22.039
 music for knitting and just the same in 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:25.640
 moment of the Gulf came the idea very 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.409
 interesting idea the idea came at the moment 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.130
 poduma when I had something that 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:36.020
 make and actually i'm in hand 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.030
 I took here such a thing that is it 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.180
 screwdriver 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:44.840
 no matter which firm in every mean wirth 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.840
 Well, we can not in any screwdriver at 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:54.700
 which is like a sponge drill on 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:57.590
 patron that is, three sponges they diverge 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:06.500
 clamped hook now I'll show you 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:09.670
 how to do it and then continue asking 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.670
 forgiveness do not fall frame 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.930
 that is, so here u have a hook between 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.420
 two sponges 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.420
 while we can rotate it 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.870
 with all of this 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.050
 it is clear that there are two screwdrivers 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.660
 Well, not all, but many well, more extreme 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:55.610
 as much as i know i will tell you 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:59.340
 means drill mode and screwdriver mode 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.330
 mode screwdriver rotates 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.890
 a little harder 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.820
 in door mode regardless of degree 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.670
 clamping 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.210
 chuck chuck a couple can be turned 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.130
 by hands 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.740
 that is, we get can say 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.090
 swiveling vice if we need 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.610
 reels something and we can 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.050
 gently press the start key 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.630
 that is, the trigger as you see at all 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.410
 small speed we can reel in 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.410
 one side or the other 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:35.489
 in all screwdriver ack there i know what 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.459
 choice side rotation here is the degree 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.680
 clamping 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.709
 ratchet on the screw but in this one and in this one 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.010
 models although the model is so far from 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.500
 budget and in this model there is no adjustment 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.060
 pressing there is no adjustment 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.970
 speed though i can buy 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.069
 key from the drill and put or top 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.859
 somewhere or as a separate module 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.650
 or just replace the trigger itself but 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:08.970
 there is also a force adjustment 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:10.459
 pressing that is, we press a little on 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:16.950
 slow rotation speed 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:19.109
 we are stronger and here is a huge plus all rub 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.389
 over so it is possible since ancient times to do it 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:24.359
 huge plus auto screwdriver that 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:26.280
 screwdriver sharp stop that is, he 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.680
 stops at the same place when where 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.040
 he should stop basically 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:42.629
 Knitting a fly, of course, we can 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:44.909
 right here 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.889
 inconvenience means as you see here 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.440
 here here is pretty big 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:52.530
 hillock if we weave 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:57.599
 Naturally field a little hook fly 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:00.209
 and if we will deal with this fly 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.669
 ponytail then it is almost impossible not 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.549
 of course we can give birth to a cartridge 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:07.680
 put the hook at a high angle and there 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.750
 do something but then rotate with us 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.459
 it will already be problematic although on the other 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.849
 parties may be has 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:18.030
 here let me try too 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:22.229
 put a little mouse 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.490
 of course like amateur on the platform 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.900
 Well, I would not know any 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.479
 this little body ride can be on 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.850
 of need here on the Korean rubber to 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:35.120
 Unfortunately I do not have a home can rubber 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:39.110
 be then ride will not let this one down 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:48.110
 hook and now i have got a hook 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:58.759
 quite small is easier hope that 16 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:05:00.949
 number also insert it that is here 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:03.949
 look and you see them as a hook 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:06.650
 in order to put a ponytail I even 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:10.210
 I'll show you the music with a tail like 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.919
 there is a question well let's say such a fly 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.660
 that is, in order to put a ponytail 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.610
 you see she will have a ponytail 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.220
 hang back and if more larger 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.260
 do a fly is also problematic then 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.990
 have now, we can supply hook 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:28.699
 But from this angle it is clear 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.530
 we clamp the hook this but again now 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:34.840
 we put the tail comfortably knit 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.840
 uncomfortable even that's the problem 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.409
 look we start to knit everything with us 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.300
 ok we only we leave the coil 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:46.400
 that is maria the slightest movement we have 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.979
 she will start the whole thing crawl over and 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.139
 turns starting to subside 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.860
 Of course all this fix every time 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.860
 by nodes 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:58.330
 Well, that is, as an option as an exit idea 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:02.080
 from the situation of course it is possible but how 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:05.389
 final solution and complete replacement 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.560
 knitting vice of course no well what 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:09.199
 then little flies 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.419
 up small any big is quite possible 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:14.330
 knit the same can 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:19.760
 hook to clamp upside down if we have 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:23.710
 no tail planned 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:26.419
 like this then natural 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:30.789
 eccentricity will be much less i 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:34.590
 I think it is clear that in the center of the cartridge 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:41.910
 elementary you can hold some kind of needle 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:43.820
 Here in the other under my arm 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.950
 This is a needle, that is, we are elementary. 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:50.040
 we clamp in the center of some kind of needle and knit 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:52.080
 fly on needles in those cases where it is necessary 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.470
 knit flies there or streamer and on pins and needles 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:58.160
 Well, actually I think the question 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:00.540
 understand how to get out of the situation 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.360
 a screwdriver can be used as 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:06.360
 the visual vice honestly tell myself 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.890
 tried tied one fly on 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:11.760
 versus normal grip 

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:14.300
 completely uncomfortable but everything is possible 

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.300
 Thanks for attention
