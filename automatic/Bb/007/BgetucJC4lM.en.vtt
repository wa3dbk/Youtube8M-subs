00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.190
 present 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.280
 to yourself 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.330
 I'm dreaming 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.340
 as radio beacon 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.340
 as he added 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.800
 or did I find him 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.080
 then I take a year off 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.590
 I want to live here 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.570

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.050
 tanya 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.879

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.879
 I said 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.489
 I heard 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:21.800
 due to 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.609
 rather the opposite 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.609
 at the same time not offended 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.129
 concepts of what it is to do 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.569
 Rodriguez here a question I start August 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:46.679
 we passed will pick up the pier is not necessary 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:49.799
 so it turns out 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.469
 sport meeting 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:54.469
