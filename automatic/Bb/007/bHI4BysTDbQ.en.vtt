00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
lighting issues I don't know about this

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.460 
lighting issues I don't know about this
Jim<00:02:15.030> we've<00:02:16.030> got<00:02:16.240> this<00:02:16.420> room<00:02:16.720> right<00:02:16.870> over<00:02:16.930> here

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.770 

but<00:02:20.470> it's<00:02:20.650> pretty<00:02:20.740> sparse<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.840> far<00:02:23.110> as<00:02:23.350> um

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
but it's pretty sparse so far as um

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.970 
but it's pretty sparse so far as um
equipments<00:02:25.780> concerned<00:02:26.200> we<00:02:26.440> just<00:02:26.470> have<00:02:26.770> some

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
equipments concerned we just have some

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.810 
equipments concerned we just have some
free<00:02:27.190> weights<00:02:27.370> here<00:02:27.700> some<00:02:28.420> mats<00:02:29.490> but<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.640> room

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
free weights here some mats but the room

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.390 
free weights here some mats but the room
itself<00:02:31.360> is<00:02:31.690> pretty<00:02:31.959> empty<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:32.680> equipment<00:02:33.190> for

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
itself is pretty empty of equipment for

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.210 
itself is pretty empty of equipment for
training<00:02:33.790> on<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.959> ultimately<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:35.860> think<00:02:35.950> we

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
training on so ultimately I think we

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.610 
training on so ultimately I think we
might<00:02:36.430> have<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.760> opt<00:02:37.000> ask<00:02:37.270> her<00:02:37.480> we'll<00:02:38.410> probably

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
might have to opt ask her we'll probably

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.400 
might have to opt ask her we'll probably
have<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:38.890> go<00:02:39.100> to<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.340> other<00:02:39.430> place<00:02:40.410> it's
