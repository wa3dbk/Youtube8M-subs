but<00:04:52.610> why<00:04:53.230> ever<00:04:54.230> since<00:04:54.620> I<00:04:54.770> got<00:04:54.980> this<00:04:55.160> house<00:04:55.400> I've

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
but why ever since I got this house I've

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.730 
but why ever since I got this house I've
been<00:04:55.790> very<00:04:56.030> low<00:04:56.240> on<00:04:56.390> money<00:04:56.570> and<00:04:57.080> even<00:04:57.560> if<00:04:57.650> I

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
been very low on money and even if I

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.800 
been very low on money and even if I
sold<00:04:57.980> it<00:04:58.160> I<00:04:58.190> wouldn't<00:04:58.580> get<00:04:58.670> very<00:04:58.730> much<00:04:59.240> so<00:04:59.780> I

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
sold it I wouldn't get very much so I

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.810 
sold it I wouldn't get very much so I
decided<00:05:00.260> to<00:05:00.410> rob<00:05:00.710> every<00:05:01.040> jewellers<00:05:01.430> in<00:05:01.460> town

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
decided to rob every jewellers in town

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.580 
decided to rob every jewellers in town
just<00:05:02.120> so<00:05:02.270> I<00:05:02.300> could<00:05:02.600> get<00:05:02.690> enough<00:05:02.960> to<00:05:03.110> get<00:05:03.290> out<00:05:03.410> of

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
just so I could get enough to get out of

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.010 
just so I could get enough to get out of
here<00:05:03.800> and<00:05:03.980> I<00:05:04.730> guess<00:05:04.970> the<00:05:05.180> suction<00:05:05.600> cups<00:05:05.870> were

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
here and I guess the suction cups were

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.530 
here and I guess the suction cups were
for<00:05:06.200> climbing<00:05:06.590> up<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:06.860> building's<00:05:07.540> indeed

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
for climbing up the building's indeed

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.360 
for climbing up the building's indeed
they<00:05:08.780> were<00:05:08.840> and<00:05:09.320> I<00:05:09.590> would<00:05:09.650> have<00:05:09.890> got<00:05:10.070> away<00:05:10.190> with

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
they were and I would have got away with

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.950 
they were and I would have got away with
the<00:05:10.610> two<00:05:10.790> if<00:05:10.940> it<00:05:11.060> weren't<00:05:11.300> for<00:05:11.330> you<00:05:11.510> meddling

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
the two if it weren't for you meddling

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.750 
the two if it weren't for you meddling
kids<00:05:12.020> and<00:05:12.380> your<00:05:12.470> dumb<00:05:12.740> dog<00:05:13.750> scooby-doo
