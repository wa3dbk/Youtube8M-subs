another<00:00:09.180> Lego<00:00:09.480> Cuusoo<00:00:09.870> project<00:00:10.680> this<00:00:11.280> time<00:00:11.549> is

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
another Lego Cuusoo project this time is

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.810 
another Lego Cuusoo project this time is
the<00:00:12.000> Douglas<00:00:12.480> dc-3<00:00:12.780> it's<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:14.129> really<00:00:14.549> really

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
the Douglas dc-3 it's a really really

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.590 
the Douglas dc-3 it's a really really
cool<00:00:15.059> looking<00:00:15.510> chrome<00:00:16.110> airplane<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:18.000> think<00:00:18.510> it

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
cool looking chrome airplane I think it

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.400 
cool looking chrome airplane I think it
looks<00:00:18.780> amazing

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
looks amazing

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.910 
looks amazing
now<00:00:19.949> if<00:00:20.220> Lego<00:00:20.580> makes<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.150> my<00:00:21.960> guess<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.440> it's

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
now if Lego makes it my guess is it's

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.329 
now if Lego makes it my guess is it's
probably<00:00:23.009> going<00:00:23.429> to<00:00:23.490> be<00:00:23.580> around<00:00:23.810> $100<00:00:25.220> give<00:00:26.220> or

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:26.339 
probably going to be around $100 give or

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.450 
probably going to be around $100 give or
take<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.519> few<00:00:26.640> not<00:00:27.449> sure<00:00:27.890> but<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.919> still<00:00:29.220> think

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
take a few not sure but I still think

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.510 
take a few not sure but I still think
it's<00:00:29.640> an<00:00:29.789> amazing<00:00:30.089> looking<00:00:30.630> set<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.589> I<00:00:32.099> wanted
