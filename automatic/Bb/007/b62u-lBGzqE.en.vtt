part<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.710> our<00:02:07.799> nation's<00:02:08.129> history<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:09.830> that's

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
part of our nation's history and that's

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.890 
part of our nation's history and that's
why<00:02:11.039> they<00:02:11.160> put<00:02:11.340> her<00:02:11.520> on<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.209> dollar<00:02:12.450> coins

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
why they put her on the dollar coins

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.420 
why they put her on the dollar coins
from

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
from

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.280 
from
mm<00:02:14.030> I<00:02:14.180> mean<00:02:14.329> like<00:02:14.480> now<00:02:14.599> they<00:02:14.780> have<00:02:14.900> like<00:02:15.049> real

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
mm I mean like now they have like real

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.059 
mm I mean like now they have like real
you<00:02:15.680> know<00:02:15.890> presidents<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:16.549> stuff<00:02:16.790> but<00:02:17.090> um<00:02:18.069> but

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
you know presidents and stuff but um but

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.530 
you know presidents and stuff but um but
back<00:02:19.370> then<00:02:19.609> she<00:02:19.640> was<00:02:19.909> a<00:02:19.939> pretty<00:02:20.150> important

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
back then she was a pretty important

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.089 
back then she was a pretty important
person<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.019> that's<00:02:21.109> why<00:02:21.319> they<00:02:21.469> put<00:02:21.769> her<00:02:21.859> on<00:02:21.920> the

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
person so that's why they put her on the

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:28.000 
person so that's why they put her on the
money<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:26.510> mean<00:02:27.290> I'm<00:02:27.349> not<00:02:27.469> really<00:02:27.650> sure<00:02:27.890> how

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
money so I mean I'm not really sure how

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.979 
money so I mean I'm not really sure how
they<00:02:28.129> got<00:02:28.159> a<00:02:28.310> photograph<00:02:29.239> of<00:02:29.390> versus<00:02:29.810> they

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
they got a photograph of versus they

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.709 
they got a photograph of versus they
didn't<00:02:30.200> have<00:02:30.349> cameras<00:02:31.219> in<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.790> 19th<00:02:32.299> century

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:32.719 
didn't have cameras in the 19th century

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:37.390 
didn't have cameras in the 19th century
but<00:02:34.150> I'm<00:02:35.150> just<00:02:35.420> going<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:36.129> assume<00:02:37.129> that<00:02:37.189> it's

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
but I'm just going to assume that it's

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.690 
but I'm just going to assume that it's
just<00:02:37.459> like<00:02:37.639> a<00:02:37.700> really<00:02:37.939> good<00:02:38.180> painting<00:02:39.219> I<00:02:40.219> mean

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
just like a really good painting I mean

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.949 
just like a really good painting I mean
like<00:02:40.849> have<00:02:40.969> you<00:02:41.090> seen<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:41.359> lot<00:02:41.659> of<00:02:41.750> those

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
like have you seen a lot of those

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.539 
like have you seen a lot of those
paintings<00:02:42.260> they<00:02:42.590> have<00:02:42.739> where<00:02:43.129> it's<00:02:43.370> just<00:02:43.459> like

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
paintings they have where it's just like

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.250 
paintings they have where it's just like
you<00:02:43.730> can't<00:02:43.939> even<00:02:44.180> tell<00:02:44.359> if<00:02:44.510> it's<00:02:44.659> real<00:02:44.870> or<00:02:45.079> gone

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
you can't even tell if it's real or gone

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.750 
you can't even tell if it's real or gone
like<00:02:45.799> there's<00:02:45.980> this<00:02:46.129> guy<00:02:46.340> with<00:02:48.340> it's<00:02:49.340> it's<00:02:49.609> not

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
the one with like the Panda head but

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.409 
the one with like the Panda head but
it's<00:02:51.500> just<00:02:51.650> this<00:02:51.889> Dutch<00:02:52.310> guy<00:02:52.609> he<00:02:52.939> drew<00:02:53.359> a

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:53.419 
it's just this Dutch guy he drew a

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:55.720 
it's just this Dutch guy he drew a
picture<00:02:53.599> of<00:02:53.750> this<00:02:53.989> old<00:02:54.260> man<00:02:54.530> and<00:02:54.859> like<00:02:55.579> it

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
picture of this old man and like it

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.159 
picture of this old man and like it
looks<00:02:56.090> really<00:02:56.209> realistic<00:02:56.870> like<00:02:57.379> um<00:02:57.739> I<00:02:59.169> can't

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.169 
looks really realistic like um I can't

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:04.740 
looks really realistic like um I can't
even<00:03:00.260> describe<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.769> but<00:03:01.569> it's<00:03:02.569> really<00:03:02.780> good<00:03:03.049> I

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
even describe it but it's really good I

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.849 
even describe it but it's really good I
guess<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:05.870> could<00:03:06.019> describe<00:03:06.409> it<00:03:06.530> cuz<00:03:06.680> it's<00:03:06.829> just

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
guess I could describe it cuz it's just

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.979 
guess I could describe it cuz it's just
sort<00:03:07.099> of<00:03:07.189> like<00:03:07.250> this<00:03:07.549> Sacagawea<00:03:08.209> painting

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
sort of like this Sacagawea painting

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.319 
sort of like this Sacagawea painting
here<00:03:11.799> okay<00:03:12.799> so<00:03:12.859> make<00:03:13.310> sure<00:03:13.340> you<00:03:13.609> get<00:03:13.760> both<00:03:14.120> of

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
here okay so make sure you get both of

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.469 
here okay so make sure you get both of
her<00:03:14.659> braids<00:03:14.930> coming<00:03:15.409> down<00:03:15.560> here<00:03:15.769> and<00:03:16.069> a<00:03:16.790> lot<00:03:17.419> of

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:17.479 
her braids coming down here and a lot of

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:18.879 
her braids coming down here and a lot of
people<00:03:17.690> but<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:17.840> think<00:03:17.900> this<00:03:18.139> one's<00:03:18.470> kind<00:03:18.739> of<00:03:18.799> a

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
people but I think this one's kind of a

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.379 
people but I think this one's kind of a
beard<00:03:19.159> or<00:03:19.370> something<00:03:19.699> cause<00:03:19.819> it's<00:03:19.970> coming<00:03:20.299> out

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
beard or something cause it's coming out

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.080 
beard or something cause it's coming out
of<00:03:20.419> that<00:03:20.690> part<00:03:21.079> of<00:03:21.139> her<00:03:21.260> chin<00:03:21.530> but<00:03:21.970> don't<00:03:22.970> be

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
of that part of her chin but don't be

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.170 
of that part of her chin but don't be
fooled<00:03:23.120> because<00:03:23.629> it's<00:03:24.409> four<00:03:24.799> braids<00:03:25.040> from<00:03:26.000> her

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
fooled because it's four braids from her

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.640 
fooled because it's four braids from her
head<00:03:26.359> I<00:03:26.389> mean<00:03:26.629> she<00:03:26.930> doesn't<00:03:27.139> like<00:03:27.290> a<00:03:27.319> braided

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
head I mean she doesn't like a braided

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.520 
head I mean she doesn't like a braided
beard<00:03:28.010> but<00:03:28.340> I<00:03:28.609> have<00:03:29.479> met<00:03:29.780> people<00:03:29.810> of<00:03:30.169> braided

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
beard but I have met people of braided

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:38.170 
beard but I have met people of braided
beards<00:03:30.859> so<00:03:32.019> it<00:03:33.019> doesn't<00:03:33.349> pay<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.500> judge<00:03:37.090> so<00:03:38.090> you

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
beards so it doesn't pay to judge so you

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.580 
beards so it doesn't pay to judge so you
might<00:03:38.329> be<00:03:38.359> wondering<00:03:38.599> why<00:03:38.810> that<00:03:38.959> resolutions

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
might be wondering why that resolutions

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.289 
might be wondering why that resolutions
a<00:03:39.680> little<00:03:39.859> bit<00:03:39.979> lower<00:03:40.189> than<00:03:40.280> normal<00:03:40.489> and

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
a little bit lower than normal and

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.749 
a little bit lower than normal and
that's<00:03:41.750> because<00:03:42.169> I'm<00:03:42.889> using<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.459> different

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:43.759 
that's because I'm using a different

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:45.339 
that's because I'm using a different
computer<00:03:43.970> for<00:03:44.299> a<00:03:44.329> while<00:03:44.540> just<00:03:44.569> trying<00:03:45.199> a<00:03:45.259> few

computer for a while just trying a few
things<00:03:45.650> out<00:03:46.000> because<00:03:47.000> you<00:03:47.659> know<00:03:47.750> I<00:03:47.780> think<00:03:47.930> like

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
pixely blocky games when we were kids

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.909 
pixely blocky games when we were kids
and<00:04:13.030> I<00:04:14.139> think<00:04:15.139> that<00:04:15.349> we<00:04:15.470> should<00:04:15.650> kind<00:04:15.799> of

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
and I think that we should kind of

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.339 
and I think that we should kind of
reflect<00:04:16.310> that<00:04:16.519> with<00:04:16.849> the<00:04:17.150> things<00:04:17.359> we<00:04:17.599> do<00:04:17.810> later

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:18.349 
reflect that with the things we do later

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:20.529 
reflect that with the things we do later
in<00:04:18.530> life<00:04:18.680> to<00:04:19.039> show<00:04:19.250> you<00:04:19.880> know<00:04:20.000> honor<00:04:20.209> where<00:04:20.449> it

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
in life to show you know honor where it

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.490 
in life to show you know honor where it
all<00:04:20.659> began<00:04:22.659> because<00:04:23.659> a<00:04:23.870> lot<00:04:24.110> of<00:04:24.139> people<00:04:24.229> think

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
all began because a lot of people think

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.870 
all began because a lot of people think
they're<00:04:24.620> too<00:04:24.740> good<00:04:24.950> for<00:04:25.010> those<00:04:25.370> things<00:04:25.669> and

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
they're too good for those things and

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.540 
they're too good for those things and
I've

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
I've

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.439 
I've
don't<00:04:27.139> think<00:04:28.139> that<00:04:28.789> Stouffer<00:04:29.789> er<00:04:29.909> the<00:04:30.000> eyelids

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
don't think that Stouffer er the eyelids

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.059 
don't think that Stouffer er the eyelids

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
you know we've been kind of neglecting

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:34.820 
you know we've been kind of neglecting
the<00:04:32.190> eyelids<00:04:32.520> lately<00:04:32.909> and<00:04:33.470> we<00:04:34.470> need<00:04:34.590> to<00:04:34.680> get

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
like for most people even then you could

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.730 
like for most people even then you could
probably<00:04:48.509> tell<00:04:48.840> but<00:04:49.080> for<00:04:49.229> someone<00:04:49.409> who's<00:04:49.590> on

probably tell but for someone who's on
currency<00:04:50.190> you<00:04:50.550> know<00:04:50.669> they<00:04:50.819> really<00:04:51.030> do<00:04:51.500> need<00:04:52.500> to

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.410 

we're<00:05:51.130> kind<00:05:51.310> of<00:05:51.340> extrapolating<00:05:52.030> here<00:05:52.240> with

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
we're kind of extrapolating here with

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.870 
we're kind of extrapolating here with
her<00:05:52.570> shoulders<00:05:53.280> because<00:05:54.280> here<00:05:54.550> I<00:05:54.610> was<00:05:54.730> talking

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
her shoulders because here I was talking

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.040 
her shoulders because here I was talking
we<00:05:55.150> don't<00:05:55.210> really<00:05:55.390> know<00:05:55.570> what<00:05:55.690> her<00:05:55.750> shoulders

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
we don't really know what her shoulders

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.600 
we don't really know what her shoulders
like<00:05:56.290> because<00:05:56.950> this<00:05:57.070> is<00:05:57.190> the<00:05:57.280> only<00:05:57.400> surviving

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
like because this is the only surviving

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.470 
like because this is the only surviving
painting<00:05:58.180> ever<00:05:58.300> so<00:05:58.800> we<00:05:59.800> just<00:06:00.270> kind<00:06:01.270> of<00:06:01.300> have<00:06:01.450> to

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 
painting ever so we just kind of have to

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.330 
painting ever so we just kind of have to
guess<00:06:01.780> you<00:06:02.350> know<00:06:02.440> most<00:06:02.740> people<00:06:02.890> have<00:06:03.100> pretty

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
guess you know most people have pretty

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.790 
guess you know most people have pretty
similar<00:06:03.580> shoulders<00:06:04.120> maybe<00:06:04.720> she<00:06:04.990> did<00:06:05.170> but<00:06:05.620> I

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
similar shoulders maybe she did but I

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.690 
similar shoulders maybe she did but I
think<00:06:06.040> it's<00:06:06.160> a<00:06:06.190> risk<00:06:06.400> we'll<00:06:06.910> have<00:06:06.940> to<00:06:07.210> take<00:06:07.360> I

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
think it's a risk we'll have to take I

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.080 
think it's a risk we'll have to take I
mean<00:06:09.700> like<00:06:10.030> some<00:06:10.240> of<00:06:10.330> the<00:06:10.420> best<00:06:11.910> some<00:06:12.910> of<00:06:12.970> my

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
mean like some of the best some of my

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.730 
mean like some of the best some of my
favorite<00:06:13.480> movies<00:06:13.600> and<00:06:13.810> books<00:06:14.140> are<00:06:14.590> about

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
favorite movies and books are about

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.290 
favorite movies and books are about
historical<00:06:15.460> events<00:06:15.730> where<00:06:15.880> they<00:06:15.940> take<00:06:16.150> into

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
historical events where they take into

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.080 
historical events where they take into
liberties<00:06:16.720> with<00:06:16.990> them<00:06:17.580> and<00:06:18.580> I<00:06:18.670> think<00:06:18.880> that's

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
liberties with them and I think that's

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.300 
liberties with them and I think that's
generally<00:06:19.600> okay<00:06:20.080> just<00:06:20.560> it<00:06:20.740> makes<00:06:20.890> it<00:06:21.040> for<00:06:21.280> a

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
generally okay just it makes it for a

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.190 
generally okay just it makes it for a
kind<00:06:21.760> of<00:06:21.790> a<00:06:21.850> more<00:06:22.030> interesting<00:06:22.240> story<00:06:23.200> overall

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
kind of a more interesting story overall

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.490 
kind of a more interesting story overall
you<00:06:26.200> know<00:06:26.320> like<00:06:27.780> Carmen<00:06:28.780> punishment<00:06:29.320> you<00:06:29.410> know

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
you know like Carmen punishment you know

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.590 
you know like Carmen punishment you know
it<00:06:29.590> takes<00:06:29.770> kind<00:06:29.980> of<00:06:30.070> a<00:06:30.190> few<00:06:30.400> liberties<00:06:31.150> here

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
it takes kind of a few liberties here

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.950 
it takes kind of a few liberties here
and<00:06:31.750> there<00:06:31.930> but<00:06:32.200> overall<00:06:32.610> it's<00:06:33.610> um<00:06:33.940> it's<00:06:34.360> okay

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960
