00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.869
 although the peak of the popularity of these games already 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.660
 passed all the old women are lovers 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.609
 Good meditative gameplay all the more 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.590
 last five years have been saying that 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:39.730
 do not forget this genre until the heroes of the sword and 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.380
 magic roll into dismay another no less 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.140
 interesting and time-tested game 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.710

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.430
 this is such a hybrid of heroes of sword and magic and 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.950
 master of magic 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.510
 we took the role of a powerful mage 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.660
 the reins of state 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.180
 explored the world conquered the city accumulated 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.820
 gold increased power and throwing 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.950
 subjects in the meat grinder war in the third 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.570
 the parts above are relatively recent 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.540
 fundamentals are mechanics 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.980
 remained intact we are still 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.550
 manage a powerful wizard 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.200
 whose task is to conquer the kingdom 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.510
 conquered or settled by settlers 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.360
 cities still need to build different 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.060
 buildings barracks magical towers and 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.120
 strengthen the picture in the last part 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.980
 looks juicy and modern but 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.600
 computer rival intelligence 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.190
 leaves much to be desired 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.770
 so after a little learning 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.350
 the basics should get started online 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.790
 battle because a living opponent to play 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:46.420
 much more interesting the next game will teach 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.180
 love history rule the empire and 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.290

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.890
 rabies players they hated this 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.710
 the game but still run after 100 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.860
 departure or freeze all because no 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.800
 to this day more epic beautiful and 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.290
 scale project in this niche game 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.330
 total war series unique some 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.570
 try to reproduce their formula for success 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.540
 but in vain and it would seem that everything is just there 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.300
 two modes of government 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.310
 turn-based mode and battle between armies in 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.780
 real time on global map 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.420
 seasons change 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.940
 you are planning military campaigns 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.330
 develop empires do 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.459
 diplomacy and espionage as soon as your 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:42.430
 the army and the enemy will converge at one point 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:45.010
 you are transported on the battlefield that 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.110
 will happen when humanity becomes 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.930
 closely on the ground and she will find 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.350
 the hyperdrive will answer this question 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.050
 the next game from our galactic top 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.269

 best-case action 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:04.720
 happens in 2178 when humanity 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.030
 invented hyperdrive capable of quickly 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.670
 move from one point of space to 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.880
 another exploring the cosmos the human race 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.299
 will meet other reasonable races first 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.670
 parts 5 times a second 10 times each 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.650
 of which you can play each race 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.100
 has its own characteristics and 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.820
 abilities exemplary people are very tasty 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.670
 diplomats 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.239
 dry gin and warriors have good troops and 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.510
 ships 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.060
 perry they quickly multiply the main 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.890
 the goal of the game is to outperform other races 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.190
 this can be achieved 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.040
 military means of cultural policies or 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.840
 best player research often 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.410
 you have to choose which way 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.410
 develop 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.730
 this game cannot be compared with 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.850
 civilization and perhaps it is destined 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.010
 stay forever in the shadow of big brother 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.800
 but this project which will be discussed 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.140
 below largely outdid his whole 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.990
 and dance legend is a game that is wrong 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.300
 can be taken for clones of civilization but 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.660
 if we compare the closest in spirit and 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.510
 it seems not even 5 civilization but the edge of 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.270
 wonders 3 here's your army under 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.000
 someone with role characteristics here 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.710
 the settlers here are the leader of the nation who 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.790
 trying to negotiate with each other about 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:26.270
 urgent affairs 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.730
 However, this is all the little things about the project 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.680
 very, very distinctive 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.410
 overcome the brothers' family curses 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.360
 artificial intelligence diplomacy genre 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.090
 problem of unhindered exchange 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.240
 technology and original fraction with 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.700
 All this Andrews Lind managed on 5 but 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.980
 the main game has amazing 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.590
 attractiveness which is not enough 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.760
 another turn-based strategy can 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:54.980
 brag make up step by step 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.160
 strategies can not get around this game 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.460
 civilization a series of civilization games 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.470
 exchanged for two decades and is unlikely 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.810
 sid meyer suspected your 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.570
 turn his proven child 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.660
 time mechanics and balance that's what we 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:14.360
 love tsivu yes sometimes the old sit goes on 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.670
 things like adding cutouts 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.740
 religions in a separate addon but it can 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.980
 forgive it because among 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.420
 strategy lovers there is no man 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.390
 who playing civilization did not say 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.450
 imagine one more move on and off and then 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:31.300
 came to life after a few hours 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.220
 concept of the game as all ingenious is simple 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.560
 we choose a civilization developed 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.170
 and bring domination and this way 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:45.020
 conquest can be scientific cultural 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:46.610
 military and infinitely variable sometimes 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.039
 good old games 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.580
 return like the following 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:54.800
 strategic project from our firebox 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:57.979
 excuse me a noun is a remake 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:02.539
 once a popular game xcom 2 pdf 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:04.340
 released in 1993 due to the overhanging 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.830
 threat of alien invasion of the earth 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.669
 it was decided to create a special 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.669
 organization 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:12.500
 xcom able to resist 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:14.300
 aliens player will take on 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.439
 yourself commanding organization and 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.139
 central base 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:20.389
 you have to monitor everything 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:22.689
 what do aliens distribute 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:26.060
 finance for a particular study 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:28.639
 armament development and expansion of the base and 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.199
 and the ability to arrange interceptors 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:33.020
 to fight with space ships 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:35.870
 aliens and send troops to 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.300
 ground combat operations battles take place 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:41.180
 in step mode you distribute 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:44.750
 their fighters tactical convenient . 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:47.449
 use first - aid kits grenades or otitis 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.960
 fighter in the shelters of fighters can cover 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:52.729
 I use air support from the air 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.360
 interceptors and rangers you can 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:56.000
 hire 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.370
 equip and train soldiers and personnel 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.879
 bases seize aliens and lead 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.069
 interrogation 

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:04.719
 the main task is to protect 

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:04.719
 population from aliens
