order that i'm going to show you this
protest<00:00:46.170> build<00:00:46.410> order<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.770> going<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.010> focus

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
protest build order is going to focus

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.340 
protest build order is going to focus
around<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:48.000> constant<00:00:48.660> work<00:00:48.840> or<00:00:49.020> production

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
around this constant work or production

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.319 
around this constant work or production
idea<00:00:49.770> that's<00:00:50.399> going<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> really

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
idea that's going to get you to a really

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.959 
idea that's going to get you to a really
strong<00:00:51.690> mid-game<00:00:52.260> economic<00:00:53.010> position<00:00:53.520> also

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
strong mid-game economic position also

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.389 
strong mid-game economic position also
this<00:00:54.480> build<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.230> go<00:00:55.410> gateway<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
this build is going to go gateway and

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.160 
this build is going to go gateway and
then<00:00:56.550> cyber<00:00:56.879> Corps<00:00:57.270> which<00:00:57.510> cyber<00:00:57.780> Corps<00:00:58.050> is

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
then cyber Corps which cyber Corps is

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.310 
then cyber Corps which cyber Corps is
really<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:59.280> building<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.359> unlocks<00:01:00.809> all<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
really the building that unlocks all the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.740 
really the building that unlocks all the
tech<00:01:01.500> paths<00:01:01.770> for<00:01:02.250> protoss<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.480> get<00:01:03.629> that

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
tech paths for protoss so you get that

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.090 
tech paths for protoss so you get that
out<00:01:03.899> immediately<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.470> then<00:01:04.680> there's<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.949> lot

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
out immediately and then there's a lot

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.740 
out immediately and then there's a lot
of<00:01:05.129> decisions<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.729> can<00:01:05.760> make<00:01:05.909> about<00:01:06.150> where

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
of decisions you can make about where

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.630 
of decisions you can make about where
you're<00:01:06.900> going<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.140> go<00:01:07.290> after<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.400> this

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
you're going to go after that so this

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.530 
you're going to go after that so this
build<00:01:08.909> will<00:01:09.119> get<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.420> there<00:01:09.570> very<00:01:09.869> solidly<00:01:11.540> so

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
build will get you there very solidly so

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.060 
build will get you there very solidly so
first<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.110> all<00:01:13.170> you're<00:01:13.350> going<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.530> notice<00:01:13.710> is

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
first of all you're going to notice is

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.280 
first of all you're going to notice is
that<00:01:14.130> I'm<00:01:14.939> going<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.180> build<00:01:15.450> probes<00:01:15.900> until<00:01:16.229> I

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
that I'm going to build probes until I

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.890 
that I'm going to build probes until I
get<00:01:16.470> 29<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:18.210> other<00:01:18.360> thing<00:01:18.540> i<00:01:18.630> want<00:01:18.810> to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
get 29 the other thing i want to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.320 
get 29 the other thing i want to
emphasize<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.740> pro<00:01:20.189> top<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.580> protest<00:01:21.090> build

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
emphasize with pro top a protest build

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.270 
emphasize with pro top a protest build
order<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.960> protest<00:01:22.619> build<00:01:22.799> orders<00:01:23.100> are<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
order is that protest build orders are a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.830 
order is that protest build orders are a
little<00:01:23.430> more<00:01:23.640> dynamic<00:01:24.240> because<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.659> have

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
little more dynamic because you have

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.230 
little more dynamic because you have
chrono<00:01:25.140> boost<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.710> makes<00:01:26.130> things<00:01:26.400> makes<00:01:26.880> any

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
chrono boost that makes things makes any

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.719 
chrono boost that makes things makes any
unit<00:01:28.170> or<00:01:28.290> upgrade<00:01:28.590> come<00:01:28.799> out<00:01:28.920> fifty<00:01:29.400> percent

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
unit or upgrade come out fifty percent

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.700 
unit or upgrade come out fifty percent
faster<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.750> makes<00:01:31.079> these<00:01:31.290> ideas<00:01:31.680> of

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
faster so that makes these ideas of

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.030 
faster so that makes these ideas of
timing<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.310> stuff<00:01:32.549> become<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> lot<00:01:33.390> more<00:01:33.540> loose

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
timing and stuff become a lot more loose

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.819 
timing and stuff become a lot more loose
so<00:01:35.040> I'll<00:01:35.189> show<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.430> what<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.939> do<00:01:36.500> this<00:01:37.500> isn't

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
so I'll show you what I do this isn't

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.100 
so I'll show you what I do this isn't
necessarily<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.369> best<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.970> can<00:01:39.150> tweak<00:01:39.900> these

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
necessarily the best you can tweak these

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.020 
necessarily the best you can tweak these
things<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.650> all<00:01:40.740> kinds<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.189> small<00:01:41.820> little

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
things and all kinds of small little

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.429 
things and all kinds of small little
ways<00:01:42.329> depending<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.840> how<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.020> want<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.290> play

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
ways depending on how you want to play

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.469 
ways depending on how you want to play
it<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.009> what<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.790> I

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
it but this is just what I do and I

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.030 
it but this is just what I do and I
think<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:45.960> pretty<00:01:46.170> good<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.770> I'm<00:01:46.860> going<00:01:47.009> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
think it's pretty good so I'm going to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.980 
think it's pretty good so I'm going to
show<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.729> other<00:01:48.479> thing<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.780> want<00:01:48.960> to

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
show to you the other thing I want to

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.840 
show to you the other thing I want to
point<00:01:49.049> out<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.560> whenever<00:01:50.310> you're<00:01:50.549> making

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
point out is that whenever you're making

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.800 
point out is that whenever you're making
these<00:01:50.939> buildings<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.450> want<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.659> put

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
these buildings you want to put

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.560 
these buildings you want to put
everything<00:01:52.049> down<00:01:52.200> like<00:01:52.590> at<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.979> exact<00:01:53.570> second

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
everything down like at the exact second

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.600 
everything down like at the exact second
that<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.899> can<00:01:55.020> possibly<00:01:55.439> go<00:01:55.649> down<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.399> I've<00:01:56.490> got

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
that it can possibly go down so I've got

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.609 
that it can possibly go down so I've got
like<00:01:56.759> 95<00:01:57.299> minerals<00:01:57.780> right<00:01:57.990> now<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.409> this

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
like 95 minerals right now and this

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.280 
like 95 minerals right now and this
probe<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.670> his<00:01:59.909> way<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.119> go<00:02:00.390> build<00:02:00.750> my<00:02:00.930> pile

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
probe is on his way to go build my pile

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.020 
probe is on his way to go build my pile
on<00:02:01.530> that's<00:02:01.740> going<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.040> make<00:02:02.460> sure<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.670> don't<00:02:02.790> get

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
on that's going to make sure I don't get

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.760 
on that's going to make sure I don't get
supply<00:02:03.390> blocked<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.409> want<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.649> build

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
supply blocked and you want to build

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.199 
supply blocked and you want to build
that<00:02:04.979> basically<00:02:05.700> as<00:02:05.909> close<00:02:06.719> to<00:02:06.930> 100<00:02:07.290> minerals

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
that basically as close to 100 minerals

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.170 
that basically as close to 100 minerals
so<00:02:10.209> gonna<00:02:10.720> put<00:02:11.680> out<00:02:11.830> one<00:02:12.220> more<00:02:12.459> probe<00:02:12.760> here<00:02:13.030> and

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
so gonna put out one more probe here and

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.000 
so gonna put out one more probe here and
this<00:02:13.270> probe<00:02:13.569> is<00:02:13.720> going<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:13.959> again<00:02:14.500> like<00:02:14.830> the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
this probe is going to again like the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.520 
this probe is going to again like the
Terran<00:02:15.400> builder<00:02:16.060> I<00:02:16.180> showed<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.630> this<00:02:17.200> probe

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
Terran builder I showed you this probe

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.110 
Terran builder I showed you this probe
is<00:02:17.650> going<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:17.860> line<00:02:18.010> up<00:02:18.160> exactly<00:02:18.340> with<00:02:18.880> when

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
is going to line up exactly with when

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.630 
is going to line up exactly with when
this<00:02:19.239> pylon<00:02:19.870> finishes<00:02:20.380> and<00:02:20.560> after<00:02:21.160> this<00:02:21.280> pilot

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
this pylon finishes and after this pilot

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.430 
this pylon finishes and after this pilot
finishes<00:02:22.090> we<00:02:22.420> are<00:02:22.510> going<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.780> use<00:02:22.810> our<00:02:23.050> first

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
finishes we are going to use our first

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.580 
finishes we are going to use our first
chrono<00:02:23.890> boost<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.849> get<00:02:24.970> two<00:02:25.510> more<00:02:25.930> probes<00:02:26.349> out

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
chrono boost to get two more probes out

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.430 
chrono boost to get two more probes out
as<00:02:26.830> quickly<00:02:27.640> as<00:02:27.880> possible<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:28.660> we<00:02:28.690> run<00:02:29.050> supply

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
as quickly as possible so we run supply

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.350 
as quickly as possible so we run supply
locked<00:02:29.800> we're<00:02:30.459> going<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:30.640> get<00:02:30.790> this<00:02:31.030> probe

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
locked we're going to get this probe

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.850 
locked we're going to get this probe
right<00:02:31.569> here<00:02:31.750> we're<00:02:32.050> going<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.290> get<00:02:32.410> this<00:02:32.620> probe

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
right here we're going to get this probe

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.500 
right here we're going to get this probe
right<00:02:33.069> here<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.400> then<00:02:33.880> after<00:02:34.120> that<00:02:34.150> we're

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
right here and then after that we're

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.290 
right here and then after that we're
going<00:02:34.599> to<00:02:34.660> get<00:02:34.959> a<00:02:35.230> gateway<00:02:35.980> down<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.550> you'll

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
going to get a gateway down and you'll

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.380 
going to get a gateway down and you'll
see<00:02:37.739> right<00:02:38.739> at<00:02:38.920> this<00:02:39.040> 12<00:02:39.430> supply<00:02:39.819> mark<00:02:40.150> I'm

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
see right at this 12 supply mark I'm

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.020 
see right at this 12 supply mark I'm
approaching<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.769> looks<00:02:41.980> like<00:02:42.130> oh<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.370> can<00:02:42.760> I've

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
approaching it looks like oh I can I've

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.479 
approaching it looks like oh I can I've
got<00:02:43.269> 150<00:02:43.900> minerals<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.500> can<00:02:44.830> make<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.040> gateway

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
got 150 minerals I can make a gateway

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.870 
got 150 minerals I can make a gateway
right<00:02:45.700> now<00:02:46.200> gateway<00:02:47.200> goes<00:02:47.410> down<00:02:47.560> right<00:02:48.010> at<00:02:48.190> 150

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
right now gateway goes down right at 150

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.630 
right now gateway goes down right at 150
and<00:02:49.120> I'm<00:02:49.600> going<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.840> be<00:02:50.380> not<00:02:50.769> producing<00:02:51.340> probes

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
and I'm going to be not producing probes

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.449 
and I'm going to be not producing probes
for<00:02:51.910> just<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.209> couple<00:02:52.390> seconds<00:02:52.959> if<00:02:53.890> you<00:02:53.950> really

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
for just a couple seconds if you really

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.630 
for just a couple seconds if you really
want<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.840> can<00:02:55.989> actually<00:02:56.140> delay<00:02:56.980> this<00:02:57.340> gateway

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
want you can actually delay this gateway

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.130 
want you can actually delay this gateway
to<00:02:57.819> 13<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:58.989> continue<00:02:59.769> making<00:02:59.920> probes<00:03:00.400> and

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
to 13 and continue making probes and

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.360 
to 13 and continue making probes and
that<00:03:02.140> will<00:03:02.290> just<00:03:02.319> give<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.709> a<00:03:02.860> slightly

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
that will just give you a slightly

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.580 
that will just give you a slightly
better<00:03:03.940> economic<00:03:04.720> position<00:03:05.110> but<00:03:05.260> might<00:03:05.410> be<00:03:05.560> a

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
better economic position but might be a

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.080 
better economic position but might be a
little<00:03:05.739> bit<00:03:06.010> riskier<00:03:06.670> because<00:03:06.819> you're

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
little bit riskier because you're

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.170 
little bit riskier because you're
getting<00:03:07.180> your<00:03:07.450> gateway<00:03:07.630> out<00:03:07.870> later<00:03:09.180> again

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
getting your gateway out later again

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.690 
getting your gateway out later again
this<00:03:10.330> one<00:03:10.569> these<00:03:10.799> preference<00:03:11.799> things<00:03:12.040> or<00:03:12.370> map

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
this one these preference things or map

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.569 
this one these preference things or map
choice<00:03:13.030> or<00:03:13.329> all<00:03:13.840> that<00:03:14.049> very<00:03:14.350> subtle<00:03:14.769> you

choice or all that very subtle you
probably<00:03:15.760> don't<00:03:15.880> need<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.180> worry<00:03:16.329> about<00:03:16.420> until

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
probably don't need to worry about until

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.660 
probably don't need to worry about until
you're<00:03:16.959> getting<00:03:17.170> into<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.470> higher<00:03:17.620> level<00:03:17.980> so

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
you're getting into the higher level so

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.550 
you're getting into the higher level so
that<00:03:18.700> gateway<00:03:19.090> didn't<00:03:19.450> went<00:03:19.630> down<00:03:19.780> at<00:03:19.930> 12<00:03:20.260> and

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
that gateway didn't went down at 12 and

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.460 
that gateway didn't went down at 12 and
then<00:03:21.130> I<00:03:21.459> have<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.390> just<00:03:22.930> want<00:03:23.079> to<00:03:23.140> point<00:03:23.260> out<00:03:23.410> I

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
then I have I just want to point out I

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.199 
then I have I just want to point out I
have<00:03:23.859> a<00:03:23.890> chrono<00:03:24.250> boost<00:03:24.519> that<00:03:24.640> I<00:03:24.730> could<00:03:25.060> be

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
have a chrono boost that I could be

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.819 
have a chrono boost that I could be
using<00:03:25.540> right<00:03:25.690> now<00:03:25.720> to<00:03:25.840> get<00:03:26.109> more<00:03:26.290> probes<00:03:26.620> out

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
using right now to get more probes out

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.550 
using right now to get more probes out
but<00:03:27.489> instead<00:03:27.850> I<00:03:28.120> want<00:03:28.299> to<00:03:28.390> if<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:29.019> use<00:03:29.290> that

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
but instead I want to if I use that

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.900 
but instead I want to if I use that
chrono<00:03:29.829> boost<00:03:30.069> I<00:03:30.190> wouldn't<00:03:30.519> have<00:03:30.700> enough

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
chrono boost I wouldn't have enough

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.660 
chrono boost I wouldn't have enough
minerals<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.510> get<00:03:31.769> Anna<00:03:32.769> simulator<00:03:33.190> out<00:03:33.459> so

minerals to get Anna simulator out so
I'm<00:03:33.730> going<00:03:33.910> to<00:03:33.970> delay<00:03:34.569> that<00:03:34.600> right<00:03:35.019> now<00:03:35.200> and

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
I'm going to delay that right now and

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.199 
I'm going to delay that right now and
just<00:03:35.530> wait<00:03:36.250> until<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:36.549> have<00:03:36.730> enough<00:03:36.970> minerals

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
just wait until I have enough minerals

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.300 
just wait until I have enough minerals
to<00:03:37.480> get<00:03:37.600> in<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:37.750> simulator<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:38.799> then<00:03:39.160> you'll

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
to get in the simulator and then you'll

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.879 
to get in the simulator and then you'll
see<00:03:39.549> one<00:03:40.480> of<00:03:40.569> these<00:03:40.720> guys<00:03:40.959> is<00:03:41.319> putting<00:03:41.739> the

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
see one of these guys is putting the

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.210 
see one of these guys is putting the
simulator<00:03:42.220> down<00:03:42.549> immediately<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:44.530> after<00:03:44.829> that

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
simulator down immediately so after that

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.309 
simulator down immediately so after that
guy<00:03:45.400> i<00:03:45.639> can<00:03:45.910> again<00:03:46.299> chrono<00:03:46.720> boost<00:03:46.989> and<00:03:47.200> not

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
guy i can again chrono boost and not

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.699 
guy i can again chrono boost and not
worry<00:03:47.560> about<00:03:47.650> having<00:03:48.250> too<00:03:48.639> few<00:03:48.670> minerals<00:03:49.709> I'm

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
worry about having too few minerals I'm

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.199

blocked for a brief second but the pylon
will<00:04:56.630> finish<00:04:56.840> and<00:04:57.230> then<00:04:57.860> this<00:04:58.220> is<00:04:58.640> basically

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
will finish and then this is basically

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.430 
will finish and then this is basically
where<00:04:59.390> I'm<00:04:59.510> going<00:04:59.690> to<00:04:59.750> stop<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.230> build

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
where I'm going to stop the build

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.950 
where I'm going to stop the build
because<00:05:01.370> this<00:05:01.730> cyber<00:05:02.030> Corps<00:05:02.390> will<00:05:02.570> come<00:05:02.750> up

because this cyber Corps will come up

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.990 
because this cyber Corps will come up
and<00:05:03.170> after<00:05:03.980> that<00:05:04.100> comes<00:05:04.340> up<00:05:04.520> there's<00:05:04.730> a<00:05:04.790> lot<00:05:04.970> of

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
and after that comes up there's a lot of

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.790 
and after that comes up there's a lot of
decisions<00:05:05.390> you<00:05:05.690> can<00:05:05.720> make<00:05:05.900> you<00:05:06.290> can<00:05:06.470> go<00:05:06.620> for

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
decisions you can make you can go for

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.710 
decisions you can make you can go for
some<00:05:06.950> kind<00:05:07.160> of<00:05:07.250> tech<00:05:07.550> where<00:05:08.180> you<00:05:08.300> can<00:05:08.420> just<00:05:08.450> add

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
some kind of tech where you can just add

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.200 
some kind of tech where you can just add
on<00:05:08.990> a<00:05:09.350> couple<00:05:09.980> more<00:05:10.100> gateways<00:05:10.400> and<00:05:10.850> go<00:05:10.970> for<00:05:11.150> a
