and<00:00:00.089> so<00:00:00.659> the<00:00:01.500> reason<00:00:01.829> why<00:00:01.949> we're<00:00:02.220> kind<00:00:02.610> of

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
and so the reason why we're kind of

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.519 
and so the reason why we're kind of
differentiating<00:00:03.389> these<00:00:03.540> two<00:00:03.870> spots<00:00:04.200> on<00:00:04.410> the

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
differentiating these two spots on the

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:05.960 
differentiating these two spots on the
promoters<00:00:04.980> because<00:00:05.339> different<00:00:05.730> things

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
promoters because different things

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.230 
promoters because different things
happen<00:00:06.690> at<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.290> tata<00:00:07.680> box<00:00:07.890> versus<00:00:08.790> the

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
happen at the tata box versus the

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.400 
happen at the tata box versus the
initiation<00:00:09.900> site<00:00:11.300> the<00:00:12.300> tata<00:00:12.660> box<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.200> where

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
initiation site the tata box is where

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.650 
initiation site the tata box is where
some<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.370> helpers<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.299> RNA

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
some of the helpers of the RNA

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.650 
some of the helpers of the RNA
polymerase<00:00:15.990> bind<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:18.150> name<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.510> those

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
polymerase bind to and the name of those

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.720 
polymerase bind to and the name of those
helper<00:00:19.020> proteins<00:00:19.500> they're<00:00:20.460> called

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
helper proteins they're called

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.759 
helper proteins they're called
transcription<00:00:21.420> factors<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:22.590> that's

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
transcription factors and so that's

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.609 
transcription factors and so that's
where<00:00:23.210> again<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.570> transcript<00:00:25.019> sure<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
where again the transcript sure of the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.620 
where again the transcript sure of the
transcription<00:00:26.279> factors<00:00:26.640> bind<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.240> tata

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
transcription factors bind to the tata

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.919 
transcription factors bind to the tata
box<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.890> promoter<00:00:29.250> region<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.750> turns

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
box of the promoter region and it turns

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.299 
box of the promoter region and it turns
out<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.260> there<00:00:31.470> are<00:00:31.500> several<00:00:31.949> different

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
out that there are several different

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.350 
out that there are several different
types<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:33.140> transcription<00:00:34.140> factors<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.360> they

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
types of transcription factors and they

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.479 
types of transcription factors and they
all<00:00:36.540> bind<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.260> tata<00:00:37.739> box<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.280> the

all bind to that tata box of the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.979 
all bind to that tata box of the
promoter<00:00:40.190> again<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.760> purpose<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.809> these

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
promoter again the purpose of these

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.049 
promoter again the purpose of these
transcription<00:00:43.440> factors<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.640> they<00:00:44.850> kind

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
transcription factors is that they kind

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.610 
transcription factors is that they kind
of<00:00:45.180> help<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.629> star<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> show<00:00:46.140> do<00:00:46.469> their

of help the star of the show do their

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.869 
of help the star of the show do their
thing<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.100> when<00:00:47.370> we're<00:00:47.520> talking<00:00:47.640> about

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
thing and when we're talking about

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.029 
thing and when we're talking about
transcription<00:00:48.590> remember<00:00:49.590> again<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
transcription remember again that the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.260 
transcription remember again that the
star<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.489> showed<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.850> enzyme<00:00:51.239> that

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
star of this showed the enzyme that

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.529 
star of this showed the enzyme that
makes<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:52.379> all<00:00:52.469> happen<00:00:52.520> is<00:00:53.520> RNA<00:00:54.059> polymerase

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
makes it all happen is RNA polymerase

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.660 
makes it all happen is RNA polymerase
and<00:00:54.809> where<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.530> binds<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.190> binds<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
and where it binds to it binds to the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.639 
and where it binds to it binds to the
promoter<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.300> specifically<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.170> binds<00:00:58.379> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
promoter but specifically it binds to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.650 
promoter but specifically it binds to
this<00:00:58.770> initiation<00:00:59.430> site<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.930> promoter<00:01:02.660> it

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
this initiation site of the promoter it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.050 
this initiation site of the promoter it
turns<00:01:03.899> out<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:05.129> order<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.729> RNA

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
turns out that in order for the RNA

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.149 
turns out that in order for the RNA
polymerase<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.720> bind<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:07.320> has<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:08.010> be

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
polymerase to bind it has to be

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.730 
polymerase to bind it has to be
associated<00:01:08.490> with<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.390> protein<00:01:10.049> called<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
associated with a protein called the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.700 
associated with a protein called the
Sigma<00:01:11.520> factor<00:01:11.939> all<00:01:12.720> right<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.320> turns<00:01:13.500> out

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
Sigma factor all right so it turns out

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.740 
Sigma factor all right so it turns out
that<00:01:13.860> RNA<00:01:14.250> polymerase<00:01:14.700> will<00:01:14.939> only<00:01:15.150> be<00:01:15.509> able<00:01:15.570> to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
that RNA polymerase will only be able to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.230 
that RNA polymerase will only be able to
find<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.350> initiation<00:01:16.860> site<00:01:17.250> if<00:01:17.909> there's

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
find this initiation site if there's

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.679 
find this initiation site if there's
this<00:01:18.479> Sigma<00:01:18.840> factor<00:01:19.290> that's<00:01:19.890> bound<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.700> if

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
this Sigma factor that's bound to it if

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.450 
this Sigma factor that's bound to it if
the<00:01:21.869> Sigma<00:01:22.259> factor<00:01:22.409> was<00:01:22.710> not<00:01:22.890> bound<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.369> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the Sigma factor was not bound to the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.090 
the Sigma factor was not bound to the
RNA<00:01:23.850> polymerase<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:25.140> RNA<00:01:25.409> polymerase<00:01:25.619> would

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
RNA polymerase the RNA polymerase would

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.620 
RNA polymerase the RNA polymerase would
never<00:01:26.310> make<00:01:26.549> its<00:01:26.729> way<00:01:26.909> towards<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
never make its way towards the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.260 
never make its way towards the
initiation<00:01:28.530> site<00:01:28.770> so<00:01:29.579> again<00:01:29.820> here's<00:01:30.030> another

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
initiation site so again here's another

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.210 
initiation site so again here's another
protein<00:01:30.780> that's<00:01:30.990> helping<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.979> RNA

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
protein that's helping the RNA

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.990 
protein that's helping the RNA
polymerase<00:01:32.610> do<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.970> stop<00:01:34.369> it<00:01:35.369> turns<00:01:35.610> out<00:01:35.820> that

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
polymerase do it stop it turns out that

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.270 
polymerase do it stop it turns out that
RNA<00:01:36.540> polymerase<00:01:36.960> needs<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.619> lot<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.829> help<00:01:37.979> if

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
RNA polymerase needs a lot of help if

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.740 
RNA polymerase needs a lot of help if
you're<00:01:38.430> talking<00:01:38.579> about<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:39.000> eukaryotic<00:01:39.570> cell

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
you're talking about a eukaryotic cell

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.230 
you're talking about a eukaryotic cell
in<00:01:40.380> order<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.860> transcribe<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.460> gene<00:01:41.970> so

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
in order to transcribe that gene so

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.690 
in order to transcribe that gene so
there<00:01:42.420> are<00:01:42.600> usually<00:01:43.170> several<00:01:43.700> transcription

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
there are usually several transcription

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.840 
there are usually several transcription
factors<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.509> kind<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.140> glom<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.979> make

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
factors that kind of glom on and make

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.580 
factors that kind of glom on and make
sure<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.479> RNA<00:01:48.810> polymerase<00:01:49.049> stays

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
sure that the RNA polymerase stays

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.719 
sure that the RNA polymerase stays
attached<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.700> initiation<00:01:51.240> site<00:01:52.729> there's

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
attached to that initiation site there's

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.060 
attached to that initiation site there's
other<00:01:53.909> helpers<00:01:54.299> too<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.020> there's<00:01:55.770> another

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
other helpers too so there's another

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.600 
other helpers too so there's another
portion<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.880> promoter<00:01:57.240> that's<00:01:57.479> called<00:01:58.610> so

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
portion of the promoter that's called so

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.010 
portion of the promoter that's called so
that's<00:01:59.759> another<00:02:00.000> transcription<00:02:00.689> factor<00:02:00.990> a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
that's another transcription factor a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.630 
that's another transcription factor a
whole<00:02:01.229> bunch<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.560> o-mai<00:02:01.799> needed<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.189> help<00:02:02.340> RNA

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
whole bunch of o-mai needed to help RNA

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.359 
whole bunch of o-mai needed to help RNA
polymerase<00:02:03.320> but<00:02:04.320> again<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.799> turns<00:02:05.009> out<00:02:05.189> that

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
polymerase but again it turns out that

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.359 
polymerase but again it turns out that
there's<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.000> lot<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.210> help<00:02:06.540> that's<00:02:06.689> needed<00:02:06.840> so

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
there's a lot of help that's needed so

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.130 
there's a lot of help that's needed so
there's<00:02:08.369> another<00:02:08.670> portion<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.780> promoter

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
there's another portion of the promoter

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.410 
there's another portion of the promoter
that's<00:02:10.349> called<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:11.819> regulatory<00:02:12.270> site

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
that's called the regulatory site

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.130 
that's called the regulatory site
and<00:02:13.510> had<00:02:13.900> fear<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.440> another<00:02:15.630> helper<00:02:16.630> protein

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
and had fear that another helper protein

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.110 
and had fear that another helper protein
binds<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:18.550> there's<00:02:18.730> something<00:02:18.910> that's

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
binds to so there's something that's

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.330 
binds to so there's something that's
called<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.510> regular<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:20.319> regulatory<00:02:20.680> protein

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
called a regular a regulatory protein

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.120 
called a regular a regulatory protein
that<00:02:21.459> binds<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.870> regulatory<00:02:23.020> site<00:02:23.860> and

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
that binds to the regulatory site and

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.210 
that binds to the regulatory site and
again<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.660> job<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:26.050> this<00:02:26.170> regulatory<00:02:26.590> protein

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
again the job of this regulatory protein

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.460 
again the job of this regulatory protein
like<00:02:27.400> all<00:02:27.670> these<00:02:27.849> other<00:02:27.910> proteins<00:02:28.599> is<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.020> it

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
like all these other proteins is that it

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.220 
like all these other proteins is that it
plays<00:02:29.770> a<00:02:29.800> role<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.459> making<00:02:31.209> sure<00:02:31.569> that<00:02:32.080> the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
plays a role and making sure that the

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.920 
plays a role and making sure that the
RNA<00:02:32.530> polymerase<00:02:32.770> stays<00:02:33.580> bound<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:34.180> the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
RNA polymerase stays bound to the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.860 
RNA polymerase stays bound to the
initiation<00:02:35.319> site<00:02:36.450> turns<00:02:37.450> out<00:02:37.600> that<00:02:37.750> that's

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
initiation site turns out that that's

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.680 
initiation site turns out that that's
not<00:02:38.080> it<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.980> RNA<00:02:39.250> polymerase<00:02:39.670> in<00:02:39.940> eukaryotic

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
not it the RNA polymerase in eukaryotic

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.740 
not it the RNA polymerase in eukaryotic
new<00:02:41.440> carry<00:02:41.680> out<00:02:41.800> at<00:02:41.980> least<00:02:42.190> need<00:02:42.970> even<00:02:43.599> more

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
new carry out at least need even more

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.220 
new carry out at least need even more
help<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:45.670> if<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:45.940> consider<00:02:46.239> this<00:02:46.660> region<00:02:47.080> here

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
help so if you consider this region here

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.650 
help so if you consider this region here
so<00:02:47.410> there's<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.650> region<00:02:48.069> in<00:02:48.940> front<00:02:49.450> of<00:02:49.569> the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
so there's a region in front of the

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.449 
so there's a region in front of the
promoter<00:02:50.019> a<00:02:50.260> little<00:02:50.500> bit<00:02:50.620> upstream<00:02:50.950> of<00:02:51.370> the

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
promoter a little bit upstream of the

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.620 
promoter a little bit upstream of the
promoter<00:02:52.410> called<00:02:53.410> an<00:02:53.799> enhancer<00:02:54.370> region<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:54.940> a

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
promoter called an enhancer region and a

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.470 
promoter called an enhancer region and a
silencer<00:02:56.170> region<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:59.010> it<00:03:00.010> turns<00:03:00.220> out<00:03:00.400> that

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
silencer region and it turns out that

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.420 
silencer region and it turns out that
there<00:03:01.480> are<00:03:01.660> proteins<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:02.319> also<00:03:02.739> bind<00:03:02.980> here

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
there are proteins that also bind here

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.870 
there are proteins that also bind here
that<00:03:04.090> help<00:03:04.959> RNA<00:03:05.380> polymerase<00:03:05.890> do<00:03:06.190> its<00:03:06.370> job<00:03:06.580> and

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
that help RNA polymerase do its job and

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.650 
that help RNA polymerase do its job and
so<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.840> protein<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.319> binds<00:03:08.860> here<00:03:09.660> that

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
so the protein that binds here that

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.300 
so the protein that binds here that
helps<00:03:10.900> RNA<00:03:11.170> polymerase<00:03:11.530> it's<00:03:11.769> called<00:03:12.040> an

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
helps RNA polymerase it's called an

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.640 
helps RNA polymerase it's called an
activator<00:03:12.910> protein<00:03:13.450> that's<00:03:14.019> what<00:03:14.140> a<00:03:14.290> stands

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
activator protein that's what a stands

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.039 
activator protein that's what a stands
for<00:03:14.799> and<00:03:15.730> so<00:03:16.239> again<00:03:16.480> when<00:03:16.660> you're<00:03:16.750> talking

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
for and so again when you're talking

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.460 
for and so again when you're talking
about<00:03:17.140> eukaryotic<00:03:17.739> cells<00:03:18.250> at<00:03:18.430> least

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
about eukaryotic cells at least

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.020 
about eukaryotic cells at least
transcription<00:03:20.470> again<00:03:21.190> requires<00:03:21.609> RNA

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
transcription again requires RNA

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.660 
transcription again requires RNA
polymerase<00:03:22.420> but<00:03:22.750> it'll<00:03:23.109> only<00:03:23.260> do<00:03:23.620> its<00:03:23.769> job<00:03:24.040> if

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
polymerase but it'll only do its job if

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.599 
polymerase but it'll only do its job if
there<00:03:24.910> is<00:03:25.000> all<00:03:25.239> of<00:03:25.480> these<00:03:25.600> proteins<00:03:26.590> are<00:03:27.280> also

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
there is all of these proteins are also

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.000 
there is all of these proteins are also
bound<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.450> basically<00:03:29.230> all<00:03:29.440> these<00:03:29.590> proteins

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
bound and basically all these proteins

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.550 
bound and basically all these proteins
help<00:03:30.310> the<00:03:30.579> RNA<00:03:30.730> polymerase<00:03:31.260> do<00:03:32.260> its<00:03:32.470> thing

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
help the RNA polymerase do its thing

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.750 
help the RNA polymerase do its thing
which<00:03:32.950> is<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.340> go<00:03:34.060> down<00:03:34.239> that<00:03:34.450> gene<00:03:34.810> and

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
which is to go down that gene and

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.370 
which is to go down that gene and
transcribe<00:03:36.760> it<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.120> so<00:03:37.480> remember<00:03:37.690> that<00:03:37.959> after

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
transcribe it and so remember that after

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.560 
transcribe it and so remember that after
it<00:03:38.530> hits<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:39.489> terminator<00:03:39.970> region<00:03:40.390> that's

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
it hits the terminator region that's

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.810 
it hits the terminator region that's
when<00:03:40.780> it<00:03:40.900> knows<00:03:41.079> that<00:03:41.109> it's<00:03:41.560> found<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.459> end<00:03:42.670> of

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
when it knows that it's found the end of

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.470 
when it knows that it's found the end of
the<00:03:42.910> gene<00:03:43.180> that's<00:03:43.930> when<00:03:44.109> it<00:03:44.230> comes<00:03:44.470> off<00:03:44.739> and

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
the gene that's when it comes off and

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.000 
the gene that's when it comes off and
again<00:03:46.480> what<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.870> RNA<00:03:47.109> polymerase<00:03:47.320> does<00:03:47.769> is

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
again what the RNA polymerase does is

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.520 
again what the RNA polymerase does is
that<00:03:48.100> it<00:03:48.280> as<00:03:48.489> it<00:03:48.700> goes<00:03:48.850> down<00:03:49.060> that<00:03:49.239> gene<00:03:49.630> it

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
that it as it goes down that gene it

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.530 
that it as it goes down that gene it
uses<00:03:50.950> it<00:03:51.100> in<00:03:51.250> order<00:03:51.430> to<00:03:51.519> make<00:03:51.790> it<00:03:51.970> reads<00:03:52.180> it<00:03:52.359> in

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
uses it in order to make it reads it in

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.960 
uses it in order to make it reads it in
order<00:03:52.810> to<00:03:52.959> make<00:03:53.140> a<00:03:53.380> messenger<00:03:54.220> RNA<00:03:54.489> molecule

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
order to make a messenger RNA molecule

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.300 
order to make a messenger RNA molecule
and<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.930> messenger<00:03:56.350> RNA<00:03:56.470> molecule<00:03:57.100> again

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
and the messenger RNA molecule again

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.400 
and the messenger RNA molecule again
goes<00:03:57.579> to<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:57.850> ribosome<00:03:58.209> to<00:03:58.900> tell<00:03:59.079> the<00:03:59.230> cell

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
goes to the ribosome to tell the cell

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.020 
goes to the ribosome to tell the cell
how<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.590> make<00:03:59.859> a<00:04:00.069> particular<00:04:00.549> type<00:04:00.970> of<00:04:01.180> protein

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
how to make a particular type of protein

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.970 
how to make a particular type of protein
so<00:04:04.030> kind<00:04:04.690> of<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:04.870> take-home<00:04:05.109> point<00:04:05.590> here<00:04:05.859> is

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
so kind of the take-home point here is

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.880 
so kind of the take-home point here is
that<00:04:06.010> in<00:04:06.280> eukaryotic<00:04:06.970> cells<00:04:07.209> there<00:04:08.140> are<00:04:08.170> a<00:04:08.410> lot

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
that in eukaryotic cells there are a lot

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.879 
that in eukaryotic cells there are a lot
of<00:04:08.920> proteins<00:04:09.609> that<00:04:09.850> that<00:04:10.540> are<00:04:10.989> required<00:04:11.560> in

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
of proteins that that are required in

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.780 
of proteins that that are required in
order<00:04:12.190> to<00:04:12.340> help<00:04:12.609> RNA<00:04:13.060> polymerase<00:04:13.530> bind<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.889> the

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
order to help RNA polymerase bind to the

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.969 
order to help RNA polymerase bind to the
promoter<00:04:16.120> region<00:04:16.690> so<00:04:17.380> we<00:04:17.530> mentioned<00:04:17.889> that

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
promoter region so we mentioned that

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:18.750 
promoter region so we mentioned that
there's<00:04:18.190> these<00:04:18.400> things<00:04:18.609> called

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
there's these things called

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.150 
there's these things called
transcription<00:04:19.419> factors<00:04:20.019> there<00:04:21.010> are<00:04:21.070> these

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
transcription factors there are these

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.279 
transcription factors there are these
things<00:04:21.340> called<00:04:21.609> regulatory<00:04:22.240> proteins<00:04:22.750> and

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
things called regulatory proteins and

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.779 
things called regulatory proteins and
there<00:04:23.560> are<00:04:23.680> these<00:04:23.800> things<00:04:23.979> called<00:04:24.130> activator

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
there are these things called activator

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:25.890 
there are these things called activator
proteins<00:04:25.300> again

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
proteins again

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.960 
proteins again
they<00:04:26.320> all<00:04:26.530> help<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:27.370> RNA<00:04:27.699> polymerase

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
they all help the RNA polymerase

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.010 
they all help the RNA polymerase
transcribes<00:04:28.900> gene<00:04:32.430> you<00:04:33.430> might<00:04:33.610> be<00:04:33.759> wondering

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
transcribes gene you might be wondering

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.020 
transcribes gene you might be wondering

in this picture here so check out this

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.939 
in this picture here so check out this
activator<00:04:37.630> protein<00:04:38.110> all<00:04:38.289> the<00:04:38.440> way<00:04:38.530> over<00:04:38.740> here

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
activator protein all the way over here

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:40.650 
activator protein all the way over here
you<00:04:39.070> might<00:04:39.250> be<00:04:39.280> wondering<00:04:39.580> how<00:04:40.389> does<00:04:40.630> a

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
you might be wondering how does a

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.860 
you might be wondering how does a
protein<00:04:41.320> that<00:04:41.590> binds<00:04:41.979> all<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:42.460> way<00:04:42.550> over<00:04:42.820> here

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.570 
protein that binds all the way over here
how's<00:04:43.870> that<00:04:44.110> going<00:04:44.320> to<00:04:44.440> help<00:04:44.560> RNA<00:04:45.100> polymerase

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
how's that going to help RNA polymerase

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.320 
how's that going to help RNA polymerase
attach<00:04:46.320> way<00:04:47.320> up<00:04:47.590> here<00:04:47.919> it<00:04:48.820> looks<00:04:48.850> like<00:04:49.060> there's

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
attach way up here it looks like there's

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.930 
attach way up here it looks like there's
a<00:04:49.419> big<00:04:49.720> disconnect<00:04:50.410> between<00:04:50.979> the<00:04:51.460> activator

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
a big disconnect between the activator

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.080 
a big disconnect between the activator
protein<00:04:52.449> and<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:54.220> RNA<00:04:54.490> polymerase<00:04:54.880> that

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
protein and the RNA polymerase that

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.050 
protein and the RNA polymerase that
binds<00:04:55.479> to<00:04:55.600> the<00:04:55.720> promoter<00:04:56.490> how<00:04:57.490> does<00:04:57.729> this<00:04:57.880> help

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
binds to the promoter how does this help

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.760 
binds to the promoter how does this help
something<00:04:58.479> that<00:04:58.630> that<00:04:58.960> binds<00:04:59.260> all<00:04:59.530> the<00:04:59.680> way

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
something that that binds all the way

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.700 
something that that binds all the way
over<00:05:00.010> here<00:05:00.310> well<00:05:01.030> it<00:05:01.120> turns<00:05:01.300> out<00:05:01.539> that<00:05:01.780> DNA

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
over here well it turns out that DNA

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.490 
over here well it turns out that DNA
it's<00:05:03.310> kind<00:05:03.610> of<00:05:03.699> flexible<00:05:04.180> so<00:05:04.660> it<00:05:04.780> can<00:05:04.960> bend<00:05:05.229> and

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
it's kind of flexible so it can bend and

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.500 
it's kind of flexible so it can bend and
because<00:05:06.340> of<00:05:06.370> that<00:05:06.580> bending<00:05:07.120> that's<00:05:07.270> what

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
because of that bending that's what

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.350 
because of that bending that's what
actually<00:05:07.690> allows<00:05:08.199> the<00:05:08.650> activator<00:05:09.070> protein<00:05:09.610> to

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
actually allows the activator protein to

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.590 
actually allows the activator protein to
interact<00:05:10.750> with<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.770> RNA<00:05:11.889> porn<00:05:12.340> base<00:05:12.550> and<00:05:12.820> make

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
interact with the RNA porn base and make

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.600 
interact with the RNA porn base and make
sure<00:05:13.900> that<00:05:14.229> the<00:05:14.380> RNA<00:05:14.620> polymerase<00:05:14.860> stays<00:05:15.340> there

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
sure that the RNA polymerase stays there

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.140 
sure that the RNA polymerase stays there
here's<00:05:16.449> what<00:05:16.570> we're<00:05:16.660> talking<00:05:16.990> about<00:05:17.880> so<00:05:18.880> again

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
here's what we're talking about so again

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.200 
here's what we're talking about so again
here's<00:05:19.449> a<00:05:19.539> the<00:05:20.470> promoter<00:05:20.860> region<00:05:21.340> here<00:05:22.000> is<00:05:22.090> the

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
here's a the promoter region here is the

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.839 
here's a the promoter region here is the
RNA<00:05:22.419> polymerase<00:05:22.780> we<00:05:23.740> said<00:05:23.979> that<00:05:24.220> there's<00:05:24.610> all

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
RNA polymerase we said that there's all

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.189 
RNA polymerase we said that there's all
kinds<00:05:25.210> of<00:05:25.270> things<00:05:25.479> that<00:05:25.660> help<00:05:25.810> it<00:05:25.990> stay

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
kinds of things that help it stay

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.140 
kinds of things that help it stay
attached<00:05:26.590> including<00:05:27.400> something<00:05:27.639> called<00:05:27.789> an

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
attached including something called an

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.750 
attached including something called an
activator<00:05:28.539> protein<00:05:29.050> which<00:05:29.229> is<00:05:29.380> way<00:05:29.590> over<00:05:30.400> here

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
activator protein which is way over here

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.420 
activator protein which is way over here
on<00:05:30.880> this<00:05:31.060> portion<00:05:31.419> of<00:05:31.599> the<00:05:31.720> DNA<00:05:32.160> but<00:05:33.160> what

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
on this portion of the DNA but what

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:34.680 
on this portion of the DNA but what
you're<00:05:33.580> what<00:05:34.000> you're<00:05:34.150> seeing<00:05:34.330> here<00:05:34.539> is<00:05:34.599> that

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
you're what you're seeing here is that

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.230 
you're what you're seeing here is that
the<00:05:34.930> DNA<00:05:35.260> can<00:05:35.440> actually<00:05:35.860> bend<00:05:36.160> and<00:05:36.460> it's

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
the DNA can actually bend and it's

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.969 
the DNA can actually bend and it's
because<00:05:37.539> of<00:05:37.720> that<00:05:37.870> bending<00:05:38.560> that's<00:05:38.770> what

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
because of that bending that's what

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.159 
because of that bending that's what
allow<00:05:39.250> is<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:39.550> activator<00:05:39.970> protein<00:05:40.479> to

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
allow is the activator protein to

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:42.870 
allow is the activator protein to
actually<00:05:41.500> be<00:05:41.620> in<00:05:41.710> the<00:05:41.830> neighborhood<00:05:42.250> of<00:05:42.370> where

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
actually be in the neighborhood of where

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.170 
actually be in the neighborhood of where
the<00:05:43.650> where<00:05:44.650> the<00:05:44.770> RNA<00:05:45.010> polymerase<00:05:45.340> is<00:05:45.849> and

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
the where the RNA polymerase is and

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.990 
the where the RNA polymerase is and
again<00:05:46.449> all<00:05:46.720> of<00:05:46.750> these<00:05:46.990> proteins<00:05:47.289> here

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
again all of these proteins here

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.510 
again all of these proteins here
basically<00:05:49.000> help<00:05:49.510> the<00:05:49.659> RNA<00:05:49.810> polymerase<00:05:50.520> attach

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
basically help the RNA polymerase attach

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.159 
basically help the RNA polymerase attach
to<00:05:51.760> the<00:05:51.849> promoter<00:05:52.150> and<00:05:52.360> a<00:05:52.750> perform

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
to the promoter and a perform

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:56.909 
to the promoter and a perform
transcription<00:05:55.320> one<00:05:56.320> last<00:05:56.530> thing<00:05:56.770> we'll

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
transcription one last thing we'll

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.219 
transcription one last thing we'll
mention<00:05:57.250> so<00:05:57.400> basically<00:05:57.789> that's<00:05:58.060> you<00:05:58.720> have<00:05:59.050> the

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
mention so basically that's you have the

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:01.110 
mention so basically that's you have the
the<00:05:59.500> whole<00:05:59.680> story<00:06:00.010> as<00:06:00.159> far<00:06:00.370> as<00:06:00.490> what<00:06:00.699> happens

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
the whole story as far as what happens

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.080 
the whole story as far as what happens
during<00:06:01.419> transcription<00:06:02.580> so<00:06:03.580> one<00:06:03.789> last<00:06:03.940> thing

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
during transcription so one last thing

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.550 
during transcription so one last thing
we'll<00:06:04.330> mention<00:06:04.539> before<00:06:04.810> then<00:06:05.260> we<00:06:05.440> leave

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
we'll mention before then we leave

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.830 
we'll mention before then we leave
transcription<00:06:06.310> and<00:06:06.460> look<00:06:06.610> at<00:06:06.760> translation<00:06:07.150> is

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
transcription and look at translation is

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.899 
transcription and look at translation is
this<00:06:08.470> so<00:06:08.710> again<00:06:09.010> what<00:06:09.190> we've<00:06:09.340> just<00:06:09.520> looked<00:06:09.669> at

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:09.909 
this so again what we've just looked at

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:12.719 
this so again what we've just looked at
is<00:06:10.120> how<00:06:10.419> does<00:06:10.599> the<00:06:10.750> cell<00:06:10.960> read<00:06:11.620> a<00:06:11.650> DNA<00:06:12.190> molecule

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
is how does the cell read a DNA molecule

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.839 
is how does the cell read a DNA molecule
and<00:06:13.000> in<00:06:13.810> order<00:06:14.110> to<00:06:14.260> make<00:06:14.409> a<00:06:14.590> messenger<00:06:15.159> RNA<00:06:15.610> out

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:15.849 
and in order to make a messenger RNA out

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:18.180 
and in order to make a messenger RNA out
of<00:06:16.030> it<00:06:16.210> it's<00:06:16.930> this<00:06:17.169> messenger<00:06:17.680> RNA<00:06:18.010> then

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:18.190 
of it it's this messenger RNA then

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.399 
of it it's this messenger RNA then
that's<00:06:18.400> going<00:06:18.580> to<00:06:18.669> go<00:06:18.789> to<00:06:18.849> the<00:06:19.150> ribosome<00:06:19.750> in

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:20.409 
that's going to go to the ribosome in

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:22.649 
that's going to go to the ribosome in
order<00:06:20.740> to<00:06:20.979> instruct<00:06:21.550> the<00:06:21.669> cell<00:06:21.940> how<00:06:22.180> to<00:06:22.240> make<00:06:22.479> a

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
order to instruct the cell how to make a

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:25.350 
order to instruct the cell how to make a
protein<00:06:23.400> it<00:06:24.400> turns<00:06:24.610> out<00:06:24.820> though<00:06:25.000> that<00:06:25.210> in

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
protein it turns out though that in

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.770 
protein it turns out though that in
eukaryotic<00:06:25.840> and<00:06:26.320> eukaryotic<00:06:26.740> cells<00:06:27.780> things

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
eukaryotic and eukaryotic cells things

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.500 
eukaryotic and eukaryotic cells things
happen<00:06:29.229> to<00:06:29.380> this<00:06:29.500> messenger<00:06:30.010> RNA<00:06:30.460> before<00:06:31.300> it

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
happen to this messenger RNA before it

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.409 
happen to this messenger RNA before it
heads<00:06:31.690> over<00:06:31.930> to<00:06:32.320> the<00:06:32.620> ribosome<00:06:33.310> and<00:06:33.520> one<00:06:34.300> of

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:34.419 
heads over to the ribosome and one of

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:35.760 
heads over to the ribosome and one of
the<00:06:34.479> major<00:06:34.659> things<00:06:34.960> that<00:06:35.050> happens<00:06:35.500> to<00:06:35.620> this

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:35.770 
the major things that happens to this

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.070 
the major things that happens to this
messenger<00:06:36.219> RNA<00:06:36.580> is<00:06:36.789> that<00:06:37.300> things<00:06:37.599> are<00:06:37.750> added

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
messenger RNA is that things are added

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.420 
messenger RNA is that things are added
to

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
to

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.610 
to
so<00:06:39.430> to<00:06:39.490> one<00:06:39.880> end<00:06:40.120> of<00:06:40.300> the<00:06:40.450> messenger<00:06:40.780> RNA<00:06:41.380> is

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
so to one end of the messenger RNA is

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.300 
so to one end of the messenger RNA is
added<00:06:42.490> just<00:06:43.000> a<00:06:43.150> string<00:06:43.420> of<00:06:43.450> guanine<00:06:44.070> and<00:06:45.070> to

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
added just a string of guanine and to

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.300 
added just a string of guanine and to
the<00:06:45.400> other<00:06:45.550> end<00:06:45.820> ra<00:06:46.120> is<00:06:46.990> added<00:06:47.380> a<00:06:47.530> string<00:06:48.070> of

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
the other end ra is added a string of

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:52.140 
the other end ra is added a string of
adenine<00:06:48.850> and<00:06:49.590> basically<00:06:50.590> by<00:06:50.830> adding<00:06:51.280> the

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
adenine and basically by adding the

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.970 
adenine and basically by adding the
string<00:06:52.390> of<00:06:52.540> G's<00:06:52.750> on<00:06:52.990> one<00:06:53.170> end<00:06:53.380> and<00:06:53.590> the<00:06:53.920> string

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:53.980 
string of G's on one end and the string

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.340 
string of G's on one end and the string
of<00:06:54.280> A's<00:06:54.400> on<00:06:54.670> the<00:06:54.760> other<00:06:54.880> end<00:06:55.120> it<00:06:55.660> makes<00:06:55.930> it<00:06:56.110> so

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:56.350 
of A's on the other end it makes it so

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.680 
of A's on the other end it makes it so
that<00:06:56.380> the<00:06:56.650> messenger<00:06:57.490> RNA<00:06:57.610> once<00:06:58.270> it<00:06:58.420> gets<00:06:58.600> to

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
that the messenger RNA once it gets to

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.730 
that the messenger RNA once it gets to
the<00:06:58.750> ribosome<00:06:59.200> it<00:07:00.300> it<00:07:01.300> can<00:07:01.480> stay<00:07:01.780> attached

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:02.740 
the ribosome it it can stay attached

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.630 
the ribosome it it can stay attached
there<00:07:03.100> right<00:07:03.430> so<00:07:03.670> these<00:07:03.910> G's<00:07:04.450> and<00:07:04.780> these<00:07:05.320> days

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:05.640 
there right so these G's and these days

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.870 
there right so these G's and these days
play<00:07:06.640> a<00:07:06.670> role<00:07:06.970> in<00:07:07.240> helping<00:07:08.640> stabilize<00:07:09.640> the

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:09.880 
play a role in helping stabilize the

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.030 
play a role in helping stabilize the
interaction<00:07:10.480> between<00:07:10.660> this<00:07:11.110> messenger<00:07:11.650> RNA

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.040 
interaction between this messenger RNA

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.670 
interaction between this messenger RNA
molecule<00:07:12.610> and<00:07:12.910> the<00:07:13.540> ribosome<00:07:13.720> after<00:07:14.410> it<00:07:14.500> gets

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 
molecule and the ribosome after it gets

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.980 
molecule and the ribosome after it gets
there<00:07:14.920> all<00:07:15.610> right<00:07:15.730> so<00:07:15.970> again<00:07:16.090> the<00:07:16.510> big<00:07:16.630> picture

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990 
there all right so again the big picture

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.780 
there all right so again the big picture
is<00:07:17.080> that<00:07:17.110> the<00:07:17.380> messenger<00:07:17.800> RNA<00:07:18.100> and<00:07:18.130> eukaryotes

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:18.790 
is that the messenger RNA and eukaryotes

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.270 
is that the messenger RNA and eukaryotes
after<00:07:19.120> it's<00:07:19.240> been<00:07:19.360> made<00:07:19.630> and<00:07:20.170> after<00:07:20.530> it's<00:07:21.130> had

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 
after it's been made and after it's had

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.680 
after it's been made and after it's had
the<00:07:21.430> g's<00:07:21.700> and<00:07:22.030> then<00:07:22.120> a<00:07:22.240> is<00:07:22.390> added<00:07:24.000> so<00:07:25.000> the<00:07:25.030> G's

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:25.690 
the g's and then a is added so the G's

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.350 
the g's and then a is added so the G's
is<00:07:25.840> called<00:07:26.080> just<00:07:26.290> a<00:07:26.410> poly<00:07:26.680> G<00:07:27.070> cap<00:07:27.430> so<00:07:28.000> poly

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 
is called just a poly G cap so poly

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.050 
is called just a poly G cap so poly
means<00:07:28.660> many<00:07:28.780> so<00:07:29.340> string<00:07:30.340> of<00:07:30.460> many<00:07:30.640> G's<00:07:30.910> are

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.060 
means many so string of many G's are

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.240 
means many so string of many G's are
added<00:07:31.330> to<00:07:31.450> one<00:07:31.600> end<00:07:31.810> and<00:07:32.020> a<00:07:32.620> string<00:07:32.950> of<00:07:33.040> many

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:33.250 
added to one end and a string of many

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.850 
added to one end and a string of many
A's<00:07:33.430> are<00:07:33.670> added<00:07:33.940> to<00:07:34.030> the<00:07:34.150> other<00:07:34.710> after<00:07:35.710> that

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.860 
A's are added to the other after that

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.970 
A's are added to the other after that
happens<00:07:36.220> then<00:07:36.550> the<00:07:37.510> messenger<00:07:38.080> RNA<00:07:38.200> ends<00:07:38.860> up

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:38.980 
happens then the messenger RNA ends up

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.280 
happens then the messenger RNA ends up
going<00:07:39.190> to<00:07:39.340> the<00:07:39.490> ribosome<00:07:39.910> to<00:07:40.300> be<00:07:40.600> translated

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:41.290 
going to the ribosome to be translated

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.160 
going to the ribosome to be translated
and<00:07:42.160> so<00:07:42.430> we'll<00:07:43.120> take<00:07:43.240> a<00:07:43.300> look<00:07:43.570> at<00:07:43.690> how<00:07:43.810> that

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:44.170 
and so we'll take a look at how that

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.910 
and so we'll take a look at how that
translation<00:07:44.980> happens<00:07:45.340> next
