problem<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:06.090> going<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.540> try<00:01:07.020> and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
problem is that it's going to try and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.609 
problem is that it's going to try and
come<00:01:07.380> back<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.770> way<00:01:08.869> into<00:01:09.869> this<00:01:09.990> tree<00:01:10.350> and

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
come back this way into this tree and

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.320 
come back this way into this tree and
once<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> streets<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:11.970> be<00:01:12.030> very

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
once it's in the streets can be very

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.590 
once it's in the streets can be very

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
difficult to get hold up yet maybe it's

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.240 
difficult to get hold up yet maybe it's
maybe<00:01:15.810> it's<00:01:15.930> cancer<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> car<00:01:16.740> let's<00:01:16.979> jump
