doubt the number one choice for carp
anglers<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.060> think<00:01:39.659> because<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:39.990> very<00:01:40.140> easy

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
anglers I think because it's very easy

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.920 
anglers I think because it's very easy
to<00:01:40.650> use<00:01:40.979> they're<00:01:41.610> very<00:01:41.820> versatile<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.780> they

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
to use they're very versatile and they

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.630 
to use they're very versatile and they
don't<00:01:43.170> tangle<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.920> let's<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.280> look<00:01:44.369> at<00:01:44.520> our

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
don't tangle so let's have a look at our

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.639 
don't tangle so let's have a look at our
range<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.270> talk<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.840> through<00:01:45.990> when<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.439> use

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
range and talk you through when to use

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.830 
range and talk you through when to use
each<00:01:46.680> one<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.369> first<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.820> all<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.450> entrapped

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
each one so first of all the entrapped

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.830 
each one so first of all the entrapped
soft<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.130> one<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.430> superseded<00:01:51.329> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
soft this is the one that superseded the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.649 
soft this is the one that superseded the
hybrid<00:01:52.290> soft<00:01:52.640> basically<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.790> Dyneema<00:01:54.270> core

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
hybrid soft basically is a Dyneema core

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.080 
hybrid soft basically is a Dyneema core
so<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> braided<00:01:55.259> core<00:01:55.710> with<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.430> plastic<00:01:56.909> coating

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
so a braided core with a plastic coating

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.700 
so a braided core with a plastic coating
on<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.479> outside<00:01:57.509> comes<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.439> three<00:01:58.680> colors

use<00:02:20.880> if<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.510> was<00:02:21.630> fishing<00:02:21.870> with<00:02:21.900> very<00:02:22.170> small

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440

hooks very small bites fishing for
smaller<00:02:24.960> fish<00:02:25.320> I'd<00:02:25.890> probably<00:02:26.100> use<00:02:26.250> that

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
smaller fish I'd probably use that

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.670 
smaller fish I'd probably use that
because<00:02:26.670> it's<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:26.940> little<00:02:27.090> more<00:02:27.390> subtle<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:28.230> 20

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680

very<00:02:37.260> very<00:02:37.320> versatile<00:02:38.130> you<00:02:38.730> see<00:02:38.910> on<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.210> one

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
very very versatile you see on this one

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.480 
very very versatile you see on this one
he's<00:02:39.930> fishing<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.380> all<00:02:40.560> straight<00:02:41.160> all<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.370> way

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
he's fishing it all straight all the way

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.160 
he's fishing it all straight all the way
through<00:02:41.910> there's<00:02:42.150> no<00:02:42.270> break<00:02:42.600> in<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.870> at<00:02:42.960> all

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
through there's no break in it at all

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.110 
through there's no break in it at all
it's<00:02:43.740> right<00:02:43.950> up<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.370> hook<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.760> even<00:02:45.030> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
it's right up to the hook and even the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.480 
it's right up to the hook and even the
knot<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.750> out<00:02:46.110> of<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.350> coated<00:02:46.740> material<00:02:47.340> and

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
knot is out of the coated material and

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.850 
knot is out of the coated material and
then<00:02:47.880> he<00:02:48.000> stripped<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.540> away<00:02:48.600> at<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.530> top<00:02:49.709> of

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
then he stripped it away at the top of

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.130 
then he stripped it away at the top of
the<00:02:49.950> knot<00:02:50.130> there<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:51.300> he's<00:02:51.420> got<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.570> soft<00:02:51.870> hair

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
the knot there so he's got a soft hair

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.080 
the knot there so he's got a soft hair
basically<00:02:52.380> so<00:02:53.010> he's<00:02:53.370> combining<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.910> with<00:02:53.970> a

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
basically so he's combining that with a

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.880 
basically so he's combining that with a
shoddy<00:02:54.360> hook<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.870> it's<00:02:55.290> turning<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.740> hook

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
shoddy hook and it's turning the hook

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.320 
shoddy hook and it's turning the hook
and<00:02:56.040> catching<00:02:56.370> hold<00:02:56.580> very<00:02:56.760> quickly<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.270> you

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
and catching hold very quickly and you

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.150 
and catching hold very quickly and you
see<00:02:57.480> at<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.660> other<00:02:57.810> end<00:02:58.050> he's<00:02:58.590> got<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:58.800> grin<00:02:59.040> and

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
see at the other end he's got a grin and

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.730 
see at the other end he's got a grin and
not<00:02:59.340> tied<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.360> hybrid<00:03:00.600> lead<00:03:00.990> clip<00:03:01.260> and

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
not tied to a hybrid lead clip and

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.050 
not tied to a hybrid lead clip and
what's<00:03:01.890> basically<00:03:02.070> going<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:02.490> happen<00:03:02.820> on<00:03:02.940> the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
what's basically going to happen on the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.000 
what's basically going to happen on the
cast<00:03:03.300> because<00:03:03.570> there's<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:03.959> hinge<00:03:04.200> in<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.860> hook

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
cast because there's a hinge in the hook

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.680 
cast because there's a hinge in the hook
link<00:03:05.190> at<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.490> point<00:03:05.760> it's<00:03:06.240> going<00:03:06.300> to<00:03:06.450> fold

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
link at that point it's going to fold

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.199 
link at that point it's going to fold
back<00:03:06.840> next<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:07.890> dark<00:03:08.160> matter<00:03:08.400> tubing<00:03:09.030> and

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
back next to the dark matter tubing and

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.610 
back next to the dark matter tubing and
that's<00:03:09.600> basically<00:03:10.020> going<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.260> stop<00:03:10.470> it

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
that's basically going to stop it

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.440 
that's basically going to stop it
tangling<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:11.670> see<00:03:11.850> he's<00:03:11.940> got<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.090> big<00:03:12.270> lump

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
tangling and you see he's got a big lump

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.699 
tangling and you see he's got a big lump
of<00:03:12.570> party<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.080> middle<00:03:13.290> of<00:03:13.380> that<00:03:13.500> that's

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
of party in the middle of that that's

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.650 
of party in the middle of that that's
molded<00:03:14.100> around<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.430> sinker<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.450> just

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
molded around a sinker and that just

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.120 
molded around a sinker and that just
helps<00:03:15.930> everything<00:03:16.140> sink<00:03:16.560> down<00:03:16.770> on<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:16.980> bottom

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
helps everything sink down on the bottom

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.370 
helps everything sink down on the bottom
all<00:03:17.730> these<00:03:18.090> materials<00:03:18.630> sink<00:03:18.900> on<00:03:19.080> their<00:03:19.230> own

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
all these materials sink on their own

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.320 
all these materials sink on their own
but<00:03:19.950> if<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.160> put<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:20.430> on<00:03:20.610> there<00:03:20.790> as<00:03:20.910> well<00:03:20.940> if

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
but if you put that on there as well if

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.759 
but if you put that on there as well if
there's<00:03:21.510> any<00:03:21.720> little<00:03:21.959> contours<00:03:22.530> in<00:03:22.680> the

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
there's any little contours in the

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.920 
there's any little contours in the
bottom<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.700> hook<00:03:23.850> link<00:03:23.970> will<00:03:24.150> sink<00:03:24.390> into<00:03:24.630> them

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
bottom the hook link will sink into them

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.290 
bottom the hook link will sink into them
and<00:03:25.260> it's<00:03:25.410> much<00:03:25.709> much<00:03:25.920> harder<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.459> see<00:03:26.700> if<00:03:27.090> it's

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
and it's much much harder to see if it's

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.050 
and it's much much harder to see if it's
pinned<00:03:27.570> to<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.780> bottom<00:03:28.140> now<00:03:28.830> I've<00:03:29.370> got<00:03:29.790> 30

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060

said<00:03:44.940> why<00:03:45.060> don't<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.420> use<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.690> 20<00:03:46.049> or<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.440> 15

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920

tangled<00:03:49.860> so<00:03:50.010> I'm<00:03:50.100> going<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.280> keep<00:03:50.430> using<00:03:50.640> it

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
tangled so I'm going to keep using it

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.820 
tangled so I'm going to keep using it
forever<00:03:51.060> this<00:03:51.780> one<00:03:51.989> set<00:03:52.290> up<00:03:52.440> for<00:03:52.650> if<00:03:52.709> I'm

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
forever this one set up for if I'm

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.920 
forever this one set up for if I'm
fishing<00:03:53.040> at<00:03:53.250> gigantica<00:03:54.000> or<00:03:54.180> any<00:03:54.630> sort<00:03:54.900> of

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
fishing at gigantica or any sort of

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.140 
fishing at gigantica or any sort of
clean<00:03:55.200> bottom<00:03:55.650> if<00:03:55.799> I'm<00:03:55.920> boilie<00:03:56.310> fishing<00:03:56.340> so

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
clean bottom if I'm boilie fishing so

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.490 
clean bottom if I'm boilie fishing so
it's<00:03:57.269> about<00:03:57.420> 80<00:03:57.630> inches<00:03:57.989> long

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
it's about 80 inches long

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.860 
it's about 80 inches long
got<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:58.769> size<00:03:58.980> 4<00:03:59.280> caps<00:03:59.549> a<00:03:59.670> curve<00:03:59.880> on<00:04:00.060> there<00:04:00.360> and<00:04:00.570> a

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
got a size 4 caps a curve on there and a

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.420 
got a size 4 caps a curve on there and a
little<00:04:01.049> bit<00:04:01.170> by<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.470> hook<00:04:01.680> there<00:04:01.920> you<00:04:02.040> can<00:04:02.190> see

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
little bit by the hook there you can see

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.789 
little bit by the hook there you can see
there's<00:04:03.090> a<00:04:03.120> little<00:04:03.420> bit<00:04:03.570> stripped<00:04:03.900> back<00:04:04.080> so

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
there's a little bit stripped back so

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.500 
there's a little bit stripped back so
that<00:04:04.950> hook<00:04:05.130> can<00:04:05.280> lift<00:04:05.489> up<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:05.850> catch<00:04:06.000> hold<00:04:06.299> but

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
that hook can lift up and catch hold but

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.060 
that hook can lift up and catch hold but
the<00:04:06.570> hook<00:04:06.690> link<00:04:06.810> so<00:04:07.110> soft<00:04:07.470> anyway<00:04:07.769> to<00:04:07.920> be

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
the hook link so soft anyway to be

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.770 
the hook link so soft anyway to be
honest<00:04:08.430> it's<00:04:08.820> going<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.090> move<00:04:09.239> very<00:04:09.269> easily

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
honest it's going to move very easily

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.410 
honest it's going to move very easily
and<00:04:10.290> go<00:04:10.739> up<00:04:10.890> into<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.220> fish's<00:04:11.489> mouth<00:04:11.700> you<00:04:12.330> know

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
and go up into the fish's mouth you know

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.720 
and go up into the fish's mouth you know
really<00:04:12.780> quickly<00:04:13.019> and<00:04:13.739> then<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.310> next<00:04:14.580> one

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
really quickly and then the next one

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.759 
really quickly and then the next one
which<00:04:14.910> is<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:15.090> new<00:04:15.360> one<00:04:15.690> lots<00:04:16.169> of<00:04:16.350> people<00:04:16.650> have

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
which is a new one lots of people have

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.159 
which is a new one lots of people have
asked<00:04:17.040> us<00:04:17.130> for<00:04:17.250> this<00:04:17.400> this<00:04:18.330> is<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.780> entrapped

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
asked us for this this is the entrapped

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.349 
asked us for this this is the entrapped
semi<00:04:19.560> stiff<00:04:19.950> so<00:04:20.190> straightaway<00:04:20.580> if<00:04:20.880> I<00:04:20.940> push<00:04:21.239> the

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
semi stiff so straightaway if I push the

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.180 
semi stiff so straightaway if I push the
hook<00:04:21.479> link<00:04:21.630> together<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:22.620> can<00:04:22.800> see<00:04:23.010> it's<00:04:23.160> a

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
hook link together you can see it's a

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.969 
hook link together you can see it's a
little<00:04:23.550> bit<00:04:23.729> stiffer<00:04:24.210> than<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:24.990> soft<00:04:25.349> so

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
little bit stiffer than the soft so

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.260 
little bit stiffer than the soft so
basically<00:04:26.400> it's<00:04:26.550> going<00:04:26.669> to<00:04:26.729> push<00:04:26.970> the

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
basically it's going to push the

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.850 
basically it's going to push the
by<00:04:27.479> away<00:04:27.780> from<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.139> LED<00:04:28.289> that<00:04:28.470> little<00:04:28.740> bit

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
by away from the LED that little bit

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.219 
by away from the LED that little bit
better<00:04:29.069> still<00:04:29.550> a<00:04:29.580> brilliant<00:04:30.090> all-rounder<00:04:30.780> you

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
better still a brilliant all-rounder you

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:33.140 
better still a brilliant all-rounder you
can<00:04:31.380> use<00:04:31.530> a<00:04:31.560> soft<00:04:31.860> anywhere<00:04:32.370> you<00:04:32.639> can<00:04:32.789> use<00:04:32.940> this

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
can use a soft anywhere you can use this

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.270 
can use a soft anywhere you can use this
pretty<00:04:33.360> much<00:04:33.569> anywhere<00:04:33.750> as<00:04:34.169> well<00:04:34.199> I<00:04:34.620> probably

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
pretty much anywhere as well I probably

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.279 
pretty much anywhere as well I probably
avoid<00:04:35.550> it<00:04:35.729> in<00:04:35.819> really<00:04:36.060> heavy<00:04:36.389> weed<00:04:36.750> just

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
avoid it in really heavy weed just

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.200 
avoid it in really heavy weed just
because<00:04:37.620> it<00:04:37.979> can<00:04:38.160> come<00:04:38.340> to<00:04:38.550> rest<00:04:38.789> and<00:04:39.030> because

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
because it can come to rest and because

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.089 
because it can come to rest and because
of<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.449> stiffness<00:04:39.720> of<00:04:40.050> it<00:04:40.229> the<00:04:40.560> bike<00:04:40.770> can<00:04:40.919> end

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
of the stiffness of it the bike can end

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:42.980 
of the stiffness of it the bike can end
up<00:04:41.190> sitting<00:04:41.490> up<00:04:41.669> in<00:04:41.849> the<00:04:41.880> weed<00:04:42.150> then<00:04:42.750> I'd<00:04:42.870> want

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
up sitting up in the weed then I'd want

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.779 
up sitting up in the weed then I'd want
to<00:04:43.080> go<00:04:43.229> to<00:04:43.289> a<00:04:43.410> softer<00:04:43.770> hook<00:04:43.949> me<00:04:44.099> but<00:04:44.370> for

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
to go to a softer hook me but for

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.879 
to go to a softer hook me but for
absolutely<00:04:45.300> everything<00:04:45.569> else<00:04:45.930> this<00:04:46.710> is

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
better for anti-tangle this one because

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.800 
better for anti-tangle this one because
of<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.550> stiffness<00:05:05.940> of<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.120> coating<00:05:06.630> and

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
of that stiffness you see there I've got

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.390 
of that stiffness you see there I've got

a bit of putty on there just to sink it
down<00:05:14.580> and<00:05:14.789> pin<00:05:14.970> it<00:05:15.090> to<00:05:15.210> the<00:05:15.240> bottom<00:05:15.659> and<00:05:16.050> on

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
down and pin it to the bottom and on

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.200 
down and pin it to the bottom and on
this<00:05:16.319> particular<00:05:16.500> one<00:05:17.039> I've<00:05:17.280> stripped<00:05:17.909> a<00:05:18.060> bit

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
this particular one I've stripped a bit

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.149 
this particular one I've stripped a bit
back<00:05:18.419> near<00:05:18.659> the<00:05:18.690> hook<00:05:18.990> so<00:05:19.620> the<00:05:19.710> hook<00:05:19.860> can<00:05:19.979> lift

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:20.159 
back near the hook so the hook can lift

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:21.320 
back near the hook so the hook can lift
up<00:05:20.340> and<00:05:20.460> catch<00:05:20.639> hold<00:05:20.909> and<00:05:21.000> that's<00:05:21.060> really

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
up and catch hold and that's really

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.149 
up and catch hold and that's really
important<00:05:21.870> with<00:05:21.990> stiff<00:05:22.229> coated<00:05:22.650> hook<00:05:22.830> links

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
important with stiff coated hook links

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:25.249 
important with stiff coated hook links
there<00:05:23.580> should<00:05:23.819> be<00:05:23.970> some<00:05:24.300> kind<00:05:24.330> of<00:05:24.750> break<00:05:24.990> in

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
there should be some kind of break in

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.219 
there should be some kind of break in
them<00:05:25.470> so<00:05:25.949> that<00:05:26.130> hook<00:05:26.460> can<00:05:26.669> lift<00:05:26.909> up<00:05:27.150> turn<00:05:27.960> and

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
them so that hook can lift up turn and

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:29.930 
them so that hook can lift up turn and
catch<00:05:28.380> hold<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:29.009> then<00:05:29.490> I've<00:05:29.610> got<00:05:29.729> the<00:05:29.819> old

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
catch hold and then I've got the old

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.399 
catch hold and then I've got the old
favourite<00:05:30.300> rig<00:05:30.449> ring<00:05:30.630> on<00:05:30.780> there<00:05:31.020> and<00:05:31.169> bit<00:05:31.320> of

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
favourite rig ring on there and bit of

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.529 
favourite rig ring on there and bit of
shrink<00:05:31.650> tube<00:05:31.830> as<00:05:31.979> well<00:05:32.190> to<00:05:32.789> help<00:05:32.940> that<00:05:33.150> cap<00:05:33.360> to

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
shrink tube as well to help that cap to

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.659 
shrink tube as well to help that cap to
curve<00:05:33.780> turn<00:05:34.530> over<00:05:34.979> and<00:05:35.159> then<00:05:35.250> at<00:05:35.400> the<00:05:35.520> other

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
curve turn over and then at the other

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:36.140 
curve turn over and then at the other
end

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
end

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.560 
end
I've<00:05:36.240> crimped<00:05:37.050> it<00:05:37.169> on<00:05:37.460> using<00:05:38.460> our<00:05:38.580> crimp<00:05:38.940> you

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
I've crimped it on using our crimp you

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.089 
I've crimped it on using our crimp you
could<00:05:39.719> tie<00:05:39.870> a<00:05:39.900> half-blood<00:05:40.409> knot<00:05:40.680> or<00:05:40.860> Grinner

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
could tie a half-blood knot or Grinner

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:42.770 
could tie a half-blood knot or Grinner
in<00:05:41.310> that<00:05:41.550> but<00:05:41.820> because<00:05:42.030> it<00:05:42.150> is<00:05:42.180> stiff<00:05:42.539> it<00:05:42.659> is<00:05:42.750> a

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
in that but because it is stiff it is a

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.080 
in that but because it is stiff it is a
little<00:05:43.020> bit<00:05:43.169> harder<00:05:43.469> to<00:05:43.500> do<00:05:43.800> so<00:05:44.070> by<00:05:44.759> crimping

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
little bit harder to do so by crimping

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.909 
little bit harder to do so by crimping
it<00:05:45.389> just<00:05:45.630> makes<00:05:45.780> the<00:05:45.900> whole<00:05:45.930> job<00:05:46.289> easier<00:05:46.710> and

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
it just makes the whole job easier and

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.330 
it just makes the whole job easier and
it's<00:05:47.340> very<00:05:47.639> very<00:05:47.849> strong<00:05:48.240> as<00:05:48.419> well<00:05:48.630> so<00:05:49.590> that's

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
it's very very strong as well so that's

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.800 
it's very very strong as well so that's
the<00:05:50.460> range<00:05:50.669> of<00:05:50.880> coated<00:05:51.240> hook<00:05:51.360> links<00:05:51.630> from

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
the range of coated hook links from

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.839 
the range of coated hook links from
colder<00:05:52.259> we<00:05:52.620> pay<00:05:52.800> great<00:05:53.099> attention<00:05:53.130> to<00:05:53.669> the

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849 
colder we pay great attention to the

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:55.730 
colder we pay great attention to the
colors<00:05:54.180> we<00:05:54.330> take<00:05:54.509> samples<00:05:55.110> of<00:05:55.199> actual<00:05:55.530> light

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
colors we take samples of actual light

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.070 
colors we take samples of actual light
beds<00:05:56.039> and<00:05:56.550> match<00:05:56.849> them<00:05:57.090> perfectly<00:05:57.569> to<00:05:57.840> them

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
beds and match them perfectly to them

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.110 
beds and match them perfectly to them
they're<00:05:58.500> all<00:05:58.650> rigorously<00:05:59.130> tested<00:05:59.669> by<00:05:59.819> all<00:05:59.969> the

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
they're all rigorously tested by all the

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.939 
they're all rigorously tested by all the
boys<00:06:00.330> at<00:06:00.539> colder<00:06:00.990> so<00:06:01.380> they're<00:06:01.500> really<00:06:01.680> put

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
boys at colder so they're really put

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.649 
boys at colder so they're really put
through<00:06:02.130> their<00:06:02.310> paces<00:06:02.340> before<00:06:02.880> you<00:06:03.210> ever<00:06:03.389> use

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:03.659 
through their paces before you ever use

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:05.180 
through their paces before you ever use
them<00:06:03.990> and<00:06:04.469> they're<00:06:04.560> basically<00:06:04.949> all<00:06:05.069> the

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
them and they're basically all the

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.219 
them and they're basically all the
families<00:06:05.639> the<00:06:06.120> softer<00:06:06.599> and<00:06:06.750> shoddy<00:06:06.930> at<00:06:07.139> the

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
families the softer and shoddy at the

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.409 
families the softer and shoddy at the
bottom<00:06:07.620> the<00:06:08.099> softer<00:06:08.520> the<00:06:08.610> coated<00:06:09.000> hooklink

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
bottom the softer the coated hooklink

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.420 
bottom the softer the coated hooklink
the<00:06:09.870> cleaner<00:06:10.139> the<00:06:10.319> bottom<00:06:10.680> the<00:06:11.069> stiffer<00:06:11.400> the

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
the cleaner the bottom the stiffer the

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.300 
the cleaner the bottom the stiffer the
hooklink<00:06:11.669> you<00:06:11.909> should<00:06:12.090> use
