17<00:00:59.320> 21<00:00:59.860> out<00:01:00.040> of<00:01:00.070> 17<00:01:00.580> 34<00:01:01.210> I<00:01:01.480> just<00:01:02.320> did<00:01:02.470> a<00:01:02.500> review

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
17 21 out of 17 34 I just did a review

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.819 
17 21 out of 17 34 I just did a review
on<00:01:02.890> these<00:01:03.190> I<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:04.780> reviews<00:01:05.199> for<00:01:05.350> all<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.650> bins

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 
on these I have reviews for all the bins

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:07.200 
on these I have reviews for all the bins
so<00:01:06.040> if<00:01:06.130> you<00:01:06.189> want<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.400> go<00:01:06.490> back<00:01:06.640> and<00:01:06.850> look<00:01:06.939> at<00:01:07.119> if

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
so if you want to go back and look at if

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.450 
so if you want to go back and look at if
you<00:01:07.270> can<00:01:07.540> probably<00:01:08.350> easier<00:01:08.890> just<00:01:09.040> to<00:01:09.159> search

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
you can probably easier just to search

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.609 
you can probably easier just to search
the<00:01:10.329> bin<00:01:10.570> number<00:01:10.780> you're<00:01:10.990> looking<00:01:11.020> for<00:01:11.439> under

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
the bin number you're looking for under

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:12.990 
the bin number you're looking for under
the<00:01:11.650> search<00:01:11.979> engine<00:01:12.400> instead<00:01:12.670> of<00:01:12.790> going

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
the search engine instead of going

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.700 
the search engine instead of going
through<00:01:13.150> all<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.390> videos<00:01:13.689> there's<00:01:14.319> a<00:01:14.499> bin<00:01:14.679> bag

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
through all the videos there's a bin bag

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.160 
through all the videos there's a bin bag
for<00:01:15.100> that<00:01:15.189> one<00:01:15.399> then<00:01:16.119> we<00:01:16.299> have<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.569> bench<00:01:16.780> 7

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
for that one then we have the bench 7

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.929 
for that one then we have the bench 7
it's<00:01:17.289> probably<00:01:17.530> one<00:01:17.740> of<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.979> least<00:01:18.310> favorite

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
it's probably one of the least favorite

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:20.730 
it's probably one of the least favorite
shoes<00:01:19.240> because<00:01:19.719> everybody<00:01:20.170> didn't<00:01:20.409> like<00:01:20.560> the

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
shoes because everybody didn't like the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.010 
shoes because everybody didn't like the
African<00:01:21.549> tribal<00:01:21.880> scheme<00:01:22.329> and<00:01:22.719> the<00:01:22.810> whole

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
African tribal scheme and the whole

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.929 
African tribal scheme and the whole
colors<00:01:23.710> but<00:01:23.920> I<00:01:24.009> think<00:01:24.219> it's<00:01:24.340> high<00:01:24.460> I<00:01:24.670> really

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
colors but I think it's high I really

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:26.849 
colors but I think it's high I really
personally<00:01:25.329> think<00:01:25.479> it's<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.630> hot<00:01:25.749> shoot<00:01:26.049> the

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859 
personally think it's a hot shoot the

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:29.179 
personally think it's a hot shoot the
big<00:01:27.130> step<00:01:27.429> is<00:01:27.639> also<00:01:28.030> on<00:01:28.299> the<00:01:28.420> heel<00:01:28.569> of<00:01:28.600> these

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
big step is also on the heel of these

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.190 
big step is also on the heel of these
just<00:01:30.189> like<00:01:30.369> the<00:01:30.490> fives<00:01:30.789> and<00:01:31.179> it's<00:01:31.689> stamped<00:01:31.960> on

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
just like the fives and it's stamped on

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.749 
just like the fives and it's stamped on
the<00:01:32.289> hill<00:01:32.469> and<00:01:32.649> it<00:01:32.770> kind<00:01:33.069> of<00:01:33.130> like<00:01:33.280> look<00:01:33.670> like

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
the hill and it kind of like look like

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.239 
the hill and it kind of like look like
it's<00:01:33.969> cracking<00:01:34.420> away<00:01:34.689> the<00:01:35.020> shoe<00:01:35.259> so<00:01:36.069> that's

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:36.249 
it's cracking away the shoe so that's

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:38.249 
it's cracking away the shoe so that's
what<00:01:36.369> I<00:01:36.429> think<00:01:36.670> is<00:01:36.759> hot<00:01:36.909> about<00:01:37.030> that<00:01:37.420> but<00:01:38.170> the

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
what I think is hot about that but the

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.599 
what I think is hot about that but the
colors<00:01:38.619> is<00:01:38.770> dope<00:01:39.479> on<00:01:40.479> it<00:01:40.689> is<00:01:40.810> allowed<00:01:41.139> shoe

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:44.279 
colors is dope on it is allowed shoe
real<00:01:42.609> loud<00:01:42.850> but<00:01:43.149> I<00:01:43.179> the<00:01:43.780> whole<00:01:43.929> scheme<00:01:44.259> of

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
real loud but I the whole scheme of

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.649 
real loud but I the whole scheme of
concept<00:01:44.889> is<00:01:44.979> tight<00:01:45.249> then<00:01:46.090> you<00:01:46.179> have<00:01:46.329> the<00:01:46.479> bin

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
concept is tight then you have the bin

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.069 
concept is tight then you have the bin
23<00:01:46.840> bag<00:01:47.409> for<00:01:47.709> that<00:01:47.799> one<00:01:48.389> then<00:01:49.389> you<00:01:49.569> come<00:01:49.810> to

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
23 bag for that one then you come to

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.609 
23 bag for that one then you come to
probably<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.649> most<00:01:51.659> fallout<00:01:52.659> the<00:01:52.840> one<00:01:53.049> may<00:01:53.560> be

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
probably the most fallout the one may be

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.039 
probably the most fallout the one may be
the<00:01:53.829> most<00:01:54.060> exclusive<00:01:55.060> one<00:01:55.450> I<00:01:55.479> don't<00:01:55.810> know<00:01:55.869> why

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:56.049 
the most exclusive one I don't know why

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.199 
the most exclusive one I don't know why
