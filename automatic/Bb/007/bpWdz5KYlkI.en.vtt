 Internet and installed application 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.380
 now arrange to be in two 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:28.070
 places at the same time for example batches and 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.070
 at home on computers you have formal 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.820

 the computer that we want to manage here 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.460
 here here we have to enter the code and then 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.500
 we access our computer 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.809
 partner the second tab is computers 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.890
 you can add computers to the site

 you want to manage 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.750
 always and they will be stored here 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.970
 example added 2 of his computer 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.340

 ok let's connect to this 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.050
 computer 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.490
 connection goes and how we see that 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.479
 connection succeeded and let's now 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.659
 make streams settings here we see 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.369

 there is a mouse that is which I control 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.360
 here she repeats after me let's 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.850
 let's try to do something let's say 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.289
 those browser start see by

 control 1 click 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.729
 this one click two clicks this two clicks then 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.090
 have to open us browser 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.780
 need to double-click 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.780
 browser opened 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:13.510
 we can develop and come to 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.510
 any become valid in contact 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.379
 here we come to this site that is 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.819
 full control takes place with 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:25.970
 this program also we can get 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.280
 keyboard access ie if the camera is named 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.510

 also we have access to the book here it is 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.769
 there is an example we click from here and also 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.760
 we have access right bags here it is 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:56.150
 there is a valid point on the logo 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.810
 click and we get such a notice 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.110
 if we had our right click 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.780
 also at the top you see the opportunity 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.099
 such bring out the keyboard hold down shift 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.019
 kontrol alt 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:15.970
 let intake Abram start so I pressed the trigger 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:20.109
 see and appeared after kay further 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.109
 let's get the keyboard back 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:29.420
 remove what you already look like and try 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.260
 lead using shift see everything 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.780
 works 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.400
 so we can go to the action menu 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.290
 have we can turn on blocking of this 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.510
 computer restart this computer 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.170
 or block data here remote 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.920
 users well further we can 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:52.890
 go to settings we can set 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:56.939
 screen resolution quality hide wallpaper 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:01.209
 show information Rossi anti 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:03.189
 show remote cursor mouse 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:07.359
 principle here from the important nothing 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:09.370
 there is no going back as mentally 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:12.159
 interfere with tooltips we can them 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.439
 clean up so we'll just 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.870
 see completely our monitor 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:19.209
 computer this application is very convenient 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.979
 when we are home you need to quickly 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.570
 get access to some sort of 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.880
 program, it can also send 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.620
 contract documents which are located 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:32.560
 us on the computer using lotkov 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:34.750
 ways to close the connection and we 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.210
 there are 3 debugging files 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.010
 that is, we can share 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.169
 files that will be on the computer 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.620
 access them online we can 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:49.270
 add folders and you can log in 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:52.120
 the settings are the same as the principle 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.130
 we just looked like this 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.919
 here is a useful application tim viewer 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.960
 we have studied today wish you successfully 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.710
 use it yourself was on weight up 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.710
 meeting in the next lesson
