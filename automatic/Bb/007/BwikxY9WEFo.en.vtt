00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.319
 very interesting feature of mouchão and shadow application r was arrested 

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:15.319
 to show this feature we will create a gradient 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.650
 during people come back rare awnings for light blue rose 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.529
 four essence 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.399
 now I will have the news reputation for 90 degrees 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.320
 of low milk 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.690
 increasing the scale 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.790
 with that we have our floor 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.190
 to use with reference to text 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.450
 to create the text 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.800
 I'll use the font arial black 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.800
 she will generate a shadow more said 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.590
 seventy 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.780
 enable group 13 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.780
 without this adjustment no risk in piratininga of the 3d environment of the 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.090
 mouchão 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.090
 now just drag the text on rattlesnake pr 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.010
 That's it, I'm going to apply years 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.390
 for this scene with sinning a point of light with intensity of 150 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.510
 to enjoy the shade just click on haiti 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.770
 as we can observe the shadow is already applying 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.370
 and the main adjustment in process is a brazil object 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.390
 is the only one we have inté the light and the object but we want to clear the accounts 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.329
 to observe them better let's create a camera 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.329
 so we can change the angle of view 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.159
 I'm going to put the camera 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.200
 in perspective 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.130
 to stay 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.200
 the reflexes just select our group 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.730
 we entered the properties of the group 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.730
 and here we find reflection options 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.600
 the people change the distance 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.480
 to give greater realism rivals 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.749
 to finish we just have to take a career
