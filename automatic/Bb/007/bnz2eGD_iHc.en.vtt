00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:10.000
 Then you think that we want to see thing called horizontal ring boiler next 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:15.730
 Year to the moisture of the road that has become such a description and say that what's called the lateral annular boiler 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.140
 Poi tried to increase the heat transfer surface is provided a plurality of circular rings are hung as a New Year Ra 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:25.750
 I feel that what fancy is to say whether this is it what yes here. 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.079
 I know this is a steam locomotive, so this part is pretty normal 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.200
 I'm 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.670
 This is a boiler but a boiler 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.510
 this 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:38.430
 Is a typical example of an 8 horizontal ring boiler 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:41.520
 By the way, it is this steam locomotive It is classified into one year well mobile type boiler tier 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.900
 But I'm leaving this and yes 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.430
 It is this After the cut in this time and has become what Fu It is the 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.330
 When I cut a steam locomotive, there was a loss of my sister who is burning a regular turn like this 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.900
 from here 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:01:01.540
 There is a way of burning gas hot air coming out 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:05.980
 Water theme at the door by leaving rights Innovation baud from here in and around the combustion chamber the Charming Mother 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:10.840
 The ring boiler has a structure that water is given later to become water vapor 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.980
 Well , here's the part of the hen's face and when you start like this , let 's see here in the case of this figure 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.440
 There are only 5 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:20.370
 Of course this is not five, and when you look at the actual thing from the front the director of the garden like this 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.510
 It is why has the feeling 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.220
 Full while the fresh water to 9 Phase one around which there is a 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.650
 Hmm 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:36.300
 As it becomes the mothers who can control the back side of the water, I 'm going to be a lot with the electric heat mace. 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:40.740
 Nema has become in such a form of principal ne This is the guy that Yokoenwa boiler 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:43.700
 In this horizontal ring boiler also some other variants 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.700
 There is a kind 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.600
 One more thing, this is another example of a horizontal ring boiler 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:56.330
 There is a horizontal ring boiler only outside 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.830
 In the case of the horizontal ring looper sl steam locomotive mentioned earlier in the example, it will burn in this direction 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.210
 Though there was room 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:08.759
 There is a combustion chamber outside just the outside of the horizontal ring boiler literally. 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:11.319
 So this way if things were replaced outside is allowed to warm to Well 9 minutes It is the individual part warm 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.900
 You go to the Fu say this to say air is this 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:19.750
 It is also warmed in the latter part 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:24.129
 In some cases Furthermore guess is through a high-speed surface rather not you will come out here dopey 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:28.880
 It will be a structure that warms it, but it looks like this 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:35.170
 The outside only I of this feature is the guy I annular boiler Yes like this 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:39.880
 There is a feature that the choice of fuel is wide because the combustion chamber can be designed freely 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:43.239
 In the case of steam locomotives, the size was because I installed a combustion chamber in the boiler. 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:48.730
 I 'm sure there will be a lot of restrictions out there 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:53.860
 In the case of the 4 waterfall mothers, the combustion chamber is very wide and so on or in various forms 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:56.140
 Because there is a wide range of fuel options that can be used to burn various fuels. 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:02.910
 There is a feature to say 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.910
 It was unlucky horizontal conversion boiler various horizontal annular border pattern to the horizontal far in that
