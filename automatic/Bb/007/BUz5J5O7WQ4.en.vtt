that's where the primer is applied
it's<00:03:03.100> sanded<00:03:03.790> and<00:03:03.970> they<00:03:04.480> check<00:03:04.780> all<00:03:05.020> the<00:03:05.260> body

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
it's sanded and they check all the body

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.770 
it's sanded and they check all the body
operations<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.550> make<00:03:06.760> sure<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.270> everything

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.950 

this<00:03:18.470> particular<00:03:19.160> door<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:20.090> can<00:03:20.300> tell<00:03:20.540> that

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
this particular door you can tell that

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.200 
this particular door you can tell that
it's<00:03:21.290> had<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.560> new<00:03:21.860> outer<00:03:22.130> panel<00:03:22.700> put<00:03:22.910> on<00:03:23.030> this

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
it's had a new outer panel put on this

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.660 
it's had a new outer panel put on this
door<00:03:23.480> because<00:03:24.080> the<00:03:24.470> damage<00:03:24.860> exceeded<00:03:25.490> a

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
door because the damage exceeded a

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.360 
door because the damage exceeded a
repair<00:03:26.360> process<00:03:26.960> so<00:03:27.500> we<00:03:27.710> put<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:27.980> new<00:03:28.160> outer

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
repair process so we put a new outer

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.820 
repair process so we put a new outer
door<00:03:28.670> skin<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.210> this<00:03:29.600> first<00:03:29.810> application<00:03:30.680> is

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
door skin and this first application is

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.010 
door skin and this first application is
to<00:03:31.040> restore<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.700> corrosion<00:03:32.270> protection<00:03:32.480> on

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
to restore the corrosion protection on

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.800 
to restore the corrosion protection on
the<00:03:33.500> bare<00:03:33.710> metal<00:03:33.920> around<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.610> edge<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.210> then

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
the bare metal around the edge and then

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.930 
the bare metal around the edge and then
it'll<00:03:36.050> be<00:03:36.230> primed<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:36.950> then<00:03:37.580> it<00:03:37.700> will<00:03:37.790> be

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
it'll be primed and then it will be

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.890 
it'll be primed and then it will be
sanded<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:38.590> ready<00:03:39.590> for<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:39.980> paint

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
sanded and ready for the paint

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.190 
sanded and ready for the paint
application<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:41.960> be<00:03:42.080> applied

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.100 

this<00:03:47.800> is<00:03:47.920> a<00:03:47.950> perfect<00:03:48.459> example<00:03:48.660> where<00:03:49.660> this

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
this is a perfect example where this

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.380 
this is a perfect example where this
vehicle<00:03:50.379> is<00:03:50.680> white<00:03:50.890> on<00:03:51.099> the<00:03:51.220> exterior<00:03:51.610> but

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
vehicle is white on the exterior but

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.420 
vehicle is white on the exterior but
it's<00:03:52.569> got<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.810> great<00:03:53.200> cast<00:03:53.530> and<00:03:53.860> it's<00:03:53.980> basically

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
it's got a great cast and it's basically

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.030 
it's got a great cast and it's basically
just<00:03:54.580> overspray<00:03:55.450> we're<00:03:55.989> gonna<00:03:56.110> restore<00:03:56.680> that

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
just overspray we're gonna restore that

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.449 
just overspray we're gonna restore that
area<00:03:57.879> exactly<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:58.810> way<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.170> factory<00:03:59.650> did<00:03:59.860> so

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
area exactly the way the factory did so

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.180 
area exactly the way the factory did so
we<00:04:00.670> won't<00:04:00.940> paint<00:04:01.300> it<00:04:01.450> white<00:04:01.660> and<00:04:01.959> have<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.890> you

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
we won't paint it white and have the you

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.979 
we won't paint it white and have the you
know<00:04:03.340> this<00:04:03.550> vehicle<00:04:04.090> look<00:04:04.269> different<00:04:04.720> than<00:04:04.840> it

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
know this vehicle look different than it

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.370 
know this vehicle look different than it
did<00:04:05.140> when<00:04:05.380> it<00:04:05.410> came<00:04:05.530> from<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.069> factory<00:04:06.489> our

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
did when it came from the factory our

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.509 
did when it came from the factory our
philosophy<00:04:08.380> and<00:04:08.590> our<00:04:08.709> standards<00:04:09.280> that<00:04:09.400> our

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
philosophy and our standards that our

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.180 
philosophy and our standards that our
shop<00:04:09.790> is<00:04:10.090> to<00:04:10.300> restore<00:04:11.019> it<00:04:11.140> exactly<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.860> way<00:04:12.040> it

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
shop is to restore it exactly the way it

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.839 
shop is to restore it exactly the way it
was<00:04:12.370> when<00:04:12.700> they<00:04:12.880> purchased<00:04:13.299> the<00:04:13.420> vehicle<00:04:14.849> we

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
was when they purchased the vehicle we

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.729 
was when they purchased the vehicle we
welded<00:04:16.299> all<00:04:16.450> these<00:04:16.660> areas<00:04:16.900> right<00:04:17.290> here<00:04:17.530> when

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
welded all these areas right here when

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.050 
welded all these areas right here when
we<00:04:17.829> installed<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.370> new<00:04:18.519> quarter<00:04:18.850> package

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
we installed the new quarter package

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.750 
we installed the new quarter package
there<00:04:19.750> for<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.590> rust<00:04:20.859> corrosion<00:04:21.220> and<00:04:21.639> the

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
there for the rust corrosion and the

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.550 
there for the rust corrosion and the
paint<00:04:22.030> needs<00:04:22.270> to<00:04:22.450> be<00:04:22.570> applied<00:04:22.810> on<00:04:23.200> the

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
paint needs to be applied on the

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.370 
paint needs to be applied on the
backside<00:04:24.040> of<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.310> panel<00:04:24.729> or<00:04:24.850> the<00:04:25.630> moisture<00:04:26.260> in

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
backside of the panel or the moisture in

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.710 
backside of the panel or the moisture in
the<00:04:26.410> air<00:04:26.530> will<00:04:27.070> contaminate<00:04:27.970> it<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:28.270> rust<00:04:28.510> it

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
the air will contaminate it and rust it

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.190 
the air will contaminate it and rust it
rust<00:04:29.229> this<00:04:29.410> area<00:04:29.800> most<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:31.660> time<00:04:31.900> you<00:04:32.080> would

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
rust this area most the time you would

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.900 
rust this area most the time you would
never<00:04:32.350> see<00:04:32.680> this<00:04:32.919> because<00:04:33.340> all<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.669> trim

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
never see this because all the trim

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.120 
never see this because all the trim
panels<00:04:34.330> are<00:04:34.780> put<00:04:35.050> back<00:04:35.290> and<00:04:35.500> installed<00:04:35.889> in

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
panels are put back and installed in

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.580 
panels are put back and installed in
this<00:04:36.280> area<00:04:36.729> so<00:04:37.389> this<00:04:37.600> shows<00:04:37.870> you<00:04:38.110> how<00:04:38.290> fair

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
this area so this shows you how fair

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.980 
this area so this shows you how fair
will<00:04:38.740> we<00:04:38.889> are<00:04:39.100> when<00:04:39.580> we<00:04:39.760> restore<00:04:40.240> a<00:04:40.270> vehicle<00:04:40.900> to

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990
