 day I lost a pound and four ounces for 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.840
 the total of exactly 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.970
 and we are not happy because in my 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.970
 Two weeks vacation only three 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.000
 pounds and today I come back in these three 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.489
 days I have dropped four pounds which is a 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.130
 pound more than he had raised alone 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.530
 I'm very happy with the results 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.810
 Now I'm not very insecure 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.510
 I do not feel comfortable in the staff that 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.590
 I'm still I want to get to where 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.490
 before she gave birth and hopefully and 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.240
 yes I tell you 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.250
 I hope to arrive but right now if I do not 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.319
 shame to still teach my weight but 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.560
 already when it is close so I think 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.390
 teach how much it weighed how much and how much 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.670
 the current weight is also to say that 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.850
 I started this diet with the 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.970
 snow because as usual 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.489
 what to eat and is in this 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.830
 diet well with one many or why 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.840
 I wanted to start with this and then 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.239
 Now I feel I can control 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.370
 and now what I'm eating now 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.530
 next Monday for I'm going to do the one 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.750
 made marcela that is with the breast of 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.569
 chicken and the egg and the asparagus I know 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.040
 that has been good results since 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.660
 that ready marcela there have also been 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.380
 many of you who have done it and we 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.210
 they have given good 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.820
 that they have told us that they have been given 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.230
 good results or encourage me more to 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.240
 do it but I want to wait for the 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.780
 Monday and if I'm doing well maybe I'll come back 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.180
 to try 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.220
 hopefully and in a month the weight comes in 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.780
 which I want but if there is 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.550
 If I'm noticing the difference too 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.560
 between my previous videos but still 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.820
 I want to lose up to at least one 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.430
 been before she gave birth 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:12.950
 conclusion this is a diet that for me 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:15.590
 you eat a lot and you have rebates with the 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.520
 eating snow are more perfect I do not know 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:22.460
 Maria, I would treat her again but 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.080
 I want to give him I want to lose a little more 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.510
 super fast I'm going to try the one on 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.250
 marcela and well it's all thank you 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.240

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.240
