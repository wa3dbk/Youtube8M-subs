00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.160
 Evseenko Technology Presents Yours 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.590
 attention to the new project bypass 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.320
 tornado turbojet engine 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.169
 we are glad for your interest 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.420
 our invention and hope that this 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.150
 the project will not be ignored 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.730
 tornado he has small dimensions 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.980
 about half a meter long and 20 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.500
 centimeters in diameter is capable with 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.300
 ease of driving for example 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.870
 motor boats and motorcycles 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.280
 Let's consider the general device of the engine 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.280
 outer casing consists of two parts 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.829
 secondary circuit and housing 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.200
 primary circuit composition of the secondary circuit 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.960
 includes himself 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.719
 body and 30 percent of the blade area 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.629
 turbine wheels the first circuit consists of 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.660
 cold chamber compressor housings 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.520
 crankcase fat tube combustion chamber 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.850
 guide cone combustion chamber 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.550
 turbine wheels which are allocated 70 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.740
 percent of the area of ​​the blades of apple and 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.020
 formed by the wall of the housing of the second 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.979
 contour and reverse cone guide 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.500
 primary circuit 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.539
 such a device design 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.599
 fundamentally distinguishes tornado from 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:27.030
 traditional turbojet engine 

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:29.429
 mobility now we will understand how 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.649
 engine running primary air 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.830
 the turbine blades are sucked in by 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.860
 environment thanks to this hull 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.679
 1 and case 2 contour and turbine blades 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.619
 gets cooling and also generated 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.369
 additional pulling force 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.039
 simultaneously primary air 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.720
 sucked passing along the guide 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.539
 cone blades compressor wheels 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.970
 low pressure primary air 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.849
 falls on 2 guide cones 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.069
 compressed air is picked up 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:02.039
 high pressure wheel blades and 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:04.170
 get into the receiver further on pipes 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.509
 cold cameras are designed to 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.759
 laying wiring oil and 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.099
 fuel lines and enters the chamber 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.980
 combustion formed by the hull walls 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.349
 primary contour of the cold chamber wall 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.390
 wall and crankcase and wall guide 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.370
 cone 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.800
 in the air energy combustion chamber 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.440
 amplified by burning in it 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.510
 this fuel is enough to 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.200
 set in motion the moving part 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.690
 engine 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.910
 shaft turbine wheel compressor wheel 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.700
 low pressure compressor wheel 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.040
 high pressure which are on 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.650
 single shaft and create main traction 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.780
 efforts hot gases getting on 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.660
 turbine wheel blades are mixed with 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.310
 primary air 2 circuit and on there and 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.720
 turbine blades passes by 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.260
 guide cone 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.330
 have mercy on the jet stream exit 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.440
 create a craving for violence leading to 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.440
 motion engine 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.620
 she has a moving part of the engine attached 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.380
 to the crankcase which in turn 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.200
 fastens to two support bearings 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.010
 saidin looking for a fixed moving part 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.890
 engine 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.630
 the shaft is balanced in a way that gives 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.030
 equal load on supporting 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.670
 crankcase bearings provides 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.090
 cooling grease thrust bearings and 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.190
 so we got acquainted with the general device 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.950
 the principle of operation of a tornado now 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.140
 project time is under construction 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.390
 leave your opinion in the comments 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.390
