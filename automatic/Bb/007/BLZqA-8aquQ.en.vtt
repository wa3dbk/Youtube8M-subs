00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.520
 yes 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.610
 today then vice welcome to this 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.230
 vehicle guide 2003 is the case 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.660
 of the reaction cases even if it sounds 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.100
 redundant means or jets is the turn to 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.930
 the penultimate episode of the series the 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.610
 laser scanner and good if you like the 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.439
 series and who to support me please 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.240
 final rival test and recommends the oa 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.710
 friend if it can be useful in the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.420
 motherland has an active regent so that 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.070
 click on the accessory that you 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.109
 like to see and the video will take 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.350
 corresponding we start with the review 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.850
 and with the guidance of the laser scanner but that 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.680
 nothing for what this laser scanner does 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.970
 is to download it do what it does reduce 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.860
 the waiting time in what you 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.160
 they fix an enemy so they can launch their 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.050
 missile missile good missile guided missile 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.870
 heat much faster what I already 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.570
 normally how fast 25 percent 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.879
 it's really is not very important 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.860
 this attachment in extended but when 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.070
 you need you will need wonderful 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.649
 amount of 29 thousand points in in shares 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.329
 during the use of the jet as it is used 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.820
 this equipment is used only 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.320
 equipping it is to say you are going to have 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.030
 a passive activity you every time 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.520
 Try to set an objective this 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.560
 effect will take its place and so they can 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.689
 use your advantage really there is no 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.340
 a lot to say 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.350
 really conforming the patches has gone 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.630
 being more useless every time since the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.780
 difference between what was set 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.220
 normally to a jet with this advantage what 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.930
 which is usually not much 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.970
 difference what does not make it so relevant 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.560
 and be able to use an attachment that 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.060
 can save the skin as is the radar 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.520
 air is definitely much more 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.590
 important this isolation only what 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.689
 I would recommend along with what would be the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.700
 guided missile since we assume that 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.369
 they really are not going to have the opportunity 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.439
 of facing other players in the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.030
 air because that will leave us vulnerable 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.140
 the fact that they can have stability 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.030
 it's more when you have a 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.619
 air superiority and they know they are not going to 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.659
 be attacked or will they have to be 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.979
 looking for other jets in the airspace 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.200
 so up to here the guide of the 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.670
 barral filtres the scanner 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.380
 laser I hope you liked it if it was 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.209
 so and they want to support the thumb please

 web in the description the following 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.759
 screen is interactive for them to do 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.780
 click on a video that you have not seen and we 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.150
 we see in the next 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.689
 all right 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.689
 to 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.770
 and
