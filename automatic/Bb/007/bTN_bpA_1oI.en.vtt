if<00:00:00.480> you<00:00:00.690> are<00:00:00.810> looking<00:00:00.930> for<00:00:01.230> portable<00:00:02.070> device

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
if you are looking for portable device

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.999 
if you are looking for portable device
that<00:00:02.850> has<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.120> performance<00:00:04.020> of<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.650> server

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
that has a performance of the server

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.820 
that has a performance of the server
then<00:00:05.940> you<00:00:06.150> should<00:00:06.390> look<00:00:06.569> at<00:00:06.779> this<00:00:06.839> one<00:00:07.440> ever

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
then you should look at this one ever

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.589 
then you should look at this one ever

called Neptune 3.0 laptop I couldn't

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.480 
called Neptune 3.0 laptop I couldn't
really<00:00:12.690> call<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.080> two<00:00:13.380> up<00:00:13.530> top<00:00:13.740> because<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.280> has

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
really call it two up top because it has

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.090 
really call it two up top because it has
a<00:00:14.839> performance<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.170> server<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.650> have<00:00:16.949> to

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
a performance of the server I have to

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.849 
a performance of the server I have to
say<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:18.539> will<00:00:18.690> need<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.930> lot<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.199> money<00:00:19.350> to

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
say and you will need a lot of money to

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.099 
say and you will need a lot of money to
actually<00:00:19.980> buy<00:00:20.400> one<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.820> I'm<00:00:21.539> going<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.960> tell

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
actually buy one and I'm going to tell

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.710 
actually buy one and I'm going to tell
you<00:00:22.140> why<00:00:22.760> don't<00:00:23.760> basic<00:00:24.119> reason<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
you why don't basic reason is the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.189 
you why don't basic reason is the
hardware<00:00:25.199> inside<00:00:25.640> so<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:27.599> biggest<00:00:27.779> selling

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199

probably<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.630> would<00:01:27.750> say<00:01:28.579> multiple<00:01:29.579> hard

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
probably you would say multiple hard

probably you would say multiple hard
drive<00:01:30.150> support<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:31.110> stick<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> two<00:01:32.250> or

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280

inch screen full HD your resolution but

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.300 
inch screen full HD your resolution but
obviously<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.509> waits<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:40.020> lot<00:01:40.170> it's<00:01:40.470> free<00:01:40.829> kilos

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
obviously it waits a lot it's free kilos

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.249 
obviously it waits a lot it's free kilos
that's<00:01:41.640> how<00:01:41.820> much<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.210> weighs<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.869> probably

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
that's how much it weighs so probably

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.289 
that's how much it weighs so probably
wouldn't<00:01:43.590> fancy<00:01:43.740> taking<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.460> one<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.850> flight

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
wouldn't fancy taking this one on flight

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.749 
wouldn't fancy taking this one on flight
with<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.500> price<00:01:46.799> could<00:01:47.100> go<00:01:47.310> as<00:01:47.460> high<00:01:47.490> as

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
with you the price could go as high as

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.999 
with you the price could go as high as
up<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.240> 10,000<00:01:48.990> american<00:01:49.409> dollars<00:01:49.770> that's

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
up to 10,000 american dollars that's

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.770 
up to 10,000 american dollars that's
particularly<00:01:50.700> with<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.060> extreme<00:01:51.479> edition

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
particularly with this extreme edition

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.139 
particularly with this extreme edition
process<00:01:52.320> or<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.369> could<00:01:53.579> be<00:01:53.700> even<00:01:53.790> more

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
process or but it could be even more

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.260 
process or but it could be even more
depending<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:54.899> configuration<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.950> choose<00:01:56.280> so

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
depending on configuration you choose so

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.840 
depending on configuration you choose so
that's<00:01:58.170> pretty<00:01:58.439> much<00:01:58.619> quicker<00:01:58.979> with<00:01:59.340> hardware

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
that's pretty much quicker with hardware

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.789
