between everyone in the group break

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.870 
between everyone in the group break
because<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.620> Blazers<00:03:21.070> were<00:03:21.190> taking<00:03:21.519> out<00:03:21.670> and

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
because the Blazers were taking out and

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.810 
because the Blazers were taking out and
now<00:03:22.540> if<00:03:22.870> you<00:03:23.019> haven't<00:03:23.320> gotten<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.650> hit<00:03:23.890> this<00:03:24.670> is

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
now if you haven't gotten a hit this is

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.400 
now if you haven't gotten a hit this is
probably<00:03:25.060> why<00:03:26.760> we<00:03:27.760> have<00:03:28.030> about<00:03:28.540> one<00:03:28.840> two<00:03:28.989> three

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
probably why we have about one two three

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.479 
probably why we have about one two three
we<00:03:30.160> have<00:03:30.340> 16<00:03:30.850> we<00:03:31.600> have<00:03:31.690> 12<00:03:32.140> hits<00:03:32.440> 12<00:03:33.130> hits<00:03:33.370> out

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
we have 16 we have 12 hits 12 hits out

of 30 going to the same person and thats

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.370 
of 30 going to the same person and thats
quiet<00:03:37.090> storm<00:03:37.360> so<00:03:37.600> if<00:03:37.720> you<00:03:37.810> don't<00:03:37.989> get<00:03:38.080> a<00:03:38.140> hit<00:03:38.350> on

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
quiet storm so if you don't get a hit on

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.590 
quiet storm so if you don't get a hit on
this<00:03:38.620> group<00:03:38.890> break<00:03:39.070> you<00:03:39.700> could<00:03:39.880> blame<00:03:40.090> him<00:03:40.330> and

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
this group break you could blame him and

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.960 
this group break you could blame him and
so<00:03:40.810> here<00:03:41.019> we<00:03:41.110> go<00:03:41.140> his<00:03:41.440> hits<00:03:41.730> he<00:03:42.730> had<00:03:42.850> the
