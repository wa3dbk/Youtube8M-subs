00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
make a paper aeroplane now you might say

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.549 
make a paper aeroplane now you might say
I<00:00:11.400> would<00:00:11.730> we<00:00:11.910> can<00:00:12.059> do<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.360> anyway<00:00:12.719> but<00:00:13.440> this

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
I would we can do that anyway but this

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.220 
I would we can do that anyway but this
is<00:00:13.679> one<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:14.099> special<00:00:14.490> one<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.940> my<00:00:15.059> dad<00:00:15.299> showed

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
me must be 50 years ago now anyway you

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.570 
me must be 50 years ago now anyway you
take<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> sheet<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.760> a4<00:00:20.970> paper<00:00:22.430> plain<00:00:23.430> and

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
take a sheet of a4 paper plain and

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.200 
take a sheet of a4 paper plain and
simple<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.869> fold<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.199> once<00:00:25.439> like<00:00:25.740> that

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:40.700 

and<00:00:30.210> then<00:00:30.630> again<00:00:31.430> like<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:37.190> then<00:00:38.190> taking<00:00:39.710> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
and then again like that then taking the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.680 
and then again like that then taking the
two<00:00:40.890> sides<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.730> fold<00:00:42.030> them<00:00:42.210> into<00:00:42.360> each<00:00:42.629> other

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
two sides you fold them into each other

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:52.670 
two sides you fold them into each other
and<00:00:45.690> press<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:45.960> down<00:00:50.840> to<00:00:51.840> get<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.170> front<00:00:52.379> end

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
and press it down to get the front end

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.410 
and press it down to get the front end
of<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> aircraft<00:00:54.320> at<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.440> point<00:00:56.420> you'll

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
of the aircraft at this point you'll

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.240 
of the aircraft at this point you'll
notice<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:57.960> rather<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.410> lot<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.770> paper

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
notice we have rather a lot of paper

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.580 
notice we have rather a lot of paper
left<00:00:59.520> at<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> end<00:00:59.960> so<00:01:00.960> we're<00:01:01.140> going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.379> cut

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
left at the end so we're going to cut

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.390 
left at the end so we're going to cut
some<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.460> off<00:01:04.280> what<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.460> do<00:01:07.250> fold<00:01:08.250> it

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
some of that off what you do fold it

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.380 
some of that off what you do fold it
once

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:18.190 

then<00:01:12.229> again<00:01:14.590> we<00:01:15.590> get<00:01:15.770> a<00:01:15.800> nice<00:01:15.950> clean<00:01:16.280> cut<00:01:17.200> as

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
then again we get a nice clean cut as

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.290 
then again we get a nice clean cut as
you<00:01:18.620> turn<00:01:18.830> it<00:01:19.040> down<00:01:19.070> hopefully<00:01:20.000> I<00:01:22.150> was<00:01:23.150> going

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
you turn it down hopefully I was going

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.180 
you turn it down hopefully I was going
to<00:01:23.360> say<00:01:23.510> that<00:01:23.690> top<00:01:24.440> one<00:01:24.470> here<00:01:24.800> I<00:01:24.860> did<00:01:25.070> earlier

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
to say that top one here I did earlier

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.120 
to say that top one here I did earlier
but<00:01:25.640> I<00:01:25.880> do<00:01:26.420> do<00:01:26.780> one<00:01:26.960> earlier<00:01:27.350> they<00:01:27.740> fold<00:01:28.009> this

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
but I do do one earlier they fold this

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.880 
but I do do one earlier they fold this
part<00:01:28.520> in<00:01:28.850> too<00:01:29.570> because<00:01:30.200> it's<00:01:30.410> going<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:30.650> be<00:01:30.770> the

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
part in too because it's going to be the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.010 
part in too because it's going to be the
tailplane<00:01:31.250> by<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:31.729> way<00:01:31.940> I<00:01:32.210> forgot<00:01:32.479> to<00:01:32.630> mention

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
tailplane by the way I forgot to mention

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:41.499 
tailplane by the way I forgot to mention
that<00:01:34.090> make<00:01:35.090> a<00:01:35.119> point<00:01:35.360> there<00:01:37.960> and<00:01:38.960> there<00:01:40.509> that's

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
that make a point there and there that's

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.499 
that make a point there and there that's
the<00:01:41.720> tailplane<00:01:42.910> going<00:01:43.910> back<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.149> this<00:01:44.240> piece

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
the tailplane going back to this piece

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.219 
the tailplane going back to this piece
right<00:01:44.810> now<00:01:45.680> taking<00:01:46.130> this<00:01:46.369> side<00:01:46.640> we<00:01:47.149> fold<00:01:48.050> it

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
right now taking this side we fold it

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.020 
right now taking this side we fold it
straight<00:01:48.950> over<00:01:49.369> and<00:01:50.410> then<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:52.670> other<00:01:52.700> side

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
straight over and then the other side

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.740 
straight over and then the other side
you<00:01:53.210> do<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.450> same<00:01:58.060> now<00:01:59.060> this<00:01:59.420> is<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.630> tricky

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
you do the same now this is the tricky

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.710 
you do the same now this is the tricky
bit<00:02:00.460> you<00:02:01.460> fold<00:02:01.729> this<00:02:01.880> one<00:02:02.149> like<00:02:03.020> that<00:02:03.229> and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
bit you fold this one like that and

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.990 
bit you fold this one like that and
again<00:02:06.550> like<00:02:07.550> that

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.770 

then<00:02:12.080> open<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.290> back<00:02:13.440> out<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.180> press<00:02:15.720> it

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
then open it back out and you press it

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.490 
then open it back out and you press it
together<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.590> make<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.800> point<00:02:17.099> and<00:02:18.260> fold<00:02:19.260> it

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
together to make a point and fold it

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.460 
together to make a point and fold it
down<00:02:20.180> towards<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.270> front<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:22.020> aircraft's

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
down towards the front of the aircraft's

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.970 
down towards the front of the aircraft's
nose<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:24.690> repeat<00:02:24.959> this<00:02:25.170> on<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.620> other<00:02:25.650> side

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
nose you repeat this on the other side

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.460 
nose you repeat this on the other side
with<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:26.400> with<00:02:26.849> this<00:02:26.880> piece<00:02:27.150> here<00:02:27.630> those

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
with this with this piece here those

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:37.040 
with this with this piece here those
fold<00:02:28.980> one<00:02:30.470> or<00:02:31.470> two<00:02:33.830> very<00:02:34.830> well<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.370> mind<00:02:36.050> the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
fold one or two very well in mind the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.530 
fold one or two very well in mind the
fog<00:02:37.290> three<00:02:37.819> squeeze<00:02:38.819> them<00:02:39.000> together<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.420> make

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
fog three squeeze them together to make

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.970 
fog three squeeze them together to make
a<00:02:39.720> point<00:02:42.049> and<00:02:43.049> fold<00:02:43.350> fall<00:02:43.680> down<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:45.480> now<00:02:45.980> we've

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
a point and fold fall down so now we've

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.770 
a point and fold fall down so now we've
got<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.600> end<00:02:48.600> front<00:02:49.110> nose<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.620> aircraft

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
got the end front nose of the aircraft

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.089 
got the end front nose of the aircraft
okay<00:02:51.780> going<00:02:52.470> back<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.769> tailplane<00:02:53.660> we<00:02:55.099> slot

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
okay going back to the tailplane we slot

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.280 
okay going back to the tailplane we slot
it<00:02:56.280> into<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.700> nose<00:02:56.900> right<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:59.900> right<00:03:00.900> as<00:03:01.110> far

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
it into the nose right so right as far

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.759 
it into the nose right so right as far
as<00:03:01.410> okay<00:03:04.130> open<00:03:05.130> it<00:03:05.220> up<00:03:05.540> fold<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.720> over<00:03:06.810> hold

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
as okay open it up fold it over hold

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:14.330 
as okay open it up fold it over hold
this<00:03:07.890> piece<00:03:08.130> back<00:03:09.319> and<00:03:10.319> then<00:03:10.590> just<00:03:11.989> fold<00:03:12.989> it<00:03:13.340> up

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
this piece back and then just fold it up

airplane now you can also do a few extra
bits<00:03:27.120> like<00:03:27.750> you<00:03:27.930> can<00:03:28.079> fold<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.410> wing<00:03:29.359> and<00:03:30.359> add

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
bits like you can fold the wing and add

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.190 
bits like you can fold the wing and add
a<00:03:30.750> little<00:03:31.340> winglet<00:03:32.340> at<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:32.760> tip<00:03:33.090> my<00:03:33.450> most<00:03:33.750> jet

airlines have today the same on the

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:44.270 
airlines have today the same on the
other<00:03:37.799> side<00:03:41.630> roughly<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.690> same<00:03:43.280> distance

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
other side roughly the same distance

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.460

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
little stabilizer in the tailplane just

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.040 
little stabilizer in the tailplane just
put<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.340> nick<00:03:59.610> in<00:03:59.640> there<00:04:00.030> and<00:04:00.270> a<00:04:00.450> nick<00:04:00.660> in<00:04:00.690> there

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
put a nick in there and a nick in there

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.120 
put a nick in there and a nick in there
that<00:04:01.800> helps<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.820> air<00:04:02.940> flow<00:04:03.240> and<00:04:03.920> then<00:04:04.920> just

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
that helps the air flow and then just

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.870 
that helps the air flow and then just
fold<00:04:05.310> it<00:04:05.490> up<00:04:05.670> like<00:04:05.970> so<00:04:07.220> you<00:04:08.220> can<00:04:08.400> see<00:04:08.550> that<00:04:08.580> very

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
nice little stabilizer in the tail plane

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.600 
nice little stabilizer in the tail plane
of<00:04:15.600> course<00:04:15.780> you<00:04:15.960> can<00:04:16.110> always<00:04:16.260> color<00:04:17.100> it<00:04:17.250> in<00:04:17.400> or

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
paint it put a couple of roundels on it

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.460 
paint it put a couple of roundels on it
make<00:04:20.190> it<00:04:20.220> into<00:04:20.549> nor<00:04:20.760> EF<00:04:21.000> paint<00:04:21.660> it<00:04:21.810> red<00:04:21.989> red
