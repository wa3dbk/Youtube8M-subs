 programmed with five laps to the 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.070
 travel the realists made a 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.170
 pact in the exit site for what 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.739
 and they made the journey very calm 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.570
 taking into account then that this type of 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:06.170
 circuits were many falls 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.510
 there is a lot of risk for the riders that 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.460
 they integrate the caravan so they 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.680
 course they were collaborating with the 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.470
 organization the show in the 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.700
 streets of the town of villeta was a 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.670
 rather demanding circuit not only had 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.520
 flat terrain but also a part 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.030
 quite inclined but I repeat the 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.270
 riders agreed and what 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.430
 they made it quite soft remember that 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.979

 participating in this return to 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.410
 department of cundinamarca alters the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.720
 climate was a fundamental factor because 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.840
 from the start the temperature was 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.270
 very high what made it wear out 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.880
