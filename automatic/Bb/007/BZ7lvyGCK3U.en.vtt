00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.510 
whatever you want to just say hi there
and<00:00:59.180> then<00:01:00.180> if<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.449> cancel<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.859> can<00:01:02.129> save

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
and then if you cancel it you can save

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.609 
and then if you cancel it you can save
as<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.789> draft<00:01:02.820> or<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.600> can<00:01:03.780> save<00:01:03.989> as<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> template

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
as a draft or you can save as a template

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.830 
as a draft or you can save as a template
so<00:01:05.159> we'll<00:01:05.430> save<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.610> as<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> template<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.420> now

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
so we'll save it as a template and now

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.060 
so we'll save it as a template and now
you<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.080> see<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.530> template<00:01:07.920> right

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
you can see I have a template right

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.130 
you can see I have a template right
there<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.460> if<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.640> open<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:08.970> up<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.990> just

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
there so if I open that up I can just

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.170 
there so if I open that up I can just
tap<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.460> starts<00:01:11.760> out<00:01:11.850> with<00:01:12.000> hi

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
tap on that and it starts out with hi

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.300 
tap on that and it starts out with hi
there<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:12.689> that's<00:01:13.260> how<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.590> make<00:01:13.860> templates

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
there so that's how you make templates

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.880 
there so that's how you make templates
if<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.909> want<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.299> use<00:01:15.680> templates<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.710> don't

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
if you want to use templates I don't

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.980 
if you want to use templates I don't
really<00:01:17.009> use<00:01:17.220> them<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.520> much<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.810> not

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
really use them that much so it's not

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.740 
really use them that much so it's not
really<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.430> huge<00:01:20.430> feature<00:01:20.700> for<00:01:21.030> me<00:01:21.180> but<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.570> is

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
really a huge feature for me but this is

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.210 
really a huge feature for me but this is
actually<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> pretty<00:01:22.530> cool<00:01:22.619> tweak<00:01:22.950> I've<00:01:23.100> been

doing<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.590> just<00:02:10.860> because<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.310> just<00:02:11.430> looks<00:02:11.670> a

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
doing that just because it just looks a

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.890 
doing that just because it just looks a
whole<00:02:11.849> lot<00:02:11.910> better<00:02:12.060> when<00:02:12.569> you

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
whole lot better when you

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.660 
whole lot better when you
open<00:02:13.439> up<00:02:13.530> your<00:02:13.680> messaging<00:02:14.129> app<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.519> see

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
open up your messaging app and you see

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.339 
open up your messaging app and you see

all your contact pictures right there I

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.710 
all your contact pictures right there I
don't<00:02:16.769> really<00:02:16.860> have<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.129> many<00:02:17.450> but<00:02:18.450> i<00:02:18.510> have<00:02:18.689> a

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
don't really have that many but i have a

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.080 
don't really have that many but i have a
few<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.409> you<00:02:19.920> can<00:02:20.069> see<00:02:20.280> like<00:02:20.519> when<00:02:20.670> i<00:02:20.700> when<00:02:21.030> i

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
few and you can see like when i when i

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.030 
few and you can see like when i when i
open<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.480> up<00:02:21.540> there<00:02:21.900> wasn't<00:02:22.290> any<00:02:22.409> over<00:02:22.709> here

open this up there wasn't any over here

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.649 
open this up there wasn't any over here
so<00:02:23.519> it<00:02:23.670> doesn't<00:02:23.909> really<00:02:24.030> look<00:02:24.239> that<00:02:24.299> good

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
so it doesn't really look that good

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.780 
so it doesn't really look that good
since<00:02:24.900> it's<00:02:25.110> all<00:02:25.230> just<00:02:25.530> uh<00:02:25.620> they're<00:02:26.610> not

actually<00:06:50.280> a<00:06:50.310> pretty<00:06:50.669> cool<00:06:50.759> tweak<00:06:51.240> and<00:06:51.479> it's

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.340 
been pretty useful for me I've been

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.170 
been pretty useful for me I've been
using<00:06:53.729> it<00:06:53.879> for<00:06:53.909> about<00:06:54.719> two<00:06:55.550> maybe<00:06:56.550> about<00:06:56.969> two

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
using it for about two maybe about two

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.420 
using it for about two maybe about two
two<00:06:57.419> and<00:06:57.449> a<00:06:57.599> half<00:06:57.719> weeks<00:06:57.750> now<00:06:58.169> and<00:06:58.379> I<00:06:59.099> mean<00:06:59.280> it's

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430 
two and a half weeks now and I mean it's

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.920 
two and a half weeks now and I mean it's
a<00:06:59.490> little<00:06:59.729> on<00:06:59.879> the<00:06:59.909> pricey<00:07:00.270> side<00:07:00.419> I<00:07:00.659> can't

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
a little on the pricey side I can't

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:02.480 
a little on the pricey side I can't
remember<00:07:01.080> exactly<00:07:01.560> how<00:07:01.770> much<00:07:01.919> it<00:07:02.099> is<00:07:02.129> but<00:07:02.460> I

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
remember exactly how much it is but I

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.029 
remember exactly how much it is but I
will<00:07:02.699> put<00:07:02.879> that<00:07:02.909> on<00:07:03.270> the<00:07:03.599> video<00:07:03.800> just<00:07:04.800> in<00:07:04.949> the

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 
will put that on the video just in the

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:07.010 
will put that on the video just in the
text<00:07:05.400> at<00:07:05.490> the<00:07:05.520> beginning<00:07:05.969> of<00:07:06.030> this<00:07:06.180> video<00:07:06.330> so

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 
text at the beginning of this video so

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.409 
text at the beginning of this video so
you'll<00:07:07.169> be<00:07:07.289> able<00:07:07.349> to<00:07:07.469> see<00:07:07.650> how<00:07:07.800> much<00:07:07.979> it<00:07:08.129> is<00:07:08.419> but

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:09.419 
you'll be able to see how much it is but

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:13.399 
you'll be able to see how much it is but
I'm<00:07:09.629> thinking<00:07:10.169> it<00:07:10.319> was<00:07:10.439> around<00:07:10.770> 13<00:07:11.580> bucks<00:07:12.409> so

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:13.409 
I'm thinking it was around 13 bucks so

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:16.249 
I'm thinking it was around 13 bucks so
it's<00:07:14.069> pretty<00:07:14.279> steep<00:07:14.580> for<00:07:14.909> a<00:07:15.139> messaging<00:07:16.139> app

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:16.259 
it's pretty steep for a messaging app

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:18.409 
it's pretty steep for a messaging app
but<00:07:16.620> usually<00:07:17.370> the<00:07:17.490> messaging<00:07:17.849> app<00:07:17.969> with<00:07:18.210> all

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419 
but usually the messaging app with all

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:20.659 
but usually the messaging app with all
these<00:07:18.599> types<00:07:19.020> of<00:07:19.169> features<00:07:19.409> and<00:07:19.800> tweaks

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:20.669 
these types of features and tweaks

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:23.450 
these types of features and tweaks
within<00:07:21.060> this<00:07:21.240> tweak<00:07:21.689> usually<00:07:22.560> will<00:07:22.800> come<00:07:23.219> at<00:07:23.430> a

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:23.460 
within this tweak usually will come at a

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.399 
within this tweak usually will come at a
hefty<00:07:23.699> price<00:07:23.879> but<00:07:24.779> let<00:07:25.080> me<00:07:25.110> know<00:07:25.229> what<00:07:25.289> you
