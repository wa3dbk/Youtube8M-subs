00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.970
 this is the car of Serbia of Challenge Challenger a Toyota 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.090
 Supra and early nineties, this super athlete competed for competitors 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.589
 mix up all the Nissan skyline or Mazda rx-7 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:19.220
 a 3 liter six-cylinder with twin turbo and standard 330 hp 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.990
 drive the wing monster on the boat 280 even then helps one 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.990
 Traction control to keep the hind legs in check Christian the Domus Supra 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:32.800
 has over the series again 30 horses more under the hood 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.960
 Vogt Jahnke 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.230
 The functions stages water then obstructs their opinion 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.260
 Toyota rav4 are relatively little so far 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.080
 This car is very moderate 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.080
 What a coilover find a little surprise 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.660
 the injured party led 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.540
 8th 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.010
 I still have a speaker here to regulate the boost pressure slips 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.330
 yes, with this device I can load between 0 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.870
 and hire as a commercial paper 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.050
 more on the sales area 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.640
 alike a whole episode of Lanka's acceptance the opinion of a line no 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.450
 Be a topic 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.340
 a second no problem at all 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.140
 which cars miss against him let go for an Oscar 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.970
 Christian seems slow from which challenged with his Toyota Supra on 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.360
 and his opponents we chose three cars from a list 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.640
 both are long corporate side and hid it you say Wellendingen 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.630
 who is that also just start is 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.630
 he was then I'm curious 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.250
 a tough chunk for Christian Lach 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.320
 BMW's fastest mid-range Kobe of the m3 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.130
 Who Powerdome on the hood is a dummy 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.430
 a v8 with 4 liter displacement needs space for 420 horses 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.310
 why moderately pattern Viennese renounce their sound show goal on nothing 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.690
 no wonder at a base price of just under 67 00 euros 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:19.019
 the engine mobilizes 400 minutes of torque to torque the result 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.019
 four point 8 seconds from zero to one hundred 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.949
 only in the 63 dead it 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.349
 Although I want to warn with the father of my clients borrow 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:36.189
 Euro 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.019
 in the last stood German 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:41.249
 Grudges against eleven year old Japanese technique 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:45.239
 The weight is in both cars in the comparison with two turbo push 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.469
 a standard Super in the nearly five seconds to a hundred 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:52.559
 but Christian has set up plant Scholz in his studio 

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:59.609
 the register loaders in the Toyota set very early very much torque 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.899
 Available Sabine and Damian how high the number of engine have their will 

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:06.899
 a crucial role 

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.449
 Christian wins the sprint duel with half a length 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.479
 Carlos Montemayor or almost everyone 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:22.349
 Environmental groups and Prof da already had Christian running forward 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.749
 Let's see Lahr 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:30.479
 the quarter my duel in the Telent game between his 420 hp strong m3 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:35.649
 against Kristian in Sudan with 360 hp turned with a narrow victory for the 

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:37.659
 challenger 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:40.839
 the second discipline discipline engine test track 

00:03:40.839 --> 00:03:44.889
 a nearly three-kilometer-long airport circuit with rough asphalt 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.029
 six courses after a long straight and typical state office next to the 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:52.029
 route 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.469
 after lost sprint race Sabine still has a bill with Christian open 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:59.520
 Moderator against spectators 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.520
 the MWG just Toyota 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:12.839
 it goes 500 meters the long straight under Serbia decides for the 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:15.839
 Ideal line not for the crowbar 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.400
 Christian is very early on the brake an invitation for Sabine 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:32.099
 but in the vertex, it gives too early and too violent Gas Spa and drive across 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:35.099
 it does not taste good 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:39.469
 but also Christian Kempf on last groove 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.319
 among them took advantage of their opportunities 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:53.210
 the last attack opportunity for the challenger 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.419
 the fast right-hander before the finish 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.419
 but he is too sure 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:09.879
 Christian packed his Supra 20 meters in green 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.819
 str 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:18.819
 the SUV such a cheese here 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.659
 under it were 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:26.469
 Nagano four goals behind Bautista not really ca 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.010
 Being fearless on that is our resource of being so sure of that now 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:35.169
 maybe by turning back to 1 something is hanging out there 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:36.569
 alone 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:37.939
 she just has her here 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:41.439
 that's right more done right and if against tax havens 

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:42.849
 Berberich defense to luck 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:47.999
 The philosopher is occasionally heard thanks to the workers for 30 years 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:49.670
 longed for second chance 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.920
 it was always nice and clean and then the second round 11th
