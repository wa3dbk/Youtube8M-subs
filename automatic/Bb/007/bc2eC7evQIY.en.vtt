 throw the garlic but we are going to leave in 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.250
 two pieces so that the homo side 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.280

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.060

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.210
 time they removed the source 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.140
 to death 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.140
 as we read 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.439

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.900
 and ready 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.980
 no water is thrown 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.600
 and here we are going to throw avocados 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:46.720
 here we are all water to make 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:50.640
 as much as you can 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.640

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.890

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.520
 and now we are going to throw the maxilla here 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.870

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.790
 and here is a sauce with water 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.830
 so I say avocado sauce 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:27.349
 but it's not guacamole salt 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.510
 no longer there we made an average 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:31.540
 teaspoon of salt 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.920
 half 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:39.590
