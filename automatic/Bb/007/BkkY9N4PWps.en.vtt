00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.600

 3 wii but as I always told you 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.200
 wikipedia is rcd factor for a 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.200
 clean installation 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.060
 we have to be in the process 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.060
 then we pay attention because they are 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.229
 now we are moving forward and where the 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.020
 pp of alicante 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.390
 let's see how we have already cleaned the 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.869
 terminal of all applications 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.670
 configurations that we had 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.270
 previously we now proceed to what 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.270
 is the installation of the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.180
 of the custom we break metal if not 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.870
 we have in the microsd memory 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.830
 and we are going to pressure I have it in a 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.120
 folder and we give you install in one 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.980
 package of those that already have 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.940
 incorporated so they only have 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.940
 than installing a single package 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.400
 let's hope that the installation process 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.730
 make the corresponding file for 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.730
 its installation 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.069
 thanks for the support we have received 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.750

 videos or send us to our 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.620
 social networks 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.910
 let's hope it charges still 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.970
 installing 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.300
 I recommend you have the finish 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.040
 at least 70% of battery charge 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.430
 so they do not have any problem to the 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.570
 time of some installation as they can 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.450
 see the installation is complete 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.450
 we just have to restart 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.710
 we can not be vary change the type of 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:30.270
 animation in this case we have to 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:33.420
 wait about 5 to 10 minutes how much 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.310
 to load in our terminal if 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.200
 is there any given case happens from the 10 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.660
 minutes you can re-enter 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.400
 recovery make the three hits and 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.760
 again again they restart the 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.760
 terminal 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.100
 but we have started after that 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.990
 started then we do the configurations 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.080
 here we are accustomed to the 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.120
 email and in the country the work 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.470
 of that configuration is we will do it 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.470
 when I load the terminal 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.660
 well as we can observe already once 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.120
 configured by finishing we will appear 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.530
 this screen that is the the new the 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.410
 many the appearance that we see that 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.260
 we have now in our s3 it seemed the 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.080
 of the sony we can not save this is the 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.380
 Half-custom launcher is based on 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:25.110
 android 4 points 4.2 that cut for this 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.550
 terminal I have against what is chaos 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.020
 of applications as you can see all 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.790
 these applications that come and go 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.090
 those who are coming preinstalled 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.380
 comes with the walkman we come with the 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.510
 chrome 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.300
 and how to work with some other 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.950
 applications also brings what is the 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.610
 equalizer that many like what 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.840
 what is this application for your 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.300
 listen to music 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.140
 updated with your player we 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.140
 send adjustments 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:05:00.180
 observe here is android 4 points 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:04.180
 4.4 points 2 incat for this terminal 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:07.419
 which is next to red is based on the 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.780
 Latest version of hanoi in themes mode 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.849
 sex 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.680
 version 37 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:18.699
 this share of rum 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.350
 is a bit improved with the one that had 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.000
 tested previously but there was no 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.080
 made the video 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.820
 and that is but it has a little improvement 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.880
 we can not look like a bar that we have 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.310
 Here to order we can show 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.470
 our applications we go to what there is 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.900
 the section of the camera 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.689
 my camera works correctly 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.199
 of one more being 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:50.420
 and in the camera that brings incorporated and 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:52.889
 it is really clear what is 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:55.020
 the image of the cameras 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:57.689
 well how are we going to see what is the 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.800
 cover marking that we already know is 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:00.800
 the same logic 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:08.060
 as central in what are the 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.060
 configurations in the juste 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:15.880
 observe comes with the halo window 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.880
 those of the floating notifications 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.360
 these are the configurations that it extracts 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.310
 these are the relationships that already 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.090
 we know that they represented others 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.090
 courses in rome 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.240
 to conjure them the appearance of 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.990
 our seasonal 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:34.129
 let's see what it 's like to go back in the bar 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.889
 of 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:38.989
 and of state totally equal what 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:40.759
 did with this rom question is that 

00:06:38.989 --> 00:06:44.179
 they only added what the woman is 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:47.400
 of xperia and its applications both in 

00:06:44.179 --> 00:06:50.759
 your camera like your other applications 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.380
 to incorporate it incorporate in this 

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:55.129
 version of sean today in word that is in 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:58.639
 the one that develop because there is more 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:07:00.709
 to throw a galaxy s3 and 9,300 well 

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:03.409
 I wanted to show something quickly what it is 

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:04.900
 this question my experience in your 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:07.030
 version 1 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.580
 if you liked the video, they are not true 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.500
 and subscribe to our channel without further 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.250
 add them then I follow everything and 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.250
 until next time
