learning a lot of things I do is

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.380 
learning a lot of things I do is

ten years ago probably a little bit not
the<00:01:34.159> not<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.550> thought<00:01:34.850> that<00:01:34.880> people<00:01:35.270> really

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390

Emperor just
well<00:02:01.960> number<00:02:02.200> one<00:02:02.440> is<00:02:02.590> stretching<00:02:03.010> to<00:02:03.159> me<00:02:03.280> I

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
well number one is stretching to me I

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.240 
well number one is stretching to me I
all<00:02:04.299> get<00:02:04.540> up<00:02:04.659> in<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.840> morning<00:02:05.170> and<00:02:05.290> all

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
all get up in the morning and all

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.950 
all get up in the morning and all
stretch<00:02:06.549> for<00:02:06.760> 15-20<00:02:07.119> minutes<00:02:07.750> and<00:02:07.900> I've

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
stretch for 15-20 minutes and I've

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.280 
stretch for 15-20 minutes and I've
really<00:02:08.319> found<00:02:08.679> that<00:02:08.950> that's<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:10.690> best<00:02:11.080> way

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
really found that that's the best way

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.830 
really found that that's the best way
for<00:02:11.530> me<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.650> prevent<00:02:12.010> injuries<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:13.300> then<00:02:13.810> I

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
for me to prevent injuries and then I

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.090 
for me to prevent injuries and then I
think<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.260> weights<00:02:14.470> have<00:02:14.620> helped<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.950> little

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
think the weights have helped a little

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.650 
think the weights have helped a little
bit<00:02:15.250> too<00:02:15.430> bad<00:02:15.880> then<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.270> know<00:02:16.390> if<00:02:16.510> you've<00:02:16.630> got

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
bit too bad then you know if you've got

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.620 
bit too bad then you know if you've got
stronger<00:02:17.610> joints<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:18.760> everything<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.180> just

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
stronger joints and everything it just

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.600 
stronger joints and everything it just
needs<00:02:19.959> to<00:02:20.200> lower<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:21.010> amount<00:02:21.100> of<00:02:21.280> injuries

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
needs to lower the amount of injuries

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.090 
needs to lower the amount of injuries
you<00:02:21.730> can<00:02:21.940> get<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.780> wait<00:02:23.650> for<00:02:23.800> how<00:02:23.890> many<00:02:23.950> years

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
you can get and wait for how many years

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.270 
you can get and wait for how many years
I<00:02:24.489> believe<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:24.940> 14<00:02:25.360> 14<00:02:25.810> using<00:02:26.739> this<00:02:26.890> time<00:02:27.100> I

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
I believe the 14 14 using this time I

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.580 
I believe the 14 14 using this time I
had<00:02:27.580> several<00:02:27.819> you<00:02:28.600> know<00:02:28.720> my<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:28.900> separated<00:02:29.530> both

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
had several you know my I separated both

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.500 
had several you know my I separated both
my<00:02:29.830> shoulders<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.280> both<00:02:31.060> knees<00:02:31.270> have<00:02:31.480> been

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
my shoulders and both knees have been

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.500 
my shoulders and both knees have been
operated<00:02:32.050> on<00:02:32.050> I<00:02:32.820> guess<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:33.970> worst<00:02:34.150> ones<00:02:34.420> were

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
operated on I guess the worst ones were

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.000 
operated on I guess the worst ones were
hand<00:02:34.780> injuries<00:02:35.170> I've<00:02:35.350> had<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.530> couple<00:02:35.709> really

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
hand injuries I've had a couple really

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.180 
hand injuries I've had a couple really
bad<00:02:36.280> cuts<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.850> lost<00:02:37.300> both<00:02:37.570> all<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.560> extensor

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
bad cuts and lost both all the extensor

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.000 
bad cuts and lost both all the extensor
tendons<00:02:39.580> in<00:02:39.700> both<00:02:39.850> hands<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.680> just<00:02:41.680> bringing

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
tendons in both hands and just bringing

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.170 
tendons in both hands and just bringing
those<00:02:42.130> back<00:02:42.430> I've<00:02:42.610> had<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.850> do<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.000> lot<00:02:43.060> of

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
those back I've had to do a lot of

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.259 
those back I've had to do a lot of
weights<00:02:43.950> if<00:02:44.950> there's<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.310> one<00:02:45.850> thing<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.150> could

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
weights if there's a one thing you could

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.640 
weights if there's a one thing you could
do<00:02:46.390> over<00:02:46.420> again<00:02:46.690> if<00:02:46.959> you're<00:02:47.110> the<00:02:47.200> beginning<00:02:47.470> of

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
do over again if you're the beginning of

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.050 
do over again if you're the beginning of
your<00:02:47.769> career<00:02:47.950> there<00:02:48.550> anything<00:02:48.700> that<00:02:48.820> you

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
your career there anything that you

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.670 
your career there anything that you
would<00:02:49.090> change<00:02:49.330> as<00:02:49.630> far<00:02:49.810> as<00:02:49.900> preparation<00:02:50.200> for

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
would change as far as preparation for

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.320 
would change as far as preparation for
playing<00:02:50.890> hockey<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.400> stay<00:02:51.700> in<00:02:51.760> shape<00:02:52.000> well<00:02:52.300> I

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
playing hockey and stay in shape well I

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.990 
playing hockey and stay in shape well I
certainly<00:02:52.810> would<00:02:53.170> you<00:02:53.590> know<00:02:53.800> I<00:02:53.830> started<00:02:54.250> in<00:02:54.370> 74

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
certainly would you know I started in 74

certainly would you know I started in 74
and<00:02:55.090> in<00:02:55.180> those<00:02:55.300> days<00:02:55.680> we<00:02:56.680> used<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.920> go<00:02:57.070> to

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
and in those days we used to go to

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.400 
and in those days we used to go to
training<00:02:57.430> camp<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.820> get<00:02:57.970> into<00:02:58.180> shape<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:58.720> now

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410

you<00:02:59.980> have<00:03:00.130> to<00:03:00.310> be<00:03:00.400> in<00:03:00.489> shape<00:03:00.519> 12<00:03:01.000> months<00:03:01.269> in<00:03:01.360> a

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
you have to be in shape 12 months in a

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.350 
you have to be in shape 12 months in a
year<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.959> I<00:03:02.050> think<00:03:02.319> would<00:03:02.769> really<00:03:02.830> help<00:03:03.430> me<00:03:03.640> we

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
year and I think would really help me we

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.610 
year and I think would really help me we
worked<00:03:04.569> out<00:03:04.720> in<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.900> summer<00:03:05.110> a<00:03:05.230> little<00:03:05.440> bit
