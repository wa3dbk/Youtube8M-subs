was<00:00:33.329> something<00:00:33.659> that<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.839> started<00:00:34.079> thinking

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
was something that I started thinking

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.229 
was something that I started thinking
that<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.800> high<00:00:34.920> school<00:00:34.949> I<00:00:35.430> had<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.790> photograph

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
that in high school I had a photograph

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.000 
that in high school I had a photograph
it<00:00:36.390> on<00:00:36.480> my<00:00:36.600> wall<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.019> then<00:00:37.379> you<00:00:37.739> know<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.829> was

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
it on my wall and then you know I was

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.619 
it on my wall and then you know I was
about<00:00:38.250> 16<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.850> had<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> chance<00:00:39.269> to<00:00:39.480> visit

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
about 16 I had a chance to visit

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.439 
about 16 I had a chance to visit
Stuttgart<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:41.040> visit<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.730> mercedes-benz

this has over a thousand pounds there's
so<00:01:42.929> much<00:01:43.110> precipitating<00:01:43.890> weight<00:01:44.099> going<00:01:44.369> on<00:01:44.610> in

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
so much precipitating weight going on in

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.270 
so much precipitating weight going on in
the<00:01:44.849> engine<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.360> at<00:01:45.509> low<00:01:45.720> rpms<00:01:46.289> your<00:01:47.009> actual

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
eyeball shake inside your sockets and so

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.290 
eyeball shake inside your sockets and so
it's<00:01:49.709> very<00:01:49.950> difficult<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.759> see<00:01:50.940> what's<00:01:51.119> going

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
it's very difficult to see what's going

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.910 
it's very difficult to see what's going
on<00:01:51.539> because<00:01:51.750> your<00:01:52.050> eyes<00:01:52.229> are<00:01:52.470> shaking
