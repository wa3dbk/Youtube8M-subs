00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
back now and the color that I have in

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.389 
back now and the color that I have in
right<00:02:06.069> now<00:02:06.310> is<00:02:06.579> the<00:02:07.060> icy<00:02:07.599> blue<00:02:07.959> and<00:02:08.649> you<00:02:09.160> can

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
right now is the icy blue and you can

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.140 
right now is the icy blue and you can
see<00:02:09.700> that<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:11.110> innocent<00:02:11.620> white<00:02:11.890> is<00:02:12.220> brighter

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
see that the innocent white is brighter

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.839 
see that the innocent white is brighter
and<00:02:13.360> lighter<00:02:13.810> than<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:14.560> icy<00:02:14.890> blue<00:02:15.099> but<00:02:15.700> it

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
and lighter than the icy blue but it

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.020 
and lighter than the icy blue but it
still<00:02:16.150> covers<00:02:16.510> my<00:02:16.930> eye<00:02:16.959> color<00:02:17.560> very<00:02:18.430> good<00:02:18.760> I

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
still covers my eye color very good I

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.960 
still covers my eye color very good I
think<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:21.010> can<00:02:21.040> see<00:02:21.489> like<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.940> difference

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
think so you can see like the difference

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.280 
think so you can see like the difference
but<00:02:22.980> really<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.010> have<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.280> say<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.870> innocent

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
but really I have to say the innocent

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.940 
but really I have to say the innocent
white<00:02:26.440> is<00:02:26.680> very<00:02:27.069> bright<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.470> what<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.500> wanted

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
white is very bright and what I wanted

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.840 
white is very bright and what I wanted
so<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:32.440> is<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:33.489> icy<00:02:33.910> blue<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:36.069> next<00:02:36.280> one<00:02:36.639> I

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
so that is the icy blue the next one I

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
think about desert I thought more of a

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.839 
think about desert I thought more of a
brown<00:03:33.140> beige<00:03:33.709> but<00:03:34.670> it's<00:03:34.879> it's<00:03:35.209> kind<00:03:35.480> of<00:03:35.540> green

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
brown beige but it's it's kind of green

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.550 
brown beige but it's it's kind of green
but<00:03:37.849> I<00:03:37.879> like<00:03:38.180> this<00:03:38.390> color<00:03:38.690> -<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:39.049> don't<00:03:39.379> know<00:03:39.440> if
