00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 good evening I Chinese for Italy 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.970
 good evening friends waiting for the 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.069
 the transfer market is also on Saturdays 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.559
 neither live nor for the Brazilian 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.509
 and then later cashed if you bet 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.790
 straight on adem 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.680
 liike these goals these 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.850
 major negotiations much more 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.150
 we will face over our course 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.470
 episode we will do it with a heel a 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.609
 wiper capable and above all 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.619
 entitled to move in any area 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.080
 the solution we didn't talk about we have 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.480
 spoken often before it came out on 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.760
 let's start then with what has already happened 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.050
 also reported our enrico cerruti 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.379
 regarding the words of 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.129
 zamparini closer to naples than 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.150
 alla roma hernandez but it is so and so 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.210
 tesa del cagliari while and not 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.760
 on days in which players nevertheless 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.190
 laurana have thus decided to allow 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.960
 to the player a new experience this 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.660
 time in Holland this time with the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.430
 jersey of the ajax furio seen that they have 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.740
 asked a lot of questions in the Milan home 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.040
 cagliari our viewer but he is there 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.270
 also spoke of the reinforcement in defense on 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.600
 reinforcement that then could really 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.980
 be there and we will try to answer 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.050
 all your questions and I have to say 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.880
 we owe all your curiosity 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.860
 stop the few advertising moments 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.280
 then we will always be here together live 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.970
 up widely rewarded on a field 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.220
 so this money the rector so 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.320
 so much money that he only had to 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.840
 spend the suggestive idea well with 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.220
 that wave preference yours 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.750
 preference in the hope is that of 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.040
 we stay in our company we stop 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.150
 very few moments this oar 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.550
 here again you could be one 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.470
 solution for the zenith ivic that it is 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.690
 money seems to me that 9 million just a little 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.620
 all the objectives in common example 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:55.700
 diamonds example ogbonna has withdrawn 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:02:00.350
 from these perhaps on all of a player 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.150
 that is, the war therefore remains 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.540
 obviously speaking from football 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.580
 market- related for kolarov is instead 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.910
 an agreement must be found for how much 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.430
 is about what the market wants 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.500
 Interista Well now you really start 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.140
 will start the inter 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.400
 Monday, let's take a step back 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.930
 remember the day of the conference 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.300
 print by walter mazzarri of 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.750
 presentation had said I hope to 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.090
 leave for collection with at least the already 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.570
 complete team and with two players per 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.269
 role 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.430
 we are a little distant are 30 million 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.650
 ready for handanovic I would sell it 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.019
 as my friend says, they are only reversed 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.930
 decide where to go or unless 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.720
 I really do n't think I consider myself one 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.700
 reserve for the parma for him 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.410
 probably destination is not 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.290
 very welcome by the player there is 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.719
 also the genoa 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.269
 there are also those who follow as you said 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:57.790
 you too frog on pole 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.069
 manchester united but now I move forward 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.239
 another hypothesis you tell me what 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:07.049
 think of an exchange with naples more 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:09.099
 possible adjustment for zuniga 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:14.560
 appointment with a special transfer market 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:17.470
 from 11.00 pm stay with us mind 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.200
 but he works subtracking and already the first 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.599
 purchases brought them to dear george a 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.250
 the viewers response but mourinho 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.560
 he said he didn't want to touch 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.180
 consequently the Milan must however 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.310
 then put important resources 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.919
 anyone on the team because they give life 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.450
 to the derby director but saying 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:37.359
 of the offer that the paris saint germain 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.450
 will present and you can bet that not 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:43.720
 it will be low I don't think that at all 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.980
 judging from the parameters also the 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.530
 lottery answer 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.510
 the millionaire offers to all glebe 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.700
 comes from yours to offer little 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.519
 it doesn't seem really strange to us apart from 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.310
 I go back to the editorial staff line remains 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:00.790
 whole with michele cruttiello alfredo 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.859
