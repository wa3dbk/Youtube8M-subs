a<00:00:23.880> couple<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.300> times<00:00:24.539> here<00:00:25.050> by<00:00:25.710> putting<00:00:26.160> them

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
a couple of times here by putting them

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.589 
a couple of times here by putting them
on<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.519> platform<00:00:26.730> but<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.210> doesn't<00:00:27.449> count

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
on the platform but that doesn't count

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.109 
on the platform but that doesn't count
you<00:00:27.779> must<00:00:27.960> use<00:00:28.199> them<00:00:28.320> in<00:00:28.529> combat<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.279> for<00:00:29.939> fire

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
you must use them in combat and for fire

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.139 
you must use them in combat and for fire
proof<00:00:30.619> you<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:31.920> reset<00:00:32.369> your<00:00:32.399> checkpoint<00:00:32.730> if

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
proof you can reset your checkpoint if

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.299 
proof you can reset your checkpoint if
you<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:33.600> get<00:00:33.809> hit<00:00:33.960> by<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.140> fire<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.100> not

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
you do get hit by the fire so it's not

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.100 
you do get hit by the fire so it's not
that<00:00:35.579> big<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> deal<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.540> start<00:00:36.870> at<00:00:36.989> the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
that big of a deal you just start at the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.549 
that big of a deal you just start at the
bottom<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.969> platform<00:00:39.570> right<00:00:40.140> before

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
bottom of the the platform right before

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.010 
bottom of the the platform right before
you<00:00:40.800> would<00:00:40.980> start<00:00:41.370> going<00:00:41.610> up<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:42.090> had<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.780> reset

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
you would start going up I had to reset

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.680 
you would start going up I had to reset
a<00:00:43.079> couple<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.500> times<00:00:43.850> by<00:00:44.850> either<00:00:45.149> getting<00:00:45.480> hit

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
a couple of times by either getting hit

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.750 
a couple of times by either getting hit
by<00:00:45.840> fire<00:00:46.079> if<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.440> wasn't<00:00:46.739> quite<00:00:47.070> sure<00:00:47.129> if<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.579> get

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
by fire if I wasn't quite sure if I get

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.610 
by fire if I wasn't quite sure if I get
hit<00:00:48.030> by<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.239> fire<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.899> reset<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.260> anyway

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
hit by the fire I just reset it anyway

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.560 
hit by the fire I just reset it anyway
but<00:00:50.660> you<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.899> let<00:00:52.140> your<00:00:52.730> your<00:00:53.730> duplicate<00:00:54.420> your

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
but you can let your your duplicate your

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.689 
but you can let your your duplicate your
clone<00:00:54.960> beat<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.680> platform<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:56.399> pretty

clone beat on the platform for pretty

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.660 
clone beat on the platform for pretty
long<00:00:56.910> time<00:00:57.180> before<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.600> actually<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.350> to

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
long time before you actually have to

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.119 
long time before you actually have to
reset<00:00:59.670> them<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.140> another<00:01:01.140> strategy<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.949> order

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
reset them and another strategy in order

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.310 
reset them and another strategy in order
to<00:01:02.190> get<00:01:02.309> through<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:03.030> if<00:01:03.359> you're<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:04.260> a

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
to get through this is if you're in a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.140 
to get through this is if you're in a
bit<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.799> pickle<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.280> kind<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.640> stuck<00:01:05.909> about

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
bit of a pickle and kind of stuck about

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.750 
bit of a pickle and kind of stuck about
to<00:01:06.330> go<00:01:06.450> into<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> fire<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:07.979> use<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.490> magic

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
to go into the fire you can use a magic

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.420 
to go into the fire you can use a magic
attack<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.510> you'll<00:01:10.140> be<00:01:10.380> invincible<00:01:10.830> going

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
attack and you'll be invincible going

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.820 
attack and you'll be invincible going
through<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> fire<00:01:12.470> so<00:01:13.470> that's<00:01:13.590> another

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
through the fire so that's another

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.730 
through the fire so that's another
strategy<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:15.030> pretty<00:01:15.270> much<00:01:15.450> can<00:01:15.659> ignore<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
strategy you pretty much can ignore the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.399 
strategy you pretty much can ignore the
enemies<00:01:17.360> I'm<00:01:18.360> not<00:01:18.600> really<00:01:18.810> doing<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.259> that

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
enemies I'm not really doing it that

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.260 
enemies I'm not really doing it that
much<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:20.040> I'm<00:01:20.280> also<00:01:20.430> trying<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.939> not<00:01:21.090> lose

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
much but I'm also trying to not lose

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.480 
much but I'm also trying to not lose
health<00:01:21.509> since<00:01:21.960> I'm<00:01:22.080> doing<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.439> on<00:01:22.619> hard<00:01:22.830> you

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
health since I'm doing this on hard you

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.130 
health since I'm doing this on hard you
can<00:01:23.640> pretty<00:01:23.880> much<00:01:23.970> ignore<00:01:24.210> them<00:01:24.600> until<00:01:24.990> you

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
can pretty much ignore them until you

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.620 
can pretty much ignore them until you
get<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> top<00:01:25.740> because<00:01:26.670> once<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.450> hit<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
get to the top because once you hit the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.670 
get to the top because once you hit the
top<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.890> will<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.460> out<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.299> fire<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:31.259> you

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
top you will be out of the fire and you

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.620 
top you will be out of the fire and you
won't<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.220> worry<00:01:32.460> about<00:01:32.759> getting<00:01:33.360> hit<00:01:33.479> by

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
combat but it's really effective I would

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.880 
combat but it's really effective I would
use<00:03:26.849> it<00:03:27.000> as<00:03:27.180> much<00:03:27.630> as<00:03:27.840> possible<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.860> also
