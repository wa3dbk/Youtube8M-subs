mean it's you know you'd eventually get
to<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.260> point<00:01:48.380> of<00:01:48.500> desperation<00:01:50.500> and<00:01:51.500> I<00:01:51.590> guess

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
to the point of desperation and I guess

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.050 
to the point of desperation and I guess
it<00:01:51.979> wasn't<00:01:52.130> I<00:01:52.280> mean<00:01:52.310> it's<00:01:52.490> very<00:01:52.610> difficult<00:01:52.850> to

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
it wasn't I mean it's very difficult to

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.940 
it wasn't I mean it's very difficult to

portray that and portray a love story at
the<00:01:55.009> same<00:01:55.190> time<00:01:55.400> unless<00:01:55.670> you<00:01:55.909> want<00:01:56.060> to<00:01:56.150> make<00:01:56.810> a

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
the same time unless you want to make a

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.050 
the same time unless you want to make a
very<00:01:57.080> different<00:01:57.409> movie<00:01:57.710> I<00:01:57.740> mean<00:01:58.040> as<00:01:58.550> I<00:01:58.909> was

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
very different movie I mean as I was

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.219 
very different movie I mean as I was
trying<00:01:59.240> to<00:01:59.270> push<00:01:59.479> for<00:01:59.659> that<00:01:59.690> angle<00:02:00.050> at<00:02:00.140> the

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
trying to push for that angle at the

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.639 
trying to push for that angle at the
same<00:02:00.380> time<00:02:00.560> that<00:02:01.180> and<00:02:02.180> it's<00:02:03.080> funny<00:02:03.259> when<00:02:03.440> Bill

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
to put this at the forefront because

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.740 
to put this at the forefront because
breaking<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.820> ones<00:02:07.970> probably<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.390> happiest

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
breaking the ones probably the happiest

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.410 
breaking the ones probably the happiest
said<00:02:08.929> it's<00:02:09.140> been<00:02:09.590> even<00:02:09.709> L<00:02:10.069> Series<00:02:10.399> ahead<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:11.270> as

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
said it's been even L Series ahead so as

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.210 
said it's been even L Series ahead so as
like<00:02:11.600> a<00:02:11.720> fish<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.230> wrong<00:02:12.440> moment<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.980> use<00:02:13.190> a

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
like a fish the wrong moment to use a

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.290 
like a fish the wrong moment to use a
better<00:02:14.120> huh<00:02:14.709> but<00:02:15.709> uh<00:02:15.760> we<00:02:16.760> did<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:16.910> couple<00:02:17.090> of

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
better huh but uh we did a couple of

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.560 
better huh but uh we did a couple of
flashbacks<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:17.989> stuff<00:02:18.320> like<00:02:18.470> that<00:02:18.530> which

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
flashbacks and stuff like that which

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.130 
flashbacks and stuff like that which
kind<00:02:20.570> of<00:02:20.750> reflect<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:22.570> anger<00:02:23.570> I<00:02:23.600> guess<00:02:23.930> when

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
kind of reflect is anger I guess when

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.350 
kind of reflect is anger I guess when
you<00:02:24.230> first<00:02:24.620> turn<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:24.920> turn<00:02:25.040> out<00:02:25.190> on<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:26.090> then

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
you first turn it turn out on it then

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.290 
you first turn it turn out on it then
for<00:02:26.600> your<00:02:26.690> own<00:02:26.840> personal<00:02:27.190> journey<00:02:28.190> these<00:02:29.000> past

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
sounds of trying to grow figure out who

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.770 
sounds of trying to grow figure out who
you<00:02:48.170> want<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.560> be<00:02:48.739> in<00:02:48.890> its<00:02:49.610> it's<00:02:50.360> okay<00:02:50.660> it's
