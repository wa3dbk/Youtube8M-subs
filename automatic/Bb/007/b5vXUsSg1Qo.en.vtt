low-end as the deep blue although the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.550 
low-end as the deep blue although the
KMC<00:01:55.530> three<00:01:55.979> was<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> respectable<00:01:56.969> second<00:01:57.560> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
KMC three was a respectable second the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.350 
KMC three was a respectable second the
deep<00:01:58.770> blue<00:01:58.979> really<00:01:59.460> excelled<00:01:59.880> with<00:01:59.969> loud

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
deep blue really excelled with loud

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.389 
deep blue really excelled with loud
aggressive<00:02:00.750> music<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.469> Black<00:02:01.740> Sabbath<00:02:02.250> and

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
aggressive music like Black Sabbath and

ac/dc

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
ac/dc

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.730 
ac/dc
and<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.659> didn't<00:02:03.990> hurt<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.560> loudest

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
and it didn't hurt that it's the loudest

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.160 
and it didn't hurt that it's the loudest
system<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.520> bunch<00:02:05.729> either<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.990> one

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
system of the bunch either the one

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.050 
system of the bunch either the one
drawback<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.039> deep<00:02:08.250> blue<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.879> of

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
drawback is that the deep blue can of

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.520 
drawback is that the deep blue can of
time<00:02:09.239> sound<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.690> little<00:02:09.929> harsh

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
time sound a little harsh

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.770 
time sound a little harsh
which<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.069> don't<00:02:11.340> get<00:02:11.489> with<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.760> KMC<00:02:12.120> 3<00:02:12.569> or

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
which you don't get with the KMC 3 or

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.580 
which you don't get with the KMC 3 or
the<00:02:12.989> z2
