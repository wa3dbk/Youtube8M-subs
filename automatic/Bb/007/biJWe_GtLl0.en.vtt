00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.810
 Now all you do is truthfully before 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.430
 how to unscrew the bolts and desirable 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.290
 sprinkle some water 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:33.720
 well or brake fluid if excerpts 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.880
 no so after we shot here 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.760
 worth the ring you cleaned it off 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.930
 good from knocking whether rust on whether in 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.140
 pipe on both sides 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.019
 coat with grease or preferably more 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.319
 coil the asbestos 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.450
 the collar is inserted here and put on 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:59.310
 now do it all tighten 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.310
 so what mut mut 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:09.590
 twisted put all the mounts 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.260
 which were now looking at the results 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.900
 here's how to hear the sound almost 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.989
 no 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.300
 from the engine running well, you can 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:25.080
 check 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.080
 I will say but here's the ability to leak 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.260
 all in general 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:41.160
 everything works as the result of us not 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:42.800
 pleased with the pipe turned out here muffler 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.910
 when everything was fine everything was fine 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:51.540
 husband is very painful he sticks out to disclose 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.510
 or that was for a sedan it is a little bit 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.569
 will move no want to be so this 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.480
 I am very confused 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.580
 because you can when you park 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.860
 drive into some 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.519
 wall or curb and break new 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.630
 muffler 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:12.989
 Now we saw off his level and probably 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.340
 so here so that the bumper so slightly 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:18.690
 on the bumper was 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:22.019
 so if there will be some kind of blow we have 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:26.150
 at least did not touch the muffler now 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.150
 we will do this Belgorod
