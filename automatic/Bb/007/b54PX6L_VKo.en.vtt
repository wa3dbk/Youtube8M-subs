do also have the canadian brand but I in
it<00:02:01.740> as<00:02:01.950> far<00:02:02.130> we<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.610> see<00:02:02.790> we<00:02:03.090> will<00:02:03.240> spend<00:02:03.570> and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
it as far we can see we will spend and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.950 
it as far we can see we will spend and
the<00:02:04.409> market<00:02:04.740> will<00:02:04.979> go<00:02:05.250> interaction<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.180> more

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
the market will go interaction of more

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.869 
the market will go interaction of more
concentrating<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.220> means<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.670> big

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
concentrating and that means a big

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.240 
concentrating and that means a big
demands<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.660> big<00:02:09.840> brands<00:02:10.200> which<00:02:10.860> we<00:02:11.039> are

demands to the big brands which we are

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.490 
demands to the big brands which we are
among<00:02:11.489> them

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
among them

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.040 
among them
so<00:02:12.890> we<00:02:13.100> will<00:02:13.280> we<00:02:13.790> will<00:02:13.970> continue<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.780> develop

so we will we will continue to develop

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.010 
so we will we will continue to develop
the<00:02:15.470> brand<00:02:15.710> Excel<00:02:16.220> strongly<00:02:17.000> we<00:02:17.540> are<00:02:17.720> doing

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
the brand Excel strongly we are doing

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.950 
the brand Excel strongly we are doing
next<00:02:18.980> year<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:20.000> new<00:02:20.600> shaft<00:02:20.960> on<00:02:21.320> straight<00:02:22.130> shaft

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
next year a new shaft on straight shaft

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.640 
next year a new shaft on straight shaft
now<00:02:23.960> I<00:02:24.350> think<00:02:24.710> that<00:02:24.890> we<00:02:25.370> or<00:02:25.670> we<00:02:26.030> believe<00:02:26.390> that

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
now I think that we or we believe that

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.340 
now I think that we or we believe that
these<00:02:27.650> curves<00:02:28.100> shaft<00:02:28.910> have<00:02:29.390> met<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.870> certain

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
these curves shaft have met a certain

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.130 
these curves shaft have met a certain
level<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:32.150> market<00:02:32.450> is<00:02:32.510> not<00:02:32.630> that<00:02:32.870> hungry

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
level and the market is not that hungry

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.020 
level and the market is not that hungry
anymore<00:02:33.500> we<00:02:33.800> have<00:02:33.830> certain<00:02:34.370> consumers<00:02:34.880> they

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
anymore we have certain consumers they

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.480 
anymore we have certain consumers they
are<00:02:35.150> playing<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.690> curves<00:02:36.290> we<00:02:36.560> know<00:02:36.709> that<00:02:36.980> but

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
are playing the curves we know that but

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.220 
are playing the curves we know that but
we<00:02:37.670> see<00:02:37.940> that<00:02:38.180> more<00:02:38.390> and<00:02:38.450> more<00:02:38.600> is<00:02:38.810> going<00:02:38.930> back

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
we see that more and more is going back

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.140 
we see that more and more is going back
to<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.500> regular<00:02:39.530> shaft<00:02:40.160> and<00:02:40.400> there<00:02:40.910> we<00:02:41.060> are

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
to the regular shaft and there we are

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.910 
to the regular shaft and there we are
going<00:02:41.360> to<00:02:41.480> introduce<00:02:41.600> a<00:02:41.959> brand<00:02:42.230> new<00:02:42.410> shaft<00:02:42.740> and
