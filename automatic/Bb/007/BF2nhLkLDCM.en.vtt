00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.620 

and<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:10.280> know<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.430> installs<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.119> from<00:01:12.329> a<00:01:12.390> sea

and I know that installs it from a sea
card<00:01:13.040> choose<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.280> from<00:01:14.399> SD<00:01:14.790> card<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:16.110> should<00:01:16.439> be

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
card choose it from SD card it should be

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:35.539 
card choose it from SD card it should be
at<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.899> bottom<00:01:27.649> here<00:01:28.649> it<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:34.310> this<00:01:35.310> doesn't

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
at the bottom here it is this doesn't

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.980 
at the bottom here it is this doesn't
take<00:01:35.850> long<00:01:36.060> either<00:01:37.130> well<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.610> 107<00:01:39.539> megabyte

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
take long either well it's 107 megabyte

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:50.870 
take long either well it's 107 megabyte
so<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.289> might<00:01:45.170> just<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.679> do<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:49.610> cut<00:01:50.610> my<00:01:50.729> nails
