00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello friends of dragon ball fans we are going to 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.430
 talk a little about what you have 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.429
 come being the fifth episode of 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.410
 dragon for the software as clearly 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.500
 has seen the animation of the chapter 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.710
 has been seen in a pretty animation 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.370
 poor of what would become the battle 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.300
 between goku bills as you well know that 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.490
 battle had been happening since 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.790
 Some debate about the gods where 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.440
 faces bills between 32 basically what 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.230
 that what all the fans were the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.690
 tract was that in the anime version 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.670
 this battle is more detailed and be a 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.070
 little more extensive since there is more time 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.280
 and more chapters where you can 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.810
 scratch is better the fight however what 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.880
 who has been watching is an animation 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.329
 quite poor that logically has 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.989
 quite unleashed what comes to be the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.590
 indignation 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.600
 so much by fans not only 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.970
 Spanish speakers or Latinos but also 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.600
 by the Japanese who are 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.890
 own 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:12.759
 the first chapters according to whatever 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.920
 the information has been estimated that the 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.470
 poor production that has had in this 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.899
 dragonball case his person the battle 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.170
 between what bill is because it is coming 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:27.850
 working from multiple freelancers by 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.860
 so to say the animations and then to 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.799
 time to merge with each other is not 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.810
 are suddenly able to coordinate well 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:39.429
 although these are related more by 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:42.250
 put it like this with a low budget that 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.020
 is what is being talked about in other 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.720
 places and what has been talked about in 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.789
 certain months that worked the super no 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.409
 has a lot of budget at the moment and that 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.509
 why the animation has come out so 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.119
 power now I do want to make a 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.670
 parentheses and mention that we are happy 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.860
 a little bit but it's not the first year to 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.659
 suffer type of battles all kinds of 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.340
 mistakes 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.069
 I want to emphasize that dragon ball shopper 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.099
 It is not the first type of errors it offers 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.470
 of design so to speak but that already 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.510
 I have also seen similar things in 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.769
 Other years as gone and as naruto 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.599
 etc 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.489
 basically we really the 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:22.549
 interests of the super group and for that reason 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.709
 is that we are super worried about 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.510
 contains a reproduction about what 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.780
 has been discussed and based on all the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.940
 penalties that we hope so that the 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.730
 producer invest a little more in this 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.010
 and you can really punch fridays 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.140
 of quality not so you do not miss the 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.060
 childbirth the essence of what it is was a 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.459
 town then the thing another suggestion that 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.200
 He has been producing ends at the 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.700
 anime production is that the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.950
 battles are not so extensive and so 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.989
 detailed to avoid this kind of 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.770
 inconveniences and it was of claims because 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.380
 for one per production 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:00.130
 nothing basically to wait for the next 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.590
 chapter that all claims go to 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.760
 so we have to pass the 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.189
 battles look much better 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.310
 Anyway, another bomb will follow 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:13.950
 We can not see the rating keeps going up 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.090
 and if we want the saga to continue there 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.800
 that continue to support the production 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.330
 people know well and we continue in the 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.330
 social networks to see us
