00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.350

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.640
 to draw society to dad 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.360
 from today 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.680
 and I like it 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.989
 I lost my knife 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.540
 I am hiding in a key place 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:55.019
 but I do not say if it can be so key 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.390
 they did not give you a shot now to see to see 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.500
 see if I get shot like you have left 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.500

 equal you kill 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.910
 this 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.330
 Sometimes I have to go 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.560
 because obviously I will feel 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.560
 sure by your side 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.229
 this is the opposite really 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:02:01.440
 the camouflage of skate boarding the uncle 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.800
 for the suit is that I do parkour in 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:11.060
 an extreme kid I make my space is a 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.060
 hair so it's a hair 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.760

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.660
 always 15 years I really 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.750
 with these people it's easy to put it 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:50.400
 a gun 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:50.400

00:02:51.410 --> 00:03:04.280
 in the one that was really to take 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.530

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:12.410
 nothing agreed to be together just 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:14.650
 it's already stopped but I do not think it's 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.650
 tango 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.370
