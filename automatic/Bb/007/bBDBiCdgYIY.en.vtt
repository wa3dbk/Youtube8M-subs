00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:02.700
 damn fire 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.250
 hammer of the violent dark cry of terrorist sword of the 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.459
 intolerant wall of the selfish 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.409
 you do not like what is bad 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.309
 it gets in your way 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.150
 it bothers you to set it on fire 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.829
 wraps the flames open fire and pretends to be blind 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:26.050
 so they think 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.070
 what reason he argued 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.159
 against the fire 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.629
 and it is well known that fire is not fought with fire 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.360
 so what remedy 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.330
 no silence of course 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.230
 every word is a drop of water I would have been necessary against fire 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.380
 so let's talk 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.380
 better still tormenting we shout 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.620
 that we are fed up 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.160
 look at all as we burn 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.690
 against dozens of us every day they open fire 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.540
 scandalous lack of respect 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.780
 to life to dignity to peace to the best of the whole world 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.670
 and they also burn with their own fire 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.170
 but do not give up 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.630
 as soon as you land one you get two more to continue with the game 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.930
 a moment if we are more because we do not stop them 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.979
 and while they embrace us in the most cruel violent way 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.150
 who cries to our dead 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.180
 it's a crazy thing to realize 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.680
 this bonfire is for money 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.480
 and what we do 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.070
 give them our silence 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.180
 hide under stones because of fear 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.510
 I include myself a mask I have 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.850
 I'm not a poet, look at what sad verses, but I'm human 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.070
 Under this rain of burning lead I'm afraid 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.660
 is that I do not grieve
