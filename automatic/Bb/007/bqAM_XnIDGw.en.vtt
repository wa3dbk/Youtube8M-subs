00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.929
 super super good after for those who 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.020
 they follow me on facebook to cut me but 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.939
 it is a result if they want the article 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.980
 that I wrote to camera takes away from 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.539
 information I leave the link 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.880
 If you want me to make a video of how I 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.010
 cut the hair leave me in the comments 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.660
 if we make a video as the title says 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.090
 of the video today we're going to learn how 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.689
 fold jeans or pants to maximize 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.570
 your space and when the avilÃ©s and serves 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.609
 one does not hurt everyone is worth then 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.089
 stay for this video if you want to know 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:42.829
 how to do it good let's start to 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:45.289
 maximize your space what I need is 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.739
 that everything is super compact yes and 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.360
 can stack it then how is the 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.230
 face-up pants 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.960
 and you put the boot up the two 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.320
 routes up 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.949
 in our form that surpasses the part 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.280
 of the waist or face and it bends 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.280
 pulls out 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:12.200
 as I expected a pocket 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.310
 then you fold this part 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.380
 In the center 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.720
 turn around because it's the next marquilla 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.549
 outside 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.700
 this triangle not meters so that it is 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.700
 a perfect rectangle and doubles 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.270
 and I love you like that 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.200
 and that is a little more 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.810
 all right 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.420
 complicated now this this is more 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.420
 simple double trousers in 2 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:56.860
 for flat 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:02:01.840
 that is visible and fold the boot 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:07.539
 to the tail where the shot is 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:10.409
 then come to bend to here sometimes 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:14.370
 is going to upload it another bit 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:14.370
 and this part 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.120
 inside 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:27.510
 where mind days your legs 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:30.870
 and ready then good this 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.300
 to fold it so it gets stuck in here and 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:38.610
 it will never unfold 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.610
 when I take out it is a several files 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.280
 and ready in the conventional way as 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.319
 we speak the pants the pants 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.230
 they are quite long and occupy more 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.269
 space and when you will take them out when 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:56.099
 there are several stacked arms I will finish 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:59.069
 they unfold the way I do 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.700
 I explained is this much more compact and not 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.540
 disarms 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:10.060
 and occupies less space you can see that here 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:13.380
 there may be another when it is super good 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.780
 it was not different sizes 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.120
 with respect to the hip and the waist 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.900
 and also this game is what I have if 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.209
 you have a skin and a wide boot is going to be 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.760
 different then for those who have in 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.920
 wide boots what I recommend is that 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.930
 always look for the geometry that is 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.170
 that always look for the squares are the 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.540
 rectangles I think longer detours 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.010
 has been all the video today I hope that 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.120

 closet remembers that the spaces that are 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:14.859
 very high very wide very high you need 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.510
 a division so you can get the 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.910
 things with my great ease those that 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:22.590
