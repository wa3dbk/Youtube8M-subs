00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.319 
thought was a really good question I
thought<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.799> would<00:01:35.130> really<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.640> baby<00:01:36.000> this

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
purse and because of that like I thought

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.300 
purse and because of that like I thought
eventually<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.740> corners<00:01:41.220> might<00:01:41.810> roll<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:43.439> you

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
eventually the corners might roll or you

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.560 
eventually the corners might roll or you
know<00:01:44.460> bend<00:01:44.790> or<00:01:45.380> wear<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.670> far<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.299> mean<00:01:48.450> it's
