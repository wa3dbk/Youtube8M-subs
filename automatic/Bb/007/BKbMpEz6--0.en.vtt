00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
in office specially and we completely

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.900 
in office specially and we completely
lose<00:04:48.569> the<00:04:48.690> rhythm<00:04:48.870> of<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.710> game<00:04:49.740> because<00:04:50.130> we

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
happened around the game within a game

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.710 
happened around the game within a game
and<00:04:58.680> we<00:04:59.160> was<00:04:59.310> a<00:04:59.340> nervous<00:04:59.819> and<00:05:00.180> sometimes

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.430 
is Sammy gets easier vero beach I go to
cognition<00:05:26.909> of<00:05:27.210> each<00:05:27.389> you<00:05:27.780> touch<00:05:27.930> a<00:05:27.960> sunny<00:05:28.229> that

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
cognition of each you touch a sunny that

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.589 
cognition of each you touch a sunny that
we<00:05:28.560> know<00:05:28.710> that<00:05:28.740> the<00:05:29.039> letter<00:05:30.030> Kakashi<00:05:30.360> Jade

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
we know that the letter Kakashi Jade

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:36.920 
we know that the letter Kakashi Jade
next<00:05:31.500> time<00:05:31.620> is<00:05:33.470> some<00:05:34.470> of<00:05:34.590> us<00:05:34.919> via

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
next time is some of us via

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.279 
next time is some of us via
I<00:05:37.190> get<00:05:38.190> so<00:05:38.370> many<00:05:39.000> solutions<00:05:39.449> or<00:05:39.900> so<00:05:40.050> that<00:05:40.199> is

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
I get so many solutions or so that is

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.070 
I get so many solutions or so that is
possible<00:05:40.680> that<00:05:41.520> it's<00:05:41.669> possible<00:05:42.080> it's

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
possible that it's possible it's

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.210 
possible that it's possible it's
possible<00:05:43.110> a<00:05:43.530> generic<00:05:43.979> door<00:05:44.160> is<00:05:44.340> based<00:05:45.030> on
