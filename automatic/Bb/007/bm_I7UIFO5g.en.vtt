00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.960 
it was almost like it when you would go
off<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.350> floor<00:01:56.650> there'd<00:01:56.950> be<00:01:57.040> a<00:01:57.070> drop-off<00:01:57.909> in

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
off the floor there'd be a drop-off in

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.149 
off the floor there'd be a drop-off in
terms<00:01:58.330> of<00:01:58.479> defending<00:01:58.780> the<00:01:58.990> basket<00:01:59.409> may<00:01:59.830> not<00:02:00.010> be

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
terms of defending the basket may not be

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.130 
terms of defending the basket may not be
the<00:02:00.280> case<00:02:00.460> this<00:02:00.640> year

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
the case this year

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.680 
the case this year
awesome<00:02:02.280> that's<00:02:03.280> nice<00:02:03.580> that's<00:02:04.180> really<00:02:04.390> nice

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
awesome that's nice that's really nice

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.770 
awesome that's nice that's really nice
but<00:02:05.549> exactly<00:02:06.549> we<00:02:06.700> needed<00:02:07.030> we<00:02:07.240> needed<00:02:07.420> sighs

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
but exactly we needed we needed sighs

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.419 
but exactly we needed we needed sighs
and<00:02:08.049> I<00:02:08.110> think<00:02:08.349> we<00:02:08.470> got<00:02:08.619> him<00:02:08.799> now

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
and I think we got him now

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.750 
and I think we got him now
and<00:02:09.689> what<00:02:10.689> the<00:02:10.810> good<00:02:11.019> big<00:02:11.200> guys<00:02:11.409> would<00:02:11.859> without

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
and what the good big guys would without

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.670 
and what the good big guys would without
experience<00:02:13.450> in<00:02:13.629> the<00:02:13.719> league<00:02:13.900> too<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:14.439> I<00:02:14.469> think

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
experience in the league too so I think

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.610 
experience in the league too so I think
it<00:02:14.980> definitely<00:02:15.129> will<00:02:15.900> really<00:02:16.900> be<00:02:17.079> a<00:02:17.109> big<00:02:17.379> big

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
it definitely will really be a big big

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.440 
it definitely will really be a big big
