for pros Umi working with 1t four I has

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.090 
for pros Umi working with 1t four I has
been<00:00:35.890> a<00:00:35.920> great<00:00:36.430> opportunity<00:00:37.420> for<00:00:37.809> us<00:00:38.110> to<00:00:38.260> use

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
been a great opportunity for us to use

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.639 
been a great opportunity for us to use
the<00:00:39.340> team<00:00:39.579> as<00:00:39.879> inspiration<00:00:40.570> for<00:00:40.600> design<00:00:41.260> and

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
the team as inspiration for design and

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.720 
the team as inspiration for design and
development<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:44.320> find<00:00:44.829> that<00:00:44.920> the<00:00:45.190> young

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
development we find that the young

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.040 
development we find that the young
riders<00:00:46.120> and<00:00:46.329> the<00:00:46.480> organization<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:47.829> very<00:00:47.980> well

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
riders and the organization is very well

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.160 
riders and the organization is very well
put<00:00:50.050> together<00:00:50.170> and<00:00:50.559> focused<00:00:51.010> on<00:00:51.159> on<00:00:51.550> winning

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
put together and focused on on winning

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.430 
put together and focused on on winning
and<00:00:53.170> creating<00:00:53.650> a<00:00:53.739> great<00:00:53.980> environment<00:00:54.280> for

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
and creating a great environment for

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.530 
and creating a great environment for
innovation<00:00:56.440> and<00:00:57.129> improvement<00:00:57.430> yeah<00:00:58.239> for<00:00:58.510> sure

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
innovation and improvement yeah for sure

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.990 
innovation and improvement yeah for sure
it<00:00:58.989> helps<00:00:59.260> definitely<00:01:00.250> helps<00:01:00.489> to<00:01:00.640> perform

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
it helps definitely helps to perform

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.689 
it helps definitely helps to perform
because<00:01:01.449> if<00:01:02.290> it's<00:01:02.530> flappy<00:01:02.920> then<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.430> wind<00:01:03.579> is

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
because if it's flappy then the wind is

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.880 
because if it's flappy then the wind is
in<00:01:03.850> it<00:01:03.969> and<00:01:04.210> it<00:01:04.660> saves<00:01:05.170> a<00:01:05.259> lot<00:01:05.289> of<00:01:05.410> energy<00:01:05.590> of

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
in it and it saves a lot of energy of

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.090 
in it and it saves a lot of energy of
just<00:01:06.220> tighten<00:01:06.789> in<00:01:07.080> physics<00:01:08.080> could<00:01:08.200> I<00:01:08.410> stay<00:01:08.950> in

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
just tighten in physics could I stay in

the<00:02:05.830> aerodynamic<00:02:06.819> performance<00:02:06.940> a<00:02:07.330> little<00:02:07.539> bit

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:07.629 
the aerodynamic performance a little bit

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:09.300 
the aerodynamic performance a little bit
by<00:02:07.780> tying<00:02:08.050> these<00:02:08.229> two<00:02:08.470> pieces<00:02:08.649> together<00:02:08.920> it

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
by tying these two pieces together it

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.040 
by tying these two pieces together it
keeps<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.670> side<00:02:09.879> panels<00:02:10.300> of<00:02:10.539> the<00:02:10.569> jersey

keeps the side panels of the jersey

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.610 
keeps the side panels of the jersey
smooth<00:02:11.440> yet<00:02:12.310> still<00:02:12.700> gives<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.629> riders<00:02:13.989> access

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
to a pocket and a comfort break nature

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.940 
to a pocket and a comfort break nature
breaks<00:02:19.410> access<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:22.360> that<00:02:22.390> they<00:02:22.870> can<00:02:23.050> really

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
breaks access so that they can really

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.600 
breaks access so that they can really
perform<00:02:24.849> at<00:02:25.239> their<00:02:25.360> absolute<00:02:25.540> best<00:02:26.610> important

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
perform at their absolute best important

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.400 
perform at their absolute best important
is<00:02:27.790> that<00:02:27.819> it<00:02:28.120> fits<00:02:28.690> really<00:02:28.840> good<00:02:28.989> to<00:02:29.260> your<00:02:29.349> body

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
is that it fits really good to your body

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.920 
is that it fits really good to your body
that<00:02:29.800> it's<00:02:30.400> tight<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.599> don't<00:02:31.780> have

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
that it's tight and you don't have

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.410 
that it's tight and you don't have
flappy<00:02:32.379> clothes<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.970> that's<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.390> think

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
flappy clothes and that that's I think

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.800 
flappy clothes and that that's I think
the<00:02:34.660> important<00:02:35.110> thing

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810
