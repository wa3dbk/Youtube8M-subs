00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.820
 The tank of the regent 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.080
 with the six wave river plates so the 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.820
 be that both wet as 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.880
 and oily in a single container 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.950
 can work when they paint dry 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.740
 want to please fill the container 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.349
 with at least 500 grams with it 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.570
 The swirl arises evenly 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.390
 circulated and the goods again and again 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.910
 back to the knives brings to 10 15 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.650
 or 20 seconds you have out of rice book 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.140
 bite or other cereal mail 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.300
 made almonds go similarly fast 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.190
 how can you use it as a basis for one 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.170
 take wonderful cake ground by 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.299
 They still have to do with it if they do 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.860
 data and other oily things in this 

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:51.059
 have processed containers and they 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.949
 want to take that out 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.299
 then they should not do that with one 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.580
 do traditional spoon 

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:59.129
 possibly on the inner wall of the 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.650
 container scratch leaves you 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.290
 a silicone lever like this remo tool 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.140
 that you can purchase as an accessory 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.979
 This silicone spatula is exactly for 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.240
 the size of the republic's container 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.070
 They are processed to the ground 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.470
 you can see everything on the walls 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.110
 they can get everything out of the ground 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.570
 it stays as good as nothing and she 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.030
 but also enjoy the last gram of 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.590
 your nut or similar things the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.590
 they have just processed 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.380
 when you have finished the mixing process 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.540
 remove your food 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.310
 this plastic container will let you 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.370
 no food for a longer time 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.040
 time in your plastic container 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.110
 It is generally recommended food 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.050
 to store in glass containers over one 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.930
 longer time if you have the things 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:56.530
 they have shredded 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.900
 have the container with warm 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.750
 water they may issue a pot 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.540
 with glasses with it and clean the 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.790
 containers immediately during the months 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.340
 will be on the inside of the 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:13.120
 containers settle down 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.850
 quite simply with some citric acid and 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.790
 can dissolve hot water for this 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.890
 process you must contact the container 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.810
 fill two hot tablespoons of hot water 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.310
 Add citric acid and that at least 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.480
 a half to three quarters of an hour 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.090
 let it soak it with a 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:34.390
 cast out soft damp cloth again 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.049
 and thus the arrears of the 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.060
 puree glued to the walls 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.799
 replace 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.200
 please do not put this container in 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.080
 the dishwasher 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.280
 because the aggressive salts in the 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.230
 cleaning tabs one 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.230
 Dishwasher are able 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.720
 the camp of the 612 revo blades 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.680
 attack and do this over time 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.610
 to destroy 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.049
 In addition, the container would in the course of 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.110
 time always more opaque 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.690
 milky and you can avoid that 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.180
 Just by adding warm water and 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.810
 use a splash priel around 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.519
 then with a soft cloth 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.590
 to clean the container from the inside 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.519
 also the rest of the mix process too 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.519
 remove 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.220
 We are asked again and again 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.780
 whether it would be possible with the rewe plant 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.440
 to make a soup 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.570
 the answer is no if you want it euro 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.000
 delicious or professional 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.580
 then you want to downsize vegetables 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.830
 along with water tank and 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.790
 when the right consistency is achieved 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:50.120
 is the food in one 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.100
 cookpot and heat your soup up to 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.950
 Desired temperature you can only do it 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.230
 spice up or oil to do with 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.050
 the other way you give them 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.300
 Add food to the container 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.150
 add water and then leave the mixer 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.520
 run until the soup is hot 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.830
 that can become four or five 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.910
 take six minutes but then this is 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.890
 heated liquid 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:18.590
 only they buy oxidation as well 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.330
 by oxygen because the permanent 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.220
 rotation of the knife the heat 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.190
 always produces more 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.370
 Oxygen to your food so that 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:32.540
 the taste quality and the quality 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:35.960
 the ingredients suffers from this 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.540
 soup that they just mashed and then 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.700
 has heated in a saucepan the 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.380
 desired consistency and can with the 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.480
 right desired temperature too 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.580
 be prepared without being constantly 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.360
 oxygen is added and that 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.290
 promises a better a higher one 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.980
 Taste experience I wish you 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.980
 Enjoy your meal
