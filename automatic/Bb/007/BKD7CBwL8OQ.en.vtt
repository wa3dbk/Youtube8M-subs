 hello guys welcome to a new video 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.580
 today we are in a tutorial so 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.610
 say it and I'll show you how to install 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.730
 textures without blog launcher in a beta 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.460
 of minecraft and 0.12 not so we're going to 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.759
 start we need the minecraft apk 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.030
 and the texture that we are going to install in 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.250
 this case is the pixie texture that 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.470
 I'll give him a radio no, so let's go 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.980
 take the application we are going to give 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.420
 rename and here in apk we are going to put 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.350
 zip point 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:52.280
 we will give in ok and we will extract it 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:55.250
 over here to extract and then we go to this 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.070
 to decompress the texture let's see 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.650
 wait we are going to decompress the 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.100
 texture 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:08.009
 here we are going to extract here 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.009
 and well let's wait for it to finish 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.290
 well these two files no longer the 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:22.730
 we need we are going to erase them and we are going to 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:25.380
 go into the texture we're going to do and this 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:30.420
 we are going to copy it 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:33.750
 all this and we are going to give in copy and you 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.990
 let's go to minecraft access and let's go 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.270
 to paste here and we will apply to 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.140
 all overwrite and let's wait for 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.530
 that all the files are overwritten 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:50.240

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:53.690
 to go again and but that was nothing more 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.150
 let's copy this let's give copy and 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.170
 we are going to paste it here 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.170
 you have to use paste 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.060
 we are going to give you overwrite 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:13.240
 and already would be not now we are going to copy to 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:18.340
 catch all these and we're going to give 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.340
 compress we will give in ok 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.340
 we are going to wait for it to end 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.340
 when he finishes we will leave this file 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.920
 guys let's get it out here and now 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.269
 we are going to need this application that 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.819
 I'll leave you in the description so that 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.540
 download and we will give you the input 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.540
 over here 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.500
 let's go because I do not get 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.930
 and we are going to look for the folder where 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.720
 we have the texture where we leave the 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.690
 point zip I have it in textures let's go 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.050
 to look for it here is 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:09.260
 and here is not going to give here 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.650
 and we are going to wait for this 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.650
 load 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.940
 well you're done guys now let's go 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.600
 to go to 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.480
 where we have this here and we're going to 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.470
 have this new file that I made in zip 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:41.670
 signet we're going to give it in renaming and 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:44.640
 final we are going to put in apk 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.950
 let's give ready now let's go out to 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.569
 the main screen guys are we going to 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.330
 take the main graph and we're going to 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.890
 uninstall 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.890
 let's give in accept 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.940
 then we will install the other pk that is the 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.470
 that brings the texture 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.470
 let's go here 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.950
 and we will install it 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.000
 and next install and then it's that easy 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.910
 we would have the texture already installed in the 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.650
 minecraft without the need of a blog launcher 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.400
 since as we know we are in the 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.830
 turns 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.990
 there's no blog launcher yet so we have 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.690
 to access from this process to 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.040
 have them the texture we want here 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.419
 let's wait for them to finish 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.840
 install I do not know why this one has taken 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.840
 so much 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.419
 let's wait we're going to give it open and 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.280
 we are going to have the texture installed and 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.770
 working normally as if 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.430
 we had the blog launcher as they can 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.960
 see here we have the texture working 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:00.230
 let's wait I do not know why it's so 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:02.360
 slow for god but good let's go 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.440
 I do not know why they leave me 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.960
 I was doing well 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.750
 but good strange things that happen to you 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.050
 let's give cancel 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.610
 and well, we have this texture 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.990
 which is very very beautiful and it is also the 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.200
 first that has left for minecraft 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.970
 0.12 point zero guys so this 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.440
 it would be all guys I hope you have them 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.760
 liked if you did not understand me can 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.800
 roll back the video until I 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.260
 understand I know it's a bit difficult for 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.960
 some people but since they understand 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.710
 well it's easier not so this is 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.690
 all guys remember the texture and the the 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.340
 It is already modified with this texture 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.400
 I leave them in the description as well as 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:44.090
 the application to do to do everything 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:49.510
 this does not and so that would be all guys we 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:49.510
 we see in a next video good bye guys 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.880
 and me
