hello YouTube get outside and play here
well<00:00:10.309> I<00:00:10.400> got<00:00:10.550> my<00:00:10.670> biolite<00:00:11.450> stove<00:00:11.930> out<00:00:12.320> today

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
well I got my biolite stove out today

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.920 
well I got my biolite stove out today
because<00:00:13.730> I've<00:00:13.970> never<00:00:14.210> tried<00:00:14.450> it<00:00:14.600> with<00:00:14.720> wood

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:14.930 
because I've never tried it with wood

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.130 
because I've never tried it with wood
pellets<00:00:15.080> and<00:00:16.360> I'm<00:00:17.360> going<00:00:17.510> to<00:00:17.570> see<00:00:17.720> how<00:00:17.869> long

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
pellets and I'm going to see how long

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.030 
pellets and I'm going to see how long
one<00:00:18.860> hole<00:00:19.279> full<00:00:19.670> cup<00:00:19.939> or<00:00:20.599> one<00:00:21.020> hole<00:00:21.260> full<00:00:21.560> fire

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
chamber of wood pellets lasts typically

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.850 
chamber of wood pellets lasts typically
I<00:00:25.340> use<00:00:25.489> wood<00:00:26.000> like<00:00:26.210> this<00:00:26.239> this<00:00:27.200> is<00:00:27.410> just<00:00:27.680> some

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
I use wood like this this is just some

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.109 
I use wood like this this is just some
oak<00:00:28.130> I<00:00:28.489> split<00:00:29.450> them<00:00:29.739> roughly<00:00:30.790> four<00:00:31.790> inches

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
oak I split them roughly four inches

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.950 
oak I split them roughly four inches
long<00:00:32.390> and<00:00:32.780> yeah<00:00:33.739> half<00:00:34.340> an<00:00:34.520> inch<00:00:34.700> high<00:00:35.149> random

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
long and yeah half an inch high random

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.840 
long and yeah half an inch high random
sizes<00:00:36.470> to<00:00:36.649> change<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:37.040> heat<00:00:37.220> but<00:00:37.399> I<00:00:37.460> use<00:00:37.609> this

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
sizes to change the heat but I use this

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.920 
sizes to change the heat but I use this
for<00:00:38.289> cooking<00:00:39.289> bacon<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:40.489> everything<00:00:41.180> I<00:00:41.780> have

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
for cooking bacon and everything I have

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.500 
for cooking bacon and everything I have
the<00:00:42.050> grill<00:00:42.289> attachment<00:00:42.859> as<00:00:42.949> well<00:00:43.190> but<00:00:43.510> for

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
the grill attachment as well but for

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.060 
the grill attachment as well but for
this<00:00:44.600> experiment<00:00:45.050> we're<00:00:45.440> just<00:00:45.590> going<00:00:45.800> to<00:00:45.859> well

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
this experiment we're just going to well

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.310 
this experiment we're just going to well
just<00:00:46.969> let<00:00:47.149> this<00:00:47.329> burn<00:00:47.629> and<00:00:47.840> see<00:00:47.989> how<00:00:48.140> it<00:00:48.289> does

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
just let this burn and see how it does

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.450 
just let this burn and see how it does
I'm<00:00:49.309> using<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:49.789> included<00:00:50.120> bio<00:00:50.780> light<00:00:51.460> little

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
I'm using the included bio light little

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.160 
I'm using the included bio light little
fire<00:00:52.730> starter<00:00:52.879> just<00:00:53.420> a<00:00:53.510> piece<00:00:53.690> of<00:00:53.719> it<00:00:53.989> there

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
fire starter just a piece of it there

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.689 
fire starter just a piece of it there
and<00:00:54.320> hopefully<00:00:54.949> that's<00:00:55.129> enough<00:00:55.219> to<00:00:55.489> get<00:00:55.579> the

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
and hopefully that's enough to get the

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.910 
and hopefully that's enough to get the
wood<00:00:55.820> pellets<00:00:55.969> going<00:00:56.469> so<00:00:57.469> I'm<00:00:57.530> just<00:00:57.649> going<00:00:57.829> to

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
wood pellets going so I'm just going to

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.099 
wood pellets going so I'm just going to
let<00:00:58.039> it<00:00:58.070> run<00:00:58.309> on<00:00:58.370> low<00:00:58.730> speed<00:00:58.789> only<00:00:59.420> and<00:00:59.660> we'll

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
let it run on low speed only and we'll

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.290 
let it run on low speed only and we'll
see<00:01:00.559> how<00:01:00.649> long<00:01:00.710> it<00:01:01.010> takes<00:01:01.219> normally<00:01:01.910> for<00:01:02.089> me<00:01:02.120> to

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
see how long it takes normally for me to

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.720 
see how long it takes normally for me to
cook<00:01:02.420> a<00:01:02.539> pound<00:01:02.749> of<00:01:02.899> bacon<00:01:03.050> I<00:01:03.440> need<00:01:04.280> about<00:01:05.080> 15<00:01:06.080> or

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
cook a pound of bacon I need about 15 or

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.020 
cook a pound of bacon I need about 15 or
between<00:01:07.730> 15<00:01:08.300> and<00:01:08.330> 18<00:01:08.659> minutes<00:01:09.200> of<00:01:09.760> burn<00:01:10.760> time

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
between 15 and 18 minutes of burn time

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.240 
between 15 and 18 minutes of burn time
and<00:01:11.300> it<00:01:11.390> would<00:01:11.480> take<00:01:12.070> well<00:01:13.070> maybe<00:01:14.770> maybe<00:01:15.770> twice

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
and it would take well maybe maybe twice

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.680 
and it would take well maybe maybe twice
this<00:01:16.520> much<00:01:16.840> twice<00:01:17.840> this<00:01:18.050> much<00:01:18.260> wood<00:01:19.450> all<00:01:20.450> right

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
this much twice this much wood all right

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.130 
this much twice this much wood all right
well<00:01:21.080> I'm<00:01:21.230> going<00:01:21.380> to<00:01:21.410> get<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.620> fire<00:01:21.770> going<00:01:21.890> and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
well I'm going to get the fire going and

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.810 
well I'm going to get the fire going and
find<00:01:24.140> out<00:01:24.320> how<00:01:24.470> long<00:01:24.680> this<00:01:24.890> lasts<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:25.700> I'll

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
find out how long this lasts so I'll

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.260 
find out how long this lasts so I'll
check<00:01:26.060> back<00:01:27.550> alright<00:01:28.550> we're<00:01:28.730> about<00:01:28.760> five

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
check back alright we're about five

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.590 
check back alright we're about five
minutes<00:01:29.300> in<00:01:29.900> and<00:01:30.230> it's<00:01:30.260> just<00:01:31.090> barely<00:01:32.090> starting

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
minutes in and it's just barely starting

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.790 
minutes in and it's just barely starting
to<00:01:32.660> get<00:01:32.780> going<00:01:33.080> good<00:01:33.260> but<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:33.410> can<00:01:33.590> tell<00:01:33.710> you

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
to get going good but I can tell you

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.020 
to get going good but I can tell you
that<00:01:33.920> those<00:01:34.100> flames<00:01:34.580> are<00:01:34.880> hot<00:01:35.500> real<00:01:36.500> hot<00:01:36.590> and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
that those flames are hot real hot and

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.270 
that those flames are hot real hot and
it<00:01:38.030> started<00:01:38.540> up<00:01:38.630> with<00:01:38.810> virtually<00:01:39.320> no<00:01:39.560> smoke<00:01:39.980> so

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
it started up with virtually no smoke so

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.160 
it started up with virtually no smoke so
I<00:01:40.580> think<00:01:41.180> these<00:01:41.420> wood<00:01:41.630> pellets<00:01:41.900> are<00:01:41.990> going<00:01:42.110> to

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
I think these wood pellets are going to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.890 
I think these wood pellets are going to
last<00:01:42.320> a<00:01:42.470> very<00:01:42.500> long<00:01:42.830> time<00:01:43.010> now<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:44.510> reason<00:01:44.780> I'm

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
last a very long time now the reason I'm

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.960 
last a very long time now the reason I'm
doing<00:01:45.050> wood<00:01:45.320> pellets<00:01:45.650> is<00:01:45.800> because<00:01:46.010> I<00:01:46.250> mean<00:01:46.940> I

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
doing wood pellets is because I mean I

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.350 
doing wood pellets is because I mean I
do<00:01:47.870> hike<00:01:48.200> around<00:01:48.380> but<00:01:48.800> I<00:01:49.060> certainly<00:01:50.060> I<00:01:50.270> don't

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
do hike around but I certainly I don't

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.790 
do hike around but I certainly I don't
think<00:01:50.630> I'd<00:01:50.750> take<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.080> bio<00:01:51.260> lights<00:01:51.560> though

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
think I'd take the bio lights though

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.530 
think I'd take the bio lights though
first<00:01:52.130> of<00:01:52.250> all<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:52.430> weighs<00:01:52.580> two<00:01:52.610> pounds<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.450> if

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
first of all it weighs two pounds and if

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.280 
first of all it weighs two pounds and if
you're<00:01:53.660> going<00:01:53.780> to<00:01:53.840> bring<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.080> grill

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
you're going to bring the grill

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.810 
you're going to bring the grill
attachment<00:01:54.830> that's<00:01:55.070> like<00:01:55.280> another<00:01:55.580> two

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
attachment that's like another two

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.930 
attachment that's like another two
pounds<00:01:56.030> I<00:01:56.560> bought<00:01:57.560> one<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:57.770> those<00:01:57.950> Chinese

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
pounds I bought one of those Chinese

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.980 
pounds I bought one of those Chinese
knockoff<00:02:00.580> pocket<00:02:01.580> rockets<00:02:02.030> for<00:02:02.360> like<00:02:02.570> seven

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
knockoff pocket rockets for like seven

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.530 
knockoff pocket rockets for like seven

canister of fuel and everything fits in
the<00:02:07.250> pot<00:02:07.460> and<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:08.060> thing<00:02:08.269> works<00:02:08.450> great<00:02:08.840> so

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
on I was inside doing seven but I took a

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.600 
on I was inside doing seven but I took a
look<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:47.350> 20-minute<00:02:47.830> mark<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.220> it's<00:02:48.370> green

conductor<00:02:56.800> route<00:02:57.040> there<00:02:57.340> so

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
conductor route there so

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.750 
conductor route there so

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
switches off from green and power back

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.020 
switches off from green and power back
up<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.730> see<00:03:54.390> how<00:03:54.510> well<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:54.720> does<00:03:56.030> alright

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
but wood pellets Wow one five-gallon

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.160 
but wood pellets Wow one five-gallon
bucket<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.400> would<00:03:59.910> estimate<00:04:00.030> would<00:04:00.480> last<00:04:00.660> you<00:04:00.959> a

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
bucket I would estimate would last you a

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.690 
bucket I would estimate would last you a
month<00:04:02.180> for<00:04:03.180> more<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.860> you<00:04:04.860> could<00:04:04.980> cook<00:04:05.220> three

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
month for more and you could cook three

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.660 
month for more and you could cook three
meals<00:04:05.730> a<00:04:06.090> day<00:04:06.410> because<00:04:07.410> uh<00:04:07.440> once<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.519> get<00:04:08.640> a

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
meals a day because uh once you get a

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.009 
meals a day because uh once you get a
fire<00:04:08.850> going<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:09.180> really<00:04:09.209> doesn't<00:04:09.630> take<00:04:09.780> long

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
fire going it really doesn't take long

and<00:04:58.610> it<00:04:59.560> just<00:05:00.560> now<00:05:00.710> within<00:05:00.920> the<00:05:01.100> last<00:05:01.280> 30<00:05:01.490> 30

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
and it just now within the last 30 30

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
seconds went to the amber colored light

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.180 
seconds went to the amber colored light
which<00:05:05.570> means<00:05:05.840> it's<00:05:06.020> no<00:05:06.170> longer<00:05:06.380> charging<00:05:06.980> and

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
which means it's no longer charging and

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.130 
which means it's no longer charging and
in<00:05:07.600> the<00:05:08.600> 20<00:05:09.110> minutes<00:05:10.000> it's<00:05:11.000> been<00:05:11.270> it<00:05:11.600> charged

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
in the 20 minutes it's been it charged

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.380 
in the 20 minutes it's been it charged
5%<00:05:13.070> so<00:05:13.370> from<00:05:13.730> 83<00:05:14.270> to<00:05:14.570> 88<00:05:14.870> percent<00:05:15.170> that's<00:05:16.160> 5%<00:05:16.700> 20

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
5% so from 83 to 88 percent that's 5% 20

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.080 
5% so from 83 to 88 percent that's 5% 20
minutes<00:05:17.720> with<00:05:17.930> the<00:05:18.650> phone<00:05:18.890> powered<00:05:19.340> off<00:05:19.520> so

minutes with the phone powered off so

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.150 
minutes with the phone powered off so
really<00:05:21.050> that's<00:05:21.170> not<00:05:21.380> that<00:05:21.530> bad<00:05:21.710> considering

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
really that's not that bad considering

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.180 
really that's not that bad considering
one<00:05:22.430> load<00:05:22.640> of<00:05:23.020> things<00:05:24.020> burn<00:05:24.290> for<00:05:24.530> an<00:05:24.620> hour<00:05:24.740> so

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
one load of things burn for an hour so

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.480 
one load of things burn for an hour so
you<00:05:25.430> might<00:05:26.270> be<00:05:26.390> able<00:05:26.540> to<00:05:26.600> get<00:05:26.690> 20%<00:05:27.130> in<00:05:28.130> an<00:05:28.340> hour

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
you might be able to get 20% in an hour

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.420 
you might be able to get 20% in an hour
so<00:05:29.300> I<00:05:29.510> know<00:05:29.690> it's<00:05:29.930> not<00:05:30.050> a<00:05:30.110> high<00:05:30.590> speed<00:05:30.950> charger
