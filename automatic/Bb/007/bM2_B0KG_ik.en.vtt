hands at your size now this I'm talking

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.380 
hands at your size now this I'm talking
about<00:01:18.750> about<00:01:19.530> match<00:01:20.340> grip<00:01:20.670> now<00:01:20.880> or<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.180> could

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
about about match grip now or I could

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.960 
about about match grip now or I could
talk<00:01:21.479> about<00:01:21.540> traditional<00:01:22.290> grip<00:01:22.470> too<00:01:22.680> but<00:01:23.340> this

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
talk about traditional grip too but this

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.030 
talk about traditional grip too but this
is<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.299> way<00:01:24.420> where<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.960> put<00:01:25.140> your<00:01:25.320> hands<00:01:25.590> for

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
is the way where you put your hands for

match grip just put your hand up like

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.890 
match grip just put your hand up like
this

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
this

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.140 
this

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
hang it there neither like this they

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.109 
hang it there neither like this they
like<00:01:30.270> just<00:01:30.479> hanging<00:01:30.720> not<00:01:31.200> like<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:31.860> just

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
like just hanging not like this but just

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.020 
like just hanging not like this but just
that<00:01:33.119> little<00:01:33.390> Bowl<00:01:33.600> here<00:01:33.630> put<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:35.000> stick<00:01:36.000> in

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
that little Bowl here put the stick in

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.520 
that little Bowl here put the stick in
there<00:01:36.299> like<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.720> put<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.079> stake<00:01:37.290> other

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.420 

I'll<00:01:42.460> think<00:01:42.700> of<00:01:42.850> in<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.300> beginning<00:01:43.480> think<00:01:44.020> of

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
I'll think of in the beginning think of

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.280 
I'll think of in the beginning think of
holding<00:01:45.430> a<00:01:45.700> fledgling<00:01:45.970> bird<00:01:46.479> in<00:01:46.690> your<00:01:46.720> hand<00:01:46.870> a

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
holding a fledgling bird in your hand a

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.860 
holding a fledgling bird in your hand a
bird<00:01:47.890> that<00:01:48.100> that<00:01:48.340> would<00:01:48.880> escape<00:01:49.240> if<00:01:49.420> you<00:01:49.540> if

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
bird that that would escape if you if

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.890 
bird that that would escape if you if
you<00:01:50.050> let<00:01:50.229> it<00:01:50.410> let<00:01:50.740> it<00:01:50.940> fly<00:01:51.940> up<00:01:52.240> move<00:01:52.450> around<00:01:52.479> too

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
you let it let it fly up move around too

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.870 
you let it let it fly up move around too
much<00:01:53.110> but<00:01:53.380> you<00:01:53.830> don't<00:01:53.979> want<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.160> hurt<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:54.640> so

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
much but you don't want to hurt it so

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.340 
much but you don't want to hurt it so
you're<00:01:55.000> holding<00:01:55.180> a<00:01:55.420> stick<00:01:55.690> sort<00:01:55.960> of<00:01:56.050> like<00:01:56.140> that

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
you're holding a stick sort of like that

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.750 
you're holding a stick sort of like that
maybe<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:56.860> little<00:01:57.010> pinch<00:01:57.340> out<00:01:57.550> in<00:01:57.700> here<00:01:59.760> and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
maybe a little pinch out in here and

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.540 
maybe a little pinch out in here and
just<00:02:00.970> try<00:02:01.119> to<00:02:01.210> get<00:02:01.390> this<00:02:01.630> feeling<00:02:01.990> of<00:02:02.850> throwing

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
just try to get this feeling of throwing

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.100 
just try to get this feeling of throwing
so<00:02:06.550> one<00:02:06.700> of<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.880> ways<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.210> do<00:02:07.360> it<00:02:07.390> put<00:02:07.780> your<00:02:07.960> own

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
so one of the ways to do it put your own

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.540 
so one of the ways to do it put your own
triplet<00:02:08.530> like<00:02:08.679> this<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:11.140> so<00:02:12.070> that<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.370> molle

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
triplet like this and so that the molle

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.330 
triplet like this and so that the molle
didn't<00:02:12.880> let<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.090> do<00:02:13.240> this<00:02:13.390> molar<00:02:13.860> 1:24<00:02:14.860> for<00:02:15.310> a

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
didn't let you do this molar 1:24 for a

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.710 
didn't let you do this molar 1:24 for a
different<00:02:15.730> thing<00:02:15.910> he<00:02:16.060> went<00:02:16.239> right<00:02:16.420> from<00:02:16.630> the

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
different thing he went right from the

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.729 
different thing he went right from the
beginning<00:02:16.870> slow<00:02:17.940> but<00:02:18.940> I<00:02:19.060> kind<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.739> discarded

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
beginning slow but I kind of discarded

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.050 
beginning slow but I kind of discarded
that<00:02:20.770> for<00:02:21.070> a<00:02:21.100> while<00:02:21.280> in<00:02:21.400> fact<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.700> didn't<00:02:21.970> even

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
that for a while in fact I didn't even

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.080 
that for a while in fact I didn't even
do<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.930> big<00:02:23.230> thing<00:02:23.500> for<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.830> while<00:02:24.090> many

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
do it the big thing for a while many

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.940 
do it the big thing for a while many
years<00:02:25.360> ago<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.290> was<00:02:26.500> cheating<00:02:26.860> my

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
years ago and I so I was cheating my

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.370 
years ago and I so I was cheating my
students<00:02:27.370> so<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:27.940> went<00:02:28.090> back<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.480> open<00:02:28.720> mostly

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
students so I went back to open mostly

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.479 
students so I went back to open mostly
what<00:02:29.860> I'm<00:02:29.950> doing<00:02:30.250> now<00:02:30.459> I<00:02:32.220> see<00:02:33.220> what<00:02:33.340> they<00:02:33.430> can

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
what I'm doing now I see what they can

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.880 
what I'm doing now I see what they can
do<00:02:33.700> this<00:02:33.910> way<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:35.380> as<00:02:35.470> I<00:02:35.620> can't<00:02:35.890> do<00:02:36.100> it<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:37.890> go

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
do this way and as I can't do it I go

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.720 
do this way and as I can't do it I go
right<00:02:39.220> away<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.489> this<00:02:39.820> this<00:02:41.430> method<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.550> making

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
right away to this this method of making

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.570 
right away to this this method of making
every<00:02:43.570> motion<00:02:43.840> like<00:02:44.320> right<00:02:45.190> here<00:02:45.370> is<00:02:45.430> it

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
every motion like right here is it

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.150 
every motion like right here is it
here's<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.209> molar<00:02:46.420> downstroke<00:02:47.019> and<00:02:47.260> then<00:02:48.070> you

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
here's the molar downstroke and then you

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.310 
here's the molar downstroke and then you
fly<00:02:48.370> back<00:02:51.269> see<00:02:52.269> I'm<00:02:52.390> flying<00:02:52.690> back<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:52.959> I<00:02:53.140> don't

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
fly back see I'm flying back and I don't

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.910
