00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.870 
you know you could because everybody
knows<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.770> people<00:01:53.340> don't<00:01:53.460> really<00:01:53.610> talk<00:01:53.850> about

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
knows and people don't really talk about

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.850 
knows and people don't really talk about

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
two months they yeah black ops it did

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.380 
two months they yeah black ops it did
have<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.100> pretty<00:01:56.280> bad<00:01:56.549> lag<00:01:56.820> like<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.270> hit

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
have a pretty bad lag like the hit

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.139 
have a pretty bad lag like the hit
detection<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:58.259> was<00:01:58.680> not<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.100> great<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.729> was

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
detection it was not that great I was

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.880 
detection it was not that great I was
the<00:02:00.210> same<00:02:00.450> deal<00:02:00.720> with<00:02:00.899> what<00:02:01.079> i<00:02:01.110> wore<00:02:01.380> what<00:02:01.860> i

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
wore you know the connection wasn't that

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.310

great and you know what it kind of

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.509 
great and you know what it kind of
ruined<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.619> experience<00:02:07.830> for<00:02:08.039> people<00:02:08.160> but<00:02:08.459> for

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
ruined the experience for people but for

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.059 
ruined the experience for people but for
me<00:02:08.880> the<00:02:09.690> thing<00:02:09.720> i<00:02:10.110> was<00:02:10.259> always<00:02:10.440> good<00:02:10.830> that

me the thing i was always good that

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.860 
me the thing i was always good that
worked<00:02:11.250> out<00:02:11.400> for<00:02:11.459> me<00:02:11.640> was<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.120> maps<00:02:12.360> i<00:02:12.599> love

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
worked out for me was the maps i love

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.990 
worked out for me was the maps i love
the<00:02:13.019> way<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.230> match<00:02:13.500> play<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.860> out<00:02:14.099> you<00:02:14.819> know

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
the way the match play it out you know

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.229 
the way the match play it out you know
you<00:02:15.060> always<00:02:15.510> always<00:02:16.080> flank<00:02:16.590> routes<00:02:16.970> this<00:02:17.970> map

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
you always always flank routes this map

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.500 
you always always flank routes this map
right<00:02:18.480> here<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:19.019> reminds<00:02:19.590> me<00:02:19.709> too<00:02:19.920> much<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.160> a

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
right here it reminds me too much of a

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.270 
right here it reminds me too much of a
modern<00:02:21.510> warfare<00:02:21.660> 2<00:02:22.080> map<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.530> know<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.830> map<00:02:23.100> I

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
modern warfare 2 map you know that map I

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.280 
modern warfare 2 map you know that map I
think<00:02:23.549> was<00:02:23.670> called<00:02:23.880> rundown<00:02:24.360> where<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.170> had

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
think was called rundown where it had

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.960 
think was called rundown where it had
like<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.709> think<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:25.980> was<00:02:26.069> like<00:02:26.190> three<00:02:26.489> two<00:02:26.819> or

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
like I think it was like three two or

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.180 
like I think it was like three two or
three<00:02:27.209> bridges<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.560> can<00:02:28.739> run<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.040> gotta

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
three bridges that you can run you gotta

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.680 
three bridges that you can run you gotta
run<00:02:29.430> across<00:02:29.760> to<00:02:29.790> get<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.239> the<00:02:30.330> other<00:02:30.390> side<00:02:30.630> of

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
run across to get to the other side of

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.330 
run across to get to the other side of
the<00:02:30.810> map<00:02:31.019> I<00:02:31.200> didn't<00:02:31.440> like<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:32.040> notice

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
the map I didn't like that you notice

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.190 
the map I didn't like that you notice
and<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.850> that's<00:02:33.330> kind<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.540> like<00:02:33.630> how<00:02:33.810> this<00:02:33.989> map

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
and and that's kind of like how this map

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.110 
and and that's kind of like how this map
is<00:02:34.230> set<00:02:34.560> up<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.489> know<00:02:35.580> best<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:35.940> got<00:02:36.090> to

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
is set up and you know best you got to

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.550 
is set up and you know best you got to
kind<00:02:36.299> of<00:02:36.390> do<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.959> got<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.110> go<00:02:37.349> and<00:02:37.500> they

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
kind of do this you got to go and they

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.920 
kind of do this you got to go and they
spawn<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.430> work<00:02:38.580> them<00:02:38.760> out<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.569> that's<00:02:39.780> what

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
spawn and work them out and that's what

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.150 
spawn and work them out and that's what
I<00:02:39.989> do<00:02:40.049> but<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.890> think<00:02:41.040> that's<00:02:41.519> have<00:02:41.760> more<00:02:42.090> maps

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
I do but I think that's have more maps

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.710 
I do but I think that's have more maps
like<00:02:44.160> you<00:02:44.489> know<00:02:44.640> if<00:02:44.819> they<00:02:45.030> knew<00:02:45.269> that<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.510> say

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
like you know if they knew that I say

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.229 
like you know if they knew that I say
for<00:02:45.930> instance<00:02:46.049> I<00:02:46.410> fire<00:02:46.950> ranch<00:02:47.340> or<00:02:47.610> even<00:02:47.849> Afghan

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
for instance I fire ranch or even Afghan

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.390 
for instance I fire ranch or even Afghan
if<00:02:48.989> you<00:02:49.200> got<00:02:49.349> a<00:02:49.380> map<00:02:49.680> like<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.190> just

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
if you got a map like that just

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.190 
if you got a map like that just
reconstructed<00:02:51.330> by<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.510> can<00:02:51.840> reach<00:02:52.019> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
reconstructed by you can reach the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.560 
reconstructed by you can reach the
reconstruct<00:02:53.069> afghan<00:02:53.549> in<00:02:53.760> some<00:02:53.940> way<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.180> make

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
reconstruct afghan in some way to make

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.280 
reconstruct afghan in some way to make
it<00:02:54.630> in<00:02:55.019> a<00:02:55.709> city<00:02:56.070> or<00:02:56.340> make<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.239> in<00:02:57.359> a<00:02:57.450> park<00:02:57.810> you

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
it in a city or make it in a park you

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.199 
it in a city or make it in a park you
know<00:02:58.440> what<00:02:58.560> I'm<00:02:58.620> saying<00:02:58.920> like<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.760> can<00:02:59.970> still

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
know what I'm saying like it can still

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.140 
know what I'm saying like it can still
have<00:03:00.359> the<00:03:00.450> same<00:03:00.660> way<00:03:00.900> out<00:03:01.109> maybe<00:03:01.470> add<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.739> few

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
have the same way out maybe add a few

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.009 
have the same way out maybe add a few
textures<00:03:03.150> here<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.510> there<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.690> couple

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
textures here and there a couple

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.530 
textures here and there a couple
buildings<00:03:04.350> here<00:03:04.799> a<00:03:04.829> couple<00:03:05.160> little<00:03:05.940> cuts<00:03:06.269> here

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
buildings here a couple little cuts here

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.000 
buildings here a couple little cuts here
and<00:03:06.660> there<00:03:06.810> add<00:03:07.079> some<00:03:07.440> new<00:03:07.590> shit<00:03:07.829> of<00:03:07.980> course

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
and there add some new shit of course

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.280 
and there add some new shit of course
make<00:03:08.489> it<00:03:08.609> look<00:03:08.790> different<00:03:08.970> but<00:03:09.660> keep<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.079> same

make it look different but keep the same

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.410 
make it look different but keep the same
way<00:03:10.560> out<00:03:10.769> you<00:03:11.040> know<00:03:11.190> what<00:03:11.280> I'm<00:03:11.340> saying<00:03:11.609> no

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
way out you know what I'm saying no

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.949 
way out you know what I'm saying no
people<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:13.549> don't<00:03:14.549> know<00:03:14.670> what<00:03:14.970> are<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.780> way<00:03:15.930> I

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
people I don't know what are the way I

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.809 
people I don't know what are the way I
just<00:03:16.290> feel<00:03:16.500> right<00:03:16.709> now<00:03:16.920> let<00:03:17.519> me<00:03:17.549> know<00:03:17.640> what

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
just feel right now let me know what

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.580 
just feel right now let me know what
y'all<00:03:18.060> think<00:03:18.329> do<00:03:18.510> y'all<00:03:18.660> think<00:03:18.959> like<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.200> lot<00:03:19.530> of

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
y'all think do y'all think like a lot of

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.890 
y'all think do y'all think like a lot of
the<00:03:19.709> reason<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.190> people<00:03:20.430> not<00:03:20.730> filling<00:03:21.120> black

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
the reason that people not filling black

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.539 
the reason that people not filling black
ops<00:03:22.139> 2<00:03:22.319> it's<00:03:22.470> cuz<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.829> maps<00:03:23.069> I<00:03:23.280> think

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
much 66 just I don't know 66 just cuz

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.290 
much 66 just I don't know 66 just cuz
you<00:04:36.710> know<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:36.950> way<00:04:37.070> this<00:04:37.220> game<00:04:37.460> roll<00:04:37.760> out<00:04:38.000> man

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
you know the way this game roll out man

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.450 
you know the way this game roll out man
and<00:04:38.540> it<00:04:38.630> seemed<00:04:38.840> like<00:04:38.870> that's<00:04:39.860> another<00:04:40.250> big

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
and it seemed like that's another big

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.340 
and it seemed like that's another big
reason<00:04:40.700> why<00:04:40.850> I<00:04:40.940> really<00:04:41.390> playground<00:04:41.930> one<00:04:42.110> here

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
reason why I really playground one here

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.250 
reason why I really playground one here
is<00:04:42.440> because<00:04:42.590> when<00:04:42.950> I<00:04:43.010> playing<00:04:43.280> 66<00:04:44.080> it's<00:04:45.080> like

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
is because when I playing 66 it's like

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.960 
is because when I playing 66 it's like
I'm<00:04:45.380> playing<00:04:45.500> for<00:04:45.860> verse<00:04:46.070> 4<00:04:46.400> you<00:04:46.669> know<00:04:46.820> the

saying 3 verse 3 I want to play a real 6

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.670 
saying 3 verse 3 I want to play a real 6
verse<00:04:49.580> 6<00:04:49.910> because<00:04:50.810> then<00:04:51.020> when<00:04:51.169> people<00:04:51.470> leave
