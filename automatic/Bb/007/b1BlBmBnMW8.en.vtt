00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.329
 let's start cutting in a 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.250
 cardboard a square with our 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.710

 get internet and you'll move on to the 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.040
 red cloth, look at this for the face 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.149
 reverse and the molds you also have to 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.149
 get it out this way 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.450
 Now place your squares and the 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.790
 letters for that you have to have 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.250
 past already taught the edges so that 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.570
 has been that he does not vote for those experts and 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.570
 you will stick it with silicone 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.030
 since you have pasted all your letters 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.060
 let's start sewing by joining faces 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.430
 tion as studying the horita and you will 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.840
 begin to know about here you can 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.330
 do it also with a machine if it is 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.330
 you have but in this case I will do it by hand 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.810
 When you finish sewing it will stay like that 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.759
 and now we are going to do the same with the 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.150
 next letter and do all the 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.100
 letters 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.100
 while the faces and sewing 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.890
 and when it's over, only the 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.890
 What is it 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.630
 when I'm closed once 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.569
 square will be to start putting what 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.910
 which are two squares that will go first 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.480
 in the base first with which the base goes 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.750
 with your photo around 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.550
 and now if you know the square that will go in 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.320
 The top 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.990
 when you have finished giving the first 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.230
 back in the next round you go to 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.190
 take your tape and the base fold and you go 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.910
 to put in here leaving these tabs 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.910
 and the mass things 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.650
 now if you are going to know these faces that 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.410
 are missing leaving open this for 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.830
 to be able to turn around and put what is 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.830
 filling 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.140
 in this case I am using this type 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.970
 filling but you do not have this 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.290
 filling you can use our ribbon 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.860
 fabric that you have left of your 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.860
 jobs 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.450
 when you have finished filling 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.120
 Now let's close that hole to 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.260
 double is towards the inside and the 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.260
 small stitches 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:26.069
 now help yourself with your jewelery pieces 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.069
 to hang what is to see 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.660
 and girls ready is this how we stayed 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.330
 you do not want to use it as a keychain 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.730
 you can also use what are those 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.400
 pieces to hang on what is the 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.860
 glass or you can make it bigger as 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.440
 This her for decoration use 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.090
 a printed fabric to combine and the 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.210

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.080
