build<00:00:25.500> process<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.310> kind<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.609> bummed<00:00:26.789> out

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
build process and kind of bummed out

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.310 
build process and kind of bummed out
about<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.359> because<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.750> think<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:28.019> turned<00:00:28.199> out

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
about that because I think it turned out

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.679 
about that because I think it turned out
pretty<00:00:28.500> well<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.769> mean<00:00:28.980> take<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> look<00:00:29.480> this<00:00:30.480> is

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
pretty well I mean take a look this is

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.530 
pretty well I mean take a look this is
the<00:00:31.349> gun<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.769> finished<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.399> took<00:00:32.759> about<00:00:32.880> 20

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
the gun that I finished it took about 20

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.569 
the gun that I finished it took about 20
minutes<00:00:33.870> or<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.829> lot<00:00:35.070> faster<00:00:35.250> than<00:00:35.520> I

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
minutes or so a lot faster than I

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.970 
minutes or so a lot faster than I
actually<00:00:35.700> thought<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.120> would<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.980> more

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
actually thought it would and more

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.950 
actually thought it would and more
importantly<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.640> really<00:00:39.180> like<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.540> how<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
importantly I really like the how the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.750 
importantly I really like the how the
handle<00:00:40.559> came<00:00:40.710> out<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.250> guy<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.430> think<00:00:41.700> it

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
handle came out to this guy I think it

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.520 
handle came out to this guy I think it
looks<00:00:41.910> pretty<00:00:42.000> nice<00:00:42.390> as<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.320> see<00:00:43.500> right

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
looks pretty nice as you can see right

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.549 
looks pretty nice as you can see right

not not a pro yet but trying to work it
anyway<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.539> decided<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:52.110> since<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.680> didn't

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
anyway I decided that since I didn't

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.560 
anyway I decided that since I didn't
record<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.610> even<00:00:54.149> though<00:00:54.239> i<00:00:54.270> had<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
record it even though i had the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.330 
record it even though i had the
recording<00:00:55.020> program<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.590> which<00:00:55.980> doesn't<00:00:56.280> make

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
recording program on which doesn't make

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.639 
recording program on which doesn't make
any<00:00:56.520> sense<00:00:56.699> right<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.480> was<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.559> just

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
any sense right like it was on and just

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.889 
any sense right like it was on and just
didn't<00:00:58.980> record<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.609> decided<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.629> would<00:01:00.750> be<00:01:00.809> a

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
didn't record I decided this would be a

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.229 
didn't record I decided this would be a
good<00:01:01.050> opportunity<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.680> do<00:01:02.010> another<00:01:02.250> contest

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
cool and for some weird reason I built

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.310 
cool and for some weird reason I built
it<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.100> don't<00:01:56.280> know<00:01:56.340> if<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.610> see<00:01:57.290> but<00:01:58.290> I
