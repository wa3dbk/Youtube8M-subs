00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.880
 don't always have to work 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.799
 modern equipment and when leaving 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.900
 new operating systems are not always 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.510
 It turns out to find a driver for the device 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.939
 because a manufacturer company can 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.250
 stop releasing drivers for new ones 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.439
 operating systems and in this situation 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.340
 it only remains to get rid of 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.070
 equipment 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.540
 but who will like it so in this 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.090
 lesson let's consider an example of a situation 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.640
 which I recently encountered in 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.640
 organizations have a xerox phaser printer 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.640
 3210 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.670
 but since I put the seven everywhere 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.100
 I need to install for it 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.280
 the driver under the seven in this case 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.549
 seven 64-bit but on the official 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.280
 The site says that for this printer 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:03.750
 there are drivers only for windows 2000 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.400
 in English I tried them 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.290
 substituted but nothing worked out 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.810
 would 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.210
 the system says that the driver data is not 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.909
 Fit for my operating system 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.550
 not one hour I studied this topic in 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.070
 Internet but no sense so 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.619
 there was no one we recommend the driver and 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.509
 manipulations did not help and here I am 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.000
 stumbled upon an article about 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.759
 that that is an analog of the printer is 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.360
 samsung ml-2015 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:37.050
 and for him there are drivers for windows 7 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.000
 32 and 64 bit 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.039
 therefore, an idea appeared to sign the data 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.310
 drivers 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:48.220
 but usually we install drivers 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.170
 happens according to the following scenario we 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.319
 go into computer management and 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.080
 device manager and in this case 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.909
 I have a printer connected to this and 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.399
 showing that there is a device but it 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.700
 not recognized and what we are doing next 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:08.610
 go to the properties of this device 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:11.459
 driver and update here automatically 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.829
 windows cannot detect drivers for 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.720
 this device is therefore necessary 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.500
 select search drivers on this 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.769
 computer 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.800
 and here we indicate where are stored 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:28.740
 My driver is stored on disk e 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:35.530
 hooked 5 driver and here there is 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:36.860
 drivers for 64 bit system 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.810
 so here 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.400
 tick nested subfolders 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.530
 go ahead but again it says 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.750
 that there are no drivers for this device 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.870
 as they are meant for another 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.400
 devices so let's go 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:57.320
 in a different way also go to update 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.490
 search for drivers and select 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:05.090
 driver from the list of already installed 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.860
 further as my case I need 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.990
 set up a printer here i choose 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.120
 printer printers 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:19.180
 go ahead and here we have 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:21.460
 drivers that are in the seven in this 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.160
 I have a copy machine and my model 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.950
 there is no why we are going to install with 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.120
 disk and manually 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.120
 write the driver file 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.710
 for this device 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.710
 so 64-bit that's samsung one 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.550
 this driver is called 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:50.120
 we choose the driver 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:52.549
 further up to install and so 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.989
 completed driver installation for this 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:59.269
 devices so click close and let's 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.019
 try to update our devices and 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:07.360
 as you see here we no longer have 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:10.579
 identified devices go further this 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.840
 control panel to see our 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:17.090
 printers so devices and printers and here 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.579
 this very printer appeared and now 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.440
 let's try to print something 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.440
 let's say this page 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.020
 so page 1 print 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:45.060
 and here I have everything perfectly printed 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.820
 it means the drivers work this way 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.780
 we can manually subscribe drivers for 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.160
 devices 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.300
 you look some and fit 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.740
 validity of the same series or 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.440
 similar equipment 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.330
 so let's say as the last option if 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.770
 it will not work then you can carry 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.770
 devices to landfill
