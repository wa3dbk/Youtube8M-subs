00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
you're going to do kind of a

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.590 
you're going to do kind of a
loop-de-loop<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.500> little<00:00:52.739> bit<00:00:52.860> as<00:00:53.010> well

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
loop-de-loop in a little bit as well

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.389 
loop-de-loop in a little bit as well
doing<00:00:54.600> those<00:00:54.930> it's<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.800> require<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.370> to

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399

doing those it's going to require you to
maintain<00:00:57.030> speed<00:00:57.270> otherwise<00:00:57.840> you'll<00:00:58.079> fall

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
maintain speed otherwise you'll fall

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.500 
maintain speed otherwise you'll fall
backwards<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> first<00:00:59.699> couple<00:01:00.090> laps

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
backwards now the first couple laps

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.510 
backwards now the first couple laps
they're<00:01:01.379> not<00:01:01.500> too<00:01:01.739> difficult<00:01:01.949> especially

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
they're not too difficult especially

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.880 
they're not too difficult especially
this<00:01:02.910> section<00:01:03.270> here<00:01:03.449> there's<00:01:03.660> no<00:01:03.809> traps<00:01:04.229> this

this section here there's no traps this
is<00:01:05.070> where<00:01:05.220> you're<00:01:05.339> kind<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.549> doing<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
is where you're kind of doing the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.780 
is where you're kind of doing the
loop-d-loop<00:01:06.740> that's<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:08.040> it's<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.430> little<00:01:08.549> bit

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
loop-d-loop that's a it's a little bit

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.960 
loop-d-loop that's a it's a little bit
more<00:01:08.970> tricky<00:01:09.240> in<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.130> second<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.310> third<00:01:11.610> lap

there's the final section here again

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.700 
there's the final section here again
just<00:01:14.700> use<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.420> circle<00:01:15.780> button<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.200> raise<00:01:16.350> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
just use the circle button to raise and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.679 
just use the circle button to raise and
lower<00:01:16.770> these<00:01:17.400> blockades<00:01:18.390> here<00:01:19.369> and<00:01:20.689> then

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
lower these blockades here and then

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.840 
lower these blockades here and then
we're<00:01:22.080> starting<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.770> number<00:01:23.220> two<00:01:23.369> now<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.729> is

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
we're starting on number two now this is

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.600 
we're starting on number two now this is
the<00:01:24.030> final<00:01:24.330> Riddler<00:01:24.990> trial<00:01:25.380> prior<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the final Riddler trial prior to the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.109 
the final Riddler trial prior to the
final<00:01:27.060> exam<00:01:27.650> so<00:01:28.650> we'll<00:01:29.009> we'll<00:01:29.520> do<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.880> cover

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
final exam so we'll we'll do that cover

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.260 
final exam so we'll we'll do that cover
that<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.570> another<00:01:30.780> video<00:01:31.759> so<00:01:32.759> we're<00:01:32.880> going<00:01:32.970> in

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
that in another video so we're going in

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.240 
that in another video so we're going in
the<00:01:33.390> center<00:01:33.689> here<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.110> you're<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> see

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the center here and you're going to see

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.770 
the center here and you're going to see
there's<00:01:35.460> going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.640> be<00:01:35.729> considerably<00:01:36.420> more

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
there's going to be considerably more

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.990 
there's going to be considerably more
the<00:01:37.079> traps<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.640> you're<00:01:38.790> going<00:01:38.970> to

accidentally at the button twice but

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.130 
accidentally at the button twice but
again<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> little<00:01:56.790> extra<00:01:57.030> time<00:01:57.270> on

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
again you have a little extra time on

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.560 
again you have a little extra time on
the<00:01:58.320> third<00:01:58.560> lap<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:59.159> think<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.820> finished<00:02:00.210> with<00:02:00.509> a

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
the third lap I think I finished with a

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.440 
the third lap I think I finished with a
little<00:02:01.049> under<00:02:01.619> 10<00:02:01.860> seconds<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.820> know<00:02:03.030> it

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
little under 10 seconds but I know it

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.730 
little under 10 seconds but I know it
was<00:02:03.600> my<00:02:03.719> second<00:02:04.110> attempt<00:02:04.469> my<00:02:04.619> first<00:02:04.860> one<00:02:05.100> I

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
was my second attempt my first one I

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.650 
was my second attempt my first one I
ran<00:02:05.979> out<00:02:06.009> of<00:02:06.189> time<00:02:06.460> so<00:02:09.060> here<00:02:10.060> this<00:02:10.390> section

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
ran out of time so here this section

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.000 
ran out of time so here this section
here<00:02:10.869> in<00:02:10.989> the<00:02:11.050> loop-d-loop<00:02:11.319> make<00:02:11.739> sure<00:02:11.890> you

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010

controlling the traps now so they're

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.699 
controlling the traps now so they're
going<00:02:45.850> to<00:02:45.940> move<00:02:46.060> much<00:02:46.510> more<00:02:46.720> feverishly<00:02:47.380> and

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
now this wall section here can be a

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.670 
now this wall section here can be a
little<00:02:57.730> tricky<00:02:58.090> as<00:02:58.209> well<00:02:58.450> you're<00:02:59.440> going<00:02:59.560> to
