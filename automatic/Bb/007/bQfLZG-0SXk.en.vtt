one<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.590> jump<00:01:53.679> in<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:53.950> firefight<00:01:54.250> because<00:01:55.240> Ken's

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
one to jump in a firefight because Ken's

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.590 
one to jump in a firefight because Ken's
fireball<00:01:56.049> has<00:01:56.200> so<00:01:56.590> much<00:01:56.740> worse<00:01:56.979> recovery<00:01:57.600> well

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
fireball has so much worse recovery well

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.179 
fireball has so much worse recovery well
the<00:01:58.689> scan<00:01:58.899> hasn't<00:01:59.259> DP'd<00:01:59.500> a<00:01:59.619> single<00:01:59.890> jump<00:02:00.070> in

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
the scan hasn't DP'd a single jump in

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.279 
the scan hasn't DP'd a single jump in
yet<00:02:00.369> so<00:02:01.119> he's<00:02:01.299> shown<00:02:01.539> that<00:02:01.569> it's<00:02:02.080> safe<00:02:02.319> to<00:02:02.470> jump

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
yet so he's shown that it's safe to jump

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.149 
yet so he's shown that it's safe to jump
should<00:02:05.289> have<00:02:05.380> been<00:02:05.470> a<00:02:05.500> hurricane<00:02:05.799> kick<00:02:05.979> their
