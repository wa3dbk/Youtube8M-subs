00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
listen beyond the fact that this an

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.220 
listen beyond the fact that this an
invisible<00:00:21.150> in<00:00:21.300> audience<00:00:21.779> there<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.050> have<00:00:22.199> no

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.310 
hit detection or anything more
importantly<00:00:24.840> though<00:00:25.640> with<00:00:26.640> him<00:00:26.789> being<00:00:26.939> there

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
importantly though with him being there

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.019 
importantly though with him being there
we<00:00:28.320> can't<00:00:28.590> get<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.980> him<00:00:29.130> this<00:00:29.670> will<00:00:29.820> triple

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
we can't get to him this will triple

you'll see shortly he's trying to attack
or<00:00:56.489> trying<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.910> get<00:00:57.149> food<00:00:57.420> into<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> edge<00:00:57.960> of

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
or trying to get food into the edge of

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.920 
or trying to get food into the edge of
the<00:00:58.980> wing<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.340> he<00:00:59.820> will<00:01:00.180> be<00:01:00.270> able<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.570> climb

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
the wing and he will be able to climb

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.680 
the wing and he will be able to climb
that<00:01:01.320> edge<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.980> hemel<00:01:02.280> self<00:01:02.520> meaning<00:01:03.030> that

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
that edge of the hemel self meaning that

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.230 
that edge of the hemel self meaning that
all<00:01:03.750> sides<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> cell<00:01:05.159> are<00:01:05.369> still<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> same

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
all sides of the cell are still the same

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.760 
all sides of the cell are still the same
like<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.570> old<00:01:06.720> days<00:01:06.869> we<00:01:07.080> could<00:01:07.320> go<00:01:07.470> around<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
like the old days we could go around the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.560 
like the old days we could go around the
edge<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:07.950> climb<00:01:08.310> at<00:01:08.430> any<00:01:08.580> point<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.060> climb<00:01:09.420> up

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
edge and climb at any point and climb up

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.620 
edge and climb at any point and climb up
which<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.560> good<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.790> means<00:01:12.030> they<00:01:12.270> never<00:01:12.479> took

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
which is good it means they never took

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.929 
which is good it means they never took
it<00:01:12.810> out<00:01:12.930> they<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.140> either<00:01:13.560> made<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.580> cell

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
it out they just either made that cell

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.270 
it out they just either made that cell
I've<00:01:15.180> tiny<00:01:15.659> bit<00:01:16.020> bigger<00:01:16.259> or<00:01:17.150> the<00:01:19.280> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
I've tiny bit bigger or the the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.719 
I've tiny bit bigger or the the
barricade<00:01:20.880> was<00:01:21.479> made<00:01:21.689> smaller<00:01:22.430> one<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
barricade was made smaller one of the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.550 
barricade was made smaller one of the
other<00:01:23.909> take<00:01:24.420> your<00:01:24.570> pick<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:24.930> what<00:01:25.080> one<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.409> is

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
other take your pick on what one that is

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.740 
other take your pick on what one that is
I<00:01:25.770> probably<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.970> ring<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.420> smaller

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
I probably because the ring is smaller

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.950 
I probably because the ring is smaller
I'd<00:01:28.470> assume<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> barricades<00:01:29.490> are<00:01:29.610> smaller

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
I'd assume the barricades are smaller

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.770 
I'd assume the barricades are smaller
that<00:01:30.960> would<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.290> my<00:01:31.560> hunch<00:01:31.979> but<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:33.030> don't<00:01:33.570> tell

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
that would be my hunch but I don't tell

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.359 
that would be my hunch but I don't tell
dimensions<00:01:34.530> I<00:01:35.150> just<00:01:36.150> really<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.780> don't<00:01:36.960> know

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
dimensions I just really just don't know

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.219 
dimensions I just really just don't know
what<00:01:38.369> do<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.549> think<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:39.600> was<00:01:39.810> not<00:01:40.110> about

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
what do you think this was not about

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.170 
what do you think this was not about
much<00:01:40.590> but<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.920> was<00:01:41.040> 20<00:01:41.310> minutes<00:01:41.340> long<00:01:41.820> even

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
much but it was 20 minutes long even

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.219 
much but it was 20 minutes long even
though<00:01:42.270> those<00:01:42.420> people<00:01:42.780> running<00:01:43.020> away<00:01:43.200> and

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
though those people running away and

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.510 
though those people running away and
everything<00:01:43.680> like<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.860> from<00:01:44.130> time<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.460> time

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
everything like that from time to time

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.550 
everything like that from time to time
we<00:01:45.180> were<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> bit<00:01:45.479> perplexed<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.020> happened<00:01:46.470> as

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
we were a bit perplexed that happened as

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.870 
we were a bit perplexed that happened as
well<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.009> were<00:01:47.130> trying<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.369> replicate<00:01:47.520> it

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
well so we were trying to replicate it

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.490 
well so we were trying to replicate it
hence<00:01:48.060> why<00:01:48.240> he<00:01:48.390> tried<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.689> fly<00:01:49.049> off<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
hence why he tried to fly off and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.880 
hence why he tried to fly off and
suddenly<00:01:50.869> not<00:01:51.869> froze<00:01:52.200> but<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:52.740> had

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
suddenly not froze but just had

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.760 
suddenly not froze but just had
