00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.690
 the study of the pulse is generally considered a complicated star 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.949
 plenty of suture tendon present 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.019
 it must be explored in a rational way taking into account that on the dosage side we have 6 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:19.839
 electric wires poles 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.019
 the first chain is composed 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.019
 from the long abductor and the extension of the thumb 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.869
 that arise 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.479
 coupled by side by side 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:34.830
 outside we find the club extender 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.390
 outside we find the long doctor 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.970
 of the thumb 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.970
 + medially the short extender 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.789
 and they are 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:48.800
 contained in a single sheath 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.560
 often it is possible to identify a small meniscus that distinguishes two 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.650
 loggias 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.650
 we continue distally 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.960
 they head towards the first finger 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.780
 in longitudinal scanning it is easier to follow the insertion of the tendon 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.510
 coming back soon 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.500
 and going medially one meets the second chain 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.780
 that occupied 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.140
 from the extensor fingers and from the short radial extensor carpus inside 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.140
 long radial extender on the outside 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.980
 we see the two tendons 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.980
 contained in the mar in the same sheath 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.690
 we divide distally the tendons diverge 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.690
 slightly to go to the level of the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.630
 carpal region and this is the longitudinal scan 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.600
 with in the listing 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.600
 exterior 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.650
 and the interior 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.610
 returning on average and in the near future 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.610
 we meet the bergolo side of lister 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.019
 tubercle of lister extensor tendon proper of the thumb 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.789
 extender of the thumb left in the shower identified by the 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:19.049
 lister tubercle crosses the radial extensor of the carpus 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.349
 heading more laterally 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.859
 and going 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.589
 to the base 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:29.899
 in the first metacarpal 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.899
 from which it will then head to 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.509
 first finger 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:37.169
 to fit in 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:39.959
 at the distal phalanx 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.859
 here are the short extensor 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.100
 and here we are at the 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.889
 distal phalanx 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:51.009
 with the insertion on the dorsal side of the distal phalanx 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:55.889
 let's retrace the path 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.979
 reviewing our long thumb extender 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.159
 that brings us back to correspondence 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:06.119
 of the third cde 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.089
 on the outside 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:10.889
 of the third filia 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.439
 there is the fourth supply chain occupied by a series of tendons 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.959
 el common extender of fingers and the extension of the index
