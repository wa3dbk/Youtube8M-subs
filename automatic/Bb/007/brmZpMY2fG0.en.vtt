00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.120
 in principle this is nothing else 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.580
 a formula 1 tests one uses the 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.560
 It irritates you and that's what it is 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.510
 an interesting situation for me to 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.790
 then again to give a impulse 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.790
 and to share my view of the things 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.340
 intelligent drive is our vision 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.660
 from accident-free driving and our way 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.660
 go to the autonomous driving 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.810
 we take the distance now 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.160
 controller 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.990
 Here I have the opportunity 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.800
 with this speed limit 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.540
 adjust 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.980
 I do not always need that 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.150
 slow down and accelerate 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.150
 but it is taken over 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.090
 and so decides between zero and 60 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.910
 the car if we follow the lines 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.170
 shape or whether he is behind the car 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.170
 drive even if there is no line 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.730
 Michael Schumacher as a very 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.940
 experienced racer rates ours 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.430
 systems he pay input once from the 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.990
 view of a profi driver and tries 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.790
 but we may also associate with it 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.470
 the normal customer with one 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.270
 appropriate situation 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.450
 and so provides us with very valuable 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.450
 hints 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.640
 because at that time also small nuances 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.980
 determined where the system 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.180
 reacts differently and it already 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:51.290
 very unusual with which 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.030
 precision such a system works then 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.700
 does one have a good discussion are ours 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.230
 Construction too late at the moment 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.210
 We did not think earlier 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.350
 but when we were in the situation then 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.330
 have shown again and together 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.960
 are driven and rather on 23 everything 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.680
 has tried with the book still goes 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.680
 had forgiven our system 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:16.269
 when you clear yourself up 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.530
 must of that is that 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.599
 driver assistance systems no patronage 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.780
 are but in principle 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:26.629
 us all including more of ours 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.099
 Help performance are in the moment where we are 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.530
 fail to respond 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.430
 are they for us help us and me 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:38.290
 only but also our fellow men the 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.290
 say good from the end of June
