00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
can bring the goals are definitely very

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.860 
can bring the goals are definitely very
important<00:01:00.280> to<00:01:00.430> like<00:01:00.699> if<00:01:00.910> i<00:01:01.239> get<00:01:01.420> a<00:01:01.449> referral

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
important to like if i get a referral

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.290 
important to like if i get a referral
for<00:01:02.350> someone<00:01:03.280> who's<00:01:03.579> in<00:01:03.760> a<00:01:03.850> lot<00:01:04.000> of<00:01:04.119> pain

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:04.300 
for someone who's in a lot of pain

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.420 
for someone who's in a lot of pain
versus<00:01:04.930> someone<00:01:05.170> who<00:01:05.379> needs<00:01:05.590> some<00:01:06.040> social

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
versus someone who needs some social

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.160 
versus someone who needs some social
stimulation<00:01:06.759> but<00:01:07.270> it's<00:01:07.750> going<00:01:07.930> to<00:01:07.990> be<00:01:08.140> very

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
stimulation but it's going to be very

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.020 
stimulation but it's going to be very
different<00:01:08.590> than<00:01:08.830> materials<00:01:09.369> that<00:01:09.550> i<00:01:09.610> bring<00:01:09.789> in

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
different than materials that i bring in

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.210 
different than materials that i bring in
and<00:01:10.330> i<00:01:10.630> also<00:01:10.780> think<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.200> diagnosis<00:01:11.830> is<00:01:11.979> very

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
and i also think the diagnosis is very

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.279 
and i also think the diagnosis is very
important<00:01:12.729> because<00:01:12.850> sometimes<00:01:13.479> that<00:01:13.810> means

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
important because sometimes that means

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:15.900 
important because sometimes that means
that<00:01:14.590> maybe<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.950> patient<00:01:15.310> has<00:01:15.430> a<00:01:15.460> limited

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
that maybe the patient has a limited

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.880 
that maybe the patient has a limited
range<00:01:16.119> of<00:01:16.479> motion<00:01:16.750> or<00:01:17.440> movement

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.649 

there's<00:01:20.580> definitely<00:01:20.940> materials<00:01:21.450> available

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
there's definitely materials available

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.310 
there's definitely materials available
for<00:01:22.140> drawing<00:01:22.409> painting<00:01:22.950> there's<00:01:23.880> clay<00:01:24.330> I

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
for drawing painting there's clay I

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.350 
for drawing painting there's clay I

best<00:01:27.390> friend<00:01:27.659> because<00:01:28.110> i<00:01:28.140> think<00:01:28.290> that's<00:01:28.619> a

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
best friend because i think that's a
