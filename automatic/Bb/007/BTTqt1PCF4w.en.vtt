dodgeball<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:05.220> guess<00:01:05.550> so<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.780> that

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
dodgeball I guess so it's just that

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.600 
dodgeball I guess so it's just that
makes<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.230> lot<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.440> different<00:01:07.620> stuff<00:01:07.980> I'm

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
