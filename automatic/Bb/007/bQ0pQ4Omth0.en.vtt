with a very heavy practice treatment

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.600 
with a very heavy practice treatment
let's<00:01:00.930> try<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.140> one<00:01:01.350> first

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.060 

okay<00:01:08.610> I'm<00:01:08.790> gonna<00:01:09.030> use<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:10.290> same<00:01:10.530> amount<00:01:10.740> of

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
okay I'm gonna use the same amount of

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.630 
okay I'm gonna use the same amount of
pressure<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:12.479> bow<00:01:12.630> I'll<00:01:12.900> try<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:14.250> won't<00:01:14.490> be

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
pressure the bow I'll try it won't be

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:29.760 
pressure the bow I'll try it won't be
the<00:01:14.820> same

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:02:01.120 

this<00:01:56.830> is<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:57.950> difference<00:01:58.370> I<00:01:59.650> heard<00:02:00.650> only

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
this is the difference I heard only

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.680 
this is the difference I heard only
thing<00:02:01.750> well<00:02:02.750> they're<00:02:02.930> just<00:02:03.170> about<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.500> same

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
thing well they're just about the same

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.220 
thing well they're just about the same
to<00:02:05.690> be<00:02:05.720> honest<00:02:06.110> I<00:02:06.470> personally<00:02:06.920> think<00:02:07.810> this<00:02:08.810> one

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:09.230 
to be honest I personally think this one

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:14.770 
to be honest I personally think this one
is<00:02:09.260> only<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:10.640> little<00:02:11.090> bit<00:02:11.890> more<00:02:12.890> higher<00:02:13.780> than

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
is only a little bit more higher than

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.580 
is only a little bit more higher than
that<00:02:15.140> one<00:02:15.410> with<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.460> practice<00:02:16.850> boot<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:20.590> and
