"Speaker 1: My name is Lauren Wallner and
we're here at the University of Michigan in

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.360
the Department of Medicine.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.810
I am a faculty member in the CanSORT group,
which is a Cancer Surveillance Outcomes and

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.860
Research focused group of investigators.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.149
Well, I grew up in New Jersey and also here
in Michigan.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.969
I was a pretty curious kid by nature and I
think my parents really supported that and

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:47.260
were always giving us opportunities to learn
about new things and travel and really foster

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.260
that.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.180
I was really always sort of interested in
medicine and health in general and particularly

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.199
had a fascination with diseases and why they
happen and what happens once you get them,

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.610
so I decided to go to the University of Michigan
for my undergraduate training.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.420
I was pre-med initially and I thought that
I wanted to be a physician, and it was really

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.880
during this time that I was exposed to the
disciple of public health and the idea that

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.030
you could improve health on a population level
and actually affect more people than you would

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.159
by being a physician potentially.

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.000
I then went on to get a PhD in epidemiology.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.549
My work really blends both epidemiology and
public health with medicine, so the majority

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.310
of my research focuses on trying to improve
care for both breast and prostate cancer patients.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.189
What I try to do is build the science to understand
patient's care and support needs while they're

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:45.399
going through treatment and after in the survivorship
period.

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.439
I design and analyze and run research studies
of patients with cancer.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.590
Okay, so one of the studies we have going
in the field right now is a large survey study

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.670
of women with breast cancer.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.500
We're currently sending survey packets to
over 5,000 women asking them a variety of

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.840
questions about their treatment experience,
how they made their decisions for treatment

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.420
for breast cancer, a lot of questions about
the care that they're receiving and so on.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.150
In order to disseminate our information from
our research findings, what we normally do

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.200
is we publish in medical journals, we present
at meetings that are with other clinicians

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.270
and oncologists who treat cancer patients.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.120
a system where it could populate information
where it would be added to a personalized

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.820
or tailored survivorship care plan.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.790
One new avenue actually that we're using quite
a bit now is social media, so most of the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.420
faculty in our group have an active presence
on Twitter.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.720
We're engaging with patients that way as well.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.070
We also are developing some pretty cool tools
where clinicians can access information online

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.700
to get what they need to help better care
for their patients.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.430
We're doing the same for patients, so we developed
web-based tools where patients can get information

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.650
to help them make better cancer treatment
decisions or understand what they need to

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.510
do after treatment to keep up with their care
needs.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.070
The cancer group in general is a very dynamic
bunch of investigators.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:13.290
We are all very, very passionate about what
we do.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.760
We all come from different backgrounds, so
I'm actually the only epidemiologist on the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.720
team, and with that I bring the training that
comes along with that, and so we have weekly

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.380
team science meetings where we get together
in a room and we talk about the science and

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.940
we talk about designing the science, carrying
out the science, the details of it, but really

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.250
it's an avenue to bring together ideas from
people of various backgrounds and try to improve

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.720
upon those ideas.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.870
We definitely have a regular interaction where
we try to problem-solve things and come up

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.690
with solutions for what we're facing, as well
as really trying to, again, generate those

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.950
unique ideas and those unique research questions
that will ultimately make a difference in

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:08.430
cancer patient's lives.
