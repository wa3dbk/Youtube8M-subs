00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.250
 cobismo is an artistic movement 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.740
 that breaks the structure of art 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.080
 traditional arises at the beginning of the century 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.670
 20 after the investigations carried out 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.459
 done by painters like picasso paintings 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.410
 georges black or juan gris the term 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.990
 Cubism was adopted in a derogatory way 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.900
 by the French critic louis bout cels 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.810
 who referred to the painting as formed 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.609
 by small cubes is a movement that 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.859
 gives rise to the rest of avant-garde 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.359
 20th century European painters 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.670
 cubists realize that the 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.039
 photography can offer in a way 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.649
 realistic what until then 

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:41.350
 made the painting both the portrait 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.600
 how the character can be represented 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.270
 in a reliable way and without losing detail 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.829
 by the photographer so the painting has 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.710
 lost one of his traditional papers 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.420
 and must adapt to try the 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.980
 representation of what the 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.980
 photography can not offer 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.290
 The main characteristics of 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.090
 Cubism are the following in a box 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.980
 traditional Renaissance period or 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.160
 baroque we find three dimensions 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.070
 high width and deep the pictures 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.360
 Cubists eliminate the third dimension 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.310
 advancing the background to the foreground of 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.140
 way that the objects that appear in 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.270
 foreground are confused with those who 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.130
 find the background of the image 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.050
 photography can only offer us a 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.210
 point of view depending on the plane 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.490
 from where the picture is taken 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.380
 cubist decomposes the figure in a way 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.050
 that offers us different points of view 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.729
 of the same image ie in a 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.009
 face we can see the eyes 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.140
 placed in different positions or the 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.360
 skin with different shades of light because 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.550
 each of those parts would be taken 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.830
 from a different point of view and with 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.140
 a different light exists a great 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.360
 influence of primitive art on everything 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.430
 African the schematism and the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.950
 simplicity in the lines of composition 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.259
 very few geometric strokes are those that 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.420
 make up a figure is another of the 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.430
 distinctive elements some of the 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.450
 Faces of the work give a feeling of 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.450
 wear a
