is<00:03:53.359> a<00:03:53.479> USB<00:03:53.780> microphone<00:03:54.109> but<00:03:54.739> let<00:03:54.889> me<00:03:55.009> explain

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
is a USB microphone but let me explain

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.460 
is a USB microphone but let me explain
since<00:03:56.359> the<00:03:56.509> microphone<00:03:56.930> has<00:03:57.139> a<00:03:57.199> polar

since the microphone has a polar

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
cardioid pattern it still does pick up

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.899 
cardioid pattern it still does pick up
