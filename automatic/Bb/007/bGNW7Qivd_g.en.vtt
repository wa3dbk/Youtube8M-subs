00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
doesn't look like it should be that hard

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.740 
doesn't look like it should be that hard
and<00:00:40.100> I've<00:00:40.190> watched<00:00:40.489> other<00:00:40.700> people<00:00:40.789> do<00:00:41.210> it<00:00:41.239> with

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
and I've watched other people do it with

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.860 
and I've watched other people do it with
no<00:00:41.780> issues<00:00:42.590> but<00:00:42.980> for<00:00:43.969> some<00:00:44.180> reason<00:00:44.539> this<00:00:44.660> one

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
no issues but for some reason this one

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.770 
no issues but for some reason this one
just<00:00:45.050> really<00:00:46.000> got<00:00:47.000> me<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:47.480> I<00:00:48.079> think<00:00:48.559> it's<00:00:48.920> just

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
just really got me and I think it's just

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.600 
just really got me and I think it's just
being<00:00:50.780> able<00:00:51.050> to<00:00:51.379> see<00:00:51.829> where<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:52.100> coins<00:00:52.399> are

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
being able to see where the coins are

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.910 
being able to see where the coins are
and<00:00:52.940> jump<00:00:53.329> in<00:00:53.480> time<00:00:53.719> to<00:00:53.960> get<00:00:54.079> them<00:00:54.260> before<00:00:54.559> the

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
and jump in time to get them before the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.680 
and jump in time to get them before the
platform<00:00:55.129> moves<00:00:55.670> because<00:00:56.120> once<00:00:56.570> the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
platform moves because once the

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.770 
platform moves because once the
platforms<00:00:57.199> are<00:00:57.260> gone<00:00:58.090> then<00:00:59.090> you<00:00:59.420> don't<00:00:59.600> have<00:00:59.660> a

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
platforms are gone then you don't have a

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.509 
platforms are gone then you don't have a
chance<00:01:00.020> to<00:01:00.260> get<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.500> coins<00:01:00.739> again<00:01:00.980> and<00:01:01.309> if<00:01:01.430> you

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
chance to get the coins again and if you

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.069 
chance to get the coins again and if you
get<00:01:01.640> to<00:01:01.850> the<00:01:01.969> end<00:01:02.120> and<00:01:02.420> you<00:01:02.539> don't<00:01:02.690> have<00:01:02.840> all<00:01:03.050> of

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
get to the end and you don't have all of

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.840 
get to the end and you don't have all of
them<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.379> little<00:01:03.590> robot<00:01:03.920> do<00:01:04.100> kills<00:01:04.460> you<00:01:04.610> it
