00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 and then Brazil long ago personal 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.700
 ask a video of my things setup 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.170
 which I use to record video then today 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.809
 I was able to finish my setup. 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.820
 finally after months and this is the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.429
 video for you to start 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.770
 note Swiss looks like an ordinary computer 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.070
 it's not even paying attention anymore now I 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.760
 I come from this side number 1 headset I 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.320
 I come from this side headset number two 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.070
 front handles 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.439
 luÃ­s number 1 light number 2 to low 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.210
 monitor pulls back turns the camera on 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.820
 we have done khan 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.329
 this from here and here we have our setup 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.969
 Recording has just been recorded 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.760
 turn off camera saves headset 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.739
 number saves the headset number 2 we have 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.660
 back to our normal setup and the best 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.510
 share how many children you see 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.000
 How many children are you watching, magic? 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.649
 miracle of the wires is actually everything 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.910
 hidden down here 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.980
 Sensational load but now talking. 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.489
 seriously my concept for these stage 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.570
 here it is clean and also 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.400
 so I do not have many 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.140
 things here have no son not going 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.490
 have distraction and can do a lot 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.920
 of thing you have not seen anything yet 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.020
 and if hence the first thing secret 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.909
 all 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.200
 cables here I have both headsets 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.090
 they get the cable wrapped here 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.280
 below and here I have my 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.049
 capture because the public my 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.759
 The signal coming from the video game goes 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.500
 for this plate as for another one here 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.450
 record a reserve signal and I also 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.310
 I can connect directly to the computer that has 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.900
 a usb cable connected in them I was going to ask 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.460
 Something also saw her and what 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.200
 obviously you are seeing that my 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.780
 monitor is supported by an arm 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.610
 articulated and also my camera is 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.740
 on top of that thing that 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.320
 table and it's kind of like a tripod that does not have 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.270
 three feet that have no foot at all 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.189
 feel at first then now people 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.409
 is on the ground and if there is the setap de 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.810
 console, do not live, right, I know. 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.159
 I know that this is my ps4 from issue 10 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.630
 nor is he white because when I 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.399
 I arrived in Canada that was the one he 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.170
 was selling that he formed 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.969
 whole stage agreement and this is mine. 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.070
 The second console I got now 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.960
 that's a white ps3 so not from here 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.910
 It manufactures but I've been waiting in the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.950
 internet yesterday the tone until you find a 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.930
 that I could buy legal from ps3 is 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.800
 that it is on the white base also 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.480
 this basis 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.980
 was not made in the West, I had to 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.600
 ask of Japan because here only came the 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.060
 black and deep down is the most important 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.790
 Come with me, that's mine. 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.650
 Dear friends is a suite of hdmi is a 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.110
 in which I connect all my 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.910
 positive hdmi and it identifies which 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.350
 that is on to know which signal 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.730
 what he has to send to the 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.190
 capture and for the computer monitor 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.230
 demonstration time also works 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.510
 so ps4 control connects ps4 to 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.660
 People come here to change the input the ps4 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.990
 is on the screen is not there to give it okay 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.940
 it if we want to record the ps4 back 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:57.900
 to the pc screen open the software 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:59.820
 capture are recording you can put 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.860
 The whole screen is too, but this is not the 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.720
 best part and if we want to record 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.600
 and it 's at this time that we have to 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.470
 come here and we'll come and 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.840
 West of that clothes is in the hands of us 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.340
 take this cable by the government and ask for your 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.300
 time we're recording sensational ipad myself 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:27.450
 I do not know 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:28.950
 look this back the ps4 came back 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.870
 The only problem is that this is what 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.820
 that door must remain open whenever 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.770
 have a connected console but does not give the 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.230
 This is my computer's circulation . 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.730
 also known as a refrigerator but 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.100
 When I open it here they say that he 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.810
 It looks more like an air conditioner than 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.310
 information about it over other 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.720
 things of my being captain in the 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.310
 description it was a computer 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.650
 primarily intended for editing 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.390
 obviously it 's good for the game too 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.430
 as I do not bring so much triple play 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.600
 play on my channel the thing that is 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.930
 more important for me is to achieve 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.520
 dictate fast and it does it at the greatest 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.260
 sometimes I found it but it was 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.000
 tornado buyer and it was made 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.680
 to be silent because I have to 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.780
 record the voice while I play 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.220
 so it has so far a switch that I 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.769
 I can control the speed of the 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.660
 fans and put it according to 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.660
 with the need for silence that I 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.060
 need organization of yarn organization 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.010
 here has a line filter here 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.810
 a coming hdmi signal duplicator 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.880
 of the switch it sends a capture card 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.770
 on a monitor and this from here my board 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.270
 My cat's main catch is 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.270
 sakine horse 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.160
 and I think this is my setar that 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.690
 hence it was no attempt to expose 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.310
 the things that I really have of mine 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.259
 try this because there is a whole 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.720
 culture and youtube gringo of people who 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:42.000
 does exactly that share videos 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.650
 of cetaceans that have what only helps 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.810
 other people who are thinking of 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.220
 do the same thing because to put together a 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.560
 these are not simply 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.300
 go out and buy things there is a field 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.770
 knowledge that you have to have a 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.750
 so much research you have to do 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.759
 to find what you need for 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.370
 example that belly that holds the 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:01.770
 My lamp, she was not made for it. 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.139
 Yeah, I need something like that. 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.090
 I went to research what I had on the market that 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.280
 could work that way then those 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.289
 types of video work basically for 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.090
 This will see that there is someone who needs 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.680
 And now you've seen how the 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.900
 stretch does this is kinda like a 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.520
 analogy I already did I draw wave with 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.500
 any of these things here is the 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.300
 same thing a taxi driver throws wave 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.280
 with a taxi that has not my friend you 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.630
 do not have that cab because you can 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.789
 there's why you need it for your 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.229
 work relationship here is basically the 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.270
 same but I hope you have 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.520
 This video does not go away without 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.020
 leave your young man's 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.000
 I like you rate this video 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.979
 positively because it is very important 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.690
 You asked to bring the video here. 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:41.250
 from my setup I finally brought that 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.319
 now it's complete it was only 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.819
 waiting for playstation 3 that was 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:46.979
 searching the internet for so long 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:49.349
 until you find one with tracy used here 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:51.300
 so it's complete and here's such a video 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.380
 you sign up for the channel if you guys 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.819
 are not registered yet I think I 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.819
 see you at the next champions
