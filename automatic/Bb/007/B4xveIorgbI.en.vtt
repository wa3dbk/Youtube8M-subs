00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.059
 beautiful to all the boys today we are here 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.010
 with a new video tutorial and how you have it 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:55.949
 already seen before 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:59.830
 this is a small a small farm 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:03.640
 automatic cooking animals of 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.259
 pork and jade as you have seen 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.560
 at the beginning of the video I will now do it 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:16.330
 see how to build it 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:22.030
 then it is very simple to dig a 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:27.190
 tube down as you want it to 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:38.340
 length and then we lowered there 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:41.140
 we lower by eight then 237 and then 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.259
 we see 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.259
 and we do here and we also remove here 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:22.360
 ok after doing it after digging 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:29.530
 this false and at the second cube we dig 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:37.150
 of two on this side and this one 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:41.950
 peep data and take not a piston 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:56.010
 normal but a sticky piston 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:03:00.430
 let's put it this way then 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:05.290
 we take the earth and we put it there 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:08.349
 in front so that then they will close 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:15.100
 this step not showing 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:15.489
 this bug or so here is the wall of 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:22.690
 land 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:29.440
 here is the piston and from here to the third 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:31.769
 cube and we dig a tube just a cube to the 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.769
 below 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.810
 we also match it from 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:43.510
 this other part 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:46.540
 ok so how and why is the wall here 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:54.400
 land the piston here and we should 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:04:00.030
 put the red son ok after putting the 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:09.340
 red star we put a repeater here is a 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:12.580
 ok now and we have to put the signs for 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.510
 put the rava and then cook the 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:23.340
 so the meat that fell here is the earth 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:28.290
 here the pisone which the lava will go to here 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.290
 so here we put all the signs 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:50.070
 in this way here on this other side 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:50.070
 yes ok ok let's put the lava like this 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:07.870
 ok ok para pace is not really para non 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:11.500
 knows nothing however to be precise 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.479
 so then here on this side can go 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.250
 it is good here that it is the same 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:21.130
 here we put another verse to say of 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:27.389
 cubic blood of orcia pienza that will do 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:31.660
 close and then the lever will go to the front 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:34.710
 this one when we will activate and fall 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:39.460
 the pigs and then close them again 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:42.699
 bring us back in there so small 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.760
 try I did that little house that 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:49.000
 then you will make you embellish I have to like 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:53.710
 you want and we put the best friend i 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:59.919
 pigs in and before starting 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:08.289
 we should dig a passage that 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:10.870
 bring from the pig okay ok 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:12.910
 here has brought us here at least so 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.990
 we go down and take the meat already 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:22.960
 cooked and you're done 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:29.760
 activate pigs fall close and 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:29.760
 when we go down we will have the cooked meat 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:37.900
 without wasting coal and various stuff e 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:43.979
 very useful indeed I have here to report 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:43.979
 the pigs inside next to this dome 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:51.940
 here is the pit and next he made us 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:54.760
 this small fence where I will put in 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:58.210
 I will bring back those pigs I have redone 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.040
 I will redo it reproduce and then I will bring them 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:06.940
 in here 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:10.590
 with carrots and then activate ee 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:14.230
 they will fall and we will have this cooked meat 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:17.440
 well guys if the viasat video useful and 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:21.210
 you enjoyed signing up and putting me 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.210
 like the next beautiful
