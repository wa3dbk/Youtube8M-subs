00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 after the extremely important collection 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.040
 commemorative and historical 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.240
 let's go to the clinical exam itself 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.360
 it's very simple it has to stay 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.289
 extremely schooly with three parts 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.609
 main inspection the eyes the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.010
 palpation hands and auscultation 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.500
 the ears these three times have to 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.150
 be made in this order there inspection 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.390
 first of all with elements 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.540
 extremely important as for example 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.829
 the examination of the respiratory curve 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.570
 the examination of the respiratory curve is 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.610
 something capital is often 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.850
 very underestimated will allow to 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.860
 to detect a dyspnea at rest to know 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.950
 if it is inspiratory or 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.879
 expiratory so rather obstructive or 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.520
 restrictive 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.860
 we already have there determinants 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.570
 which in many cases you 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.969
 be much more important than the 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.260
 complementary exams a very element 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.469
 important right away in 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.660
 the inspection and look at the curve 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.720
 how does this dog breathe 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.000
 totally terrorized breathes it's 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.560
 easy just follow the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.439
 thoracic movements 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.680
 here there is no disney nor 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.180
 inspiratory or expiratory there is even 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.619
 not the other sign 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.119
 panic 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.830
 what is the font is thermal 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.850
 so we can say that this curve 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.880
 respiratory is normal the characters 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.770
 to just as easily listen to it in 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.680
 live on a dog that goes all and on 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.700
 the table are decisive for example 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.960
 a chronic bronchitis cough is going to be 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.960
 particularly strong 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.299
 but wet a cough of collapse 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.939
 tracheal will be particularly strong 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.780
 and dries one both like lung 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.430
 cardiogenic is going to be small and wet 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.930
 it's a caricature there are 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.270
 intermediate criteria but nevertheless 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.850
 already these elements there we allow you 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.670
 to steer very seriously is your 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.340
 diagnosis and in priority the examinations 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.570
 on the table of 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.009
 consultation 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.320
 and always about this inspection 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.630
 the behavior of the dog is also 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.470
 very important there you can judge a 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.140
 dog certainly 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.790
 frightened he's shaking but he's calm this 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.030
 is not an edgy chronic 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.950
 this chronic annoyance is still going 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.780
 to be an aggravating factor especially for 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.130
 the frequency of coughing the examination of 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.070
 blues is also important 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.740
 actually like for any exams from 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.250
 internal medicine the mucous membranes are going 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.280
 to be able to show anemia on the contrary 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.880
 congestion or possibly even 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.530
 blue mucous membranes of cyanosis in a 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.600
 number of very heart disease 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.970
 specific 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.470
 the second part is the palpation 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.150
 it's also a very important time 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.489
 and unfortunately also 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.470
 underestimate this palpation must 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:59.790
 start with a very shock palpation 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.280
 cordial left and there the intensity of this 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.350
 shock very cordial heart rate 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.450
 heart rate can already be 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.280
 estimated even before the stethoscope 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.690
 but what is very important is 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.190
 compare this palpation of shock very 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.170
 cordial to a second palpation 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.070
 simultaneous which is the palpation of the 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.070
 femoral pulse 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.910
 and there you have almost a 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.880
 electrocardiograph in the hands in 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.890
 effect if there is a discrepancy 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.450
 important to know a frequency of 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.980
 much more cordial shock much higher 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.530
 that the frequency of the femoral pulse 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.690
 with so what is called a deficit 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.660
 pulsatile is that there is a disorder of 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.519
 major rhythm that will tell you that 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.579
 complementary number 1 examination 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.100
 realized is an electrocardiogram before 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:43.110
 the other complementary exams two 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.060
 other elements of the palpation are 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.420
 important palpation of the trachea 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.760
 cervical which can prove 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:54.930
 perfectly flaccid soft and triggered 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.000
 an intense cough giving you 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.590
 at once 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.780
 the main etiology of cough at 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.850
 these small breed dogs 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.739
 the second element of palpation that 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.560
 can be important too 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.170
 and do what we call in 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.920
 pressing the mucous membranes including the 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.170
 mucous 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.079
 gingival a filling time 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.320
 capillary that will give you an idea 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.900
 of the power of the heart pump and 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.240
 especially of his weakness if this time of 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.639
 Capillary filling exceeds 3 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.220
 second one goes by pressure on the 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.830
 oral mucosa calculated in second the 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.370
 recolouration time of this mucosa 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.860
 mouth 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.250
 once you have pressed it must 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.630
 normally board from white to pink 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.330
 less than 3 seconds 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.800
 unless the heart pump is impaired 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.780
 this is the case in cardiomyopathy 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.180
 dilated for example where this time of re 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.919
 hair coloring will be superior 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.050
 at 30 seconds it is extremely simple 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.900
 and that already gives you the solution before 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.419
 even echocardiography afterwards so 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.930
 eyes and hands are the ears to 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:02.639
 to know the auscultation the auscultation is 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.889
 both heart and respiratory 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.419
 cardiac auscultation she has to 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.350
 always have the same order 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:13.729
 we must therefore to the cardiac auscultation 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:17.789
 detected the frequency the rhythm 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:20.640
 the intensity of the noises of the noises on 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.039
 added and analysis of the breaths in 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.880
 this cardiac auscultation 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:25.080
 the auscultation of the breaths is 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.210
 certainly the most important element 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.250
 it is the one who will bring a 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.950
 Semiological precision sometimes 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.450
 capital this auscultation must 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.010
 stay dynamic 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.650
 that is, the stethoscope is not 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.350
 not frozen he will walk on the thorax 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.740
 on the left but also on the right 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:46.620
 he must go to the level to pÃ©cs hey he 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.410
 must go to the cranial level at the level 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.070
 dorsal at the medial thoracic level 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.890
 each of these areas corresponds to a 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:58.500
 particular entity and so it takes 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.240
 absolutely maintain his stethoscope in 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.460
 movement constantly so as to 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.550
 analyze the breath criteria your 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.979
 stethoscope must constantly move 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:12.990
 on the dog's thorax firstly to 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:16.139
 left but not just on the area to 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.740
 yen we must go back to the area 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:20.380
 cranial 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:22.539
 to go back to the dorsal area for the 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:26.080
 arterial duct blows and even located 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:28.599
 under the scapula on the left and especially very 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:31.240
 often neglected we must not forget 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:32.800
 to listen to the right there are breaths 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.870
 as the breath of inadequacy 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.419
 tricuspid where the breaths of 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:39.340
 internal communication in tribe the air that 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:42.990
 do not agree to the right and not to 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:45.849
 left is a dynamic exam 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.639
 here is the detail of the tunes of this cult to 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:51.370
 heart rate in the dog imagine 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:54.099
 so in this little medio line a choir 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.669
 which is located at 45 degrees in the 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:57.669
 thorax 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:07:00.099
 you have a first of auscultation 

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:02.050
 is sure the shock to pecs it's air 

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:05.500
 to yen it's the era of the valve 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:08.560
 mitral if you go back slightly to 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:11.800
 middle of the chest German kranj you 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.240
 are going to look like auscultation of 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.630
 the aortic valve 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.550
 if on the contrary you go down belly 

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:20.620
 German but more and more kranj 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.690
 German in the third space you 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.930
 are going to look like this cult to sion of 

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:28.960
 the pulmonary valve finally left 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.039
 going up soulas four places that 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.860
 everyone neglect 

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:35.139
 you are going to have very fat no German 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.360
 is very dorsal in the air 

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:38.560
 auscultation of the canal breath 

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.880
 arterial 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.139
 it's not over that's 

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.930
 auscultation on the left 

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:46.180
 you will take your dog 

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:48.909
 auscultation right and there you have 

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:51.370
 two important tunes one that is located 

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:53.500
 under the right elbow that looks like this 

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:56.620
 worship at the tributary valve tribe speed 

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:59.380
 and you have an era that is medio located 

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:01.900
 thoracic right they look 

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:05.620
 of this cult to communications 

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:07.389
 inter ventricular this is for the 

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.219
 main areas of scanning in the 

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:12.009
 dog this distribution in space 

00:08:09.219 --> 00:08:13.990
 is extremely accurate much more 

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:16.530
 that in the feline species is so full 

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.530
 lessons
