quick on this this is the Sputnik you

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.369 
quick on this this is the Sputnik you
know<00:00:44.430> has<00:00:44.670> your<00:00:45.110> resistor<00:00:46.110> values<00:00:47.120> 5<00:00:48.120> 10<00:00:48.539> 15<00:00:49.110> 20

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
know has your resistor values 5 10 15 20

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.220 
know has your resistor values 5 10 15 20
and<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.460> got<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.789> normal<00:00:51.300> 0<00:00:51.510> which<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.020> over

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
and it's got the normal 0 which is over

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.770 
and it's got the normal 0 which is over
here<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.800> then<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> unlock<00:00:53.610> then<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.539> would

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
here and then the unlock then you would

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.750 
here and then the unlock then you would
slide<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.230> back<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.559> normal<00:00:55.949> once<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.579> was<00:00:56.670> on

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
slide it back to normal once it was on

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.689 
slide it back to normal once it was on
the<00:00:56.879> drive<00:00:57.680> you<00:00:58.680> know<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.070> really<00:00:59.460> easy

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
the drive you know this is really easy

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.799 
the drive you know this is really easy
to<00:01:00.000> install<00:01:00.800> just<00:01:01.800> solder<00:01:02.609> here<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:03.690> and

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
to install just solder here here and

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.140 
to install just solder here here and
there<00:01:04.350> that's<00:01:05.250> really<00:01:05.489> all<00:01:05.580> there<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:06.119> it

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
you have to cut the trace right here the

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.140 
you have to cut the trace right here the
very<00:01:09.659> easy<00:01:09.930> cuts<00:01:10.200> really<00:01:10.860> big<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.820> cut

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
very easy cuts really big if you can cut

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.490 
very easy cuts really big if you can cut
the<00:01:12.750> traces<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:14.150> non<00:01:15.150> series<00:01:15.630> liteon<00:01:16.080> drive

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the traces on a non series liteon drive

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.300 
the traces on a non series liteon drive
from<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.850> fat<00:01:18.210> consoles<00:01:18.830> this<00:01:19.830> right<00:01:20.070> here

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
from the fat consoles this right here

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.310 
from the fat consoles this right here
nothing<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.330> really<00:01:22.430> easy<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.670> do<00:01:23.850> and

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
nothing to it really easy to do and

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
nothing to it really easy to do and
works<00:01:25.320> pretty<00:01:25.740> good<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.369> think<00:01:27.060> they<00:01:27.270> are<00:01:27.299> eight

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
works pretty good I think they are eight

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.149 
works pretty good I think they are eight
dollars<00:01:29.340> right<00:01:29.549> now<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:30.000> X<00:01:30.299> consoles<00:01:31.159> don't

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
dollars right now on X consoles don't

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.760 
dollars right now on X consoles don't
quote<00:01:32.340> me<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.640> price<00:01:33.140> since<00:01:34.140> what<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.439> think

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
quote me on the price since what I think

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.330 
quote me on the price since what I think
they<00:01:35.280> are<00:01:35.310> when<00:01:35.759> i<00:01:35.790> ordered<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:37.189> again<00:01:38.189> it's

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
they are when i ordered this again it's

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.560 
they are when i ordered this again it's
really<00:01:39.090> easy<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.360> install<00:01:39.860> I<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:42.000> will

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
really easy to install I like it I will

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.109 
really easy to install I like it I will
honestly<00:01:42.979> know<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.220> you've<00:01:44.399> got<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> slamming

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
honestly know if you've got a slamming

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.359 
honestly know if you've got a slamming
you<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.450> keep<00:01:45.600> updating<00:01:46.079> yours<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:47.220> know

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
you have to keep updating yours you know

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.780 
you have to keep updating yours you know
this<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.899> best<00:01:48.899> bet<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.500> mean<00:01:49.710> sure<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.280> you

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
this is best bet I mean sure you can you

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.340 
this is best bet I mean sure you can you
know<00:01:51.920> side<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.159> trace<00:01:53.490> over<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.600> over<00:01:54.659> you

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
know side of the trace over and over you

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.410 
know side of the trace over and over you
know<00:01:55.500> eventually<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:56.549> might<00:01:56.729> mess<00:01:56.939> up<00:01:57.180> one

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
know eventually we might mess up one

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.600 
know eventually we might mess up one
time<00:01:57.600> if<00:01:58.320> you're<00:01:58.560> not<00:01:58.649> paying<00:01:58.860> attention<00:01:59.009> but

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
time if you're not paying attention but

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.700 
time if you're not paying attention but
I<00:01:59.850> mean<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.659> use<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> 10<00:02:01.110> ohm<00:02:01.259> resistor

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
I mean you can use the 10 ohm resistor

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.730 
I mean you can use the 10 ohm resistor
and<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.920> works<00:02:02.130> really<00:02:02.729> good<00:02:03.060> but<00:02:03.960> in<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.590> end

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
and it works really good but in the end

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.580 
and it works really good but in the end
I'd<00:02:04.920> rather<00:02:05.100> have<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:06.780> my<00:02:06.840> board<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.380> fact

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
I'd rather have this on my board in fact

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.219 
I'd rather have this on my board in fact
I<00:02:07.680> do<00:02:07.829> have<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.399> my<00:02:08.429> slim<00:02:08.970> console<00:02:09.450> which
