00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
see I got accepted to UVA as well but I

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.819 
see I got accepted to UVA as well but I
just<00:01:36.630> got<00:01:36.869> here<00:01:37.049> because<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.439> big<00:01:37.650> and

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
just got here because it's so big and

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:38.539 
just got here because it's so big and
everything<00:01:38.189> like<00:01:38.310> that

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
everything like that

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.520 
everything like that
but<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.360> found<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.720> Concordia<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.259> that's

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
but I found that Concordia so that's

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.870 
but I found that Concordia so that's
because<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:40.829> smaller<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.369> it's<00:01:41.520> not<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:41.850> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
because it's smaller so it's not like a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.460 
because it's smaller so it's not like a
giant<00:01:42.210> step<00:01:42.390> compared<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.229> were<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.380> go

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
giant step compared to if you were to go

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.050 
giant step compared to if you were to go
straight<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> University<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.939> can

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
straight to the University you can

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.639 
straight to the University you can
interact<00:01:45.479> between<00:01:45.750> your<00:01:46.049> professors

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649

my<00:03:59.220> grades<00:03:59.700> in<00:04:00.150> all<00:04:00.269> of<00:04:00.389> my<00:04:00.510> classes<00:04:00.780> have

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
my grades in all of my classes have

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.780 
my grades in all of my classes have
reflected<00:04:01.530> my<00:04:01.620> ability<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:02.250> my<00:04:02.459> hard<00:04:02.609> work

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
reflected my ability and my hard work

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.020

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.399
