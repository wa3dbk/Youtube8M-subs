00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
ok so maybe you've seen my video about

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.510 
ok so maybe you've seen my video about
how<00:00:03.540> my<00:00:03.720> lazy<00:00:04.020> eye<00:00:04.200> controller<00:00:04.770> thing<00:00:05.069> works

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
how my lazy eye controller thing works

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.550 
how my lazy eye controller thing works
now<00:00:06.509> I'm<00:00:06.660> going<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.839> show<00:00:06.870> you<00:00:07.020> how<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.170> make<00:00:07.259> it

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
now I'm going to show you how to make it

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.450 
now I'm going to show you how to make it
so<00:00:07.890> basically<00:00:08.400> my<00:00:09.740> flashlight<00:00:10.740> this<00:00:10.860> time<00:00:12.110> ok

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
so basically my flashlight this time ok

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.230 
so basically my flashlight this time ok
so<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.549> see<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.940> fuse<00:00:15.150> panel<00:00:15.179> there<00:00:17.240> is

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
so you see in the fuse panel there is

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.880 
so you see in the fuse panel there is
you<00:00:18.390> take<00:00:18.600> here<00:00:18.960> cover<00:00:21.320> you<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:22.380> look<00:00:22.710> at<00:00:22.859> it

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
you take here cover you can look at it

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.310 
you take here cover you can look at it
and<00:00:23.449> basically<00:00:24.449> one<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.410> them<00:00:25.560> says<00:00:27.170> so<00:00:28.170> what<00:00:28.289> I

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
and basically one of them says so what I

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.170 
and basically one of them says so what I
say<00:00:29.240> light<00:00:30.240> control<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.320> 58<00:00:31.710> infuse

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
say light control and it's a 58 infuse

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.959 
say light control and it's a 58 infuse
goes<00:00:33.950> right<00:00:34.950> there<00:00:35.160> those<00:00:35.430> wires<00:00:35.670> are

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
goes right there those wires are

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.340 
goes right there those wires are
sticking<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.450> there<00:00:36.630> basically<00:00:38.660> you<00:00:39.660> go<00:00:39.899> jump

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
sticking in there basically you go jump

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.270 
sticking in there basically you go jump
out<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> car<00:00:41.489> for<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> second<00:00:45.590> go<00:00:46.590> like

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
out of the car for a second go like

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.630 
out of the car for a second go like
carquest<00:00:47.940> or<00:00:48.420> napa<00:00:48.710> your<00:00:49.710> hardware<00:00:50.039> store<00:00:50.340> and

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
carquest or napa your hardware store and

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:03.560 
carquest or napa your hardware store and
you<00:00:50.850> buy<00:00:53.750> these<00:00:54.750> things<00:00:56.090> to<00:00:57.090> little<00:01:02.570> little

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
you buy these things to little little

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.490 
you buy these things to little little
male<00:01:03.860> blade<00:01:04.860> connectors<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.450> fuse<00:01:06.750> panel

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.109 

distally<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.010> here<00:01:11.340> goes<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.790> your<00:01:11.850> fuse

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
distally this in here goes in your fuse

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.499 
distally this in here goes in your fuse
panel<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.650> then<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.950> int<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.580> gets

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
panel and then this int it gets

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.760 
panel and then this int it gets
connected<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.400> female<00:01:17.400> blade<00:01:17.970> connector

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
connected to a female blade connector

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.960 
connected to a female blade connector
one<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.890> those<00:01:20.040> which<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.759> put<00:01:20.909> your

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
one of those which you can put your

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.649 
one of those which you can put your
wires<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:22.009> so<00:01:23.009> how<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.549> how<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.030> make<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
wires on so how this how you make the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:36.859 
wires on so how this how you make the
make<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.830> thing<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:32.659> you<00:01:33.659> put<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:35.689> put<00:01:36.689> your

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
make the thing is you put it put your

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.350 
make the thing is you put it put your
blade<00:01:37.049> connectors<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:37.920> then<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:39.090> left

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
blade connectors in and then on the left

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.960 
blade connectors in and then on the left
blade<00:01:39.570> connector<00:01:40.250> you<00:01:41.250> come<00:01:41.490> out<00:01:41.670> into<00:01:41.880> a

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
blade connector you come out into a

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.760 
blade connector you come out into a
little<00:01:42.240> wire<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:43.680> then<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.920> connect<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.340> to

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
little wire and then you connect it to

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.429 
little wire and then you connect it to
another<00:01:46.770> female<00:01:47.579> blade<00:01:48.180> connector<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:50.729> then

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
another female blade connector and then

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.560 
another female blade connector and then
that<00:01:52.439> connects<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.920> hold<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:56.270> female<00:01:57.270> blade

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
that connects to hold on female blade

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.160 
that connects to hold on female blade
connector<00:01:57.810> we<00:01:58.290> lift<00:01:58.560> into<00:01:58.770> your<00:01:58.950> fuse<00:02:00.170> and

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
connector we lift into your fuse and

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.389 
connector we lift into your fuse and
then<00:02:01.740> another<00:02:02.430> blade<00:02:03.000> connector<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.689> your

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
then another blade connector on your

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.969 
then another blade connector on your
fuse<00:02:05.399> will<00:02:05.969> connect<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:07.049> bit<00:02:07.259> of<00:02:07.350> speaker

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
fuse will connect to this bit of speaker

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.130 
fuse will connect to this bit of speaker
wire<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.940> negative<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.629> speaker<00:02:09.959> wire

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
wire the negative on the speaker wire

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.260 
wire the negative on the speaker wire
then<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.129> positive<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.849> speaker<00:02:12.120> wire

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
then the positive on the speaker wire

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.520 
then the positive on the speaker wire
connects<00:02:12.629> into<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.020> other

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
connects into the other

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.740 
connects into the other
fuse<00:02:13.709> panel<00:02:14.069> socket<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.700> then<00:02:15.600> basically

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
fuse panel socket and then basically

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.930 
fuse panel socket and then basically
this<00:02:16.140> runs<00:02:16.440> up<00:02:16.680> type<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.819> fuse<00:02:18.060> back<00:02:18.240> in<00:02:19.940> you

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
this runs up type the fuse back in you

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.340 
this runs up type the fuse back in you
don't<00:02:21.150> really<00:02:21.240> need<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.660> fuse<00:02:21.930> in<00:02:22.050> there<00:02:22.140> but

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
don't really need the fuse in there but

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.660 
don't really need the fuse in there but
I<00:02:22.380> just<00:02:22.620> did<00:02:22.709> that<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.100> know<00:02:23.340> you'd<00:02:23.459> still

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
I just did that so you know you'd still

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.300 
I just did that so you know you'd still
have<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:24.060> fuse<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:25.290> can<00:02:25.500> change<00:02:25.709> out<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.250> you

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
have a fuse you can change out so you

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.340 
have a fuse you can change out so you
don't<00:02:26.340> burn<00:02:26.580> anything<00:02:26.880> out<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.420> speaker

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
don't burn anything out that speaker

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.530 
don't burn anything out that speaker
wire<00:02:28.500> runs<00:02:28.830> up<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.910> over<00:02:30.150> your<00:02:30.180> steering

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
wire runs up and over your steering

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.630 
wire runs up and over your steering
column<00:02:30.959> then<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.160> where<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.340> put<00:02:32.580> my

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
column then this is where I put my

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.000 
column then this is where I put my
switch<00:02:34.100> right<00:02:35.100> there<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:36.680> basically<00:02:37.680> that

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
switch right there and basically that

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.040 
switch right there and basically that
speaker<00:02:38.550> wire<00:02:38.670> connects<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.239> and<00:02:39.510> then<00:02:39.690> of

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
speaker wire connects to and then of

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.540 
speaker wire connects to and then of
course<00:02:41.000> take<00:02:42.000> your<00:02:42.830> little<00:02:45.019> pop-up<00:02:46.019> button

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
course take your little pop-up button

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:55.009 
course take your little pop-up button
and<00:02:48.380> just<00:02:49.380> pull<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.190> out<00:02:51.739> that<00:02:53.600> then<00:02:54.600> here's

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
and just pull it out that then here's

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.400 
and just pull it out that then here's
what<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:55.200> did<00:02:56.239> instead<00:02:57.239> of<00:02:57.480> cutting<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.959> wire<00:02:58.140> I

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
what I did instead of cutting the wire I

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.110 
what I did instead of cutting the wire I
really<00:02:59.069> didn't<00:02:59.220> want<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.430> cut<00:02:59.610> anything<00:02:59.790> in<00:03:00.000> my

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
really didn't want to cut anything in my

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.520 
really didn't want to cut anything in my
car<00:03:00.330> I<00:03:01.010> just<00:03:02.010> pull<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:02.819> used<00:03:03.000> pins<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.660> pulled

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
car I just pull I used pins and pulled

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.309 
car I just pull I used pins and pulled
it<00:03:04.680> out<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:05.880> whole<00:03:06.090> thing<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.630> just<00:03:07.080> put<00:03:07.260> a

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
it out the whole thing and just put a

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.250 
it out the whole thing and just put a
little<00:03:07.440> bit<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.650> electrical<00:03:07.890> tape<00:03:08.280> around<00:03:08.670> it

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
little bit of electrical tape around it

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.600 
little bit of electrical tape around it
so<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.290> disconnected<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.160> but<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.340> didn't<00:03:11.519> have

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
so I disconnected it but I didn't have

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.070 
so I disconnected it but I didn't have
to<00:03:11.700> cut<00:03:11.880> it<00:03:11.910> if<00:03:12.120> I<00:03:12.239> ever<00:03:12.300> want<00:03:12.600> I<00:03:12.660> can<00:03:12.720> stick<00:03:12.989> it

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
to cut it if I ever want I can stick it

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.630 
to cut it if I ever want I can stick it
back<00:03:13.230> in<00:03:13.640> and<00:03:14.640> then<00:03:14.880> basically<00:03:16.250> not<00:03:17.250> like<00:03:17.400> that

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
back in and then basically not like that

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.930 
back in and then basically not like that
oh<00:03:17.940> by<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.540> way<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.959> switch<00:03:19.260> it's<00:03:19.940> upside

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
oh by the way the switch it's upside

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.550 
oh by the way the switch it's upside
down<00:03:20.970> so<00:03:21.390> when<00:03:21.600> it<00:03:21.750> when<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.049> switch<00:03:22.260> is<00:03:22.290> in

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
down so when it when the switch is in

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.250 
down so when it when the switch is in
the<00:03:22.590> down<00:03:22.860> position<00:03:22.890> it's<00:03:23.610> on<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.930> when<00:03:25.079> it's

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
the down position it's on and when it's

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.319 
the down position it's on and when it's
in<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.590> up<00:03:25.709> it's<00:03:25.980> actually<00:03:26.250> off<00:03:26.370> but<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.150> put

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
in the up it's actually off but I put

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.670 
in the up it's actually off but I put
mine<00:03:27.480> upside<00:03:27.780> down<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.049> then<00:03:28.170> flipped<00:03:28.500> over

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
mine upside down and then flipped over

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.759 
mine upside down and then flipped over
the<00:03:28.980> little<00:03:29.190> plate<00:03:29.640> that<00:03:29.880> says<00:03:30.060> on<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.420> off<00:03:30.769> so

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
the little plate that says on and off so

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.390 
the little plate that says on and off so
I<00:03:31.799> refer<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.430> off<00:03:32.940> as<00:03:33.510> on<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:34.019> on<00:03:34.079> his<00:03:34.320> off<00:03:34.500> so

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
I refer to off as on and on his off so

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.009 
I refer to off as on and on his off so
