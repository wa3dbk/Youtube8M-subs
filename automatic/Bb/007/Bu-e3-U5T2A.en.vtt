00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
hand but I absolutely love the concept

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.819 
hand but I absolutely love the concept
I<00:03:02.310> use<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.180> all<00:03:03.389> the<00:03:03.450> time<00:03:03.599> even<00:03:04.319> with<00:03:04.680> the

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
I use it all the time even with the

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.819 
I use it all the time even with the
module<00:03:05.310> that<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.579> use<00:03:05.849> I<00:03:06.090> find<00:03:06.780> no<00:03:07.019> conflict
