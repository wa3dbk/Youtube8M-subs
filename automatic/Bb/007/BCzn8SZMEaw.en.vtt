00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640

boy it does make a difference now the
the<00:05:29.020> Droid<00:05:29.530> Razr<00:05:29.800> had<00:05:30.130> a<00:05:30.160> pretty<00:05:30.460> decent

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
the Droid Razr had a pretty decent

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.670 
the Droid Razr had a pretty decent
capacity<00:05:31.330> eighteen<00:05:31.690> seventy<00:05:32.050> milliamp<00:05:32.440> hour

battery<00:05:32.770> and<00:05:33.340> it's<00:05:34.180> a<00:05:34.240> good<00:05:34.360> thing<00:05:34.420> it<00:05:34.600> did

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
battery and it's a good thing it did

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.270 
battery and it's a good thing it did
because<00:05:35.020> the<00:05:35.140> battery<00:05:35.440> is<00:05:35.500> sealed<00:05:35.860> inside

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
because the battery is sealed inside

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.640 
because the battery is sealed inside
just<00:05:36.580> like<00:05:36.730> here<00:05:37.150> there's<00:05:37.660> no<00:05:37.810> popping<00:05:38.530> this

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650

eighteen<00:05:43.240> seventy<00:05:43.660> is<00:05:43.720> a<00:05:43.810> pretty<00:05:43.990> good

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.170 
eighteen seventy is a pretty good

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.890 
really a killer battery now for those of
you<00:06:45.400> have<00:06:45.550> more<00:06:45.760> moderate<00:06:46.120> use<00:06:46.270> it's<00:06:46.510> really

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:46.900 
you have more moderate use it's really

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:47.940 
you have more moderate use it's really
not<00:06:47.020> as<00:06:47.170> you<00:06:47.260> can<00:06:47.410> actually<00:06:47.740> make

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:47.950 
not as you can actually make

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.940 
not as you can actually make
for<00:06:48.130> two<00:06:48.280> days<00:06:48.490> on<00:06:49.030> a<00:06:49.090> charge<00:06:49.620> so<00:06:50.620> it's<00:06:50.770> rather

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:50.950 
for two days on a charge so it's rather

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.470 
for two days on a charge so it's rather
convenient<00:06:51.520> and<00:06:51.580> again<00:06:51.850> given<00:06:52.120> the<00:06:52.240> sealed

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480 
convenient and again given the sealed

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.810 
convenient and again given the sealed
berry<00:06:52.750> design<00:06:53.140> it's<00:06:53.950> nice<00:06:54.250> to<00:06:54.490> have<00:06:54.670> that

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
berry design it's nice to have that

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.250 
berry design it's nice to have that
built<00:06:55.150> in<00:06:55.360> so<00:06:55.510> you<00:06:55.570> don't<00:06:55.600> have<00:06:55.750> to<00:06:55.900> carry<00:06:56.110> all

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260
