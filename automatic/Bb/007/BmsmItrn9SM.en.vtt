00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.230
 George Zimmerman sold the plate 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.230
 Annabeth this story is so crazy I use the term painting too loose 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.950
 For a hundred grand fine it's sold on eBay for $ 100,000 and ninety-nine 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:13.969
 Ninety-nine cents 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.520
 What a person will pay for something George Zimmerman painted 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.890
 I do not know but the media I care about is reporting 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.279
 It's not obvious that it's really an original painting 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.990
 Twitter The crow used to confirm the rain and pointed out that the media interested me 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.800
 That America Zimmerman to broadcast the artwork above the American flag and so on 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.220
 It seems to be copied or tracked 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.070
 More than one photo from the company Free Shutterstock 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.820
 Here for the people who are watching here in the Roman painting and that is this is it 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.300
 Images in Roman painting 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.220
 Then here is the corresponding crop 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.940
 I love this twinkling science Shutterstock all ripple in science 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.970
 Lewis matched the best guess I am here I suppose is the wanted Mirman pain 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.350
 American Flag 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.060
 So we are looking for a picture on Shutterstock then 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.670
 Trace more or something or do not know what to do 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.330
 I am in any case here good old George holding the painting 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.930
 This can in fact lead to some copyright issues on Shutterstock 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.430
 Copyright Images 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.789
 Zimmermann made a hundred grand copies of the work seem 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:31.159
 Yes I could have just had something simple Photoshop for you I mean 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.119
 Is a good chance that there was not any drawing or drying or anything to do 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.479
 The hand is simmered here 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.149
 Bahama but I think it is possible that if you actually bought a picture of a star 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.600
 Shutterstock that this would be fine white to know 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.909
 This is the case there is another man who pu 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.200
 Published the photo that is drying it done online 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.289
 Michael's artist does not want Oh do not publish on the Bay e-fee did 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.759
 Which has a kinda like KKK-looking person that can be Zimmermann 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.189
 A pistol is directed at the bowling game held by a child 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.250
 Maybe Martin Trayvon has pulled an electronic bay on it like the same day that 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.250
 Zimmermann sold for a hundred grand 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.400
 Saying that he portrays me as being portrayed 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.670
 And KKK and they do not allow okkk related stuff that bay not only 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.390
 Allow it 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.110
 It's wonderful because this drawing is much more than a social comment from 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.060
 George Zimmerman 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.340
 That man also painted on the commentary 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.410
 The supposed photo did not kill anyone in his life but Zimmerman is not allowed to 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.870
 Make a hundred major shares of shutterstock copied image 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.940
 But this other guy could even get the grand 25 that his paintings were up to 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.130
 And donate to charities so that it's a strange world there Lewis 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.420
 It is for them and George 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.220
 In the use of Zimmerman to thank him for his fame for that because this is 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.970
 The only reason this is what happens
