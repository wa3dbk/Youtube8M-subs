00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:08.390
 hi are you in the channel of 20 296 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.390
 men but not 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.930
 hello to all the kids here I see 96 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.209
 commenting again on a new video this 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.400
 time of formula one of 2012 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.460
 good is a game that came out a little 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.320
 specifically on September 21 in my 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.100
 opinion I think a little late because 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.529
 good the world championship of formula 1 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.949
 it's almost there when I finish 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:36.699
 informed and good they could have taken it out 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.210
 just leave I understand that of selling 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:42.070
 more take it out at Christmas and those things but 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.989
 This game is better when the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.309
 season but I'm going to leave 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.070
 talk and let's talk about the game of a 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.900
 once for all 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.630
 good what I 'm playing right now 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.290
 it's a time trial a good way to me to 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.290
 see 5 years 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.470
 run for running and soaking are races 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.410
 since he does not like racing 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.940
 good good to me truthfully the truth 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.640
 is that I do not like Formula 1 very much 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.710
 before I liked it better but well now 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.840
 I do not like it much now our 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.250
 path is good for sex that wanders in 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:21.100
 the world but good the case is that a 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.800
 I think it's great if it looks like a 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.270
 I play cars even though I do not 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.430
 I would buy because I do not like it anymore 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.320
 I said but to the people who love it 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.040
 the formula one 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.530
 I'm talking about you, share it because it's 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.250
 very very well and why do I say this then 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.800
 because formula one 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.760
 it seems to me the most realistic that yes it has 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.700
 there is super real 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.910
 good things like adapting the car with 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.180
 engineers for for example by the 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.940
 rain for these things the tires 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.780
 these engineering things and good 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.720
 also the meteorological theme play 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.970
 rainy dry good you see in the game 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.760
 that I'm pretty bad but what is 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.800
 can 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.310
 and of course it also has some 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.170
 great game modes as is the side 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.870
 lifelong career we can see that 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.590
 between simulation arcade arcade will be a 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.690
 little easy and good in the races 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.360
 we can access the flashback mode that 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:29.080
 it's like a repeat we have four 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.450
 playback for 2005 like me that can 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.290
 missing this game we can rewind the 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.510
 game and 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:41.240
 they selected when we were good and 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.240
 go back to that point and you'll see 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.530
 other of its vast are the modes 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:49.400
 multiplayer that we can play to 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.010
 split screen with a friend or online 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.860
 for 16 people something pretty good that 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.590
 lengthen the 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.170
 a new model in champion mode with the 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.620
 that we will fight between some champions 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.190
 of the formula one alonso hamilton 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.110
 challenging them and see who will win 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.270
 and that, not to mention the trajectory mode 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.210
 in which we will create a player and what 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.280
 we will take to the top that yes something that 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.570
 are lack is without a doubt the voices of 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.660
 antonio lobato that although they are in 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.570
 Spanish the voices of the race 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.790
 they will be the same as with the caldito well 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.840
 how good so my opinion if you 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.090
 like the shape one 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.540
 You should share it here I leave you with a
