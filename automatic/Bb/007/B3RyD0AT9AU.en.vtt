00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.290
 smile when it rains when 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.130
 ceased you must stop crying 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.980
 out of season 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.870
 if we try and see what happens for 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.490
 every part of you that wants you there is another 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.859
 that recedes to piece as for the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.480
 More social scale goals give away 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.789
 two of spades striking kings of money 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.800

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.689
 have some feelings found 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.730
 not so well on their way to come to 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.410
 same way but with different arguments 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.240
 we are in the same calm nothing counts 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.960
 differentiate love is a point of arrival 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.440
 a concrete perspective without two points 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.020
 view and measure Italian pride 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.910
 ara sea ​​well proud of us too 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.829
 wear an Italian mark no because well 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.680
 I am left of armani fans e 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.050
 armani has a band on it really is 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.690
 dress for us fills us with 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.280
 happiness is the whole world and does it 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.789
 we see traveling around the world because when 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.760
 let's say yes we sing lara Italian music 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.739
 and do not know pizza dough in 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.770
 the whole world, however, when it comes to 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.330
 fashion by now you will know repress and leverage 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.330
 also the emotion 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.380
 sure this is little but sure but I wanted to 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.530
 add another thing 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.930

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.240
 us because already the kind we sing 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.369
 it is not little is not a people would deny 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.439
 something more classic is not rock 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.570
 so surely you dramatize a little 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.620
 what is our musical genre 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.350

 small room then it is fine since the 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.180
 musical genre is not exactly the same 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:53.650
