00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
kinds of numbers and we're gonna head

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.759 
kinds of numbers and we're gonna head
back<00:02:24.790> inside<00:02:25.209> and<00:02:25.420> talk<00:02:25.690> with<00:02:25.840> Justin<00:02:26.260> about

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.970 
their superchargers on and we're pretty
pretty<00:05:19.630> happy<00:05:19.720> with<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:20.110> outcome<00:05:20.440> of<00:05:20.470> it<00:05:20.740> so

you now very cool so you said you had a
couple<00:05:28.180> other<00:05:28.330> superchargers<00:05:29.050> that<00:05:29.200> you

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
couple other superchargers that you

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.620 
couple other superchargers that you
tested<00:05:29.650> on<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:29.920> same<00:05:30.130> car<00:05:30.370> how<00:05:31.210> do<00:05:31.270> you<00:05:31.360> arrive

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
tested on the same car how do you arrive

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.470 
tested on the same car how do you arrive
at<00:05:31.810> VMP<00:05:32.230> after<00:05:32.530> testing<00:05:32.860> all<00:05:32.950> these<00:05:33.070> others

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
at VMP after testing all these others

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.510 
at VMP after testing all these others
newest<00:05:34.480> latest<00:05:34.600> and<00:05:34.810> greatest<00:05:35.310> how<00:05:36.310> do<00:05:36.370> the

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
newest latest and greatest how do the

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.660 
newest latest and greatest how do the
numbers<00:05:36.610> compare<00:05:37.590> very<00:05:38.590> impressive<00:05:39.130> we

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
numbers compare very impressive we

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.800 
numbers compare very impressive we
actually<00:05:40.000> have<00:05:40.090> had<00:05:40.150> a<00:05:40.210> couple<00:05:40.570> different

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
actually have had a couple different

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.900 
actually have had a couple different
units<00:05:41.110> all<00:05:41.770> different<00:05:42.070> sizes<00:05:42.250> different

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
units all different sizes different

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.000 
units all different sizes different
displacements<00:05:43.530> this<00:05:44.530> unit<00:05:44.770> is<00:05:44.830> actually

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
displacements this unit is actually

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.130 
displacements this unit is actually
we've<00:05:45.640> kind<00:05:45.910> of<00:05:46.000> stepped<00:05:46.210> back<00:05:46.270> on<00:05:46.600> size<00:05:46.840> now

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
we've kind of stepped back on size now

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.040 
we've kind of stepped back on size now
we're<00:05:47.500> actually<00:05:47.950> smaller<00:05:48.580> now<00:05:48.880> than<00:05:48.910> the<00:05:49.840> last

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
we're actually smaller now than the last

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.920 
we're actually smaller now than the last
unit<00:05:50.290> we<00:05:50.320> had<00:05:50.530> but<00:05:51.010> it's<00:05:51.250> outperformed<00:05:52.120> the

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
unit we had but it's outperformed the

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.750 
unit we had but it's outperformed the
last<00:05:53.140> unit<00:05:53.440> we<00:05:53.500> had<00:05:53.620> on<00:05:53.770> there<00:05:53.980> to<00:05:54.430> drive<00:05:54.640> the

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
last unit we had on there to drive the

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.280 
last unit we had on there to drive the
car<00:05:54.910> on<00:05:55.030> the<00:05:55.060> street<00:05:55.420> is<00:05:55.570> just<00:05:55.810> I<00:05:55.990> mean<00:05:56.080> it's

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
car on the street is just I mean it's

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.410 
car on the street is just I mean it's
unbelievable<00:05:56.460> verse<00:05:57.460> all<00:05:57.730> the<00:05:57.910> other<00:05:58.060> units

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.420 
unbelievable verse all the other units

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.300 
unbelievable verse all the other units
not<00:05:58.570> everything<00:05:58.990> from<00:05:59.140> stock<00:05:59.440> to<00:05:59.470> all<00:06:00.160> the

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
not everything from stock to all the

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.740 
not everything from stock to all the
other<00:06:00.430> units<00:06:00.670> we've<00:06:00.820> been<00:06:00.940> through<00:06:01.210> so<00:06:01.510> it's

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
other units we've been through so it's

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.990 
other units we've been through so it's
it's<00:06:02.380> a<00:06:02.470> monster<00:06:02.860> I<00:06:03.010> mean<00:06:03.160> for<00:06:03.370> a<00:06:03.400> little<00:06:03.670> unit

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
it's a monster I mean for a little unit

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.790 
it's a monster I mean for a little unit
it's<00:06:04.330> a<00:06:04.420> little<00:06:04.690> monster<00:06:05.080> as<00:06:05.170> I<00:06:05.290> guess<00:06:05.470> I<00:06:05.620> can

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
it's a little monster as I guess I can

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.340 
it's a little monster as I guess I can
call<00:06:05.950> it<00:06:06.450> right<00:06:07.450> on<00:06:07.600> well<00:06:07.780> that's<00:06:07.930> typically

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
call it right on well that's typically

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:09.960 
call it right on well that's typically
not<00:06:08.380> what<00:06:08.560> you<00:06:08.800> hear<00:06:08.950> somebody<00:06:09.160> describe<00:06:09.700> a

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
not what you hear somebody describe a

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.760 
not what you hear somebody describe a
supercharger<00:06:10.630> as<00:06:10.750> is<00:06:10.930> a<00:06:10.960> little<00:06:11.290> monster<00:06:11.620> but

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
supercharger as is a little monster but

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:12.900 
supercharger as is a little monster but
if<00:06:11.860> you're<00:06:11.980> getting<00:06:12.100> bigger<00:06:12.400> numbers<00:06:12.730> at<00:06:12.880> a

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
if you're getting bigger numbers at a

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.340 
if you're getting bigger numbers at a
smaller<00:06:13.240> displacement<00:06:13.540> you<00:06:13.930> can't<00:06:14.140> really

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.350 
smaller displacement you can't really

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.880 
smaller displacement you can't really
argue<00:06:14.500> with<00:06:14.620> that

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
argue with that

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.680 
argue with that
and<00:06:15.160> that's<00:06:15.490> what<00:06:15.670> we're<00:06:15.790> seeing<00:06:15.820> here<00:06:16.060> at<00:06:16.300> VMP

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
and that's what we're seeing here at VMP

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.240 
and that's what we're seeing here at VMP
