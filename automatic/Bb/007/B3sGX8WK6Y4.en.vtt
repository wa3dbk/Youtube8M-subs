00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
that don't make sense to me but I have

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.389 
that don't make sense to me but I have
to<00:00:57.219> say<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.640> way<00:00:57.880> it<00:00:58.239> is<00:00:58.300> at<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:58.989> moment<00:00:59.399> it's

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
to say the way it is at the moment it's

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.750 
to say the way it is at the moment it's
kind<00:01:01.030> of<00:01:01.210> exceeded<00:01:02.140> my<00:01:02.320> expectations<00:01:03.100> it's<00:01:03.460> a

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
kind of exceeded my expectations it's a

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.840 
kind of exceeded my expectations it's a
lot<00:01:04.000> of<00:01:04.119> fun<00:01:04.300> to<00:01:04.479> play<00:01:04.720> now<00:01:05.640> compared<00:01:06.640> to<00:01:06.700> how

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
lot of fun to play now compared to how

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.850 
lot of fun to play now compared to how
it<00:01:06.970> was<00:01:07.000> in<00:01:07.240> battlefield<00:01:07.660> 3<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:08.020> I<00:01:08.050> think<00:01:08.320> that

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
it was in battlefield 3 and I think that

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.100 
it was in battlefield 3 and I think that
is<00:01:09.009> at<00:01:09.250> least<00:01:09.430> in<00:01:09.700> part<00:01:09.970> due<00:01:10.450> to<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.660> fact<00:01:10.869> in

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
is at least in part due to the fact in

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.499 
is at least in part due to the fact in
battlefield<00:01:11.649> 3<00:01:11.740> you<00:01:12.130> had<00:01:12.280> to<00:01:12.430> move<00:01:12.670> up<00:01:13.240> through

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
battlefield 3 you had to move up through

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.330 
battlefield 3 you had to move up through
the<00:01:13.720> weapons<00:01:14.080> in<00:01:14.259> and<00:01:14.380> sort<00:01:14.500> of<00:01:14.619> staged<00:01:14.979> where

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
the weapons in and sort of staged where

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.580 
the weapons in and sort of staged where
you<00:01:15.460> have<00:01:15.550> to<00:01:15.670> progress<00:01:16.030> where<00:01:16.990> is<00:01:17.140> in

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
you have to progress where is in

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.160 
you have to progress where is in
battlefield<00:01:18.130> 4<00:01:18.280> I<00:01:18.820> like<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.330> variety<00:01:19.479> you

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
don't start with the crummiest pistols

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.930 
don't start with the crummiest pistols
and<00:01:23.530> then<00:01:23.649> work<00:01:23.890> your<00:01:23.920> way<00:01:24.190> up<00:01:24.340> to<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.700> good

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
and then work your way up to the good

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.930 
and then work your way up to the good
weapons<00:01:25.420> it's<00:01:26.319> kind<00:01:26.709> of<00:01:26.950> you<00:01:27.250> know<00:01:27.280> you<00:01:27.759> can

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
weapons it's kind of you know you can

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.059 
weapons it's kind of you know you can
have<00:01:28.030> an<00:01:28.149> m60<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.110> then<00:01:29.200> you<00:01:29.289> just<00:01:29.470> have<00:01:29.590> an

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
have an m60 and then you just have an

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:34.080 
have an m60 and then you just have an
an-94<00:01:31.030> net<00:01:31.750> so<00:01:32.500> it<00:01:32.830> i<00:01:33.069> actually<00:01:33.459> prefer<00:01:33.610> it

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
an-94 net so it i actually prefer it

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.749 
an-94 net so it i actually prefer it
like<00:01:34.240> that<00:01:34.479> and<00:01:34.990> i<00:01:35.080> think<00:01:35.319> if<00:01:35.860> you're<00:01:36.160> not<00:01:36.520> the

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
like that and i think if you're not the

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.880 
like that and i think if you're not the
most<00:01:36.940> elite<00:01:37.509> battlefield<00:01:38.170> 4<00:01:38.380> player<00:01:38.679> out

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
something like that you get the circular

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.309 
something like that you get the circular
reticule<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:28.629> it's<00:02:28.750> not<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.989> end<00:02:29.019> of<00:02:29.260> the

in the an-94 in full auto so you just

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.360 
in the an-94 in full auto so you just
have<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.209> switch<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.629> to<00:02:40.660> burst<00:02:40.989> mode<00:02:41.379> the

it a lot and I think it's because the

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.400 
it a lot and I think it's because the

anything else and actually it's not

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.420 
anything else and actually it's not

just<00:04:26.620> one<00:04:26.830> final<00:04:27.220> thing<00:04:27.520> that<00:04:27.700> comes<00:04:27.940> to<00:04:28.180> mind

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
just one final thing that comes to mind

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.200 
just one final thing that comes to mind
is<00:04:28.870> maybe<00:04:29.500> I'm<00:04:29.710> enjoying<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:30.430> more<00:04:30.820> than<00:04:31.030> I<00:04:31.150> did

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
is maybe I'm enjoying it more than I did

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.600 
is maybe I'm enjoying it more than I did
in<00:04:31.389> battlefield<00:04:31.960> 3<00:04:32.020> say<00:04:32.500> because<00:04:33.250> I'm<00:04:33.340> doing

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
in battlefield 3 say because I'm doing

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.159 
in battlefield 3 say because I'm doing
better<00:04:33.760> at<00:04:34.060> it<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:34.360> that<00:04:34.479> could<00:04:34.630> be<00:04:34.780> because

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:35.169 
better at it and that could be because

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.900 
better at it and that could be because
of<00:04:35.470> one<00:04:35.650> of<00:04:35.800> a<00:04:35.860> number<00:04:36.039> of<00:04:36.250> reasons<00:04:36.460> it<00:04:36.880> could

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
of one of a number of reasons it could

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.300 
of one of a number of reasons it could
be<00:04:37.210> the<00:04:37.720> weapon<00:04:37.990> system<00:04:38.710> that<00:04:38.830> you<00:04:38.890> don't<00:04:39.070> just

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
be the weapon system that you don't just

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.219 
be the weapon system that you don't just
start<00:04:39.550> with<00:04:39.760> the<00:04:39.789> sort<00:04:40.150> poor<00:04:40.419> weapons<00:04:40.960> and

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
start with the sort poor weapons and

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:41.679 
start with the sort poor weapons and
work

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:41.689 
work

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:43.989 
work
it<00:04:42.469> could<00:04:42.679> be<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:42.949> fact<00:04:43.159> that<00:04:43.339> it's<00:04:43.759> not<00:04:43.969> a

00:04:43.989 --> 00:04:43.999 
it could be the fact that it's not a

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:46.299 
it could be the fact that it's not a
premium<00:04:44.389> only<00:04:44.539> game<00:04:45.110> mode<00:04:45.439> in<00:04:45.769> battlefield<00:04:46.249> 4

00:04:46.299 --> 00:04:46.309 
premium only game mode in battlefield 4

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:48.969 
premium only game mode in battlefield 4
so<00:04:46.729> it's<00:04:47.330> not<00:04:47.479> just<00:04:47.539> a<00:04:47.839> hard<00:04:48.110> core<00:04:48.409> element<00:04:48.889> of

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
so it's not just a hard core element of

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.949 
so it's not just a hard core element of
people<00:04:49.429> playing<00:04:49.580> it<00:04:49.879> could<00:04:50.149> just<00:04:50.299> be<00:04:50.419> they'll

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:50.959 
people playing it could just be they'll

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:53.199 
people playing it could just be they'll
played<00:04:51.169> so<00:04:51.499> much<00:04:51.769> more<00:04:52.099> battlefield<00:04:52.519> now<00:04:52.969> that

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:53.209 
played so much more battlefield now that

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:54.879 
played so much more battlefield now that
