00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
new high low seat yeah so the high low

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.540 
new high low seat yeah so the high low
is<00:00:54.210> definitely<00:00:54.740> something<00:00:55.740> you<00:00:55.770> guys<00:00:56.040> wanted

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
and we built in a frame and actually I

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.010 
and we built in a frame and actually I
think<00:00:59.880> we<00:00:59.970> can<00:01:00.120> pull<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.510> out

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
think we can pull this out

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.810 
think we can pull this out
you<00:01:01.860> can<00:01:02.010> see<00:01:02.220> if<00:01:02.310> there's<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.520> framework

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
you can see if there's a framework

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.389 
you can see if there's a framework
inside<00:01:03.540> the<00:01:03.810> boat<00:01:03.990> that<00:01:04.500> allows<00:01:04.799> us<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.219> put

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
inside the boat that allows us to put

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:08.029 
inside the boat that allows us to put
the<00:01:05.489> Slayer<00:01:05.759> seat<00:01:06.119> down<00:01:07.020> inside<00:01:07.499> you<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:08.009> a
