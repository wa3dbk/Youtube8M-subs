00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.839
 on the map is a sandy river at this moment 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.700
 when I appeared in the fourth i have 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.670
 there were only two directions where I could 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.000
 go left where I'm going now and 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.550
 right not believe right and in general 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.180
 did not want to go because because 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.970
 but on the left it seemed to me that it would be 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.939
 very promising movement there is not 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.630
 I know why, but something told me 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.460
 that it will be so right you know 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.770
 because of such battles here, more and more 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.469
 and more want to ride the same myself 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.899
 the fourth isa because of his circular 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.390
 booking which allows you to survive 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.079
 just such situations which but 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.969
 seriously some other cars they would 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.210
 so could not god see far te 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.210
 ver2 she goes to him please for 500m 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.010
 registered chakra certainly does not break through 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.070
 he would not want to because I was going to him 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.140
 so semi rhombuses and even if the dialogue 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.180
 the bombs to him just rolled him water not 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.939
 would help us turntables please 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.490
 shoot from roses caught fire there 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.159
 Do you understand this myself Serb me so 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.560
 seemed to be looking for my fight exactly 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.259
 so he helped me with accuracy and on 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.439
 so he helped me with alpha lies and 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.060
 Do not other buns 50100 nothing 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.270
 can only do put on to 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.170
 points and turn the art simply not 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.479
 shot it is not clear why because 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.930
 why she didn't shoot is not clear 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.000
 because if she were here that 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.840
 my life would come to an end here and 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.150
 here I start to see the beautiful who here I am 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.130
 I came five tanks and now let's 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:50.250
 let's see which of ours on the flank I and all 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.740
 jesus back well maybe foch everything 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.920
 shoots and little by little modifies 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.560
 arthar but here the motive is five tanks 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.320
 who came here three more behind 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.369
 but honestly, then Iâ€™m optimistic 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.460
 left immediately 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.580
 especially after me out of 4 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.860
 in mask of gun motive in mask of aru 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.810
 I never warrior God to devils 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.570
 the war but struck me in the roof 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.550
 The eternal problem of the fourth 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.770
 that there seems to be a 30 mm roof 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.320
 which is knocked out by all and all 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.050
 and here by the movement of which I was afraid 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.210
 most of all m103 drove me 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.910
 I was quite happy with positional warfare 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.270
 between these two guys was fine 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.110
 would 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:38.080
 but here is something im 103 I understand what is here 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.800
 salt and I drove him forward in the course of someone 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.520
 from shots 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.930
 gave the tower once he did not move us and 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.960
 now my main task will not be 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.560
 let yourself be surrounded as you see alpha 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.660
 500 plus flies out again I 'm telling myself 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.330
 sat watching this fight and here 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.720
 go and flash to this all played 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.790
 the boy can pack his bags and go out 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.810
 hut there are four of course punches me 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:09.040
 I have a boy 43 percent I will break through f you 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.170
 I am punched with crit you two members 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.360
 crew but do not pierce but put 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.060
 explosive damage from what I was happy 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.880
 just go nuts well and the fourth beat still 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.620
 God breaks it and it is trying at least 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.910
 like that maneuver from him but me 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.250
 this fourth one seems to be 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.080
 I think the Serb is watching 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.900
 for all the fourth and themselves in this battle and 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.660
 he breaks again -1200 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.170
 goes to flash drives and finally now 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:38.980
 there will be a wave of failures at the enemy four 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:42.100
 on your face that's what it is not struck 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.800
 take it pleases mechvod and him 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.989
 rain finishes him 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.519
 short pancake episode for 3 minutes has passed 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.150
 I have a fight 130 x p and a bunch around me 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.250
 corpses 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.160
 let's just see how many tanks 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:01.300
 I was killed four tanks went to 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.630
 kill me kill soviet prisoner and they 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.360
 of 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.620
 nothing came here as far as I remember 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.910
 that's all mine ends with 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.250
 skating in this battle turn to 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.720
 the results of the fight and I hope you conclusions 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.780
 do it yourself 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.630
 tyazh still there in this game 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.900
 play on the straps do not play pt all 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.900
 until
