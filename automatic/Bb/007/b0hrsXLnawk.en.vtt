late

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.750 
late
which<00:01:56.810> is<00:01:57.080> okay<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:57.800> if<00:01:57.980> it's<00:01:58.070> already<00:01:58.370> a<00:01:58.550> full

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
which is okay and if it's already a full

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.220 
which is okay and if it's already a full
length<00:01:58.880> which<00:01:59.120> you<00:01:59.240> get<00:01:59.360> hateful<00:01:59.780> behavior

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
length which you get hateful behavior

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.110 
length which you get hateful behavior
two<00:02:00.860> out<00:02:01.010> of<00:02:01.040> three<00:02:01.160> gay<00:02:01.520> students<00:02:02.030> is

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
two out of three gay students is

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.410 
sexually harassed while at school and

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.350 
sexually harassed while at school and
eventually<00:02:07.010> someone's<00:02:07.730> going<00:02:07.910> to<00:02:07.970> take<00:02:08.180> that

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
eventually someone's going to take that

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.900 
eventually someone's going to take that
to<00:02:08.570> its<00:02:08.720> logical<00:02:08.899> extreme<00:02:09.290> as<00:02:09.890> happened<00:02:10.880> in

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
to its logical extreme as happened in

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.450 
to its logical extreme as happened in
Oxnard<00:02:11.360> California<00:02:11.780> two<00:02:12.080> months<00:02:12.260> ago<00:02:12.430> so<00:02:13.430> I

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
Oxnard California two months ago so I

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.520 
Oxnard California two months ago so I
think<00:02:13.580> that<00:02:13.940> we<00:02:14.180> when<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:14.720> ask<00:02:14.900> teachers<00:02:15.320> what

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
think that we when you ask teachers what

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.380 
think that we when you ask teachers what
they<00:02:15.680> need<00:02:15.920> they<00:02:16.310> say<00:02:16.820> they<00:02:16.970> need<00:02:17.000> three

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
they need they say they need three

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.700 
they need they say they need three
things<00:02:17.420> we<00:02:17.840> did<00:02:17.960> a<00:02:18.020> major<00:02:18.200> study<00:02:18.470> with<00:02:18.680> the
