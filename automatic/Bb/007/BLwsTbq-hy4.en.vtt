00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:07.790
 Hello everyone, I will review 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.889
 German heavy tank tiger models 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.090
 Here we have this set 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.090
 gift set 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:22.320
 model number 3646 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:27.390
 star manufacturer look at the box 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:32.070
 and on the model we have 24 1 centimeters when 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.800
 135 item goes in the set so since 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:41.010
 this is a gift set we have glue in 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.840
 set and brush paint and glue yes 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.500
 it's worth saying what you have just 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:51.600
 seen or production 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.340
 that is, an early version of the tank proceed as 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.800
 to 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:01.670
 a review of the model 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.670
 paint brush and glue 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:11.180
 Well, such a delivery is convenient here for us 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.960
 the manufacturer offers four options 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.740
 paint colors 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.430
 this is german yellow olive acrylic 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:24.090
 black acrylic blued steel and woody 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.000
 Acrylic also comes with an adhesive 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:33.829
 so red 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:35.780
 and tassel tassel number two is round 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.690
 synthetics written 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:44.210
 such a brush so 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:50.710
 while for this side so we will proceed 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.710
 open the box to the tank itself 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:11.010
 so here we have the tank set itself we 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:14.040
 includes instructions on the first page here 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:18.420
 see the image of the tank brief 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:24.500
 historical background from saying that the tank 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:27.360
 was developed in 1942 by henschel 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:32.210
 us also tools that 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:41.150
 we will need when assembling here nippers 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:43.800
 knife and tweezers on the second page we have 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.940
 all sprues that are included are shown 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:53.270
 set yes no 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:57.320
 DÃ©colle so on we go already 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.320
 step by step and assembly 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:08.730
 everything is described in detail all the steps 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:15.760
 numbered so I think of questions 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:21.900
 with the assembly will not occur such 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.900
 the whole tower area is going to corpus 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:33.549
 instruction yes here at the end we have 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:39.549
 suggested coloring options here either 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:42.180
 so was not another option but it will be 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.720
 already such a final stage therefore 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:49.569
 all ahead 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:55.379
 so while laying aside here with us 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.379
 there is another instruction 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:03.010
 I have been thinking how to paint but that's 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:08.790
 This manual offers an option. 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:12.909
 four-color paint model gas already 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:17.829
 every detail of the girl and the color which 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:18.699
 her proposed to paint with that too 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.609
 will get 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:25.870
 a little later and now consider the details 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:28.810
 tank so here we have here the most so 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.560
 close up detail of this lower part 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.560
 tank hull 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:45.119
 so next we have 

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:55.119
 upper case if 

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:58.799
 the tower is further such here we have decal 

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:58.799
 go those 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.810
 cup type 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:19.010
 kia 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:23.710
 so here we have click on the details of the tower 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:32.600
 the quality is interesting 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:38.720
 good quality next sprue 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:48.460
 power smaller parts we have lattices 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:48.460
 engine compartment waiting for us 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.530
 other details 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:07.490
 such qualities are good until next 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.490
 poor big 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:14.389
 branched and here we are running 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:20.520
 part 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:31.490
 all undercarriage 2 double will not go in 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:41.669
 one wheel package is all so 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:45.210
 stayed with us sprue with caterpillars here 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:47.189
 we have probably one detail is already 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:52.039
 assembled single 

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:59.580
 such is the rest we will 

00:06:52.039 --> 00:07:03.529
 gather here such there are also two runner 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:06.330
 two half plates 

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:09.599
 he is also here a separate part on this 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:16.279
 the country and the same that we need 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:20.569
 gather in general it can be said that 

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:24.000
 quality model good quality set 

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:27.060
 but perhaps for a beginner build and and will 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.779
 quite complicated because there are a lot of 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.779
 small parts but try to collect
