00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.130
 mind they are animal lovers 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.650
 a member of the habib and england foundation infiltrated the circus 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.530
 I go to these scenes I remember 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.650
 these images are from the gasca brothers circus 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.100
 the same where they are thinking to take their children tomorrow Sunday 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.940
 the opera on 'the potato' animals night 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.440
 below the percent 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.040
 as 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.040
 and still 81 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.460
 so this is the way the gasca brothers circus protects the 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.860
 animals it is necessary to have meetings to understand that they are not only big 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.750
 violators of animal rights 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.010
 if not what deliberate and deceitful way they place posters in the light 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.010
 public where they say support you will not kill 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.070
 if it were known that the circus is mistreating animals would come otan circus 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.630
 I do not think so 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.860
 they are not the same goals that later they did not allow me to be recorded 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.860
 it will be that the blows are noticed 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.750
 know what you think about the animal abuse that many times some 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.750
 annoyances 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.280
 I think that's the most important thing 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.860
 It is important 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.990
 the circuses 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.060
 they do not even take into account the natural habitat or even the climate in which 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.339
 these animals would normally have been born and live 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.989
 the place had to fly over the African plain under the sunrise sun 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:22.539
 This king of the jungle huddles in a metal container under a snow 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:24.239
 ice cream maker 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.180
 a polar bear has to change the vast frozen desert a world in which 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.099
 would marry and nothing life for a cage in the back of a truck under a 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.489
 suffocating heat with only a small homemade fan to keep cool 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.280
 many times 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.700
 the animals die due to the mistreatment which the adverse conditions in which 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.269
 they live in these walking prisons 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.689
 like this giraffe 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:54.989
 who died in his absurd and inexplicable sentence 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.059
 but the circus 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:59.219
 makes sure that the public does not find out about his death 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:03.019
 but how to remove such a large animal without the public noticing 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.639
 here is the answer 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.639
 they quartered 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.849
 we know that other animals feel just like humans 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.179
 they feel afraid 

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:17.649
 loneliness 

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:21.019
 which animal would choose to live in captivity if it had a choice 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.170
 We knew this in this decision to never visit this kind of 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:27.190
 spectacles 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.320
 could be the difference and the noble life of thousands of animals subjected to 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.689
 injustice 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:33.749
 of course 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:37.919
 not to take their children to witness this incognito show
