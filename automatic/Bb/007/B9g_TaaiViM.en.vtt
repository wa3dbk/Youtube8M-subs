00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.318
 I'm hot. 

00:00:12.983 --> 00:00:14.115
 I'm a big. 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.853
 No. No! 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.331
 June 17, 1995 

00:00:27.972 --> 00:00:29.690
 My name is Daniel Lugo 

00:00:29.993 --> 00:00:31.702
 and I believe in good physical condition. 

00:00:37.452 --> 00:00:40.109
 It all started because it was time to push myself harder. 

00:00:41.804 --> 00:00:45.713
 Otherwise, I would be doing a sporting job at work for the next 40 years 

00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.700
 Mr. Hubble, are you using steroids? 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.450
 I think they broke me. 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.305
 Do not worry, we are experts in this. 

00:00:54.702 --> 00:00:56.444
 I'm a self-made man. 

00:00:56.567 --> 00:00:57.752
 I have made a lot of money. 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.981
 Perhaps you should spend some on a salad. 

00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:03.690
 Do you know who invented the salad? Poor people. 

00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:07.202
 What happens; 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.100
 Were not you tired of being here where you are, Adrian? 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.350
 No, I like it here. 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.300
 Weights are new ... 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.574
 I mean our lives. 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.216
 When was the last time you paid the rent when it was supposed to? 

00:01:15.526 --> 00:01:16.967
 I have a plan to change that. 

00:01:19.256 --> 00:01:20.344
 Who did you punish your friend? 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.400
 North. 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.000
 Are you in for a job now? 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.750
 You can not kidnap someone and take them. It's illegal. 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.800
 And of course we can. 

00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:30.900
 Viktor Kirsch is a criminal dick 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.776
 which deserves bad things to do. 

00:01:33.398 --> 00:01:35.263
 If we do no one will not hurt, okay? 

00:01:35.418 --> 00:01:36.506
 No. We grab him. 

00:01:37.128 --> 00:01:38.128
 There he is! 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 We catch him. 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.900
 Puts a few signatures. 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.741
 We give him a protein shake. 

00:01:44.743 --> 00:01:46.040
 He will not even know what happened. 

00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:48.579
 I have seen many movies, Paul. I know what I'm doing. 

00:01:49.871 --> 00:01:53.756
 The Sam Jim gang managed to get all your fortune. 

00:01:53.912 --> 00:01:55.310
 What are you doing now? 

00:01:55.611 --> 00:01:57.217
 Now I get a job. 

00:02:09.607 --> 00:02:10.806
 I have to inflate. 

00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:12.249
 So. 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.500
 It hurts I know it. 

00:02:14.736 --> 00:02:15.979
 So, no. 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.550
 You said no violence. 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.450
 And I meant it when I said it. I swear. 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.700
 -I can not kill. - It was recorded. 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.400
 Look when everything is over we will all go camping. 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.800
 -Okay; -Good.
