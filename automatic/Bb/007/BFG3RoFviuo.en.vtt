want to make sure there's no lipstick
because<00:03:11.910> even<00:03:12.810> though<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.290> Hobart<00:03:13.770> a<00:03:14.360> m14

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
because even though the Hobart a m14

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.010 
because even though the Hobart a m14
industrial<00:03:16.950> sanitizer<00:03:17.580> is<00:03:18.000> pretty<00:03:18.420> amazing

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
industrial sanitizer is pretty amazing

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.090 
industrial sanitizer is pretty amazing
it<00:03:19.800> can't<00:03:20.190> get<00:03:20.370> lipstick<00:03:20.790> off<00:03:21.470> even<00:03:22.470> 150

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
it can't get lipstick off even 150

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.700 
it can't get lipstick off even 150
degrees<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:24.180> if<00:03:24.330> there's<00:03:24.570> lipstick<00:03:25.020> you'll

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
degrees so if there's lipstick you'll

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.620 
degrees so if there's lipstick you'll
take<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.070> sponge<00:03:26.520> and<00:03:26.880> you'll<00:03:27.150> rub<00:03:27.420> the

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
take a sponge and you'll rub the

take a sponge and you'll rub the
lipstick<00:03:28.020> off<00:03:28.170> make<00:03:29.040> sure<00:03:29.250> there's<00:03:29.460> not<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:29.880> lot

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
lipstick off make sure there's not a lot

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.210 
lipstick off make sure there's not a lot
of<00:03:30.300> food<00:03:30.660> particles<00:03:31.290> because<00:03:31.710> that's<00:03:31.920> what

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
of food particles because that's what

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.270 
of food particles because that's what
fills<00:03:32.670> up<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.390> strainer<00:03:33.930> so<00:03:34.740> you<00:03:34.800> might<00:03:35.010> want

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
fills up the strainer so you might want

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.610 
fills up the strainer so you might want
to<00:03:35.340> slight<00:03:35.670> rinse<00:03:35.970> but<00:03:36.780> if<00:03:36.900> it's<00:03:37.080> if<00:03:37.350> they're

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
to slight rinse but if it's if they're

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.400 
to slight rinse but if it's if they're

not heavily soiled with food or lipstick
why<00:03:40.920> I<00:03:40.950> need<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.370> do<00:03:41.490> is<00:03:41.640> put<00:03:41.850> them<00:03:42.000> upside<00:03:42.360> down

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
why I need to do is put them upside down

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.040 
why I need to do is put them upside down
now<00:03:43.560> one<00:03:43.770> thing<00:03:43.980> that's<00:03:44.160> important<00:03:44.730> for

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
now one thing that's important for

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.510 
now one thing that's important for
filling<00:03:46.050> the<00:03:46.200> basket<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.860> be<00:03:46.980> washed

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
filling the basket to be washed

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.450 
filling the basket to be washed
is<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:48.420> hot<00:03:48.690> water<00:03:49.020> and<00:03:49.350> sanitizing<00:03:50.340> agent

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
is the hot water and sanitizing agent

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.370 
is the hot water and sanitizing agent
needs<00:03:51.270> to<00:03:51.540> be<00:03:51.660> able<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.960> go<00:03:52.140> on<00:03:52.530> all<00:03:52.980> sides<00:03:53.520> of

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
needs to be able to go on all sides of

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.380 
needs to be able to go on all sides of
what's<00:03:55.380> being<00:03:55.680> cleaned<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:56.760> you<00:03:56.820> do<00:03:57.030> not<00:03:57.150> want

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
what's being cleaned so you do not want

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.780 
what's being cleaned so you do not want
to<00:03:57.540> pack<00:03:57.840> these<00:03:58.110> in<00:03:58.380> so<00:03:58.650> close<00:03:58.860> water<00:03:59.280> can't<00:03:59.640> go

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
to pack these in so close water can't go

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.390 
to pack these in so close water can't go
between<00:03:59.970> them<00:04:00.390> so<00:04:01.080> instead<00:04:01.500> you<00:04:02.130> want<00:04:02.310> to

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
between them so instead you want to

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.729 
between them so instead you want to
space<00:04:02.640> them<00:04:02.700> out<00:04:03.060> just<00:04:03.900> for<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.260> dishwashing

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
space them out just for the dishwashing

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.690 
space them out just for the dishwashing
cycle<00:04:06.080> so<00:04:07.080> that<00:04:07.350> when<00:04:07.739> the<00:04:07.950> hot<00:04:08.130> water<00:04:08.160> hits

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
cycle so that when the hot water hits

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.970 
cycle so that when the hot water hits
them<00:04:08.940> it'll<00:04:09.750> be<00:04:09.870> straight<00:04:10.260> from<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.620> bottom

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
them it'll be straight from the bottom

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.300 
them it'll be straight from the bottom
and<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.550> top<00:04:11.580> and<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.330> sides<00:04:12.600> you<00:04:13.530> also<00:04:13.739> can

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
and the top and the sides you also can

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.199 
and the top and the sides you also can
put<00:04:15.169> things<00:04:16.169> like<00:04:16.320> cutting<00:04:16.739> boards<00:04:17.220> but<00:04:17.880> don't

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
put things like cutting boards but don't

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.470 
put things like cutting boards but don't
block<00:04:19.160> you<00:04:20.160> know<00:04:20.280> don't<00:04:20.520> pile<00:04:20.790> them<00:04:21.060> on<00:04:21.180> so

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
block you know don't pile them on so

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.520 
block you know don't pile them on so
that<00:04:21.660> that<00:04:21.690> things<00:04:22.560> are<00:04:22.770> blocking<00:04:23.070> each<00:04:23.400> other

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
that that things are blocking each other

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.890 
that that things are blocking each other
once<00:04:25.530> it<00:04:25.740> is<00:04:25.830> full<00:04:26.660> we<00:04:27.660> drag

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
once it is full we drag

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.270 
once it is full we drag
are<00:04:29.410> trimmed<00:04:29.860> down<00:04:31.440> so<00:04:32.440> that<00:04:32.680> it's<00:04:32.830> ready<00:04:33.009> to

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
are trimmed down so that it's ready to

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.610 
are trimmed down so that it's ready to
be<00:04:33.400> pushed<00:04:33.669> in<00:04:33.970> but<00:04:34.600> we're<00:04:34.780> still<00:04:35.020> waiting<00:04:35.229> for

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
be pushed in but we're still waiting for

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.840 
be pushed in but we're still waiting for
our<00:04:35.949> Hobart<00:04:36.669> to<00:04:36.880> actually<00:04:37.300> come<00:04:37.539> up<00:04:37.570> 2<00:04:38.130> to<00:04:39.130> 150

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
our Hobart to actually come up 2 to 150

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.510 
our Hobart to actually come up 2 to 150
degrees<00:04:40.289> now<00:04:41.289> this<00:04:41.470> was<00:04:41.650> actually<00:04:41.830> heating<00:04:42.400> up

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
degrees now this was actually heating up

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.670 
degrees now this was actually heating up
earlier<00:04:42.940> so<00:04:43.270> it's<00:04:43.419> it's<00:04:43.810> heating<00:04:44.320> up<00:04:44.410> pretty

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
earlier so it's it's heating up pretty

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.090 
earlier so it's it's heating up pretty
fast<00:04:44.979> it's<00:04:45.389> 118<00:04:46.389> but<00:04:47.110> again<00:04:47.380> you<00:04:47.530> want<00:04:47.650> to<00:04:47.770> wait

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
fast it's 118 but again you want to wait

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.629 
fast it's 118 but again you want to wait
until<00:04:48.250> it<00:04:48.460> says<00:04:48.639> 150<00:04:49.449> or<00:04:49.570> 152<00:04:53.100> you<00:04:54.100> can<00:04:54.310> stack<00:04:54.610> a

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
until it says 150 or 152 you can stack a

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.540 
until it says 150 or 152 you can stack a

they really do get in the way so we have

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.100

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
central spikes and those are the best to
