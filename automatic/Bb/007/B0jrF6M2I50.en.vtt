00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.620 
weapon where it is weird how it's stored
whether<00:01:49.649> it's<00:01:49.860> safe<00:01:50.130> or<00:01:50.369> not<00:01:50.490> whether<00:01:51.270> there's

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
whether it's safe or not whether there's

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.020 
whether it's safe or not whether there's
persons<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.829> house<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.130> shouldn't<00:01:53.909> be

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
persons in that house that shouldn't be

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.389 
persons in that house that shouldn't be
near<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.390> weapon<00:01:54.840> or<00:01:55.290> not<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.950> think<00:01:56.250> that

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
near that weapon or not it I think that

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.069 
near that weapon or not it I think that
it<00:01:56.579> will<00:01:56.729> add<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.990> community's<00:01:58.439> safety

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
it will add to the community's safety

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.749 
it will add to the community's safety
