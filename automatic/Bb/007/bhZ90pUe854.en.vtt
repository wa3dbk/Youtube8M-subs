each product incorporates into each step

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.380 
each product incorporates into each step
normally<00:01:34.560> you'd<00:01:34.710> start<00:01:35.009> with<00:01:35.070> step<00:01:35.460> 1<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:36.270> we

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
normally you'd start with step 1 but we

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.700 
normally you'd start with step 1 but we
don't<00:01:36.540> have<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.720> lot<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.930> standing<00:01:37.350> water<00:01:37.409> on

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
this properties so that's why we chose

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.999 
this properties so that's why we chose
