00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.060 
spoke design very good looking wheel and
I'm<00:01:12.600> gonna<00:01:12.720> let<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.900> guys<00:01:13.049> hear<00:01:13.740> what<00:01:13.799> it

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
I'm gonna let you guys hear what it

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.190 
I'm gonna let you guys hear what it
sounds<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:15.590> think<00:01:16.590> there's<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.799> bit<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.040> a

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
sounds like I think there's a bit of a

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.160 
sounds like I think there's a bit of a
break<00:01:19.200> rub<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:21.320> but<00:01:22.320> I'm<00:01:22.470> not<00:01:22.640> sure<00:01:24.170> as

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
break rub going on but I'm not sure as

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:50.109 
break rub going on but I'm not sure as
it<00:01:25.350> stops<00:01:25.650> kind<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.040> sudden<00:01:27.979> anyway

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.749 

that's<00:01:51.200> 120<00:01:52.200> points<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.799> engagement

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
that's 120 points of engagement

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.399 
that's 120 points of engagement
I<00:01:53.790> believe<00:01:54.780> hope<00:01:55.080> and<00:01:56.420> Orick<00:01:57.420> risking<00:01:57.780> our<00:01:57.960> 96

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.830 

so<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.500> can<00:02:01.710> tell<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.009> difference<00:02:02.340> right

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
so you can tell the difference right

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:20.580 
so you can tell the difference right
away<00:02:03.840> when<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.320> pedal

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.080 

so<00:02:21.590> yeah<00:02:21.710> that's<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.130> new<00:02:22.250> i9<00:02:22.580> torch<00:02:22.910> wheel

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
so yeah that's the new i9 torch wheel

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.350 
so yeah that's the new i9 torch wheel
and<00:02:23.360> or<00:02:24.140> chub
