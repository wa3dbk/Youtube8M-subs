00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
 hunt a pigeon you say to me like 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.580
 bell to all boys pieces for traits 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.809
 on my December channel between TV 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.490
 finally after a while guys 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.699
 first of all I wanted to thank you for 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.710
 the weight review video really is 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.830
 you had an absurd involvement is 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.939
 in fact I'm very happy you left 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.410
 lots and lots of comments from you 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.070
 they would like a boy's need 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.180
 your turn will come sooner or later 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.880
 in the description of the text 20 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.770
 comically 20 lay a month of ju ne 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.550
 you have left almost two centers of 200 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.310
 if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.840
 so they should be 10 and video e 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.970
 10 as mentioned last time become 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.800
 long and gets ugly because you do the 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.760
 things a little in a hurry so I prefer 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.740
 so we do 30 like every 30 likes 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.150
 I will do a based review so more has 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.620
 practically in that case they would be 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.210
 almost 7 we do 7 beasley views for the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.850
 Next video them today however we are here 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.309
 with ver rice dinner we returned with 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.960
 the mercenaries guys because I wanted to 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.090
 bring you the only tanks but 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.760
 I really did n't feel like right now 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.830
 bring it I prefer to bring you the mercenaries 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.780
 still guys because today they have one 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.190
 quite complicated mission like 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.790
 see on my map I have no people 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:26.190
 ie below the level 50 50 54 51 56 51 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.610
 and 51 the rest there is nothing left because 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.170
 i'm bringing the i brought the national 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.520
 at level 20 and I'm a warrior 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.320
 at the last level boys then 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.330
 be prepared that in just over three 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.030
 days you'll have gameplay on warriors 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.590
 at maximum level but we do not anticipate not 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.840
 let's worry about this we have one 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.780
 only chance to find someone 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.850
 lower level nothing only level 50 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.850
 let's see how its defense is put 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.409
 guys I know it sounds like I know it's easy 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.299
 for the two for our mercenary friends 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.220
 but it is the easiest of all because i 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.659
 others are really too complicated 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.830
 there this has a very long name 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.990
 therefore it will be called anna anacleto 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.490
 anacleto ide is called he us 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.280
 practically a close relative of 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.039
 anacleto that of the sword in the stone 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.190
 even this is not difficult in theory 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.569
 it's not that complicated 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.810
 let's do so then since this 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.680
 this does not seem very difficult to me 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:26.100
 honestly too easy 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.750
 let's do so let's try this one here no 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.250
 this guy doesn't give me too many 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.560
 I keep it for next time 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.360
 so we're going to face the today 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.180
 our friend he is called name 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.650
 very short so I would say luca luca by 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.150
 luca 6 best 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.070
 luca from china if you're watching us 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.200
 luca from china and i salute you oh 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.269
 if you're not looking at it anyway 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.269
 then let's see the main things immediately 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.330
 to chase away then this one has 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.030
 too many attached but what a beauty 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.760
 attached together with looks looks how it is 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.330
 It was nice to leave us pro-budget 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.950
 shocks and guys at a level because if 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.360
 it takes so many shots for me 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.370
 pull it down 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:10.319
 it means that the level is not for sure 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.360
 low let's see now let's do one 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.430
 what I would do in the meantime I would raise 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.079
 down to the warriors immediately 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.610
 obviously kids will die right away like 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.959
 always so much and we have fun with 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.489
 our warrior friends who break 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.110
 all that they smash from 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.240
 machine guns from cannons from the morning 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.400
 take a breath then we pull this off 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.350
 that is not explosive that this too 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.510
 seems a really great level 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.550
 exaggerated perfect gone down 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.540
 surely he will have succeeded shoot 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.610
 let's leave this and this to me until 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.500
 which is not exclusive cicciotta i 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.790
 Warriors do not care 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.950
 let's do so here in the middle of it 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.660
 we remove from the boxes is perfect 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.160
 remained the rocket launcher than if anyone 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.380
 he probably won't destroy it 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.390
 he destroys us that shot off me but 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.880
 sorry but what level was the base not 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.490
 I looked at two word spear choc ha 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.370
 only a rocket launcher but the tremendous 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:03.910
 what flame thrower has just me 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.680
 all disintegrated and are called i 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.209
 so warriors are we are without 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.340
 warriors but I would say that this base is 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.800
 was very easy peasy les murs crisis 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.209
 we really really destroyed it 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:17.890
 really but really fast 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.000
 we have also lost very few troops 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.919
 boys so I would say 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.320
 we do so today we make you do well 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.390
 two missions we immediately do at 12 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.660
 diamonds who if we see if there 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:31.540
 we can see stewie steve steve 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.070
 steve and this already more complicated 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.280
 guys we see that level hides the level 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:40.090
 6 level 7 with this defense statues 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:44.110
 see tar tare to a worm 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:46.810
 oh well let's do something we stick to 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.120
 martin see martin luther king 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.040
 the perfect team beasts with duplicate 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.960
 we stay here here guys it's okay 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.700
 you know something who cares even though 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.520
 he really gives me so many 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:01.690
 resources, however, I do a little gnaw there 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.490
 only he remains and I would say yes maybe 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.150
 we see a means of tampering at the level 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:10.960
 55 in fact it is in fact no feasible 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.400
 it is indeed bile va well you know one thing 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.470
 we attack it we attack ours 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.500
 friend anacleto and how I had called him 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.060
 before I didn't remember the name anymore 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.669
 then to a blaster choc 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.430
 I don't know if we'll make it this time though 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.760
 I'd say let's try then 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.570
 first of all this 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:32.030
 perfect for a shock throw and even outside 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:35.860
 use but how nice but made us a 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:38.210
 give this away this perfect one 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.240
 then the main thing to take out 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.550
 out of boxes this here because it's that 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.310
 which in my opinion makes us more harm here 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.020
 perfect we want on the 3 strokes I leave 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.500
 that the sonic explosives but for now 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.150
 we can risk, however, we throw down 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.650
 all together via candia moos in 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.970
 detail according to the last mission of the 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.990
 our mercenary friends who are today 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.520
 they feel in form 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.160
 what not even boys has 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.770
 fired did not shock my rifleman 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.480
 there really is scarce as no difference 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.170
 melange gone okay that would kill me his 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.880
 maximum level 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.000
 but for a canon I cannot give a 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.820
 rifleman is an obrobrio and not launched 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.100
 really I bother me at all 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.370
 those three things worry more than anything else 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:22.280
 there that I now distract ok 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.810
 distracted perfect I would say medical kit here 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.270
 In this area 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.390
 they are distracted I would throw a nice maybe 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.890
 flooded not made very badly announced 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:33.410
 we pull them away from us 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.970
 by the little perfect this went down 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:38.150
 we are almost there 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.710
 here we launch the criteria ok perfect e 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.340
 I would say that even this base guys with 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.960
 a strategy that really does like it 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.740
 says practically holes in the water from 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.570
 every where 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.120
 this is better than we am 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.070
 love and bumi I would say that now it is 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.740
 once we have gone, let's help them one 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:57.600
 let's pull everything up here via crisis 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.820
 everywhere if we do to throttle 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.940
 our friend anacleto laughs if he is 

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:05.610
 gone home would you think peace of 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:08.340
 split iss well our boys 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.980
 mercenary friends for today also have 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.390
 finished their wonderful mission 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:14.850
 I hope we liked the video 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:17.490
 guys is the next video of bumblebees there 

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.110
 will be another country view I will take 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.550
 guys comments at home from last 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.680
 video we made of the bass review 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:26.130
 you see really many left 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:29.910
 so I'll make it 78 in a video 

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:31.980
 obviously guys I go by chance to take 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.390
 the names because you are so many me 

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.790
 I am very happy with this because 

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.140
 series I want it to last as long as possible 

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:41.120
 we'll see you in the next video from 

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.120
 bombaci is all peace house
