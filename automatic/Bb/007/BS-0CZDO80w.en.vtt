00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.590
 after we had what we wanted was 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.870
 that refer me, raise your hand and 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.150
 somehow finish the fight without 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.040
 no doubt and that's how it was and the truth 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.470
 I'm very happy I was about to 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.590
 retire but well I think that as 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.149
 I said there is divine justice and up 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.149
 that the revolution did us justice 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.370
 the key answer of happiness of 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.370
 Mexican there we are 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.640
 we will confirm but there are problems for 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.640
 look at us 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.530
 about the last sequence of blows 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.830
 of pacquiao to try that 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.830
 kickback 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.340
 well we are working from that hand 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.890
 right I said that this movie is going to be 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.020
 very important the change was a minimum 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.170
 that it was going to be important and that's how it was 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.970
 that it was wrong for him to dare to throw 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.610
 blows is any entity ended me 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.840
 they counterattacked I resulted from 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.119
 that I'm against it because when he 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.470
 launched the yacht or I put his rope and 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.910
 it has the right where I connected it 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.910
 pretty solid and the fight is over 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:53.200
 when I was finishing the best and 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.210
 I was looking to dominate at that time 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.420
 with the Mexican here comes the third 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.420
 Question 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.280
 he asks me how he feels finally 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.530
 manny pacquiao you had not got it 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.050
 in his previous combats as he grew up 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.660
 I feel happy, I think that 's the 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.519
 willing work and thanks to be 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.790
 stinging stone I think that here they are 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.790
 the results 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:31.560
 happiness and luis gold had not been able 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:33.640
 to be today the natal choir finally ends 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.360
 creepy cash of those that 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.360
 they will go down in history 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.910
 h 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.260
 with audio sponge 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:04.370
 it's perfect for your career 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.700
 I believe that a great victory a great 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.630
 effort that was made by not while 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.360
 let's rest 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.430
 we do not know what's coming we're going to rest 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.920
 let's enjoy celebrating the triumph 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.290
 with the family with all my people in 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:40.420
 Mexico and the truth that we are thinking 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:52.690
 that you do not have to imagine perfectly 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:55.110
 that is destroying when another one comes 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.110
 Question 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.920
 do not be the little ones to each other 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.400
 on the radio 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:22.380
 and it's being picked up that there was not 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.180
 lists that could not fight with the 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.890
 terror hit with manny pacquiao because 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.890
 I was at risk of getting knocked out 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.160
 it was not the fight I had to fight 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.160
 when the ship 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:45.249
 l 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:47.120
 yes no s 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:58.760
 the distance 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:05:00.560
 absolute is precisely a pedophile and 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.260
 it was very difficult to get it in a 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.850
 chronic in this type of fights you have 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.040
 that use a lot of intelligence that 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.139
 intelligence the most important thing and that was 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.970
 what got it out intelligence 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.360
 boxing speed and all that 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.360
 we had prepared 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:22.720
 answering the questions of the 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.720
 reporters give us a brief pause
