00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hi guys, I'm good, I want to give you a 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.680
 Message to you that is mother and grandmother who is 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.050
 nanny 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.670
 what the big sister and anyway you that 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.530
 shower the baby 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.139
 how do you do to take this 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.090
 the bathtub so as not to leave a 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.330
 is what you do to draw with 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.609
 Security is complicated right now 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.560
 requires much of our attention is not 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.340
 I need to be very careful not to give anything 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.859
 wrong 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.670
 a lot of people put a towel here like this 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.640
 huh 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.710
 then you can balance with a hand 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.870
 holds the child against a pull 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.610
 towel and there the middle of it said 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.780
 slip off and play with it 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.230
 so what's my tip today is you? 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.930
 turn your towel on apron 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.789
 So you wear like that, you will not 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.370
 wet as before 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.239
 Can this child get this animal? 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.000
 safely. 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:03.359
 wrap the towel with nothing wrong 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.060
 If no one falls on the ground, it's all gone. 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.530
 The safest you think the tip is well 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.790
 easy to do 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.790
 that's how it looks 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.120
 Very well here is my towel. 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.430
 I noticed that on one side it has a 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.800
 line is not covered with a ribbon 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.810
 and on the other side already had two 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.140
 embroidered ribbons then I chose that side 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.479
 to be my part of this rock here 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.270
 I made two markings already you can 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:48.350
 see I did it with chalk because here I need 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.110
 approximately 20 and 25 centimeters 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.410
 maximum're so what I did 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:58.160
 I came from outside in. 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.590
 I marked 17 centimeters here too. 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.080
 same thing 17 centimeters and total 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.960
 here with 23 centimeters 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.590
 ok then this us - an average that has 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:14.239
 to have then I got 30 cm and 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:17.110
 I will mark it as the ruler there of the seam 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:22.489
 So far down to 30 centimeters looks 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:24.860
 also here and macu 30 now I'll call 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:30.680
 point to the other 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:33.440
 So he's against each other because 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.750
 here is going to be the cava is the part that I 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.750
 I'll cut and create my apron. 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:45.650
 So for you to understand the time I 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:47.959
 cut the area and cut it too. 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.019
 area then I already have the top part here 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.680
 and it finishes in my apron what we go 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.680
 cut then 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.370
 After everything is cut, it's time for you. 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.819
 to the finish here in're side 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.440
 So either you fold here or you make a 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.959
 sheath leads machinet 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.239
 or you do a zigzag seam 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.360
 or you pass a culture of overlock tÃ¡ 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.730
 must have this finish so that 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.000
 undo here on the side 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.860
 Good, and then you'll do it. 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.030
 put tape on how do we go 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.030
 put tape 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:39.319
 you will reserve 60 centimeters 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:43.290
 first it reserves 60 centimeters 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:50.040
 put tape on the early side and comes 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:54.810
 with the film and the whole area here 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.890
 You 'll put an end to it, then 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.750
 I 'm already here 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:03.440
 simulating how it would be that part 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.599
 arriving here you will reserve 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.630
 45 centimeters from gets clogged stay 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:13.650
 pass around his neck who booked 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:17.090
 45 centimeters of tape there begins again 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:20.879
 here in the beginning is u 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.430
 There are mothers who prefer it from here. 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:25.440
 Fixed way is a unique young thing 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.430
 to put the head in is more practical 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.800
 more ready to use others prefer 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.470
 cut and tie at the time then half 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.270
 of the criterion you formanda as you 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.210
 like it better 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.900
 and then you come back here with the 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.990
 same process and getting down there goes 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.860
 set aside another 60 centimeters of 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.610
 ribbon 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:54.270
 okay that this tape with the other 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.289
 O that here these two will turn on 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.580
 your waist 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:03.590
 so it 's just the simple assembly, right? 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.590
 Now we just have to sew, let's go. 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:12.150
 because already sewing dinho is only missing 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.759
 ironing the iron to seat seam and is 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.979
 Of course I'm going to burn looking at the 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:20.729
 end of the tape to not undo 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.169
 also because it's personal this is 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.469
