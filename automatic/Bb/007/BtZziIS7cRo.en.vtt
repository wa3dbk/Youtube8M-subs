00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.280
 very important to discharge the high voltage 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.459
 of the pacifier on the televisions before 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.269
 perform a repair and disconnect from 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:11.269
 the electrical network 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.700
 the problem that this television presents 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:23.130
 of the brand sylvania is that it does not tune in 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:26.100
 the channels there are problems so that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.099
 grab the cable signal then let's go 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:32.880
 to look for him to see what the problem is 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:35.130
 and look for the problem and also look for the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.739
 solution waiting for this video then 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.430
 be useful in case you find 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.430
 the problem 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.020
 the problem that this television presents 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.000
 of the brand sylvania is the following the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.880
 TV turns on 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.600
 but they do not respond 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.720
 the keys to change the volume 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:06.390
 changing channels only works on 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.390
 power button and menu button 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.719
 but here if I want to increase in volume 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.030
 because there is no signal nor for the 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:16.870
 channels I will check to see what is the 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.150
 problem to share 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.150
 the problem that the television has here 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.970
 I'm going to show you the conditions of 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.170
 dirt in which this TV is 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.170
 of the brand silvania 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.730
 these are the conditions in which 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.440
 This TV 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.860
 let's see if we can solve the 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.860
 problem 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.049
 it's time to wash the card with water 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.880
 pressure and leave it in the sun for 3 or 4 hours 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.269
 it has to be the super super sun 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.980
 hot so it is very dry and not 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.200
 there is no problem this work has 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.140
 done many times and it works 100% if 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.989
 have one the proper precautions 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.879
 I also removed the Tunisia antenna for 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.670
 Do not get wet, I'm done from here 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:28.940
 test all the buttons 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.069
 they are all giving me what they are in 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.110
 short but this does not mean that all 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.790
 so bad but with one that is wrong or 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.700
 short is causing the problem in 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.829
 all and that is the reason why I can not 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.269
 increase in volume or decrease in volume and 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:47.540
 change channels here last will 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.010
 hear how it sounds kill the alarm when not 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.549
 I should whistle when it 's so good 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.549
 must whistle 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.549
 you just have to whistle until you 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.549
 press the button then I will remove 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.379
 the poles because there has to be one 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.230
 among all that is bad and is 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.819
 causing the problem 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.620
 after reviewing the entire button 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.500
 I found that all the buttons are 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.860
 well then I got here to change the 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.350
 tunisia antenna 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:21.250
 which is pretty 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:23.730
 rusty and I put here a be in 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.730
 better conditions 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.390
 waiting for that to be the problem 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.750
 Once the problem is the tunnel that was 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.240
 causing as a cord the one that does not 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.700
 will change the channels then 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:43.120
 since I changed this if you follow the same 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.600
 problem then the problem is this 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.600
 integrated 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.390
 at this point and the card is fine 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.180
 close it's time to install it and try 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.379
 the television let's see the difference 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.989
 this tunnel antenna is already very run with 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.990
 much corrosion while it is 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.430
 it is sanita 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.430
 and this what we are going to put 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.740
 Well, let's see how he behaves 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.220
 this TV to see if it already works a 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.530
 once we change another 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.860
 and another thunder antenna in better 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:34.100
 conditions it seems that if he had wet 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.530
 they wet it and it was rusted and 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.140
 the parts were damaged 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.660
 internally then let's hope that with 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.660
 this new antenna you no longer work 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.580
 once I changed the tunnel antenna 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.220
 new the television and it has changed well 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.600
 channel 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.600
 things that I did not do before 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.880
 a was left working 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.930
 Well, here it is already repaired to another 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.640
 TV brand and the SilvÃ¡n 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.160
 Model no I'll leave you in the 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.590
 video description 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.490
 I had a problem that I did not tune in 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.390
 well the channels 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.780
 the problem is that 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.700
 it was damaged 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.430
 the antenna box was damaged 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.400
 tunnel it seems that on some occasion 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.400
 He dipped do not know how the thing was 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.120
 thing that I had pretty well-known him 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.900
 I changed another 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:02.449
 another box was from another one of others 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.729
 modern television but this 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:07.910
 just guide me by the amount of 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:11.510
 legs and the measure and was 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:13.699
 exactly and it worked it worked 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.130
 perfectly then here we have the 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:19.790
