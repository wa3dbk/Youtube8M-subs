00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.680
 people remembering that this one the attack 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.820
 of the lions you are in their channel if

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.390
 attack before before you see the end 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.799
 of the video you go there on the channel and 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.960

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.579
 You'll see what it came out like that was 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.210
 our attack when it takes us to a 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.820
 died 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.380
 we both one for the attack the moment we 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.780
 He's going to die for the people about the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.610
 and then you follow the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.500
 channels and from there you can learn 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.950
 one of the table tennis channels is that 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.170
 It's then I'm going to attack here and the artur 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.720

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.240
 So, everybody, come on, let's go. 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.920
 there we will see if replay and galley will connect 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.079
 I started touching the goals and the people 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.680
 I had five seconds so I went there and here. 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.649
 in the river 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.509
 up there you see and step them out 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.420
 from tony beer had a star 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.420
 guaranteed tac aspects there is the goal to 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.150
 frantic team and there was a lot of 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.459
 beating 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.739
 troops resolved to attack the beam of fury 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.659
 the breaks behind the queen cane 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.459
 that later also in the bauru river 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:24.099
 turned the corner and we will see 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.590
 will steal will make with him the 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.510
 queen and even hell x beast o 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.239
 debased the troops of 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.209
 castle cleone this was very bad in 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:37.510
 true but okay I froze again 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:40.390
 there things are in the middle and let's go 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.680
 I almost collided in the middle of life 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.349
 there we go 35% and he recovered life 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.810
 how strange his activity is then 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.639
 he is now beating the winter born 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.769
 which is very dangerous because it can 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:56.530
 end up getting sick by staying on the line 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.720
 front of that and dying so let's go 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.319
 his life is quite large so that is 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.019
 helping him a lot he's very 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.069
 little life now and will die died 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.599
 I canceled the attack 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:13.720
 That's it guys 53% and now let's 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.489
 show the percentage that the artur 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.650
