materialistic<00:00:35.969> well<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.660> believe<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.530> does

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
materialistic well I believe it does

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.950 
materialistic well I believe it does
talk<00:00:38.070> about<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.610> but<00:00:39.420> that's<00:00:39.629> what<00:00:39.780> I'm

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
talk about that but that's what I'm

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.240 
talk about that but that's what I'm
feeling<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.920> talking<00:00:41.219> about

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.530 
feeling is that it is talking about
money<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.850> more<00:00:42.059> important<00:00:42.450> is

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
money but the more important is

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.799 
money but the more important is
abundance<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.700> in<00:00:44.700> becoming<00:00:45.420> more<00:00:45.690> of
