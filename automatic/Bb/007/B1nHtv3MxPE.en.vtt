so Nathan here's a problem why it
doesn't<00:00:58.460> compete<00:00:58.760> with<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:59.000> mazdaspeed3<00:00:59.630> or

aspirated<00:01:17.510> engine<00:01:18.229> it<00:01:18.530> will<00:01:18.710> not<00:01:18.920> compete

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
aspirated engine it will not compete

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:00.540 
crazy throttle tipping where it makes

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.910 
crazy throttle tipping where it makes
you<00:07:00.660> think<00:07:00.900> the<00:07:00.990> car<00:07:01.200> is<00:07:01.290> fast<00:07:01.530> and<00:07:01.740> then<00:07:01.830> it

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:01.920 
you think the car is fast and then it

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.150 
you think the car is fast and then it
really<00:07:02.130> is<00:07:02.220> yeah<00:07:03.120> yeah<00:07:03.510> and<00:07:03.960> what<00:07:04.560> happens<00:07:04.980> is

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:08.820 
power in that really all right let's see

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.840 
power in that really all right let's see
if<00:07:08.880> you<00:07:08.940> can<00:07:09.060> go<00:07:09.150> faster<00:07:09.510> than<00:07:09.540> 12<00:07:10.640> ready<00:07:11.640> guys

Oh<00:07:13.370> once<00:07:14.370> again<00:07:14.610> by<00:07:15.330> my<00:07:15.540> mind<00:07:15.830> it's<00:07:16.830> a<00:07:16.920> lot<00:07:17.190> of

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.220 
Oh once again by my mind it's a lot of

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.610 
Oh once again by my mind it's a lot of
power<00:07:17.670> to<00:07:17.850> my<00:07:18.180> 40<00:07:18.630> and<00:07:18.930> then<00:07:19.140> the<00:07:19.380> lack<00:07:19.590> of

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 
power to my 40 and then the lack of

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.650 
power to my 40 and then the lack of
horsepower<00:07:20.280> really<00:07:20.730> starts<00:07:21.030> to<00:07:21.150> show<00:07:21.270> through

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 
horsepower really starts to show through

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.120 
horsepower really starts to show through
yeah<00:07:22.230> it<00:07:22.380> doesn't<00:07:22.530> even<00:07:22.650> come<00:07:22.890> close<00:07:22.920> to

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.130 
yeah it doesn't even come close to

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:31.460 
yeah it doesn't even come close to
redline<00:07:23.430> when<00:07:23.730> it<00:07:23.820> shifts<00:07:24.000> either<00:07:30.470> exactly

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:31.470 
redline when it shifts either exactly

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.380 
redline when it shifts either exactly
the<00:07:31.560> same<00:07:31.800> time<00:07:32.040> folks<00:07:32.310> exactly<00:07:32.520> the<00:07:33.150> same

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:33.390 
the same time folks exactly the same

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.660 
the same time folks exactly the same
time<00:07:33.690> usually<00:07:34.140> it's<00:07:34.320> a<00:07:34.470> a<00:07:34.680> millisecond<00:07:35.520> off

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:35.670 
time usually it's a a millisecond off

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:38.780 
time usually it's a a millisecond off
but<00:07:35.970> no<00:07:36.180> not<00:07:36.390> just<00:07:36.570> well<00:07:36.720> 0.78<00:07:37.650> two<00:07:38.130> times<00:07:38.430> that

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:38.790 
but no not just well 0.78 two times that

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:39.830 
but no not just well 0.78 two times that
is<00:07:38.910> the<00:07:39.000> first<00:07:39.240> time<00:07:39.390> that<00:07:39.510> has<00:07:39.630> ever<00:07:39.720> happened

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 
is the first time that has ever happened

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.230 
is the first time that has ever happened
so<00:07:40.260> I<00:07:40.620> think<00:07:40.770> it<00:07:40.919> is<00:07:41.750> there<00:07:42.750> you<00:07:42.930> have<00:07:43.110> it<00:07:43.260> the

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 
so I think it is there you have it the

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.550 
so I think it is there you have it the
2013<00:07:45.240> Lexus<00:07:45.780> LS<00:07:46.500> is<00:07:47.130> like<00:07:48.060> a<00:07:48.090> business<00:07:48.720> jet<00:07:49.320> it

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 
2013 Lexus LS is like a business jet it

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.550 
2013 Lexus LS is like a business jet it
is<00:07:49.830> button-down<00:07:50.669> and<00:07:50.700> absolutely<00:07:51.660> slick<00:07:52.350> when

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 
is button-down and absolutely slick when

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.530 
is button-down and absolutely slick when
it<00:07:52.650> comes<00:07:52.860> to<00:07:53.010> taking<00:07:53.280> an<00:07:53.520> executive<00:07:54.090> from

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:54.540 
it comes to taking an executive from

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.290 
it comes to taking an executive from
point<00:07:54.750> A<00:07:54.840> to<00:07:54.870> point<00:07:55.020> B
