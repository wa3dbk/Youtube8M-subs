00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 friends welcome to cnec and how are you? 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.210
 asked today's tutorial to grow well 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.210
 so learn 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.869
 so come on, the first thing that I 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.730
 I want to tell you, it's dirty black. 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.279
 do not have to do so there are three 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.039
 one with practical options that they 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.560
 piece of paper put it under the eye day 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.830
 are appropriate for this purpose, so that everything 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.130
 the black meat gets paper you take away 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.210
 another option can put part of the eye the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.030
 baby powder 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.059
 I do not know where the shadow's black haired is going. 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.559
 fall in this powder and then save and has 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.480
 the last option that is my favorite 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.579
 I 'm very worn out if that 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.920
 It's already a matter of worrying. 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.989
 with nothing left fell pretim in the eye 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.480
 then moistened wipe to 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.640
 Take this advantage and help here at 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.140
 format in the corner of the eye and pass 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.809
 corrective to finish 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.219
 I always felt when we spent a 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.960
 that she did not have much 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.010
 Drive it when I want too 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.840
 very black 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.439
 I spent gloomy stay the way I 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.770
 I wanted to stay a little foggy. 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.270
 ready 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.490
 then to give more movement to the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.680
 pass a pencil first before the shadow 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.990
 all calm and do not expect a 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.759
 Turn that will not get bad there is an option 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.080
 Good cause they're creamier. 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.670
 possible that you will have spread 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.030
 china is so bad 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.040
 without fear can serve whole eyelid 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.650
 without fear of being happy and without fear of 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.000
 to be horrible with always loving 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.000
 smart ass 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.680
 when you want it darker 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.119
 it looks like I got punched in the eye 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:00.539
 Now we'll pay it, it 'll mark 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:05.799
 so solid way I'll use the brush 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:16.450
 mineral sheron of the strain to achieve 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:18.819
 spread this bug do not worry 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.530
 much in the format of this base that the 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.000
 people are creating because really only 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.130
 to be a basis for later when he 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.620
 pass the black shadow is well're pretÃ£o 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.209
 so important now is you being able to 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.530
 to spread as much as you can 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.660
 get up lifting just a little bit 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.660
 concluded by making another eye 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:55.100
 now we go up and pretend 5 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:59.270
 Why I'll use it is the blackout of nike 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.640
 to the band following key with the same brush 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:06.230
 Whatever I was using, I'll get it. 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.530
 It haunts the line a lot and 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.530
 bay 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.569
 and now with the sigma top brush and 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.569
 25 flights shoot and start creating 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.019
 frankly formatted eye catch again 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.019
 blackout 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.500
 just this 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.180
 I also like to smoke with a 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.069
 a little brown because it gives a certain 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.390
 lightness in the corner and helps and killed himself in 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:02.800
 I'll pass the stick then and also 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.660
 the same palette with my top and 25 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.080
 There are no problem situations yet. 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.080
 black 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.360
 to the bottom and needs a 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.440
 brush retinha so ask for help 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.600
 in the application 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.230
 I'll get the mak blackout and I'll 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.230
 to control 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.030
 as you may have noticed here in the 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.140
 At last I joined with our 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:48.270
 estimated to create one thing only 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.950
 now I'll pass my pencil even though I 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.120
 I used the base that I forgot to talk to 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.210
 she is not 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.510
 is school revenge in the inner part 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.510
 of 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:07.329
 Wow 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.740
 before passing the mascara on top down 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.750
 I'll clean with it, if I decide to 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.770
 I messed down here and enjoy and 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.770
 give a shit here 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.520
 the collective I'm going to use today damha 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.800
 quinlan pretty white bag here because 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.600
 I want it to be very clear. 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.610
 under the eye to highlight the 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:36.310
 chest that I put again I do not 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.470
 I use this collective on a daily basis because I 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.510
 I found it very heavy and stayed bedridden. 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:45.750
 so it's good to use it only at night, I go 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.750
 apply using 1,190 machine 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.510
 now just pass on the name of your 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.730
 preference 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.800
 If you like to be this post, this is 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.890
 a good time to use it because you have 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.770
 but although we'll even get it 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:15.060
 appear and if it is so black I will use it only 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.060
 died because I prefer 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:35.680
 I think I use the medium where color is always 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.680
 Bad said he using my was the topic 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:43.340

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:53.150
 half a mile from the top of the 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:54.919
 button when I exaggerate 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.110
 Look, it's dark, I prefer it. 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:07:01.550
 a lighter color then I'll pass 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:04.630
