00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.949
 a server where the prizes 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:10.529
 So 

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.529
 Your character has promoted 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.309
 in crisis 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.890
 the warrior with the archer 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.609
 on Thursday the 15th 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.880
 today there will be a very good game and this is the problem 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.710
 when it left 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.230
 people to them 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.390
 also that they cursed him 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.390
 were really the case. 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.540
 because with the arrival of the internet at this time 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.140
 a lot of people in the group 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.670
 the internet already duck the physical form minc 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.120
 divided 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.610
 absurdly 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.020
 what was you invite a friend that I have home played videogame 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.790
 same effect 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.150
 It's very clear, of course, that people 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.150
 poor internet 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.020
 You end up with a lot of people outside. 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.530
 the drought of the contingent that the whole world 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.269
 family until 31/7 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.710
 - I believe the net - you end up playing confused with the captain of pm 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.120
 Do you think Bentes loses a little English? 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.120
 you maybe a little of the German cacao has a bit of it 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.360
 You end up learning several dead languages. 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.010
 It is a positive point that disproportionately exaggerates a fact 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.010
 There are people here talking about 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.240
 what internet 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.150
 made to conquer 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.320
 candy play video game and totally lost the sense of the cabinet was 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.720

 shakuri psp playstation 3 and billed in the last four 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.630
 What I think is that these inter a playstation network 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.400
 but in the case of export aip 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.860

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.440
 old games to play 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.440
 then in the beckham campaign ended up filling and 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.519
 before the two games 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.519
 were considered the best of 2009 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:19.779
 a modern man to speak after 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:22.029
 in October of 2002 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:25.029

 are two great games for playstation 3 marx 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.819
 he is a little limited 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.529
 the scenario whistles with a friend you to help him count with friends what 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:38.529
 You have to play well. 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:46.089
 the player 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:48.919
 the player 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:52.329
 in high 97 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.199
 already the site fighters 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:56.329
 site fighters also acts 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.659
 after playing 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.139
 What happened was the following 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.799
 people who played even consortium 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.609
 great majority has created what the pc 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:07.489
 and they're done 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.939
 taking advantage 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.609
 this myth on the internet 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.609
 I play the games will still be Christian 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.129
 but the vast majority of these people still rain 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.639
 soccer 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.689
 another 7 thousand kilos of coca cola from the controls 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:27.709
 and not because 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.049
 and has that bluetooth technology 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:31.499
 ended up winning 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:34.499
 I feel an interesting way of fighting. 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:37.579
 this segment d 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:38.460
 four 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.430
 curitiba formerly the ps you played in four people so comparing 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.059
 its modest 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:46.929
 You put it side-by-side, yes. 

00:03:46.929 --> 00:03:50.389
 it provokes but the controls but I never got to buy and also never 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.849
 I got nautical 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.899
 in the next game 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:57.059
 maybe game 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:00.059
 soccer 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.650
 I find very interesting LED technology and movement 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.889
 but it went away design christmas that also is not no more correct watchtower 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.659
 kinect 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:16.799
 recently 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.900
 more scarce and killer but form the seat of gameplay 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.689
 by agreement the people around you 

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:25.139
 interesting 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.139
 Kenya has a way 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.180
 the projectile or kinect 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.860
 the president 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.830
 misguided age characteristics of the product and 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.490
 balance 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.559
 the public saw it was a very good team 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:42.559
 very lucid chest the securities rose 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.020
 ends up being a risk 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.730
 escorted by city agents you also symbolically the letters 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:55.110
 port 27 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.949
 the guri to the children's audience 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.469
 I do not think it started has been 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:00.889
 I felt on the thirst site. 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:02.039
 one day 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.900
 surely he compares to a monthly fee there 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.900
 according to the inscription here 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:15.339
 to contain maxim 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:21.379
 therefore 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.930
 Sonik 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:30.909
 then the other 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.909
 a quotation 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:41.349
 the time to shut up 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:44.379
 this is the point where they are buried in 2009 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.580
 there 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:02.939
 yea 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:11.759
 - have 

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:24.680
 it's a time of the entourage the son with certainty 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.789
 would jeopardize the increase in the UN level 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:28.659
 infomoney 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:33.119
 and tapurah and this is the benfica way where I was deciding if they would split 

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:34.520
 although what 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.569
 making goals and lost contact with his friends 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:38.770
 around you 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.809
 Good people, this is my vision. 

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:42.379
 Who has solved it? 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:44.449
 how was the evolution of the games 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:47.449
 as guests 

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:50.300
 and as such this with the victory 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.710
 summers that there was a misunderstanding 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.710
 everybody would have no science 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.059
 do you play video game 

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:03.679
 with his friends about whether he suddenly loses contact with the pins with the 

00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:05.229
 family with 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:08.649
 we count on it 

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:10.949
 it is a pity 

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:13.059
 that is becoming aware of 

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:13.629
 but it's true
