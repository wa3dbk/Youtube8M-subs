record now is 60 and

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.140

on<00:02:10.200> next<00:02:11.129> gen<00:02:11.280> fifa<00:02:11.489> so<00:02:11.790> we<00:02:11.909> are<00:02:12.000> still

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
on next gen fifa so we are still

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.880 
on next gen fifa so we are still
unbeaten<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.810> we're<00:02:13.140> going<00:02:13.439> really<00:02:13.769> really

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
unbeaten and we're going really really

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.949 
unbeaten and we're going really really
strong<00:02:14.340> but<00:02:14.549> obviously<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.180> had<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.689> do<00:02:15.780> is<00:02:15.840> I

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
strong but obviously I had to do is I

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.350 
strong but obviously I had to do is I
had<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.260> pick<00:02:16.379> up<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.650> king<00:02:16.860> at<00:02:17.069> Thierry<00:02:17.909> Omri

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
had to pick up the king at Thierry Omri

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.149 
had to pick up the king at Thierry Omri
for<00:02:18.569> seven<00:02:18.780> hundred<00:02:18.840> coins<00:02:19.110> i<00:02:19.379> may<00:02:19.860> get<00:02:20.040> him

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159

with<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.519> hunter<00:02:21.329> chemistry<00:02:21.659> style<00:02:21.900> him

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
with the hunter chemistry style him

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.089 
with the hunter chemistry style him
because<00:02:22.379> he<00:02:22.439> doesn<00:02:22.650> t<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.739> little<00:02:22.920> bit<00:02:23.010> more

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
because he doesn t a little bit more

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.920 
because he doesn t a little bit more
pace<00:02:23.310> in<00:02:23.489> my<00:02:23.579> opinion<00:02:23.819> i<00:02:24.030> will<00:02:24.360> pick<00:02:24.599> up<00:02:24.780> a

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
pace in my opinion i will pick up a

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.250 
pace in my opinion i will pick up a
Evans<00:02:25.530> from<00:02:26.010> sounders<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.120> we<00:02:27.780> need<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.959> few

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
Evans from sounders and we need a few

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.509 
Evans from sounders and we need a few
more<00:02:28.349> backup<00:02:28.560> players<00:02:28.950> because<00:02:29.250> we<00:02:29.370> are

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
more backup players because we are

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:30.860 
more backup players because we are
players<00:02:29.760> finished<00:02:30.150> with<00:02:30.239> running<00:02:30.480> load<00:02:30.659> and

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
players finished with running load and

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.809 
players finished with running load and
scored<00:02:31.590> finishes<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:31.980> coming<00:02:32.280> by<00:02:32.370> buying<00:02:32.640> them

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
scored finishes I coming by buying them

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.339 
scored finishes I coming by buying them
so<00:02:32.970> I'd<00:02:33.329> rather<00:02:33.540> have<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.840> team<00:02:34.049> that<00:02:34.079> could

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
so I'd rather have a team that could

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.500 
so I'd rather have a team that could
swap<00:02:34.530> around<00:02:34.799> a<00:02:35.040> lot<00:02:35.609> first<00:02:35.909> I<00:02:36.120> mean<00:02:36.299> we<00:02:36.420> can

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
swap around a lot first I mean we can

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.780 
swap around a lot first I mean we can
get<00:02:36.599> more<00:02:36.750> games<00:02:36.989> out<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.260> them<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.790> initially

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
get more games out of them and initially

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.750 
get more games out of them and initially
expected<00:02:39.090> we<00:02:39.599> go<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.810> second<00:02:40.170> episode<00:02:40.470> though

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
expected we go to second episode though

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.890 
expected we go to second episode though
another<00:02:41.760> guy<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.030> does<00:02:42.239> not<00:02:42.329> full<00:02:42.569> chemistry

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
another guy that does not full chemistry

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.780 
another guy that does not full chemistry
only<00:02:43.079> 40<00:02:43.500> or<00:02:43.590> him<00:02:43.739> though<00:02:43.889> and<00:02:44.099> here's<00:02:44.579> got

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
only 40 or him though and here's got

only 40 or him though and here's got
Chamakh<00:02:45.239> a<00:02:45.420> left<00:02:45.690> midfield<00:02:46.109> so<00:02:46.230> that's<00:02:46.440> where

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
Chamakh a left midfield so that's where

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.930 
Chamakh a left midfield so that's where
you<00:02:46.650> went<00:02:46.739> wrong<00:02:46.920> from<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.310> very<00:02:47.400> beginning

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
you went wrong from the very beginning

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.819
