the<00:01:15.280> actual<00:01:15.700> burner<00:01:16.540> itself<00:01:16.990> I<00:01:17.380> said<00:01:17.890> where

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:17.980 
the actual burner itself I said where

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.850 
the actual burner itself I said where
the<00:01:18.070> magnet<00:01:18.460> comes<00:01:18.610> in<00:01:18.850> this<00:01:19.750> piece<00:01:20.020> here<00:01:20.320> fits

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
the magnet comes in this piece here fits

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.210 
the magnet comes in this piece here fits
on<00:01:21.070> and<00:01:21.370> basically<00:01:22.320> allows<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.620> wind<00:01:23.890> guard

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
on and basically allows the wind guard

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.580 
on and basically allows the wind guard
to<00:01:24.790> see<00:01:25.000> in<00:01:25.210> position<00:01:25.690> without<00:01:26.080> too<00:01:26.410> much

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
to see in position without too much

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.570 
to see in position without too much
laughing<00:01:27.160> about<00:01:27.340> fact<00:01:27.670> it's<00:01:27.910> very<00:01:28.090> simple<00:01:29.580> it

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
laughing about fact it's very simple it

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.800 
laughing about fact it's very simple it
should<00:01:30.760> kind<00:01:30.910> of<00:01:31.030> what<00:01:31.120> you<00:01:31.180> want<00:01:31.360> for<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.630> wind

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
should kind of what you want for a wind

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.080 
should kind of what you want for a wind
guard<00:01:32.020> angle<00:01:32.650> it<00:01:32.710> to<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.860> wind<00:01:33.040> we're<00:01:33.910> very

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
guard angle it to the wind we're very

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.490 
guard angle it to the wind we're very
lucky<00:01:34.210> this<00:01:34.450> morning<00:01:34.840> we<00:01:34.960> ever<00:01:35.110> really<00:01:35.350> got

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
lucky this morning we ever really got

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.990 
lucky this morning we ever really got
any<00:01:35.650> we're<00:01:36.160> getting<00:01:36.490> run<00:01:36.970> along<00:01:37.210> go<00:01:38.910> onto<00:01:39.910> the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
any we're getting run along go onto the

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.600 
any we're getting run along go onto the
pan<00:01:40.210> comes<00:01:40.570> with<00:01:40.720> a<00:01:41.130> plastic<00:01:43.650> bowl<00:01:44.650> used<00:01:45.340> for

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
pan comes with a plastic bowl used for

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.030 
pan comes with a plastic bowl used for
cooking<00:01:46.240> whatever<00:01:46.930> you<00:01:47.170> wish<00:01:47.970> it's<00:01:48.970> one<00:01:49.119> side

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
cooking whatever you wish it's one side

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
the pan is kind a bit of the clever bit

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.340 
the pan is kind a bit of the clever bit
because<00:01:52.930> what<00:01:53.320> it's<00:01:53.440> got<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.869> bottom

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
because what it's got is this bottom

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.639 
because what it's got is this bottom
flux<00:01:56.710> ring<00:01:57.040> system<00:01:57.640> now<00:01:57.850> this<00:01:58.119> here<00:01:58.450> is<00:01:58.869> an

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
flux ring system now this here is an

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.660 
flux ring system now this here is an
aluminium<00:02:00.180> corrugated<00:02:01.180> ring<00:02:02.460> basically<00:02:03.460> when

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
aluminium corrugated ring basically when

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.730 
aluminium corrugated ring basically when
you<00:02:03.790> seek<00:02:04.060> that<00:02:04.090> on<00:02:04.360> sort<00:02:04.570> of<00:02:04.630> stove<00:02:04.899> the<00:02:05.440> heat

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
you seek that on sort of stove the heat

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.160 
you seek that on sort of stove the heat
goes<00:02:06.369> up<00:02:06.610> goes<00:02:07.000> into<00:02:07.300> here<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:09.149> aluminium

transfer the heat extremely efficiently

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.330 
transfer the heat extremely efficiently
into<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.340> pan<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:19.630> even<00:02:20.350> on<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.530> low<00:02:20.860> setting

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
into the pan so even on a low setting

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.150 
into the pan so even on a low setting
you<00:02:22.060> get<00:02:22.269> an<00:02:22.810> amazing<00:02:23.230> amount<00:02:23.500> heat<00:02:23.890> getting

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
you get an amazing amount heat getting

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.920 
you get an amazing amount heat getting
into<00:02:24.400> there<00:02:24.580> in<00:02:24.730> other<00:02:24.850> words<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.269> can<00:02:25.480> really

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
into there in other words you can really

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.590 
into there in other words you can really
eke<00:02:26.080> out<00:02:26.260> your<00:02:26.440> gas<00:02:26.650> on<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:27.160> high<00:02:27.489> setting<00:02:27.600> this

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
eke out your gas on a high setting this

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.539 
eke out your gas on a high setting this
thing<00:02:28.900> really<00:02:29.350> boils<00:02:29.980> fast<00:02:32.220> last<00:02:33.220> but<00:02:33.430> not

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
thing really boils fast last but not

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.309 
thing really boils fast last but not
least

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.309 

you<00:02:36.920> get<00:02:37.099> a<00:02:37.129> lid<00:02:37.370> clear<00:02:38.510> she's<00:02:38.810> always<00:02:39.109> use

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
you get a lid clear she's always use

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.259
