00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.990
 hello everyone frost and today us 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.740
 just a super wonderful mod which 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.000
 allows us to control the time to 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.950
 today we can become the lord 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.860
 in time it may sound strange 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.080
 but we are the lords of time and can do 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.760
 with him all we want in this to us 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.580
 will help several new accessories 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.400
 who add this mod they are very 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.710
 look like a clock but it's done here first of 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.890
 do them in such a way is not cheap 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.950
 Kraft would say very cheap but they 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.250
 justify themselves and pay back the first hours 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.350
 us 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.450
 integrated does not allow and stop 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.730
 and speed up the time twice well and also 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.180
 set the time in the usual for us 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.920
 forms and so include the first with us 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.690
 mode is slowing down 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.369
 we slow down twice a day 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.740
 becomes twice as long as night two 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.490
 times longer everything happens twice 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.890
 slower 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.350
 blocks break 2 times slower on 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.479
 we can look at the beautiful explosion 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.610
 dynamite creepers or something like that on 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.140
 beautiful and graceful running pigs 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.630
 slow motion view though not some 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.390
 bowleg pork and we go to 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.110
 next mode he accelerates us 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.209
 twice we also move fast like 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.280
 also two times faster than normal day 

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:36.869
 getting two times shorter 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.580
 moves twice as fast all 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.349
 breaks it is very useful if we 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.319
 for example, you need to drip some 

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:45.390
 resources you dig mine in general shock 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.009
 what work to do or catch 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.160
 run away travel 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.319
 look at maybe somehow dull 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.869
 landscapes although here I am not so special 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.030
 often meet you do not want well or 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.860
 you just need to save time as 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.569
 their time not playing them fast 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.970
 somewhere to reach pasta already 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.929
 habitual landscape which already 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.940
 seen enough 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.920
 and you are not interested in watching well 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.099
 next just install 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.900
 we are used to the next time 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.660
 accessory watches which 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.030
 sprinkled with sugar to strange craft 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.489
 Cause sometimes and sugar that will be with them 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.410
 Well, it's the same magic clock and they 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.600
 allow us to accelerate six times yes 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.880
 seems to be at 6 although maybe 4 figs knows 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.700
 how to determine but it seems to be written 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.110
 which in 6 allows us 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.000
 accelerate six times a day becomes 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.250
 six times shorter than night six times shorter 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.880
 pigs at six times faster than your like 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.560
 quickly died i mean i go there once and 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.560
 we can already dig very efficiently 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.420
 mine main bottom digging something extra not 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.799
 run into the logo tula we also 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.440
 quickly flood and we can not forget 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.400
 that could have been moving as fast also 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.549
 six times faster 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.310
 like you and the reaction unlike your 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.170
 they are as fast as real 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.819
 time that you will not tell and I 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.000
 I doubt that you will be as fast 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.830
 respond as with slow motion or 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.560
 with accelerated time, the reaction is still 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.600
 will be worse and so we also turn them off and 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.660
 we get our usual habitual to you 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.489
 next time we have a clock slow 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.390
 do not do it this way 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.130
 their snow 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.780
 I hope they do not spoil again. 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.799
 getting wet but it's magic to them in general 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.890
 no difference 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.170
 they allow us to slow down time in 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.040
 six times here we move very very 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.040
 slowly we can for example epically kill 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.319
 skeletons dodge them 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.900
 arrows while responding to this and 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.730
 for example look at the epic explosion 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.920
 dynamite and what we actually now 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.840
 and make here dynamite here lever run 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.349
 rather not 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.780
 and and pika pika pika pika water flowed 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.550
 where are you skeleton worry bursting with 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.690
 bones and 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:02.519
 epic explosion but okay we turn it off so 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.019
 we returned to normal time and we 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.610
 last hours left 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.819
 the skeleton also came out to look at 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.400
 epic explosion well skeleton how are you epic 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.379
 super nice yes i knew how handsome 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.290
 well I will come back to you and me 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:18.720
 do you treat up to swing go well I hope you 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.120
 you will not make mistakes and we turn to 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.700
 the next super epic watch that 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.620
 allow us to move like in a matrix 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.320
 remember how they jumped in the matrix with 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.750
 one house to another and a long long time 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.120
 swinging your legs to reach another 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.310
 at home and finally they gave Tallinn 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.690
 and it allows us to do the same 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.810
 we see 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:43.080
 I have activated already and we can also run 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.270
 Mach feet as soon as the feet of the soul can 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.280
 teasing allows us to jump very 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.000
 we can also jump epic far 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.669
 from house to house 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.199
 After all, and this I now click on fly 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.289
 to the house and by the way they turn us off 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:57.060
 overturns stirs up sick but weak 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:00.810
 it ends so quickly 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:03.270
 and ran jump epic jump i don't 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.479
 I'm not creative I just jump in 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.530
 matrix mode epically long jump 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:12.240
 blocks probably fifteen to twenty 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.770
 cool you can all jump well 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.930
 by the way it turns off if we don't 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.240
 to take any action if the if we 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.310
 standing here turned us up a little 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.700
 a little nauseous we'll go see 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.650
 what can we mock with these 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.840
 for hours for example the volume of skeletons only 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.310
 be careful the world loves constantly 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.730
 crumble when 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.530
 many mobs plus these hours of work in general 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.580
 manages to process and the world falls but 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.650
 nothing after that he cares 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.870
 run in general will be 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.650
 careful and by the way forgot to still show 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.720
 how do you craft these super watches and do 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.030
 for him in such a way they are one of 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.780
 the most expensive but they are one of the most 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.760
 epic 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.770
 so we made the night this one 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.240
 formidable leader and gatherers and 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.150
 attack as soon as i unplug myself 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.920
 creative and a little dressed up year they already 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.410
 each other knocking down so matrix matrix 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:04.260
 give me a matrix and a movie peak 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.330
 we will shoot an epic so not for me not by 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.810
 okay let me go to you too 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.400
 revenge 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.230
 take don't forget that if you 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.300
 going to beat slow mobs 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.510
 then your arrows for example just as slowly 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.600
 stretches you just as slowly hit 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.010
 but still it looks easy 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.360
 epic just see what peak 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.180
 kill each other 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.580
 they are just not in my opinion and we 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.950
 we can for example in our epic jump 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.020
 slightly turning around shooting them and 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.970
 continue to run very much too 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.580
 pandas arrow I do not need any channel I 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:38.460
 you joked you did not offer tea 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:41.820
 what are you doing no no no no I'm running away from 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:44.010
 you nasty skeleton no no not hit 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:46.590
 got on okay yawned with skeletons 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.900
 enough how they excuse me 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:52.320
 made a porcupine enough that's enough 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.570
 your friend is a friend of Opa opa pereubivali 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.970
 pickup putty robe it's time to tie with 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:59.390
 these epic shootings all 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.710
 boil in Minsk in the summer yet you came yes 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:06.050
 go figure them out 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:10.940
 here is the dynamics of the clock arranged here get 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:13.830
 run jump epic come on 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:16.040
 elegant one more bring so I already 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:21.510
 turn on creative roll back howl from me 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:24.930
 dangerous arrow and those get away you're mine gone 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:26.730
 hence ogreb to ogreb and this is my 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:28.850
 all now see how they explode 

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:32.100
 skeletons 

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:34.170
 gorgeous scattered just like in the matrix 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.700
 so what do I have it all for myself therefore 

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:39.440
 was frost subscribe rate 

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:43.340
 comment good luck to everyone bye 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.340
 get the skeleton out of here
