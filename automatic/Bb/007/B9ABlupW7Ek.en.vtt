 there on the site barrel of the dot com 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.479
 watched at home if you miss 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.940
 something if you're going to work 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:54.129
 went out, went to the gym, no problem 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.679
 they usually put the rerun also 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.109
 from the following day then let's see if 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:01.870
 they recorded it today it will be here 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:04.089
 12 hours 6 hours is on the website of 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.370
 new you can watch without problem 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.350
 so usually at night time zone is 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.600
 different I know it then it does not have 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.970
 problem if you have any commitments 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.910
 something else that I wanted to highlight and 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.760
 I really wish to speak here is the 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.950
 fitness category did not have this 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.860
 category last year they add 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.380
 this category is a great category and 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.590
 in which we have the great Brazilian there 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.840
 Do not you know Juliana Malacarne? 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.670
 will be competing and I think the 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.730
 Juliana MaracanÃ£ will lead 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.830
 in fact this title because because it 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.050
 It has already been competing for many years already 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.940
 You take a look at her history. 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:49.480
 You'll see, and last year, actually. 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:50.680
 she won the best pro 2010 2012 and 2013 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.360
 so she already won 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.550
 She's been earning a day pro for a long time. 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.790
 time it is in the new category 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.260
 good lady, and I think this is 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.780
 her name will also be competing 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.000
 in this same category but I do not think 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.620
 that the adam band on the line will lead 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.960
 in fact the title I think this 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.610
 title will stay with the other juliana 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.160
 title that I think will want a 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.620
 A person to get is Eduard, I guess. 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.769
 that Eduard deserved 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.420
 in fact last year I won 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.530
 unfortunately he did not win the we'll see 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.120
 in this year, how will it be 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.390
 His performance there I hope he 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.340
 also win in the mister barrel of 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.560
 true, I'll stay with Diego I think 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.560
 the vehicle and gains in fact I think 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.049
 that gave cooler is diego is the right reads 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.849
 I really like him, he is 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.069
 in a very good performance 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.280
 call me for sure it will come 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.739
 between the four is also very good 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.420
 hamas performance will not have I think 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.090
 which this year will be for vehicles 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.400

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.569
