00:00:00.318 --> 00:00:01.658
(typing)

00:00:01.658 --> 00:00:03.307
- [Nathan] The video
hadn't even been uploaded,

00:00:03.307 --> 00:00:04.959
and I was already getting
worried about people

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:06.564
revealing the secret,

00:00:06.564 --> 00:00:08.803
plus watching the video again,

00:00:08.803 --> 00:00:10.922
I started to doubt that
this would fool anyone.

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:11.755
- [Man] Goat in the water.

00:00:11.755 --> 00:00:12.745
- All I could do at this point

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:14.169
was upload the video,

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:15.560
and let the public decide.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.393
- [Man] Goat in the water.

00:00:16.393 --> 00:00:19.054
(dramatic music)

00:00:19.054 --> 00:00:20.376
- [Nathan] When I woke
up the next morning,

00:00:20.376 --> 00:00:22.568
I was astounded to see
the video had been posted

00:00:22.568 --> 00:00:26.203
on Gawker, eBaum's World, and
a Body Building message board.

00:00:26.203 --> 00:00:28.317
It had over 3,000 views

00:00:28.317 --> 00:00:30.978
and that was way more
then I ever expected.

00:00:30.978 --> 00:00:33.657
Then I saw it was climbing
the charts on Reddit.

00:00:33.657 --> 00:00:36.457
Then I checked the view
count an hour later.

00:00:36.457 --> 00:00:37.290
Holy Shit.

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.933
- By the way, this may
sound like a sea rescue,

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:44.098
but a goat, a baby goat
gets stuck in water.

00:00:44.098 --> 00:00:45.403
- This is some pig.

00:00:45.403 --> 00:00:46.511
You have to see it.

00:00:46.511 --> 00:00:49.327
A goat at a petting zoo
got stuck in a lake.

00:00:49.327 --> 00:00:50.922
- [Girl] This really happened.

00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:52.243
- [Woman] That was cool.

00:00:52.243 --> 00:00:53.725
- Have no fear, there's a pig there.

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:56.966
I mean, you couldn't do
this at Warner Brothers.

00:00:56.966 --> 00:00:58.928
As a cartoon, it would make it seem

00:00:58.928 --> 00:00:59.971
more realistic.

00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:02.342
- Where we were duty-bound
to pass this on.

00:01:02.342 --> 00:01:04.496
It's the leading web video today.

00:01:04.496 --> 00:01:06.275
While we have no way of knowing

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:08.446
if it's real, this was apparently shot

00:01:08.446 --> 00:01:09.957
at a petting zoo.

00:01:09.957 --> 00:01:12.848
That's a baby goat who got
out into too deep water,

00:01:12.848 --> 00:01:14.507
begins crying for help.

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.002
Enter this pig.

00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:20.138
(woman speaks in a foreign language)

00:01:20.138 --> 00:01:23.245
(cartoon in a foreign language)

00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:24.789
- [Nathan] It seemed like the whole world

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:26.666
was talking about my video.

00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:29.345
For a moment, I felt bad
because it wasn't real,

00:01:29.345 --> 00:01:31.450
but then I realized,
that that didn't matter.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.549
- Enter species.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.869
He wouldn't help.

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.277
Learn from it, humans.

00:01:35.277 --> 00:01:36.628
- [Nathan] In these cynical times,

00:01:36.628 --> 00:01:39.439
people are desparate for
something to believe in

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.330
and I gave people a reminder

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.996
that it's okay just to believe.

00:01:43.996 --> 00:01:46.203
- How did the pig free the goat?

00:01:46.203 --> 00:01:47.334
(chattering)

00:01:47.334 --> 00:01:48.748
(laughs)

00:01:48.748 --> 00:01:50.346
- Every day with Elizabeth it's like,

00:01:50.346 --> 00:01:51.587
"How did this happen?"

00:01:51.587 --> 00:01:54.200
- [Nathan] I always knew this
video was something special

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.606
and that's why in the end,

00:01:55.606 --> 00:01:58.158
I decided not to put the name
of the petting zoo on it.

00:01:58.158 --> 00:02:00.395
I didn't want it to
come across like an ad,

00:02:00.395 --> 00:02:01.636
you know, for the petting zoo.

00:02:01.636 --> 00:02:02.469
- Right.

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:03.632
- I'd rather be a bit transparent, so.

00:02:03.632 --> 00:02:05.921
- But of people would've known that it was

00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:07.544
Oak Tree Village (mumbles).

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:10.033
- But I mean, you can be so selfish.

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:11.124
- Selfish?

00:02:11.124 --> 00:02:12.847
- Well, I mean people love the video.

00:02:12.847 --> 00:02:16.577
It's like, it can't just
be all about the business.

00:02:16.577 --> 00:02:18.314
- But that's it was supposed to be,

00:02:18.314 --> 00:02:19.998
about when you first came up,

00:02:19.998 --> 00:02:21.599
it was supposed to be about the business.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.871
- [Nathan] Terry just
didn't seem to understand

00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:27.188
but I don't leave those
that I help empty-handed.

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:29.855
That's why I made her this sign.
