00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:13.230
 good this beautiful very big very strong 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:16.529
 brown check mare is a 2003 born 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.740
 is mare her name is blotch 100 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.410
 Burg is a wittlinger vors gate where 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.710
 a lot of daughter a checklist we used to 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.369
 times in use here and the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.239
 mother is fenja a grove axi woman 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.930
 Sandra daughter flea fax II is long 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:41.750
 years the stallion supported that 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.750
 Guttenberg had been a mercenary of mine 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.420
 worse is like you right now 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.000
 can already see directly 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.820
 a rather easy to ride mare 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.420
 may be that after a bit 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.159
 got it happening here 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.380
 something like that at least here on the track 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:21.409
 but you can still see that 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.409
 they quite simply too rare 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:39.680
 I should be a very big one 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:57.050
 strong horse extremely easy to get 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:02:03.320
 the horse here on the train is the clock 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:04.880
 and earl I do okay okay okay in 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.890
 terrain is often far away 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.649
 another good we have relieved 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.270
 now partially started 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.110
 it does not just turn into the slow one 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.870
 tempo in cologne , but also 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.350
 tried or a little more tempo 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.240
 at least in the terrain are sound intact 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.760
 because the individual works well already 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.930
 very good but here on the train sees 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.060
 I can hold them with one hand 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.500
 And now she is also after the partner 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.260
 then go to the beginning is now 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:42.980
 very easy and easy and pretty 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:45.430
 easy and quite a lot this 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.750
 easy to prepare goes everywhere 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.950
 makes everything comfortable to sit 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.840
 right now the whole time is here with one 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.880
 Hand of music improves when she thinks 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.810
 rappels the second hand to take 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:03.160
 and there the chart is very very much again 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.160
 sure there 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:16.430
 It can easily be rearranged in the 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:45.980
 trot well balanced evenly 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:50.030
 trot gallop on the straight or anyway 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:54.470
 in the terrain uphill no problem here in 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.780
 the curve's fairly difficult to them 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.210
 getting through the curve always 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.310
 could clearly see but it is 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.290
 in the end, no horse, too 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.760
 a choice belongs but removes something 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.410
 maybe over heavyweight man 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:14.200
 like to be very reliable easy too 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.200
 would like to have riding leisure partners 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:29.380
 and okay stain from brother's castle
