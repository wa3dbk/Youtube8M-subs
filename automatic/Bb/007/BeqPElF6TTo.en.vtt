00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:06.910
 Hi, people are the pepper glue and I came here. 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.010
 today especially to show you 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:13.360
 my new book that has just arrived that the 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:15.099
 Cinderella pop yesterday that his cover I 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.080
 I'll show you a little detail 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:21.550
 also from my eye I think 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:26.790
 it was very cute graphic design is 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.210
 full of tweets little notes 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.900
 posters 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.970
 well I'm crazy for you peter and him 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.990
 hands to see how it got 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:40.330
 end is to tell a little of this book I 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.340
 I have to tell you about another book first. 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.260
 what is the princess's book 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.090
 I think many of you should already 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.130
 know this book is a book that I 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.380
 I wrote about two years ago 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.360
 yesterday along with the store that Ameg keita 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.800
 everton and Patricia Cardoso each 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.960
 We have to choose one of the princesses. 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.690
 to do a modern rereading 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.820
 I chose exactly the cinderella only 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.590
 in the time of choosing if I stayed 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.329
 completely undecided because I love 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.290
 very 5 princesses 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:11.710
 the cinderella the sleeping beauty ariel a 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.990
 Snow White and the beautiful of the beast and to 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.770
 leave four behind I suffered a lot 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.130
 to make that choice yourself and is the 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.229
 staff remembered this when 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.979
 this book that came out and my readers 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.600
 began to praise my tale and ask for 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.460
 to write the history of the others 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.560
 princesses a continuation 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.970
 They are inviting me to ask if I 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.590
 I wanted to do some of these things 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.420
 write other 11 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.250
 princesses to continue only I did not want 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.930
 because I think the story already 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.220
 ended there in that lived happily 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.960
 forever 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.850
 but I did make history of the others 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.590
 princesses, why not 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.049
 It's how I told you I was super. 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.030
 Undecided then I found the maximum power 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.820
 write the story of others as well 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.350
 so last year he left the beautiful 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.140
 asleep my princess 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.799
 is asleep and will still write the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.619
 snow white the beautiful and the beast and ariel 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:08.140
 but this year is coming out exactly 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.960
 so it's the same story you have 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.330
 here but in much more detail 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.700
 and that was another suffering that I shot 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.140
 to write this here is because it was to 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.950
 be a short story and I like to write 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.710
 very 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.260
 so I preferred to write a story 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.880
 complete and cut parts for 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.570
 to be able to do it here anyway , 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.710
 very big but now I could 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.290
 to rescue my original story 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.690
 because it is exactly to compose the series 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.160
 of the princesses is not easy that I like 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.920
 We took this story, did not 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.170
 This is the story of this book and she 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.520
 here's the same story but with a lot 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.070
 more details I think it has 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.080
 approximately 40 pages more 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.170
 then you will know much more about the 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.020
 fred prince on mine and her too 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.910
 and I am anxious to know if you 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.560
 They will like it if they know who has read the other 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.440
 story you will like to know 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.750
 more about my characters 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.580
 for those who have not yet read this 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.890
 dgs of her yes she is one and she 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.800
 You will find her prince around there. 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.990
 do not miss a crystal slipper and more 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.200
 solid to see if I will not start the 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.960
 leaves here has a very nice detail 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.880
 I made this version for anyone who has read 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.760
 you know that in the end you have a 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.550
 music right that is spoken in the book is that the 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.050
 mentioned and what I did now I composed 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.020
 this song for those who do not know me too 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:35.110
 I'm a composer so I made the music 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.110
 I think it was very cute and 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.770
 people also recorded this song these 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.600
 You will know this song now I will. 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.480
 leave it at the end of the video for you guys 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.460
 listen to pop princess music 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.860
 I think that's what she wants to know if 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.320
 You do not like the music book then. 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.970
 write me by telling me about the releases and it 's 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.170

 of people writing projects so much 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.510
 unfortunately this time it was only the 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.100
 simplicity since the launch 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.190

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:55.030
 zero 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:59.500

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:04.770
