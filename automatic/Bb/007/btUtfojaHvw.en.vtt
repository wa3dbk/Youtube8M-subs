why<00:00:32.910> acrylic<00:00:33.390> paints<00:00:33.750> simply<00:00:34.200> because<00:00:34.500> Aguero

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
why acrylic paints simply because Aguero

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.910 
why acrylic paints simply because Aguero
paint<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.700> usually<00:00:36.300> used<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.809> date<00:00:37.170> only<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
paint is usually used to date only and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.920 
paint is usually used to date only and
it's<00:00:38.070> not<00:00:38.280> me<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.640> stick<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.059> your<00:00:39.180> nail<00:00:39.360> you

on<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.850> Stiletto<00:01:19.330> fake<00:01:19.870> nails<00:01:20.320> simply

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
on the Stiletto fake nails simply

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.040 
on the Stiletto fake nails simply
because<00:01:21.250> i<00:01:21.430> could<00:01:21.670> not<00:01:21.700> video<00:01:22.510> my<00:01:22.750> nails

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
because i could not video my nails

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
because i could not video my nails
because<00:01:23.410> it's<00:01:23.980> a<00:01:24.040> very<00:01:24.070> detailed<00:01:24.880> job<00:01:25.620> so<00:01:26.620> it

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
because it's a very detailed job so it

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.010 
because it's a very detailed job so it
was<00:01:27.250> really<00:01:27.400> hard<00:01:27.760> to<00:01:27.820> go<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.240> camera<00:01:28.630> i<00:01:28.660> was

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
was really hard to go the camera i was

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.830 
was really hard to go the camera i was
kind<00:01:29.350> of<00:01:29.410> embarrassing<00:01:30.130> so<00:01:30.490> i<00:01:30.760> had<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.390> be<00:01:31.540> very

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
kind of embarrassing so i had to be very

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.510 
kind of embarrassing so i had to be very
close<00:01:32.140> to<00:01:32.200> my<00:01:32.440> nails<00:01:32.680> so<00:01:32.830> i<00:01:32.890> couldn't<00:01:33.250> record

the<00:01:46.509> video<00:01:46.810> because<00:01:47.320> otherwise<00:01:47.590> it<00:01:47.890> would

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
the video because otherwise it would

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.210 
the video because otherwise it would
have<00:01:48.040> lasted<00:01:48.340> 15<00:01:49.030> minutes<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.590> i<00:01:50.830> draw<00:01:51.190> my

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
have lasted 15 minutes so i draw my

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.400 
have lasted 15 minutes so i draw my
designs<00:01:51.729> and<00:01:52.030> when<00:01:52.150> I<00:01:52.180> have<00:01:52.420> holes<00:01:52.750> at<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.200> end

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
designs and when I have holes at the end

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.040 
designs and when I have holes at the end
I<00:01:53.619> make<00:01:54.009> a<00:01:54.040> thin<00:01:54.490> grid<00:01:57.180> with<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.210> curl<00:01:58.540> you<00:01:58.869> can

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
I make a thin grid with the curl you can

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.710 
I make a thin grid with the curl you can
easily<00:01:59.290> make<00:01:59.740> really<00:02:00.460> really<00:02:00.910> thin<00:02:01.270> designs

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
easily make really really thin designs

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.230 
easily make really really thin designs
compared<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.320> acrylic<00:02:03.030> result<00:02:04.030> it's

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
compared to acrylic result it's

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.430 
compared to acrylic result it's
definitely<00:02:04.569> not<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.560> same<00:02:05.830> you

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
definitely not the same you

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.169 
definitely not the same you
you<00:02:08.440> cannot<00:02:08.710> feel<00:02:09.039> you'll<00:02:09.399> have<00:02:09.610> very<00:02:09.910> thin

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
you cannot feel you'll have very thin

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.350 
you cannot feel you'll have very thin
lines<00:02:10.450> with<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.780> queer<00:02:11.050> old<00:02:11.080> paint<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:13.209> only

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
lines with a queer old paint you only

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.780 
lines with a queer old paint you only
have<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:13.630> choose<00:02:13.959> extract<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:14.920> aquaria<00:02:15.550> and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
have to choose extract in aquaria and

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.240
