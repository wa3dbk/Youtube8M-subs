face sculpt in there and he does have
his<00:00:45.660> chain<00:00:46.289> gun<00:00:46.820> however<00:00:47.899> it's<00:00:48.899> incredibly

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
his chain gun however it's incredibly

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.319 
his chain gun however it's incredibly
difficult<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:50.010> get<00:00:50.430> him<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.730> pose<00:00:50.969> with<00:00:51.000> this

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
difficult to get him to pose with this

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.090 
difficult to get him to pose with this
thing<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.750> stand<00:00:52.079> because<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.620> balance<00:00:52.949> is

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
thing and stand because the balance is

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.569 
thing and stand because the balance is
so<00:00:53.340> off<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.629> whole<00:00:54.870> thing<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.350> mean<00:00:56.280> really

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
so off on this whole thing I mean really

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.010 
so off on this whole thing I mean really
the<00:00:56.730> only<00:00:56.820> way<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> get<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.480> stand<00:00:57.660> with<00:00:57.870> this

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the only way to get to stand with this

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.799 
the only way to get to stand with this
is<00:00:58.260> if<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.680> point<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.070> straight<00:00:59.340> down

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
is if you point this straight down

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.939 
is if you point this straight down
because<00:01:00.809> at<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.109> point<00:01:03.170> its<00:01:04.170> supporting<00:01:04.769> him

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
because at that point its supporting him

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.070 
because at that point its supporting him
um<00:01:07.790> it's<00:01:08.790> kind<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:08.970> got<00:01:09.119> all<00:01:09.270> these<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:09.869> got<00:01:10.049> a
