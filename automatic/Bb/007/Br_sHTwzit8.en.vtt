00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
what about the bullet go all the way

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.820 
what about the bullet go all the way
around<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:09.700> I<00:02:09.880> have<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.090> reload<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:10.630> mean<00:02:10.900> it's

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
very basic but also the idea behind my

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.730 
very basic but also the idea behind my
game<00:02:15.850> now<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:16.600> that<00:02:16.900> I'm<00:02:17.110> not<00:02:17.410> going<00:02:17.650> to

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
game now is that I'm not going to

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.730 
game now is that I'm not going to
include<00:02:18.100> any<00:02:18.340> hands<00:02:18.880> just<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.900> charm<00:02:20.290> my<00:02:20.440> child

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
include any hands just to charm my child

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.520 
include any hands just to charm my child
then<00:02:21.010> you<00:02:21.040> spell<00:02:21.640> or<00:02:22.240> just<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:22.990> god<00:02:23.200> without

I'll just probably include the hands but
there's<00:02:33.160> also<00:02:33.310> other<00:02:33.520> reasons<00:02:33.880> for<00:02:34.210> not

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.500 
can press f2 switch to open and I'll get
in<00:02:41.290> trouble<00:02:41.610> now<00:02:42.640> if<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.030> work<00:02:43.180> was<00:02:43.210> gonna

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
in trouble now if the work was gonna

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.440 
in trouble now if the work was gonna
have<00:02:43.660> hands<00:02:44.140> and<00:02:44.380> I'm<00:02:44.920> going<00:02:45.100> to<00:02:45.160> drop<00:02:45.310> it<00:02:45.520> the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
have hands and I'm going to drop it the

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.060 
have hands and I'm going to drop it the
hands<00:02:46.630> will<00:02:46.840> stay<00:02:46.960> was<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.230> prefab<00:02:47.740> of<00:02:47.770> the

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
hands will stay was a prefab of the

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.950 
hands will stay was a prefab of the
weapon<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.670> it<00:02:49.000> will<00:02:49.210> look<00:02:49.300> a<00:02:49.420> bit<00:02:49.540> weird<00:02:49.720> in

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
weapon and it will look a bit weird in

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.050 
weapon and it will look a bit weird in
the<00:02:50.050> ground<00:02:50.290> weapon<00:02:50.650> his<00:02:50.920> hands<00:02:51.280> that's

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
the ground weapon his hands that's

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.490 
the ground weapon his hands that's
another<00:02:52.270> reason<00:02:52.450> why<00:02:52.720> I<00:02:52.750> don't<00:02:52.900> include<00:02:53.320> it

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
another reason why I don't include it

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.850 
another reason why I don't include it
and<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:54.700> also<00:02:55.120> have<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.570> Crouch<00:02:56.050> function<00:02:56.620> so

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
now if I click see and hold I can Crouch

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.190 
now if I click see and hold I can Crouch
under<00:02:59.500> things<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:00.040> in<00:03:00.880> if<00:03:01.180> I<00:03:01.360> really<00:03:01.660> see<00:03:01.690> I

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
under things and in if I really see I

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.770
