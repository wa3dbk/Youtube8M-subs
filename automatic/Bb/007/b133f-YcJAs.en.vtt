00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 what we wanted us before 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.140
 it seems that we live all the time 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.580
 thinking about the future of matches 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.440
 we knew that all the rivals two 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.929
 crazy rules are not incoherent today 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.610
 it seems to me in the different sense 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.279
 guys for a little bit further away from 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.460
 I think that for having worked at 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.619
 soccer and I realized dreams 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.840
 I think of the lower edition 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.660
 We came with other loads of fundamentals 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.519
 tactics and today carlos maybe beyond 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.009
 that know the idiosyncrasy of 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.739
 Argentinian player that he thinks has 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.260
 taken advantage in that and in the training 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.260
 and the formation of groups 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.410
 well today maybe you are paying a 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.149
 little that lapse that has not led 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.620
 you although while listening to us 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.440
 we are seeing these are images in 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.789
 I live is I have been in movement 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.769
 these are live images of the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.000
 caravan of river fans what 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.190
 they found themselves in the monumental and that 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.899
 are going to the candy shop is more than 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.549
 2,500 people on the river will be 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.890
 accompanying Ramón Díaz's team today 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:04.049
 in the bonbonnaire then if we have the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.210
 possibility of talking to Gonzalo King 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.310
 is up on top of the box 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.310
 truck it seems that if you gonzalo you're 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.610
 we are practicing 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.509

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.239
