00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.240
 it was time to start a new civic life are they or are they not 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:26.660
 schooled 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.750
 literature have a year 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.610
 was in which is surrounded by German economy where the star of 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.320
 in this way the main one that's not why we've started we've grown up when 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.570
 I loved 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.540
 this before our clients of study cc oo thus in the month of January placid 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.190

 good deficit of obama yes 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.549
 let's see what it's worth are two things with alamares inspiration 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:58.499
 but also Germans where we started and as you well know in the 80s with 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:03.259
 my father consumed a revolution in Rioja and at the level of yesteryear when in 

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:05.049
 Rioja wines in another style 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.850
 because we are one of the pioneers in the bad day back then no style of 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.200
 Rioja wines - with much more for a little more structural with more color 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.230
 and also until the presentation we came out with a bottle of loved attention 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.640
 with all state in which there is this type of bottle that has not ratified orders 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.840
 to be a good one with the white label train where you put on the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.670
 shelving already managed to be given as 2% 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.320
 the state as of the high society 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.970
 if I think it's been a little bit we've always been and we keep trying for that 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.179
 we'll see the topic explanations of always 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.250
 pioneer and in being a little ahead in an innovation in novelties 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.510
 in respect to the wines of Rioja and Spain not in fact as I said 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.060
 when it came out with the German it was not just the type of wines and the labels and 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.619
 not up to the facilities at that time 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.030
 were the most modern facilities in Europe and it was a girl remember that 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.619
 they came in advance europe 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.069
 to visit the cellar for the first temperature control as well and the ships 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.390

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:03.759
 to the debate of that fashion point 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:04.750
 in which it is present 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.150
 5 not with this agreement is already a guild reference of the faa we have more than 25 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.150
 years things last year we celebrated the 25th anniversary 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.080
 but it has not been in vain especially when also having that touch a bit 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.870
 modern 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.520
 and what to say without a reference is not a classic wine, it is not a wine 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.920
 a hundred more for a little more I have a personality but important 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.330
 when also I do not think I can be more or less but when you try 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.890
 they are with of the one of martín a personality and a different style of 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.219
 the globules of videos of 1-1 part that this evolution 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.399

 A lot to see 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:47.260
 the transit 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.030
 sisi good when we have been in the cellar for a few years and visiting 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.849
 other things 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.980
 It's worth passing non-Basques along with Gonzalo as always 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.209
 next to my father people we decided to go a step further and that step more is 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.049
 inspiration 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.239
 in that position so far this year 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.899
 these from the stations 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:09.829
 business with important news is for this instance is this context 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.829
