00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
harder but not that much but yeah if

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.450 
harder but not that much but yeah if
it's<00:01:56.520> pretty<00:01:56.759> good<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.750> know<00:01:57.840> over<00:01:58.020> time

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
it's pretty good and you know over time

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.649 
it's pretty good and you know over time
you<00:01:59.460> know<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.700> material<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.270> just<00:02:00.450> stretch

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
you know this material it just stretch

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.230 
you know this material it just stretch
out<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.840> little<00:02:00.930> bit<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:02.040> ya<00:02:02.939> know<00:02:02.969> much

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
out a little bit so ya know much

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.410 
out a little bit so ya know much
complaints<00:02:03.750> but<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.860> can<00:02:05.070> see<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.340> as<00:02:05.700> it

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
complaints but you can see that as it

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.199 
complaints but you can see that as it
goes<00:02:06.540> down<00:02:07.190> near<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.220> bottom<00:02:08.489> it<00:02:08.910> kind<00:02:09.149> of

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
goes down near the bottom it kind of

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.620 
goes down near the bottom it kind of
splits<00:02:09.509> more<00:02:09.780> because<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.289> kind<00:02:10.500> of<00:02:10.560> tight

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
splits more because it is kind of tight

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.360 
splits more because it is kind of tight
a<00:02:11.660> you<00:02:12.200> know<00:02:12.320> compared<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:12.860> other<00:02:12.980> TPU

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
a you know compared to the other TPU

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.420 
a you know compared to the other TPU
cases<00:02:13.610> I've<00:02:13.880> used<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:15.070> covered<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:16.100> buttons

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
cases I've used that covered the buttons

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.940 
cases I've used that covered the buttons
at<00:02:16.520> least<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.900> one<00:02:18.140> probably<00:02:18.350> fits<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.830> best

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
at least this one probably fits the best

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.810 
at least this one probably fits the best
so<00:02:19.100> far<00:02:19.220> I'm<00:02:19.610> compared<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:22.100> the<00:02:22.460> s-line

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
so far I'm compared to the the s-line

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.090 
so far I'm compared to the the s-line
case<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.330> I've<00:02:23.420> tried<00:02:23.630> on<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.230> know<00:02:24.320> this

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
case that I've tried on you know this

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.370 
case that I've tried on you know this
one<00:02:25.250> actually<00:02:25.370> fits<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.880> extended<00:02:26.300> battery

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
one actually fits the extended battery

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.990 
one actually fits the extended battery
so<00:02:27.380> yeah<00:02:27.560> here<00:02:27.890> we<00:02:27.950> go<00:02:28.070> everything's<00:02:28.790> pretty

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
so yeah here we go everything's pretty

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.090 
so yeah here we go everything's pretty
smooth<00:02:29.320> got<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:30.410> press<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.560> little<00:02:30.710> bit<00:02:30.920> hard

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
smooth got to press a little bit hard

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.100 
smooth got to press a little bit hard
but<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.940> get<00:02:32.030> used<00:02:32.240> to<00:02:32.330> it<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.630> it<00:02:32.900> kind<00:02:33.080> of

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
but you get used to it and it kind of

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.830 
but you get used to it and it kind of
loosens<00:02:33.230> up<00:02:33.410> after<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.710> while<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:35.600> buttons

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
loosens up after a while and the buttons

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.050 
loosens up after a while and the buttons
work<00:02:35.960> fine<00:02:36.230> up<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:36.710> down<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.750> yeah<00:02:39.590> not<00:02:39.950> bad

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
work fine up and down so yeah not bad

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.360 
work fine up and down so yeah not bad
well<00:02:41.060> right<00:02:41.600> there<00:02:41.810> all<00:02:42.680> right<00:02:42.860> now<00:02:43.040> I'm<00:02:43.160> going

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
well right there all right now I'm going

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.700 
well right there all right now I'm going
to<00:02:43.490> switch<00:02:43.940> out<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.270> phone<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.690> put<00:02:45.320> in<00:02:45.500> the

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
to switch out the phone and put in the

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:56.290 
to switch out the phone and put in the
regular<00:02:46.040> battery<00:02:47.530> me<00:02:48.530> one<00:02:48.680> second<00:02:55.090> also<00:02:56.090> the

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
regular battery me one second also the

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.070 
regular battery me one second also the
case<00:02:56.480> does<00:02:56.810> come<00:02:57.110> with<00:02:57.320> a<00:02:58.070> screen<00:02:58.460> protector

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
know i bought this for probably around

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.780 
know i bought this for probably around
15<00:03:08.960> bucks<00:03:09.170> which<00:03:09.590> is<00:03:09.800> you<00:03:10.310> know<00:03:10.340> some<00:03:10.550> people

15 bucks which is you know some people
consider<00:03:11.090> kind<00:03:11.360> of<00:03:11.450> high<00:03:11.540> for<00:03:11.750> a<00:03:11.780> TPU<00:03:12.080> case<00:03:12.380> but

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
consider kind of high for a TPU case but

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.730 
consider kind of high for a TPU case but
you<00:03:13.760> know<00:03:13.850> for<00:03:14.060> a<00:03:14.090> name<00:03:14.270> brand<00:03:14.450> they<00:03:15.440> did<00:03:15.620> come

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
he popped in the standard size battery

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.809 
he popped in the standard size battery
and<00:03:38.230> actually<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.950> extended<00:03:39.310> battery<00:03:39.340> does

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
and actually the extended battery does

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.140 
and actually the extended battery does
fit<00:03:40.090> with<00:03:40.840> the<00:03:40.930> regular<00:03:41.200> cover<00:03:41.879> you<00:03:42.879> know<00:03:42.969> some
