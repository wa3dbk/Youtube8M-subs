00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
cool experiences that go with it

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.179 
cool experiences that go with it
considering<00:01:36.350> its<00:01:36.439> my<00:01:36.530> first<00:01:36.770> time<00:01:36.979> I<00:01:37.039> know

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
considering its my first time I know

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:38.289 
considering its my first time I know
there's<00:01:37.460> still<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.640> lot<00:01:37.789> for<00:01:37.969> me<00:01:38.030> to<00:01:38.119> learn<00:01:38.240> a

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
there's still a lot for me to learn a

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.889 
there's still a lot for me to learn a
lot<00:01:38.539> to<00:01:38.719> experience<00:01:40.030> for<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.090> race<00:01:41.270> itself<00:01:41.659> I

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
lot to experience for the race itself I

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.300 
lot to experience for the race itself I
mean<00:01:42.079> obviously<00:01:42.320> first<00:01:42.770> we<00:01:42.890> got<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.039> make<00:01:43.189> the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
mean obviously first we got to make the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.429 
mean obviously first we got to make the
show<00:01:43.490> but<00:01:44.119> from<00:01:44.270> there<00:01:44.479> we<00:01:44.990> just<00:01:45.049> want<00:01:45.259> to<00:01:45.319> try

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
show but from there we just want to try

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.080 
show but from there we just want to try
and<00:01:45.590> be<00:01:45.619> I<00:01:45.920> think<00:01:45.979> top<00:01:46.340> rookie<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:46.819> know<00:01:46.909> have

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
and be I think top rookie you know have

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.760 
and be I think top rookie you know have
a<00:01:47.119> good<00:01:47.329> day<00:01:47.539> I<00:01:47.569> think<00:01:47.810> that's<00:01:48.079> the<00:01:48.170> best<00:01:48.350> sort

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
a good day I think that's the best sort

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.739 
a good day I think that's the best sort
of<00:01:48.920> gauge<00:01:49.640> because<00:01:49.999> all<00:01:50.270> these<00:01:50.390> guys<00:01:50.600> with

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
of gauge because all these guys with

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:52.239 
of gauge because all these guys with
experience<00:01:50.840> have<00:01:51.469> you<00:01:51.710> know<00:01:51.890> there's<00:01:52.039> such<00:01:52.219> a

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:52.249 
experience have you know there's such a

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:54.309 
experience have you know there's such a
leg<00:01:52.490> up<00:01:52.670> on<00:01:52.819> you<00:01:52.999> so<00:01:53.689> if<00:01:53.810> we<00:01:53.929> can<00:01:54.020> come<00:01:54.140> away

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:54.319 
leg up on you so if we can come away

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:55.450 
leg up on you so if we can come away
with<00:01:54.350> top<00:01:54.619> rookie<00:01:54.920> I<00:01:54.950> think<00:01:55.219> that'd<00:01:55.340> be

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
with top rookie I think that'd be

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.219 
with top rookie I think that'd be
tremendous<00:01:55.909> great<00:01:56.420> rookie<00:01:56.689> field<00:01:57.020> this<00:01:57.200> year

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
tremendous great rookie field this year

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.739 
tremendous great rookie field this year
so<00:01:57.530> it's<00:01:57.649> going<00:01:57.740> to<00:01:57.829> be<00:01:57.920> tough<00:01:58.069> and<00:01:58.479> then<00:01:59.479> from

00:01:59.739 --> 00:01:59.749 
so it's going to be tough and then from

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:00.819 
so it's going to be tough and then from
there<00:01:59.929> you<00:01:59.960> know<00:02:00.200> I<00:02:00.229> think<00:02:00.350> that's<00:02:00.679> pretty

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
there you know I think that's pretty

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.349 
there you know I think that's pretty
much<00:02:01.039> for<00:02:01.219> a<00:02:01.249> goal<00:02:01.429> for<00:02:01.609> the<00:02:01.700> season<00:02:01.729> is<00:02:02.210> to

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
much for a goal for the season is to

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:04.809 
much for a goal for the season is to
take<00:02:03.139> each<00:02:03.319> race<00:02:03.499> one<00:02:03.740> race<00:02:04.039> at<00:02:04.249> a<00:02:04.280> time<00:02:04.520> learn

00:02:04.809 --> 00:02:04.819 
take each race one race at a time learn

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:06.609 
take each race one race at a time learn
every<00:02:05.060> lap<00:02:05.210> I'm<00:02:05.389> out<00:02:05.539> there<00:02:05.749> and<00:02:05.810> try<00:02:06.499> and

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
every lap I'm out there and try and

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:07.929 
every lap I'm out there and try and
bring<00:02:06.740> home<00:02:06.889> top<00:02:07.130> rookie<00:02:07.460> every<00:02:07.609> weekend<00:02:07.909> and

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
bring home top rookie every weekend and

bring home top rookie every weekend and
bring<00:02:08.509> home<00:02:08.599> that<00:02:08.690> rookie<00:02:09.049> of<00:02:09.110> the<00:02:09.140> year<00:02:09.319> at

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:09.409 
bring home that rookie of the year at

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.830 
bring home that rookie of the year at
the<00:02:09.470> end<00:02:09.530> of<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.799> end<00:02:10.099> of<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.280> season<00:02:10.429> so<00:02:10.879> the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
the end of the end of the season so the

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.240 
the end of the end of the season so the
end<00:02:11.989> of<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.200> season<00:02:12.349> then<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:12.769> course<00:02:12.950> leads

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
end of the season then of course leads

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.990 
end of the season then of course leads
in<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.519> neck

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
in the neck

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.760 
in the neck
season<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:14.510> we<00:02:14.570> all<00:02:14.690> just<00:02:14.870> saw<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.080> debut<00:02:15.320> or

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
season and we all just saw the debut or

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.140 
season and we all just saw the debut or
the<00:02:15.860> unveiling<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.400> should<00:02:16.580> say<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:17.000> new

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
the unveiling I should say of the new

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.060 
the unveiling I should say of the new
IndyCar<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:17.900> I<00:02:18.410> think<00:02:18.650> they<00:02:18.710> look<00:02:18.860> really

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
IndyCar and I think they look really

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.560 
IndyCar and I think they look really
cool<00:02:19.370> they're<00:02:19.970> different<00:02:20.360> enough<00:02:20.540> that

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
cool they're different enough that

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.910 
cool they're different enough that
people<00:02:20.720> are<00:02:20.990> going<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.170> pay<00:02:21.290> attention<00:02:21.770> but

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
people are going to pay attention but

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.590 
people are going to pay attention but
you<00:02:22.100> know<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:22.460> still<00:02:22.730> looks<00:02:22.970> like<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.390> I<00:02:23.450> think

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
you know it still looks like and I think

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.460 
you know it still looks like and I think
it's<00:02:23.720> still<00:02:23.780> going<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.020> feel<00:02:24.170> like<00:02:24.200> an

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
it's still going to feel like an

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.450 
it's still going to feel like an
open-wheel<00:02:24.770> car<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.130> that's<00:02:25.220> really

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
open-wheel car and that's really

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.430 
open-wheel car and that's really
important<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.090> us<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.600> drivers<00:02:26.960> but<00:02:27.170> all<00:02:27.290> such

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
important to us the drivers but all such

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.740 
important to us the drivers but all such
of<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.650> fans<00:02:27.920> so<00:02:28.100> i<00:02:28.160> think<00:02:28.250> is<00:02:28.550> a<00:02:28.820> big<00:02:29.030> deal<00:02:29.180> so

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
of the fans so i think is a big deal so

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.630 
of the fans so i think is a big deal so
I<00:02:30.140> mean<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.890> thought<00:02:31.040> of<00:02:31.100> a<00:02:31.220> new<00:02:31.370> car<00:02:31.550> is

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
I mean the thought of a new car is

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.800 
I mean the thought of a new car is
pretty<00:02:31.790> cool<00:02:32.000> we<00:02:32.180> haven't<00:02:32.390> had<00:02:32.480> one<00:02:32.630> around
