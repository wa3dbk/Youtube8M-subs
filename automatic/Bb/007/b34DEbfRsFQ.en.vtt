00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.749
 pattern a does with its motor lines 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.419
 renewed attempt at the Dutch 

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:12.740
 and the smartphone market 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.579
 flagship leader of that line 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.250
 the moto x 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:18.050
 this engine x is quite nice 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.060
 device is given our DQ will have 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.130
 know that pattern just lay 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.419
 anyway also with the engine see that earlier 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.250
 have reviewed but also with this engine 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.359
 is just nice device on the dutch 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.550
 market 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.480
 will not be a best seller but certainly 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.579
 an interesting choice 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.200
 and of course there are some competitors 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.240
 for that moto x including for example 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.890
 this you proof and pc 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.600
 well in this video we are not going to pay much 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.250
 p and the motorola moto x 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.960
 compare what I can do best 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.730
 to buy 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.160
 Motorola Moto X who sent a message 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.290
 actually just like that wsnp 7 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.550
 not so much on very high specs, but good ones 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.140
 user experience for a reasonable 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.330
 common price and it came then 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.800
 also reasonable about the price of your 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.020
 wine that is currently higher the 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.910
 mat cola the costa just over 300 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.290
 the euro and their neighborhood was something more 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.400
 than 350 euros 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.560
 I expect that price from you 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.210
 drops fairly quickly and then will 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.530
 the two devices are directly opposite 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.030
 stand together 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.680
 in terms of design, first and foremost falls sharply 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.690
 format difference on the engine I see 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.390
 has a 4.7 inch screen and the 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.400
 now we if you have a pc 5 inch screen 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.030
 apart from that the differences are best 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.409
 big though 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.210
 as you can see it is the motorola force 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.710
 smaller and that has to do with that 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.180
 edges around the screen of the motorola 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.640
 just a lot smaller than with the 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.170
 hours and hours we who do have him 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.270
 about as much content 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.320
 which is mainly in the thickness of the back 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.300
 scraped off 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.520
 this device is 6.5 millimeters thick and 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.210
 just a bit thinner than the motorcycle 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.770
 X 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.060
 the moto x that has a curve 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.650
 back which makes it nice in the 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.540
 hand lies with roughly is all best 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.760
 sharp and therefore he is less 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.290
 in hand then the motorola so it is one 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.000
 bit you like about the 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.590
 motorola that comes despite being 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.540
 plastic construction just does pretty well 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.920
 high-quality about the rent we have been made 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.960
 made of glass and aluminum 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.520
 comes across as more high-quality and brand 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.530
 true build quality would I rather for 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.729
 you and we are going to read pattern more robust 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.450
 light is a bit nice in the hand 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.710
 is also just great in itself 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.420
 they are therefore quite different in terms of construction 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.130
 but there is certainly something to be done with it 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.079
 certainly not the bad ones 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.670
 Built of display the two differ 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.480
 also from each other the motorola has one 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.670
 slightly smaller screen 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.709
 each lower resolution has a 720 p 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.989
 12:00 a full HD resolution 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.279
 resolution we have with that 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.999
 just a bit sharp and that is natural 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:21.439
 an advantage 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:22.760
 but the big difference between the two 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.379
 screens and actually sits in the art 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.540
 which used is what red one has 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.269
 amoled screen now we has an lcd 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.439
 panel and ps lcd panel and just like you 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.969
 it just big differences between the 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.459
 colors of the motorola that come what 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:35.930
 jump in a more expressive and lively way 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.269
 only what helps what is that the white one 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.060
 the motorola balance is much worse 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.409
 it is bit greenish bluish while at 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.489
 the rent we the white along simply best 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.499
 is good in the color as a result 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.760
 appear realistic at the motorola 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.950
 so a little bit wrong 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.299
 you notice especially if you have the two nascar 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.769
 when you look at the motorola like that 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.389
 then it is not the one 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.609
 is correct but it is not entirely correct 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:57.620
 and in it hire him at the 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:01.249
 motorola, on the other hand, has a better one 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.409
 contrasting colors and that is 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:05.180
 also beautiful again and it is just something 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.919
 you wanted to point yourself so sharper 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.719
 and realistically there I would certainly 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:11.469
 we push but also for the screen 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:13.249
 there is something to be said about the motorola 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.150
 process for differences on paper 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:16.969
 reasonable 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.730
 in practice, relatively little added to the rent 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:21.980
 essent pc has 1.8 gigahertz or push 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.959
 quad core processor cortex a9 cores and 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.329
 motorola single 7 free gert dual core 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.579
 processor with cry cores and that cry 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:29.779
 know who are just one in theory 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.849
 much faster than that 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:33.439
 cortex a9 cores and practice notice that 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.269
 also because despite that the motorola 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:36.319
 which has its dual-core processor 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.849
 the differences between the two in terms of 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.590
 speed actually quite small if you 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.930
 applications goes open a web page goes 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.980
 open a little browsed yes then you see 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.689
 not so much difference between the 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.449
 two devices and that is respect of the 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:48.919
 module call the achievement think 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:51.469
 they both are just fast enough in 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:53.959
 daily use but with no 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:55.879
 extremely fast what is somewhere 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.379
 it is striking that the motorola less 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:59.239
 hitches shown in daily use 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.589
 also has to do with the interface in 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.059
 namely the feast of the motorolas 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:03.680
 once the standard android interface 

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:06.409
 Also means that you need quick updates 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.629
 get the patterns also unknown android 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.189
 sitting kitkat is now just on the 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.719
 like a pc also twisted on and also kit 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:14.569
 cat but not with the standard interface 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:16.160
 but dailymotion you why we we in large 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.409
 difference is that there is no me in now 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.690
 a big difference is graphically 

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:22.190
 looks a bit more childlike and it does 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.140
 has many more options you can 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.910
 tweaking everything in terms of permissions from 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.950
 applications and the like also to the 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.540
 Motorola not all but the standard 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.190
 Android interface just works very well 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.680
 smoothly is well optimized this 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.780
 motorola and in that sense it is normal 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.580
 very just interface and we would rather 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.620
 go for the motorola mainly because of that 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.570
 optimization just a bit smoother 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.070
 operation 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.570
 we camera different two also quite 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.670
 much the motorola has at the back 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.260
 a 10 megapixel camera that you have with you 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.120
 a back side a 13 megapixel camera 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.290
 different sizes on the front 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.300
 do you have we and namely an 8 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.790
 megapixel camera than the motorola it must 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.870
 do with 2 megapixel front camera brand 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.510
 really one big quality differences 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.980
 you now we we must clearly better 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.900
 of course you do that front camera a lot 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.610
 use that money for some people 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.930
 they definitely do that or other money they do 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.610
 not wanting to do that is what you have to do 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.400
 think of yourself but also the 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.690
 back is the me now with essent b7 though 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.670
 what better camera 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.590
 13 megapixel camera it is just right 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.660
 slightly better results than the 10 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.210
 megapixel camera of motorola a photo 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.980
 together detail richer and hms quite a bit 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.990
 nice if you look like that 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.660
 so in terms of camera wind hour it certainly drives 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.380
 well i my real motorola the battery 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.690
 prevail 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.400
 motorola that just goes easy one 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.290
 good day is coming up again 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.060
 types or for optimization 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.950
 the rent with that is not easy one 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.830
 day and it will last a day but it 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.570
 is fairly tight and yes you have to 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.010
 make a little effort if you have one 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.540
 made a long day to spend the whole day 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.010
 pick up while at the motorola 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.180
 just go smoothly and that is 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.530
 of course a big advantage of this 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.000
 motor needed 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.500
 the u he just has expandable 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.880
 memory that is something that the motorola 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.680
 not has metro has 16 gigabytes 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.890
 internal memory and you have to deal with that 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.300
 to do 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.550
 with which you seem rather a rumor 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.110
 Cascina stitches and that is natural 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.410
 open again a big advantage of the hour 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.910
 We are the motorola that has it in America 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.380
 some extra options to be in 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.460
 The Netherlands unfortunately not America and 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.320
 for example, backside 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.570
 optimize your own ebook and 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.890
 also replaces accents in device from 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.850
 wooden back pick that 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.690
 all things that can't get in 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.669
 The Netherlands 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.400
 In America, he also has a kind of 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:22.400
 oh is google well that does n't go either 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.080
 dutch so those are additions 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.580
 who would perhaps expect the moto 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.450
 x but that is not the case you are in 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.010
 The Netherlands 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.390
 the stijn are not so different from each other 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.050
 many also the your we did not like that 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.300
 kind of stuff 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.249
 so that is fine lt they have 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.289
 both 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:37.119
 so that's just neat and there 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:40.089
 are also not the big differences 

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:42.549
 in conclusion, the motorola is just right 

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:44.739
 as more robust and perhaps something for it 

00:06:42.549 --> 00:06:47.159
 use it more solidly every day 

00:06:44.739 --> 00:06:48.399
 phone camera is a bit less 

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:49.839
 device 

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:51.849
 company is just a bit smoother and 

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:54.729
 what tastes better and design is there 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:56.319
 genomic go some more robust battery 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:58.809
 it will be better that they just benefit big 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:00.699
 of the motorola does have this 

00:06:58.809 --> 00:07:02.579
 clearly our preference for yes 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:05.019
 the user experience that beat and on 

00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:06.879
 speed may be slightly less 

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:09.009
 but the screen is a bit better 

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:11.949
 device is just nicer designed and and 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:13.749
 feels more luxurious to device has a something 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:15.369
 bigger and sharper screen 

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:16.539
 when she has better camera both on the 

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:19.149
 front and back 

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:20.919
 batteries so you less so the 

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:23.469
 differences between two devices 

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:25.899
 certainly present in all kinds of areas 

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:27.939
 if you just want a decent and nice one 

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:30.129
 phone in daily use is the 

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:31.659
 better motorola if you give me something 

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:33.459
 less decent device but to it 

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:36.899
 a somewhat more premium user experience 

00:07:33.459 --> 00:07:36.899
 we now have that again at az &amp; pc
