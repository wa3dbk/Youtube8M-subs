that's<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:32.050> same<00:04:32.260> front<00:04:32.620> and<00:04:33.010> rear<00:04:33.780> where<00:04:34.780> my

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
that's the same front and rear where my

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.290 
that's the same front and rear where my
thumb<00:04:35.290> is<00:04:35.320> there<00:04:35.740> you'll<00:04:35.920> see<00:04:36.130> the<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:37.090> body

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
thumb is there you'll see the the body

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.940 
thumb is there you'll see the the body
clips<00:04:37.600> that<00:04:37.720> holds<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.170> front<00:04:38.410> section<00:04:38.830> on

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
clips that holds the front section on

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.060 
clips that holds the front section on
that<00:04:39.160> comes<00:04:39.430> off<00:04:39.730> and<00:04:39.970> again<00:04:40.870> it's<00:04:41.050> a<00:04:41.290> full

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
that comes off and again it's a full

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.180 
that comes off and again it's a full
roll<00:04:42.280> cage<00:04:42.310> underneath<00:04:42.970> and<00:04:43.860> so<00:04:44.860> if<00:04:44.950> you<00:04:45.040> want

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
roll cage underneath and so if you want

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.190 
roll cage underneath and so if you want
to<00:04:45.280> remove<00:04:45.490> this<00:04:45.730> part<00:04:46.030> it<00:04:46.150> just<00:04:46.180> removes<00:04:46.750> the

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
to remove this part it just removes the

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.010 
to remove this part it just removes the
hood<00:04:47.520> to<00:04:48.520> take<00:04:48.730> the<00:04:48.910> rest<00:04:49.180> of<00:04:49.450> the<00:04:49.540> body<00:04:49.750> off

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
hood to take the rest of the body off

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.810 
hood to take the rest of the body off
you<00:04:50.320> then<00:04:50.470> have<00:04:50.620> to<00:04:50.770> remove<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.280> rear<00:04:51.310> two

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
you then have to remove the rear two

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.730 
you then have to remove the rear two
clips<00:04:52.210> and<00:04:52.450> it<00:04:52.600> opens<00:04:53.140> up<00:04:53.290> kind<00:04:53.560> of<00:04:53.590> like<00:04:53.680> a

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
clips and it opens up kind of like a

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.040 
clips and it opens up kind of like a
clamshell<00:04:54.120> you<00:04:55.120> can<00:04:55.300> kind<00:04:55.540> of<00:04:55.570> see<00:04:55.780> in<00:04:55.900> there

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
clamshell you can kind of see in there

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.610 
clamshell you can kind of see in there
and<00:04:56.170> see<00:04:56.350> all<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:56.680> structure<00:04:57.130> and<00:04:58.590> you<00:04:59.590> know

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
and see all the structure and you know

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.680 
and see all the structure and you know
suspension<00:05:00.310> that<00:05:00.430> so<00:05:00.670> you<00:05:01.180> can<00:05:01.330> see<00:05:01.360> in<00:05:01.600> a

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
suspension that so you can see in a

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.470 
suspension that so you can see in a
front<00:05:01.900> collision<00:05:02.320> the<00:05:02.410> way<00:05:02.500> this<00:05:02.680> is<00:05:02.860> designed

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
front collision the way this is designed

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.120 
front collision the way this is designed
it's<00:05:04.480> really<00:05:04.780> going<00:05:04.930> to<00:05:04.990> protect<00:05:05.140> the<00:05:05.650> chassis

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
it's really going to protect the chassis

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.710 
it's really going to protect the chassis
the<00:05:06.250> shock<00:05:06.520> tower<00:05:06.820> and<00:05:07.060> things<00:05:07.240> that<00:05:07.330> normally

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
the shock tower and things that normally

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.990 
the shock tower and things that normally
get<00:05:07.870> damaged<00:05:08.230> I'm<00:05:08.860> really<00:05:09.250> great<00:05:09.640> of<00:05:09.730> control

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
get damaged I'm really great of control

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.909 
get damaged I'm really great of control

that you're going to over train wise a

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.450 
that you're going to over train wise a
lot<00:05:20.020> to<00:05:20.169> kind<00:05:20.320> of<00:05:20.410> skip<00:05:20.620> over<00:05:20.740> top<00:05:21.070> it's<00:05:21.340> not

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
lot to kind of skip over top it's not

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.070 
lot to kind of skip over top it's not
gonna<00:05:21.610> get<00:05:21.790> hung<00:05:21.970> up<00:05:22.120> and<00:05:22.300> rip<00:05:22.630> something<00:05:22.840> off

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
gonna get hung up and rip something off

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.020 
gonna get hung up and rip something off
so<00:05:23.650> here<00:05:23.890> we<00:05:24.010> got<00:05:24.130> the<00:05:24.310> add<00:05:24.490> that<00:05:24.669> you<00:05:24.790> saw<00:05:24.940> the

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
so here we got the add that you saw the

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.550 
so here we got the add that you saw the
front<00:05:25.300> clips<00:05:25.570> off<00:05:25.780> notice<00:05:26.140> we're<00:05:26.320> moving

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
front clips off notice we're moving

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.380 
front clips off notice we're moving
there's<00:05:26.710> one<00:05:26.950> on<00:05:27.160> each<00:05:27.190> side<00:05:27.640> the<00:05:27.850> back<00:05:28.000> here

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
there's one on each side the back here

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.900 
there's one on each side the back here
and<00:05:29.020> once<00:05:29.260> you<00:05:29.410> get<00:05:29.530> this<00:05:29.710> off<00:05:29.979> you'll<00:05:30.550> notice

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
and once you get this off you'll notice

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.420 
and once you get this off you'll notice
that<00:05:31.030> we<00:05:31.600> can<00:05:31.750> lift<00:05:32.050> the<00:05:32.260> body<00:05:32.410> forward<00:05:33.040> but

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
that we can lift the body forward but

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.310 
that we can lift the body forward but
again<00:05:33.700> it<00:05:33.820> just<00:05:33.850> flips<00:05:34.300> forward<00:05:34.660> if<00:05:34.960> you<00:05:35.110> want

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
again it just flips forward if you want

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.130 
again it just flips forward if you want
to<00:05:35.410> take<00:05:35.560> the<00:05:35.710> whole<00:05:35.830> body<00:05:36.100> off<00:05:36.370> you<00:05:36.669> have<00:05:36.880> to

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:37.140 
to take the whole body off you have to

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.380 
to take the whole body off you have to
undo<00:05:38.140> the<00:05:38.229> two<00:05:38.380> screws<00:05:38.740> that<00:05:39.190> attach<00:05:39.910> to<00:05:40.150> the

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
undo the two screws that attach to the

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.780 
undo the two screws that attach to the
front<00:05:40.720> bumper<00:05:40.930> however<00:05:41.919> I<00:05:42.070> can<00:05:42.310> do<00:05:42.460> on<00:05:42.610> my

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
front bumper however I can do on my

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.610 
front bumper however I can do on my
service<00:05:43.240> work<00:05:43.479> and<00:05:43.720> everything<00:05:43.870> else<00:05:44.050> with

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
service work and everything else with

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.890 
service work and everything else with
the<00:05:44.740> body<00:05:44.979> laying<00:05:45.220> forward<00:05:45.760> just<00:05:46.300> be<00:05:46.510> careful

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
the body laying forward just be careful

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.210 
the body laying forward just be careful
just<00:05:46.960> you<00:05:47.169> don't<00:05:47.260> want<00:05:47.440> to<00:05:47.530> leave<00:05:47.710> it<00:05:47.830> dangling

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
just you don't want to leave it dangling

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.280 
just you don't want to leave it dangling
but<00:05:48.760> now<00:05:48.940> once<00:05:49.180> we<00:05:49.360> get<00:05:49.450> that<00:05:49.630> structure<00:05:50.050> up

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290 
but now once we get that structure up

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.659 
but now once we get that structure up
you'll<00:05:50.470> see<00:05:50.620> this<00:05:50.680> is<00:05:50.860> pretty<00:05:51.070> similar<00:05:51.370> to<00:05:51.640> a

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
you'll see this is pretty similar to a

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.960 
you'll see this is pretty similar to a
blast<00:05:52.030> your<00:05:52.840> aluminum<00:05:53.490> heatsink<00:05:54.490> there<00:05:54.880> on

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
blast your aluminum heatsink there on

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.760 
blast your aluminum heatsink there on
the<00:05:55.060> motor<00:05:55.270> as<00:05:55.450> well<00:05:55.479> as<00:05:55.750> the<00:05:55.870> block<00:05:56.110> cover

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
the motor as well as the block cover

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.560 
the motor as well as the block cover
just<00:05:57.040> to<00:05:57.130> protect<00:05:57.520> fingers<00:05:58.210> from<00:05:58.360> getting

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
just to protect fingers from getting

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.870 
just to protect fingers from getting
burned<00:05:58.840> we've<00:05:59.590> got<00:05:59.710> a<00:05:59.740> rear<00:06:00.010> bumper<00:06:00.430> on<00:06:00.640> there

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 
burned we've got a rear bumper on there

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.990 
burned we've got a rear bumper on there
as<00:06:01.000> well<00:06:01.030> energy<00:06:01.780> absorbing<00:06:02.520> the<00:06:03.520> little<00:06:03.790> side

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
as well energy absorbing the little side

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.180 
as well energy absorbing the little side
guards<00:06:04.360> they're<00:06:04.540> just<00:06:04.810> they<00:06:05.290> clip<00:06:05.650> into<00:06:06.070> the

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
guards they're just they clip into the

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.719 
guards they're just they clip into the
side<00:06:06.430> of<00:06:06.850> the<00:06:07.060> roll<00:06:07.570> cage<00:06:07.780> of<00:06:08.020> the<00:06:08.080> body<00:06:08.729> and

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
side of the roll cage of the body and

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:11.219 
side of the roll cage of the body and
again<00:06:09.850> just<00:06:10.270> a<00:06:10.390> really<00:06:10.690> nice<00:06:10.840> straightforward

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
again just a really nice straightforward

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:13.890 
again just a really nice straightforward
to<00:06:11.979> go<00:06:12.130> drive<00:06:12.370> buggy

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
to go drive buggy

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.080 
to go drive buggy
to<00:06:14.740> drive<00:06:15.040> buggies<00:06:15.340> are<00:06:15.490> great<00:06:15.699> too<00:06:15.850> with<00:06:15.970> all

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
to drive buggies are great too with all

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.730 
to drive buggies are great too with all
the<00:06:16.150> weight<00:06:16.360> in<00:06:16.509> the<00:06:16.600> back<00:06:16.780> that<00:06:17.080> makes<00:06:17.530> them

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
the weight in the back that makes them

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.550 
the weight in the back that makes them
really<00:06:17.979> easy<00:06:18.100> to<00:06:18.610> jump<00:06:19.419> over<00:06:19.660> small<00:06:19.930> obstacles

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
really easy to jump over small obstacles

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.490 
really easy to jump over small obstacles
in<00:06:20.710> that<00:06:20.860> they<00:06:21.100> don't<00:06:21.310> really<00:06:22.289> nosedive<00:06:23.289> in

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
in that they don't really nosedive in

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:38.129 
in that they don't really nosedive in
that<00:06:23.650> so<00:06:23.979> a<00:06:24.220> lot<00:06:25.150> of<00:06:25.210> fun

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.199
