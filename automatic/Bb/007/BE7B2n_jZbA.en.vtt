00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.640
 hello to all code perched fiber a network 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.640
 scola that says in the package is in this program 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:17.890
 that arm in networks 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.380
 but we do it or in a real lab with 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.400
 the windows 2003 equipment and that is that all those who wait 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.720
 that will shape this network 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.050
 copper and three network events 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.770
 are hijacked by the switches by 192 168 2 0 and 4 0 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.900
 and then there are also towers between the two goalkeepers to be 2002 2003 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.620
 For this to work 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.440
 p so that the two fish there 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.490
 at the bottom they communicate 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.300
 we have two possibilities one is static alerts on the servers 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.880
 2003 the premises are removed 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.100
 configure some dynamic treatment protocols as a team 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.330
 uu oe sep efe 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.180
 let's do it d 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.430
 while two ways for you to see the difference 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.630
 and as I say mastering Windows 2003 servers 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.250
 let's go to her 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.049
 we are on the first server of the two that among those who do not figure 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.049
 completely on the one to the left of the drawing 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.100
 we are from here 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.190
 and we have to configure the exhaustion and remote access 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.060
 because on the one hand 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.170
 the sip is set they have been put previously 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.170
 note about the two network cards that we have 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.940
 a team with two cards is not a route 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.040
 in the case of windows 2003 we have to enter the route 22 pesos remote to 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.040
 enable this device as a local 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.510
 initially states is not configured today we have to configure 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.980
 I'm going to visit him 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.980
 they seem like 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.570
 we choose a custom option 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.519
 for now we choose alan exhaustion which is what interests us 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.779
 will ask us if we want to install it start it 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.939
 We think so 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.249
 and I have configured 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:29.249
 we have installed let's say specifically remote access 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.849
 well now 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.519
 if we wanted this router to work it feels highly dynamic 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.519
 you would have to add static photos 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:41.909
 let's say it is to put 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.159
 meet her retes the switch 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.169
 with this network but also does not have access to the 4 0 network with which 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.900
 to this vote we would have to add the route to arrive before where they are 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.540
 from here 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.619
 up to this network 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:57.439
 this would be adding 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:02:59.809
 a new static defeat 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:02.479
 we would say to water the network 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:05.479
 4 0 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.409
 the mask is usual in this type of fixed nets efe 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.269
 has to enter on one side is run left to the second or third 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.269
 text to 192 168 3 2 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:23.710
 and the replica only because we have a jump 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.030
 a cocktail in between will miss you rebounds of those who 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.030
 increasing the matter 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:37.339
 i the same thing should do in the future the other goalkeeper but the other way around had to 

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:39.889
 See you on the static route in the network 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.259
 by hundred point zero 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:44.859
 but in this case we do not want 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:48.169
 Seven hundred aesthetics and we do not think they are dynamic musa liminar 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.649
 this aesthetic route 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:53.439
 And we have to 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:54.999
 Add 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:58.279
 a protocol also tournament 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:02.239
 we have all these as you see the usps is one of those that appear to add 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:07.199
 and we also have the pri that equals the oldest one and also maybe more 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.940
 standard 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.749
 we choose 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:13.749
 It will look like a new entry 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.769
 now we have to add 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.329
 To the East 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.639
 the protocol 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.699
 the interface with the interfaces by which 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.650
 it will be remotely dynamic 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.830
 as 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.689
 in the first card to the left wing there is no club but it does not have 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:33.479
 sense that towards that side 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.770
 percent let's say that 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.370
 spread the tables of fashion winds or it makes sense to spread them by the 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.319
 card the right that is this 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:44.170
 then we add it to card for which there are routes 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.170
 to which bridge sa pink tables we are 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.659
 and we can configure some rich protocol properties 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.909
 or for example 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:57.069
 if we want the tables to be accompanied by a password so that 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:59.599
 there is no other issue is the means that maybe 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.569
 it happened to us in false tables 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:04.389
 we can also say 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.150
 efe acquires let's let us send tables 

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:12.099
 we are a fusion group if we are going to say only the concrete teams 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:15.099
 which we pass the tables 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.009
 temps also of what kind of routes we are and all those who send us or 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.589
 maybe only to one type of routes 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:25.419
 with laura prefixes to a tico 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.600
 initial route to a final type 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.900
 fran range of routes 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.900
 i pg high like this 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:36.860
 I would be hosted correctly 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.289
 we accept 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.699
 We can see 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:44.699
 the neighbors and this one in this case already exists because 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.949
 I'm not saying that 3 2 is a neighbor of ours because it already configures 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:51.389
 previously 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:52.759
 efe 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.710
 in regards to the right 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.479
 the second group 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.129
 at this time the challenge is configured with a dynamic talent and 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:03.129
 payments check it doing quindÃ­o in which expects another 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.800
 now I'm on the xp team on the left 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.159
 tnt 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:18.169
 two bulls I'm not wrong much 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.169
 shoes 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:25.960
 if we pineapple the team the cyst that was at the other end 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.490
 remember what the destruction was like 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:33.410
 we had xp which is the one I'm in right now nor will I ping this one 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.189
 here 

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:37.520
 carrying three cross this entire network 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.470
 Feel static but these my future are informing are decreed 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.080
 system 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.999
 Well, you have to get to this network 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:48.099
 going through the votes let's see if that works correctly 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.139
 payday loans 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:56.080
 to 192 168 4 2 

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:01.180
 and should answer what it is doing 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.839
 and with the order to do 

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:05.279
 we could even 

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:07.370
 inform north is watching 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.279
 what we got half a step behind but 

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:10.949
 It is leaving 

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:13.360
 for the right premises 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.430
 it goes through the 2 1 and 3 2 and finally reached all 

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:18.659
 With which 

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:21.269
 percent regretted rip is working properly there is no 

00:07:21.269 --> 00:07:23.369
 problem 

00:07:23.369 --> 00:07:24.099
 and that is true
