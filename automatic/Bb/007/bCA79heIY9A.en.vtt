00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.220
 how to achieve a perfect manicure in 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.220
 home 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.340
 first we will remove the painting with a 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.410
 disc and nail polish remover preferably without 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.180
 acetone we will do circles 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.180
 dragging the enamel out 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.080
 [Music] 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.000
 Now with scissors to a cutter 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.650
 nails we will match all the nails 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.650
 leaving them in the same size 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.220
 we filed and we give the desired shape 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.070
 [Music] 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.260
 Now we apply a little cream of 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.090
 hands or moisturizer and we're going to 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.090
 massage all the cuticles 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.020
 [Music] 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.350
 Now let's fill a container with 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.120
 warm water and I'm going to use some 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.460
 effervescent brand pills 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.340
 better to bleach we leave them 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:14.740
 rest for a few minutes dry the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.740
 hand and we apply the kit to cuticles 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.229
 we open in disk we roll the stick of 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.420
 orange to leave the tip of cotton and 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.070
 let's clear the nail pushing the 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.070
 cuticles carefully 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.620
 [Music] 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.430
 and only if necessary we remove the 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.040
 skins and cuticles that bother us 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.400
 we do a relaxing massage for 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.710
 moisturize the hand 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.600
 at the end we wash our hands well with 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.790
 water and soap and we can use some 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.440
 Protein enamel 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.750
 we are going great to avoid the exclamation 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.700
 the calcium gel is perfect for 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.710
 use it as a base and it helps us to have 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.960
 some healthy nails and if we have them 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.030
 weak we can use the hardener 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.160
 and always to keep us signs 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.550
 they are yellow to apply the enamel 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.550
 base 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.570
