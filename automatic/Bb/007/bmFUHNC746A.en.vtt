on<00:03:54.220> these<00:03:54.340> two<00:03:54.640> plants<00:03:55.120> so<00:03:56.110> I'm<00:03:56.470> going<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.620> go

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
on these two plants so I'm going to go

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.320 
on these two plants so I'm going to go
through<00:03:56.950> and<00:03:57.160> pick<00:03:57.400> them<00:03:57.550> all<00:03:57.670> off<00:03:57.850> today<00:03:58.150> and

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
through and pick them all off today and

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.060 
through and pick them all off today and
another<00:03:58.810> few<00:03:59.110> weeks<00:03:59.140> i'll<00:03:59.410> have<00:03:59.530> more<00:03:59.770> and

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
another few weeks i'll have more and

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.370

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
tied it to the stake and it kept growing

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.630 
tied it to the stake and it kept growing
and<00:04:58.450> broke<00:04:59.080> over<00:04:59.320> because<00:04:59.830> it<00:04:59.980> weighed<00:05:00.370> too

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
and broke over because it weighed too

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.750 
and broke over because it weighed too
much<00:05:00.850> had<00:05:01.750> I<00:05:01.780> been<00:05:01.990> here<00:05:02.260> to<00:05:02.470> keep<00:05:02.620> tying<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.640> to

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
much had I been here to keep tying it to

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.340 
much had I been here to keep tying it to
the<00:05:03.790> stake<00:05:04.090> it<00:05:04.330> would<00:05:04.419> have<00:05:04.510> been<00:05:04.570> fine<00:05:04.930> but

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
the stake it would have been fine but

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.770 
the stake it would have been fine but
it's<00:05:06.040> still<00:05:06.280> alive<00:05:06.490> in<00:05:06.760> producing<00:05:07.210> so<00:05:07.510> I'll

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
it's still alive in producing so I'll

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.900 
it's still alive in producing so I'll
let<00:05:07.930> it<00:05:07.990> go<00:05:08.130> I'm<00:05:09.130> not<00:05:09.280> going<00:05:09.430> to<00:05:09.490> try<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:09.669> bend

let it go I'm not going to try to bend

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.330 
let it go I'm not going to try to bend
it<00:05:10.060> back<00:05:10.240> because<00:05:10.419> it<00:05:10.630> looks<00:05:11.169> like<00:05:11.350> it<00:05:11.560> will<00:05:11.650> do

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.650 
it back because it looks like it will do
more<00:05:12.460> damage<00:05:12.700> than<00:05:13.120> good<00:05:15.060> we<00:05:16.060> have<00:05:16.210> about<00:05:16.390> 10
