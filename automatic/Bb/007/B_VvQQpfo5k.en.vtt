I<00:00:09.260> just<00:00:10.260> want<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.469> be<00:00:10.530> leaving<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.280> cue

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
side so it's close to the red that's

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.980 
side so it's close to the red that's
what<00:00:16.770> I'd<00:00:16.890> be<00:00:17.010> already<00:00:17.730> thinking<00:00:18.029> about<00:00:18.150> you

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.009 

40<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.800> may<00:00:23.039> even<00:00:23.070> play<00:00:23.430> for<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> ball<00:00:23.910> color<00:00:24.180> to

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
40 you may even play for a ball color to

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.140 
40 you may even play for a ball color to
move<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.289> readout<00:00:25.760> it's<00:00:26.760> going<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:26.970> suggest

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
move the readout it's going to suggest

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.460 
move the readout it's going to suggest
you<00:00:27.449> think<00:00:27.510> he<00:00:27.689> might<00:00:27.810> have<00:00:27.840> played<00:00:28.080> up<00:00:28.260> for

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
you think he might have played up for

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.479 
you think he might have played up for
the<00:00:28.859> yellow<00:00:29.119> seems<00:00:30.119> easiest<00:00:30.929> one<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.340> play<00:00:32.340> on

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
the yellow seems easiest one to play on

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.110 
the yellow seems easiest one to play on
if<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:34.309> make<00:00:35.309> he<00:00:35.399> drops<00:00:35.640> us<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:35.940> he<00:00:36.000> could

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
if you can make he drops us in he could

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.729 
if you can make he drops us in he could
come<00:00:36.239> off<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> pink<00:00:36.690> as<00:00:36.870> well<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.469> always

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
come off the pink as well but I always

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.200 
come off the pink as well but I always
like<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.190> be<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.520> yellow<00:00:38.760> order<00:00:39.059> thought

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
like to be on the yellow order thought

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.030 
like to be on the yellow order thought
assessment<00:00:39.780> might<00:00:40.290> not<00:00:40.440> have<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.559> angle<00:00:40.770> here

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
assessment might not have the angle here

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.950 
assessment might not have the angle here
I<00:00:41.280> think<00:00:41.910> that's<00:00:42.059> what<00:00:42.180> he<00:00:42.270> played<00:00:42.480> for<00:00:42.750> John

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
I think that's what he played for John

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.500 
I think that's what he played for John
isn't<00:00:43.140> left<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> left<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.920> good<00:00:44.070> angle<00:00:44.510> he

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
isn't left the left a good angle he

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.479 
isn't left the left a good angle he
knows<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.930> anywhere<00:00:46.260> near<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.649> earth<00:00:47.160> or

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
knows it anywhere near the earth or

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.830 
knows it anywhere near the earth or
yellow<00:00:47.730> or<00:00:47.820> brown<00:00:48.149> he<00:00:48.329> can<00:00:48.450> ring<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.600> read

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
yellow or brown he can ring that read

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.010 
yellow or brown he can ring that read
into<00:00:49.050> play<00:00:49.289> which<00:00:50.280> makes<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.760> little<00:00:50.879> easier

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
into play which makes it a little easier

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.810 
into play which makes it a little easier
but<00:00:52.020> decided<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.500> leave<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> pink<00:00:53.039> what<00:00:53.550> yet

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
but decided to leave the pink what yet

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.819 
but decided to leave the pink what yet
he<00:00:54.660> hasn't<00:00:54.870> got<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.050> angle<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.350> move<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.680> so

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
he hasn't got the angle to move it so

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.080 
he hasn't got the angle to move it so
it's<00:00:55.980> not<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.129> drop<00:00:56.399> me<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.640> what<00:00:56.730> he<00:00:56.820> has<00:00:56.879> of

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
it's not a drop me and what he has of

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.000 
it's not a drop me and what he has of
the<00:00:57.210> angle<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:58.170> enacted<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.620> too<00:00:58.770> hard

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the angle but it is enacted it too hard

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.610 
the angle but it is enacted it too hard
miss<00:00:59.699> read<00:00:59.940> nearly<00:01:00.120> didn't<00:01:00.449> burned<00:01:00.629> well

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
miss read nearly didn't burned well

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.390 
miss read nearly didn't burned well
didn't<00:01:02.190> realize<00:01:02.399> you've<00:01:02.550> nearly<00:01:02.730> missed<00:01:03.000> that

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
didn't realize you've nearly missed that

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.289 
didn't realize you've nearly missed that
anything<00:01:05.400> but<00:01:05.580> tight<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> cushion

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
anything but tight on the cushion

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.750 
anything but tight on the cushion
anything<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:09.510> tight<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.049> cushion<00:01:12.860> hmm

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
anything but tight on the cushion hmm

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.890 
anything but tight on the cushion hmm
it<00:01:15.760> was<00:01:15.880> a<00:01:15.940> little<00:01:16.210> trickier<00:01:16.510> than<00:01:16.540> it<00:01:16.690> looked

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
it was a little trickier than it looked

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.170 
it was a little trickier than it looked
that<00:01:17.020> because<00:01:17.320> of<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:17.470> middle<00:01:17.740> pocket<00:01:18.180> 54

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
that because of the middle pocket 54

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.490 
that because of the middle pocket 54
then<00:01:19.540> you<00:01:19.660> didn't<00:01:19.870> want<00:01:19.990> to<00:01:20.050> do<00:01:20.170> there<00:01:20.350> was

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
then you didn't want to do there was

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.040 
then you didn't want to do there was
stunned<00:01:21.460> that<00:01:21.580> enough<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.120> wasn't<00:01:22.720> too<00:01:22.900> much

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
stunned that enough and wasn't too much

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.110 
stunned that enough and wasn't too much
of<00:01:23.110> a<00:01:23.260> gap<00:01:23.440> between<00:01:23.560> that<00:01:23.920> bump<00:01:24.160> and<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.970> red

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
of a gap between that bump and the red

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.660 
of a gap between that bump and the red
itself<00:01:25.480> so<00:01:25.750> this<00:01:26.380> is<00:01:26.530> tricky<00:01:26.800> you<00:01:27.310> can<00:01:27.490> miss

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
itself so this is tricky you can miss

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:38.130 
itself so this is tricky you can miss
these<00:01:35.250> on<00:01:36.250> your<00:01:36.400> Sullivan<00:01:36.850> 50<00:01:37.420> such<00:01:37.570> a<00:01:37.600> way<00:01:37.840> try

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
these on your Sullivan 50 such a way try

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:48.120 
these on your Sullivan 50 such a way try
to<00:01:38.200> kill<00:01:38.470> the<00:01:38.619> pocket<00:01:46.619> yes<00:01:47.619> i<00:01:47.800> think<00:01:47.830> is

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
to kill the pocket yes i think is

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.830 
to kill the pocket yes i think is
definitely<00:01:48.940> sneakers<00:01:49.300> it's<00:01:49.420> just<00:01:49.570> a<00:01:49.630> case<00:01:49.780> of

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
definitely sneakers it's just a case of

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.990 
definitely sneakers it's just a case of
whether<00:01:50.110> you<00:01:50.200> can<00:01:50.320> hit<00:01:51.100> cushion<00:01:51.490> first<00:01:51.759> and

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
whether you can hit cushion first and

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.300 
whether you can hit cushion first and
leave<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.479> white<00:01:52.660> whether<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.410> is<00:01:53.560> that's

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
leave the white whether it is that's

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.609 
leave the white whether it is that's
Hawkeyes<00:01:54.790> view<00:01:55.090> so<00:01:56.020> he's<00:01:56.110> playing<00:01:56.380> off<00:01:56.500> the

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
Hawkeyes view so he's playing off the
