00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.930
 here we are for an unboxing this time 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:13.130
 we have a beautiful video card 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.969
 of the total and maybe I give it 630 we do 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.850
 of the last yes a video card 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.590
 of the last series of the idea that by now 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.869
 already almost old to tell this 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.359
 series will soon be this turns the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.109
 series 7 probably yes and will continue 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.019
 with this magical numbering 630 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.309
 let's say one of the cheapest 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.669
 almost cheaper we are a street of 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.370
 half 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.989
 for the 600 series commercial value 55 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.670
 EUR 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.450
 the with the specifications of this card 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.230
 video as you can see from the images 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:51.930
 from the image 2gb of ram support of 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.899
 x11 networks memory interface 128 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:00.090
 bit of the round I know what you're looking at 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.039
 atrocious 164 128 104 circus an ebit better 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.420
 is 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.900
 let's just say the performances of the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:12.119
 black taranta of the video card 2 gig 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.860
 precisely of this memory clock 1333 one 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.869
 specific computer list because I don't 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:22.080
 remember clocking with the 110 makers chipset 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:27.180
 and so truly these values ​​are 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:31.380
 high menus and stream processors 96 them 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.110
 quite small compared to hundreds e 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.840
 hundreds of the type from the 90 gtx axis 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:44.670
 however also this card of me anyway 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:46.770
 his against goods and nothing I don't know what 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.140
 tell you this video card allows you to 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:54.320
 do normal work at this computer 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.570
 being just medium-low end 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.210
 allows you to work with autocad 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.450
 team programs to show obviously 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.890
 because he also gv nam is a pool i 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.570
 games of course also new ones 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.569
 but I really think that it is not there 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.450
 will work at 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.010
 maximum quality so there is only to 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.299
 try out 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.999
 let's say this thing is not guaranteed ok 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:22.670
 says that there was this boxwood cota of income 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:25.760
 who saw this box enough 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.489
 treated in detail with interest 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.620
 strips are let's say shiny type 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.319
 so when you run over it for fatigue 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.209
 to flow like black and 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.980
 different material then detail to 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.349
 I don't like the box's well- kept room 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.409
 this thing instead minds other brands 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.709
 that remotely their video cards e 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:48.919
 enough here is of course there 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.230
 installation with the sticker from 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:57.459
 stick over your tower 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.459
 computer you see here on the left then 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:04.129
 trackmania 2 3 three days and free dei 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:05.780
 interesting game passes I tell you that I have 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:10.819
 lost months and play three miles 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:14.389
 one is a really nice game though 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:17.569
 you have time for another newsletter that you don't 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:20.120
 I'm going to explain squaring wiki card 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.400
 stanley melts and today the autofocus 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.509
 seems to respond well perhaps because 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.840
 same in the correct way 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:30.669
 another uses user bar you see it too 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.530
 here very nice to stay rapitalà 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:39.129
 in the manual had everything you believe the logo 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:48.109
 of the very nice and steep geforce gtx 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:52.790
 nothing we are here adapter from of via e 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:55.310
 the lie is obviously exist athena 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.199
 tractors like the aiac tv by maicon e 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.560
 this case should serve because 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:03.739
 in fact I listen to a video card 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.689
 I see the front surgery the 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.810
 therefore it is not passive dissipation but 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:12.699
 let's say active made precisely by this 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.870
 then fan the front 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:21.079
 let's see if we can get him to do a lot 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.750
 focus here and see two mihai la doors 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.960
 people 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:28.260
 autofocus and a door into that never 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.550
 however and mini hdmi never happens choice 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.990
 therefore an adapter is required or 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:41.450
 from a mini academy adapter 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:47.340
 academy or from tp air hdmi and nothing 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:49.220
 this we say box in the all is not there 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.350
 other to say 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.910
 apart from that the boy lost but runs 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.880
 stripes at the top is what you want 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.440
 write formenti Roman art that I there 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.770
 I'm always 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.850
 thank you for everything next time 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.850
 caesar bye
