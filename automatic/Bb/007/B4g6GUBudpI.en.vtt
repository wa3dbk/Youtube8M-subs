circuit that's a black face fender so

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.860 
circuit that's a black face fender so
you<00:00:44.340> kind<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.579> got<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.910> black<00:00:45.210> face<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
you kind of got the black face of the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.779 
you kind of got the black face of the
tweed<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.379> one<00:00:47.070> amp<00:00:48.230> this<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.410> also<00:00:49.860> 6l6

30 watts of clean power before it goes

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.149 
30 watts of clean power before it goes
into<00:01:02.250> clipping<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.660> we've<00:01:03.840> also<00:01:04.019> got<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.559> put

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
into clipping and we've also got to put

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.750 
into clipping and we've also got to put
a<00:01:05.450> post<00:01:06.450> phase<00:01:07.049> inverter<00:01:07.530> master<00:01:08.159> volume<00:01:08.400> on

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
a post phase inverter master volume on

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.730 
a post phase inverter master volume on
this<00:01:08.970> now<00:01:09.900> i'm<00:01:10.020> going<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.229> set<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.560> volume

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
this now i'm going to set the volume

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.679 
this now i'm going to set the volume
here<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> on<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.640> basement<00:01:12.210> channel<00:01:12.570> to

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
here on the on the basement channel to

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.990 
here on the on the basement channel to
about<00:01:12.869> five<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:14.040> i<00:01:14.130> got<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> master<00:01:14.640> volume

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
about five and i got the master volume

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.260 
about five and i got the master volume
turned<00:01:15.360> down<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.659> about<00:01:15.750> four<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:17.270> play

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270
