00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.099 
before and this works fine but the
images<00:01:34.340> are<00:01:34.549> small<00:01:34.789> enough<00:01:35.029> it<00:01:35.209> works<00:01:35.389> good<00:01:35.630> so

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109 
images are small enough it works good so

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.349 
images are small enough it works good so
just<00:01:36.319> put<00:01:36.529> one<00:01:36.709> image<00:01:36.979> on<00:01:37.130> this<00:01:37.310> end<00:01:37.670> flip<00:01:38.209> it

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
just put one image on this end flip it

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:39.879 
just put one image on this end flip it
over<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.840> other<00:01:38.869> image<00:01:39.319> on<00:01:39.469> this<00:01:39.619> end<00:01:39.799> and

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:39.889 
over the other image on this end and

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:42.010 
over the other image on this end and
burn<00:01:40.069> them<00:01:40.189> at<00:01:40.279> the<00:01:40.369> same<00:01:40.520> time<00:01:40.579> it<00:01:41.389> works<00:01:41.630> fine

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
burn them at the same time it works fine

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.480 
burn them at the same time it works fine
that'll<00:01:42.289> save<00:01:42.590> you<00:01:42.709> an<00:01:42.829> emulsion<00:01:43.130> cost

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
that'll save you an emulsion cost

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.160 
that'll save you an emulsion cost
another<00:01:44.179> thing<00:01:44.479> is<00:01:44.599> getting<00:01:44.869> all<00:01:45.139> the

another thing is getting all the

trough and it scoops you know all of
that<00:02:32.150> excess<00:02:32.870> emulsion<00:02:35.140> back<00:02:36.140> into<00:02:36.710> the

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
that excess emulsion back into the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.920 
that excess emulsion back into the
bucket<00:02:37.340> so<00:02:37.580> that's<00:02:38.150> how<00:02:38.330> it<00:02:38.450> works<00:02:38.630> and

there's just no thanks to money okay so
here<00:02:42.650> are<00:02:42.680> a<00:02:42.740> couple<00:02:42.770> things<00:02:43.130> that<00:02:43.280> I've

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
here are a couple things that I've

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.890 
here are a couple things that I've
learned<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.760> help<00:02:43.940> speed<00:02:44.150> up<00:02:44.210> production<00:02:44.450> in

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
learned to help speed up production in

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.560 
learned to help speed up production in
my<00:02:45.020> shop<00:02:45.230> now<00:02:45.950> I<00:02:45.980> use<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.280> fan<00:02:46.640> to<00:02:46.940> cool<00:02:47.090> off<00:02:47.360> my

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
my shop now I use a fan to cool off my

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.180 
my shop now I use a fan to cool off my
pallet<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.230> between<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.740> flashes<00:02:49.160> that

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
pallet and between the flashes that

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.890 
pallet and between the flashes that
helps<00:02:49.580> me<00:02:49.700> speed<00:02:49.970> up<00:02:50.120> production<00:02:50.270> a<00:02:50.660> little

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
helps me speed up production a little

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.010 
helps me speed up production a little
bit<00:02:51.020> and<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:51.800> also<00:02:52.190> use<00:02:52.490> a<00:02:52.520> timer<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.600> cure<00:02:53.810> my

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
bit and I also use a timer to cure my

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.630 
bit and I also use a timer to cure my
images<00:02:54.440> before<00:02:54.830> I<00:02:54.860> was<00:02:55.100> forgetting<00:02:55.460> what
