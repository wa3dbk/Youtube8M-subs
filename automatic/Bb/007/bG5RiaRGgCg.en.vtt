sure all this is a review for you now
the<00:01:12.360> first<00:01:12.780> sentence<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.500> need<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.830> come<00:01:14.010> up

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
the first sentence we need to come up

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.190 
the first sentence we need to come up
with<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> background<00:01:14.970> statement<00:01:15.780> about

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
with is a background statement about

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.499 
with is a background statement about
this<00:01:16.439> topic<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.220> we<00:01:18.000> might<00:01:18.150> want<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.420> start

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
this topic so we might want to start

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.830 
this topic so we might want to start
with<00:01:18.750> something<00:01:19.200> about<00:01:19.880> about<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> UAE<00:01:21.360> and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
with something about about the UAE and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.960 
with something about about the UAE and
oil<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> UAE<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.640> might<00:01:23.790> say<00:01:23.939> something

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
oil in the UAE so we might say something

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:33.130 
oil in the UAE so we might say something
like<00:01:24.299> traditionally<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:27.780> UAE<00:01:28.560> s<00:01:29.210> economy<00:01:31.909> has

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
like traditionally the UAE s economy has

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.350 
like traditionally the UAE s economy has
been

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
been

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.980 
been
completely<00:01:36.950> reliant<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:39.229> oil<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:42.540> second

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
completely reliant on oil the second

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.760 
completely reliant on oil the second
sentence<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:45.649> just<00:01:46.649> more<00:01:46.920> detail<00:01:47.430> about<00:01:47.729> this

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
sentence is just more detail about this

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.330 
sentence is just more detail about this
first<00:01:49.770> sentence<00:01:51.289> so<00:01:52.289> perhaps<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:53.039> might<00:01:53.189> want

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
first sentence so perhaps we might want

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.440 
first sentence so perhaps we might want
to<00:01:53.369> say<00:01:53.549> something<00:01:53.789> about<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.270> new

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
to say something about the new

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.840 
to say something about the new
industries<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.170> are<00:01:55.229> coming<00:01:55.619> up<00:01:55.770> or<00:01:56.369> that

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
industries that are coming up or that

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.620 
industries that are coming up or that
have<00:01:57.030> been<00:01:58.759> growing<00:01:59.759> very<00:02:00.030> quickly<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.600> let's

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
have been growing very quickly so let's

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.319 
have been growing very quickly so let's
say<00:02:00.869> within<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.470> past<00:02:02.000> you're<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.149> kind<00:02:03.299> of

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
say within the past you're just kind of

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:10.630 
say within the past you're just kind of
pulling<00:02:03.539> this<00:02:03.659> out<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.869> my<00:02:03.960> head<00:02:04.170> but<00:02:04.439> 15<00:02:05.189> years

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.970 

however

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:25.540 

it's<00:02:16.909> economy<00:02:18.159> has<00:02:19.900> diversified

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.699 

as<00:02:26.060> diversified

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
as diversified

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.289 
as diversified
okay

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.000 

and<00:02:32.780> now<00:02:32.989> what's<00:02:33.290> very<00:02:33.499> important<00:02:33.950> to

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
and now what's very important to

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.849 
and now what's very important to
remember<00:02:34.189> in<00:02:34.489> a<00:02:34.609> discussion<00:02:34.999> essay<00:02:35.510> is<00:02:35.859> that

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:36.859 
remember in a discussion essay is that

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.069 
remember in a discussion essay is that
we're<00:02:37.129> not<00:02:37.310> giving<00:02:37.730> our<00:02:37.849> opinion<00:02:38.420> until<00:02:38.959> the

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
economy will fall apart if Abu Dhabi

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.149 
economy will fall apart if Abu Dhabi
runs<00:03:11.209> out<00:03:11.329> of<00:03:11.419> oil<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:11.810> some<00:03:12.409> people<00:03:12.739> refutes

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 
runs out of oil and some people refutes

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.280

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
stick these into one sentence and we

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.000 
stick these into one sentence and we
would<00:03:19.370> say<00:03:19.519> something<00:03:19.549> along<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.209> lines<00:03:20.419> of

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
would say something along the lines of

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:35.210 
would say something along the lines of
some<00:03:22.010> believe<00:03:22.879> that<00:03:26.019> the<00:03:27.019> UAE<00:03:29.980> economy

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220

will<00:03:35.760> collapse

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
will collapse

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:47.800
