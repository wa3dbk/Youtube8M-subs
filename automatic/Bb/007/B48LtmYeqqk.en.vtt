might do a little bit of life-enhancing
and<00:02:20.110> it's<00:02:21.110> on<00:02:22.660> there's<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.810> front<00:02:23.990> of<00:02:24.110> the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
and it's on there's the front of the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.360 
and it's on there's the front of the
engine<00:02:24.320> now<00:02:24.910> got<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.000> on<00:02:26.120> how<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.390> bolt<00:02:26.630> it<00:02:26.810> down

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
engine now got it on how to bolt it down

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.610

went<00:03:12.290> let<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:12.620> go<00:03:12.739> overnight<00:03:13.010> came<00:03:13.520> back

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
went let it go overnight came back

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.830 
went let it go overnight came back
thought<00:03:14.060> yep<00:03:14.360> okay<00:03:14.720> I'll<00:03:14.840> start<00:03:15.050> it<00:03:15.200> up<00:03:15.260> it

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
thought yep okay I'll start it up it

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.100 
thought yep okay I'll start it up it
would<00:03:17.840> start<00:03:18.820> kick<00:03:19.820> over<00:03:20.000> had<00:03:20.840> spiked

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
would start kick over had spiked

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.960 
would start kick over had spiked
everything<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:21.770> then<00:03:21.860> just<00:03:22.010> cut<00:03:22.370> itself<00:03:22.670> out

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.780 
everything and then just cut itself out
and<00:03:23.390> then<00:03:23.600> sometimes<00:03:23.989> it<00:03:24.110> backfire<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:24.920> right

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
and then sometimes it backfire and right

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
out the air box something I didn't know

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.729 
out the air box something I didn't know
what<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.550> hell<00:03:28.670> is<00:03:28.760> wrong<00:03:28.910> with<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.739> checking

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
what the hell is wrong with it checking

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.680 
what the hell is wrong with it checking
sensors<00:03:31.400> checking<00:03:31.880> everything's<00:03:32.239> plugged<00:03:32.450> in

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
sensors checking everything's plugged in

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.780 
sensors checking everything's plugged in
but<00:03:32.900> whatever<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.410> know<00:03:33.530> mean<00:03:33.760> anyway<00:03:34.760> I

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
couldn't get it fixed right I checked I

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.960 
couldn't get it fixed right I checked I
took<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.520> top<00:03:37.970> one<00:03:38.180> off

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
took the top one off

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.010 
took the top one off
to<00:03:39.060> have<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.210> look<00:03:39.360> in<00:03:39.540> there<00:03:39.690> there<00:03:39.900> wasn't

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
to have a look in there there wasn't

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.390 
to have a look in there there wasn't
glue<00:03:40.320> blocking<00:03:40.860> everything<00:03:41.160> is<00:03:41.280> like

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
glue blocking everything is like

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.820 
glue blocking everything is like
whatever<00:03:41.760> take<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.150> all<00:03:42.420> apart<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:42.990> I<00:03:43.530> ended

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
whatever take it all apart and I ended

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.830 
whatever take it all apart and I ended
up<00:03:43.920> getting<00:03:44.130> I'm<00:03:44.400> Indiana<00:03:44.790> in<00:03:45.030> RMA's<00:03:45.450> I<00:03:45.660> got<00:03:45.810> a

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
up getting I'm Indiana in RMA's I got a

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.110 
up getting I'm Indiana in RMA's I got a
free<00:03:46.020> tow<00:03:46.200> truck<00:03:46.470> got<00:03:47.070> a<00:03:47.100> tow<00:03:47.340> down<00:03:47.550> to<00:03:47.790> my

free tow truck got a tow down to my

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.210 
free tow truck got a tow down to my
local<00:03:48.300> mechanic<00:03:48.840> he<00:03:49.470> pulled<00:03:49.740> the<00:03:49.860> whole<00:03:49.980> thing

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
local mechanic he pulled the whole thing

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.480 
local mechanic he pulled the whole thing
apart<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.780> as<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:51.960> can<00:03:52.050> see<00:03:52.130> see<00:03:53.130> that<00:03:53.160> bit

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
apart and as you can see see that bit

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.220 
apart and as you can see see that bit
there<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:54.000> bit<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.350> plenum<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:56.730> spacer

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
there a bit of the plenum the spacer

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.930 
there a bit of the plenum the spacer
doesn't<00:03:58.230> go<00:03:58.920> around<00:03:59.040> that<00:03:59.490> it<00:03:59.610> just<00:03:59.790> goes

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
doesn't go around that it just goes

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.550 
doesn't go around that it just goes
straight<00:04:00.090> through<00:04:00.270> and<00:04:00.960> so<00:04:01.230> there<00:04:01.440> was<00:04:01.500> a

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
straight through and so there was a

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.830 
straight through and so there was a
massive<00:04:01.770> gap<00:04:02.250> where<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.180> was<00:04:03.300> sucking<00:04:03.540> it

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
massive gap where it was sucking it

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.260 
massive gap where it was sucking it
sucking<00:04:04.230> air<00:04:04.890> would<00:04:05.100> have<00:04:05.130> been<00:04:05.340> yummy<00:04:05.850> hold

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
sucking air would have been yummy hold

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.240 
sucking air would have been yummy hold
that<00:04:06.450> big<00:04:06.690> top<00:04:06.990> and<00:04:07.020> bottom<00:04:07.440> just<00:04:07.620> now<00:04:08.070> I<00:04:08.100> was

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
that big top and bottom just now I was

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.390 
that big top and bottom just now I was
12<00:04:08.850> millimeters<00:04:09.420> by<00:04:10.140> like<00:04:10.380> 10<00:04:10.770> cent<00:04:11.010> coin<00:04:11.190> just

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
12 millimeters by like 10 cent coin just

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.860 
12 millimeters by like 10 cent coin just
sucking<00:04:11.790> it<00:04:11.910> straight<00:04:12.300> through<00:04:12.540> straight

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
sucking it straight through straight

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.050 
sucking it straight through straight
through<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.320> it<00:04:13.830> was<00:04:13.890> cutting<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.760> car<00:04:14.910> out

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
through and it was cutting the car out

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.270 
through and it was cutting the car out
straightaway<00:04:15.450> here<00:04:16.140> you<00:04:16.200> know<00:04:16.290> it<00:04:16.650> was<00:04:16.799> just

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
straightaway here you know it was just

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.740 
straightaway here you know it was just
too<00:04:17.640> much<00:04:17.790> too<00:04:18.150> much<00:04:18.299> air<00:04:19.459> anyway<00:04:20.750> I've

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
too much too much air anyway I've

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.430 
too much too much air anyway I've
removed<00:04:22.170> it<00:04:22.380> now<00:04:22.530> and<00:04:22.910> yep<00:04:23.910> so<00:04:24.450> now<00:04:25.110> it's<00:04:25.350> just

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
removed it now and yep so now it's just

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.310 
removed it now and yep so now it's just
sitting<00:04:25.830> with<00:04:25.920> the<00:04:26.010> one<00:04:26.250> but<00:04:27.090> it<00:04:27.510> does<00:04:27.720> still<00:04:28.050> I

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
sitting with the one but it does still I

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.770 
sitting with the one but it does still I
reckon<00:04:29.070> give<00:04:29.370> a<00:04:29.400> little<00:04:29.730> more<00:04:30.060> like<00:04:30.270> just<00:04:30.690> a

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
reckon give a little more like just a

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.190 
reckon give a little more like just a
little<00:04:30.900> every<00:04:31.680> now<00:04:31.800> and<00:04:31.950> then<00:04:32.040> more<00:04:32.730> more<00:04:33.200> talk

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
little every now and then more more talk

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.530 
little every now and then more more talk
because<00:04:35.100> if<00:04:35.700> I'm<00:04:35.880> in<00:04:36.000> fourth<00:04:36.210> year<00:04:36.419> and<00:04:36.480> I

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
because if I'm in fourth year and I

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.570 
because if I'm in fourth year and I
throw<00:04:36.780> it<00:04:36.840> back<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.110> third<00:04:37.380> it<00:04:37.890> just<00:04:38.100> has<00:04:38.430> that

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
throw it back to third it just has that

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.460 
throw it back to third it just has that
little<00:04:38.820> bit<00:04:38.970> more<00:04:39.090> little<00:04:39.630> yelling<00:04:40.169> like

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
little bit more little yelling like

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.380 
little bit more little yelling like
throw<00:04:40.710> you<00:04:40.770> back<00:04:40.919> in<00:04:41.070> your<00:04:41.190> seat<00:04:41.430> very<00:04:42.120> minimal

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
throw you back in your seat very minimal

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.220 
throw you back in your seat very minimal
you<00:04:43.260> know<00:04:43.380> but<00:04:43.860> I<00:04:44.100> mean<00:04:44.340> it's<00:04:44.490> only<00:04:44.610> that<00:04:44.880> now

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
you know but I mean it's only that now

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.690 
you know but I mean it's only that now
the<00:04:46.230> next<00:04:46.500> thing<00:04:46.650> I'm<00:04:46.800> going<00:04:46.919> to<00:04:46.980> do<00:04:47.130> is

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
the next thing I'm going to do is

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.030 
the next thing I'm going to do is
probably<00:04:47.910> a<00:04:48.060> bigger<00:04:48.270> throttle<00:04:48.600> body<00:04:49.040> and

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
probably a bigger throttle body and

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.880 
probably a bigger throttle body and
really<00:04:50.940> an<00:04:51.240> extractors<00:04:52.110> versa<00:04:52.350> net<00:04:52.530> cost<00:04:52.710> heap

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
really an extractors versa net cost heap

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:53.990 
really an extractors versa net cost heap
so<00:04:53.100> that's<00:04:53.340> not<00:04:53.490> going<00:04:53.580> to<00:04:53.640> happen<00:04:53.760> for<00:04:53.940> a

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
so that's not going to happen for a

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.170 
so that's not going to happen for a
while

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
while

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.750 
while
the<00:04:54.750> next<00:04:54.990> I<00:04:55.050> am<00:04:55.110> doing<00:04:55.620> definitely<00:04:56.100> though<00:04:56.250> is

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
the next I am doing definitely though is

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.330 
the next I am doing definitely though is
I'm<00:04:57.000> getting<00:04:57.150> a<00:04:57.360> bigger<00:04:57.540> alternator<00:04:58.250> this<00:04:59.250> is

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
I'm getting a bigger alternator this is

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.820 
I'm getting a bigger alternator this is
a<00:04:59.370> 100<00:04:59.940> amp<00:05:00.030> stock<00:05:00.360> alternator<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:01.020> cop<00:05:01.560> cars

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
a 100 amp stock alternator the cop cars

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.760 
a 100 amp stock alternator the cop cars
at<00:05:02.100> the<00:05:02.160> time<00:05:02.220> on<00:05:02.850> this<00:05:03.030> model<00:05:03.210> came<00:05:03.720> with<00:05:03.900> 120

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
at the time on this model came with 120

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.670 
at the time on this model came with 120
amp<00:05:04.950> so<00:05:05.460> let<00:05:05.850> me<00:05:05.940> put<00:05:06.120> 120<00:05:06.600> honor<00:05:06.720> have<00:05:07.440> a<00:05:07.470> big

amp so let me put 120 honor have a big

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.430 
amp so let me put 120 honor have a big
alternator<00:05:08.100> a<00:05:08.340> bit<00:05:08.669> more<00:05:08.880> a<00:05:09.479> bit<00:05:09.510> more<00:05:10.200> power

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
alternator a bit more a bit more power

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.700 
alternator a bit more a bit more power
from<00:05:10.650> your<00:05:10.830> battery<00:05:11.190> and<00:05:11.690> stereo<00:05:12.690> so<00:05:12.960> putting

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
from your battery and stereo so putting

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.320 
from your battery and stereo so putting
a<00:05:13.770> big<00:05:13.890> old<00:05:14.040> out<00:05:14.280> it's<00:05:14.490> exactly<00:05:14.790> the<00:05:14.910> same<00:05:15.060> box

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
a big old out it's exactly the same box

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.050 
a big old out it's exactly the same box
straight<00:05:15.660> on<00:05:15.810> and<00:05:16.100> I'll<00:05:17.100> do<00:05:17.460> a<00:05:17.490> new<00:05:17.729> drive<00:05:18.030> belt

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
straight on and I'll do a new drive belt

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.850 
straight on and I'll do a new drive belt
at<00:05:18.330> the<00:05:18.390> same<00:05:18.570> time<00:05:18.810> so<00:05:19.260> you<00:05:19.380> get<00:05:19.470> to<00:05:19.590> see<00:05:19.710> that

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
at the same time so you get to see that

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.420 
at the same time so you get to see that
install<00:05:20.870> and<00:05:21.870> yeah<00:05:22.110> so<00:05:22.890> we're<00:05:23.070> going<00:05:23.190> to<00:05:23.280> have

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
install and yeah so we're going to have

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.850 
install and yeah so we're going to have
a<00:05:23.960> 20%<00:05:24.960> bigger<00:05:25.320> alternator<00:05:25.919> coming<00:05:26.790> up<00:05:26.910> and

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
a 20% bigger alternator coming up and

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.450 
a 20% bigger alternator coming up and
that's<00:05:28.860> it<00:05:29.100> anyway<00:05:29.820> I'm<00:05:30.180> sad<00:05:30.450> to<00:05:30.570> say<00:05:31.040> don't<00:05:32.040> if

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
that's it anyway I'm sad to say don't if

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.090 
that's it anyway I'm sad to say don't if
you<00:05:32.640> have<00:05:32.760> a<00:05:32.790> VX<00:05:33.330> that<00:05:33.660> is<00:05:33.840> now<00:05:34.410> the<00:05:34.470> spacer

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
you have a VX that is now the spacer

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.480 
you have a VX that is now the spacer
will<00:05:36.060> work<00:05:36.300> probably<00:05:36.900> on<00:05:37.050> a<00:05:37.110> V<00:05:37.350> s<00:05:37.620> and<00:05:38.400> the

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
will work probably on a V s and the

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.130 
will work probably on a V s and the
older<00:05:38.850> models<00:05:39.150> with<00:05:39.330> the<00:05:39.450> same<00:05:39.630> engine<00:05:39.990> but

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
older models with the same engine but

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.840 
older models with the same engine but
with<00:05:40.770> this<00:05:40.919> engine<00:05:41.130> obviously<00:05:41.700> has<00:05:41.820> a

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:41.850 
with this engine obviously has a

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.180 
with this engine obviously has a
different<00:05:42.180> intake<00:05:42.479> manifold<00:05:42.930> and<00:05:43.110> it<00:05:43.979> just

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
different intake manifold and it just

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.990 
different intake manifold and it just
doesn't<00:05:44.490> work<00:05:44.610> so<00:05:45.030> if<00:05:45.870> you've<00:05:46.050> got<00:05:46.200> to<00:05:46.320> VX

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
doesn't work so if you've got to VX

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.270 
doesn't work so if you've got to VX
don't<00:05:48.000> buy<00:05:48.180> those<00:05:48.390> manifolds<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.590> don't<00:05:50.160> buy

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
don't buy those manifolds the don't buy

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.170 
don't buy those manifolds the don't buy
the<00:05:50.340> insulator<00:05:51.210> the<00:05:51.419> bottom<00:05:51.720> one

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
the insulator the bottom one

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.080 
the insulator the bottom one
the<00:05:52.240> top<00:05:52.450> one<00:05:52.630> is<00:05:52.870> fine
