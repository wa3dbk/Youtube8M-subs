one was down that day I had to spend a

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.240 
one was down that day I had to spend a
little<00:02:37.100> bit<00:02:37.250> extra<00:02:37.459> um<00:02:38.380> but<00:02:39.380> that<00:02:39.620> was<00:02:39.769> the

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
little bit extra um but that was the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.850 
little bit extra um but that was the
exchange<00:02:40.459> rate<00:02:40.819> that<00:02:40.850> day<00:02:41.209> and<00:02:41.569> it<00:02:42.440> wasn't<00:02:42.620> it

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
exchange rate that day and it wasn't it

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.229 
exchange rate that day and it wasn't it
was<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.130> was<00:02:43.220> kind<00:02:43.400> of<00:02:43.430> my<00:02:43.550> fault<00:02:43.610> but<00:02:43.940> anyways

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
was it was kind of my fault but anyways

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.979 
was it was kind of my fault but anyways
um<00:02:45.160> so<00:02:46.160> I<00:02:46.670> think<00:02:47.060> they<00:02:47.360> must<00:02:47.630> have<00:02:47.720> over<00:02:47.930> the

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
um so I think they must have over the

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.750 
um so I think they must have over the
price<00:02:48.200> to<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.500> region<00:02:48.800> or<00:02:48.920> something<00:02:49.190> anyway

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
price to the region or something anyway

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.620 
price to the region or something anyway
so<00:02:49.819> basically<00:02:50.680> um<00:02:51.970> yeah<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.180> hair<00:02:53.360> is<00:02:53.450> awesome
