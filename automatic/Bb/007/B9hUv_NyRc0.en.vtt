00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
I like to talk about the device is what

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.890 
I like to talk about the device is what
we<00:00:11.510> use<00:00:11.540> as<00:00:12.020> nylon<00:00:12.320> washers<00:00:13.160> and<00:00:13.610> what<00:00:14.420> it<00:00:14.570> does

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
we use as nylon washers and what it does

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.100 
we use as nylon washers and what it does
is<00:00:15.320> a<00:00:15.349> we<00:00:15.980> have<00:00:16.099> enough<00:00:16.460> yeah<00:00:16.790> bulk<00:00:17.540> hair<00:00:17.869> that

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
is a we have enough yeah bulk hair that

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.200 
is a we have enough yeah bulk hair that
squeezes<00:00:18.680> the<00:00:18.860> nylon<00:00:19.279> washers<00:00:19.820> together

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
squeezes the nylon washers together

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.310 
squeezes the nylon washers together
which<00:00:21.109> tightens<00:00:22.070> up<00:00:22.310> along<00:00:23.300> this<00:00:23.600> disk<00:00:23.990> here

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320

we<00:00:24.529> call<00:00:24.859> cam<00:00:25.310> you<00:00:26.150> have<00:00:26.270> horizontal<00:00:26.750> bar<00:00:27.320> and

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:27.680 
we call cam you have horizontal bar and

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.500 
we call cam you have horizontal bar and
a<00:00:27.710> drop<00:00:28.100> bar<00:00:28.400> and<00:00:28.910> then<00:00:29.720> on<00:00:30.130> every<00:00:31.300> moving<00:00:32.300> part

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
a drop bar and then on every moving part

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.790 
a drop bar and then on every moving part
we<00:00:33.500> have<00:00:33.530> a<00:00:33.710> copper<00:00:34.220> bushings<00:00:35.680> there's<00:00:36.680> a

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
we have a copper bushings there's a

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.110 
we have a copper bushings there's a
copper<00:00:37.280> bushing<00:00:37.730> right<00:00:37.910> here<00:00:38.300> and<00:00:38.570> there's

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
copper bushing right here and there's

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.610 
copper bushing right here and there's
inside<00:00:40.989> the<00:00:41.230> nut<00:00:41.530> on<00:00:41.770> the<00:00:42.010> end<00:00:42.039> there<00:00:42.340> so<00:00:43.620> most

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
inside the nut on the end there so most

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.369 
inside the nut on the end there so most
cage<00:00:45.100> traps<00:00:45.550> you<00:00:45.820> have<00:00:46.000> to<00:00:46.210> lubricate<00:00:46.660> all

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
cage traps you have to lubricate all

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.430 
cage traps you have to lubricate all
these<00:00:48.070> points<00:00:48.699> and<00:00:49.300> I<00:00:49.420> devised<00:00:49.839> to<00:00:49.870> lubricate

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
these points and I devised to lubricate

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.709 
these points and I devised to lubricate
the<00:00:50.829> points<00:00:51.160> on<00:00:51.280> this<00:00:51.399> one<00:00:51.640> also<00:00:51.820> but<00:00:52.360> it's<00:00:52.510> not

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
the points on this one also but it's not

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.780 
the points on this one also but it's not
going<00:00:52.960> to<00:00:53.079> rust<00:00:53.350> is<00:00:53.620> quick<00:00:53.920> with<00:00:53.949> the<00:00:54.280> copper

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
going to rust is quick with the copper

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.960 
going to rust is quick with the copper
to<00:00:55.360> metal<00:00:55.780> on<00:00:55.989> all<00:00:56.739> the<00:00:56.890> movie<00:00:57.220> points<00:00:57.699> there's

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.570 
horizontal rod in the comment question
inside<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.130> gut<00:01:15.369> so<00:01:16.119> that<00:01:16.450> stops<00:01:16.869> it<00:01:17.229> from

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
inside the gut so that stops it from

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.249 
inside the gut so that stops it from
from<00:01:18.580> rusting<00:01:19.179> together<00:01:19.539> we<00:01:19.750> have<00:01:19.929> copper

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
from rusting together we have copper

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.400 
from rusting together we have copper
with<00:01:20.649> the<00:01:20.830> steel<00:01:21.270> also<00:01:22.270> have<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:22.479> locking<00:01:22.840> pin

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
with the steel also have a locking pin

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.490 
with the steel also have a locking pin
on<00:01:23.590> here<00:01:24.100> it's<00:01:24.850> not<00:01:25.119> a<00:01:25.179> swing<00:01:25.630> pin<00:01:26.020> but<00:01:26.350> it's

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
on here it's not a swing pin but it's

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.840 
on here it's not a swing pin but it's
also<00:01:26.679> a<00:01:26.940> locking<00:01:27.940> pin<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:30.250> can<00:01:30.460> end<00:01:30.670> this

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
also a locking pin so you can end this

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.029 
also a locking pin so you can end this
this<00:01:31.300> one<00:01:31.539> has<00:01:31.750> about<00:01:31.990> two<00:01:32.259> pounds<00:01:32.500> of<00:01:32.770> tension

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:33.039 
this one has about two pounds of tension

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.100 
this one has about two pounds of tension
on<00:01:33.369> if<00:01:33.520> you<00:01:33.700> have<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:33.970> press<00:01:34.179> up<00:01:34.420> running<00:01:34.840> hard

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
on if you have to press up running hard

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.300 
on if you have to press up running hard
and<00:01:35.440> that<00:01:35.890> line<00:01:36.310> goes<00:01:37.090> blue<00:01:37.450> so<00:01:38.409> this<00:01:38.740> this

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
and that line goes blue so this this

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.649 
and that line goes blue so this this
door<00:01:40.030> can<00:01:40.330> open<00:01:40.569> up<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:42.310> trap<00:01:42.880> you<00:01:43.240> can<00:01:43.420> turn

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
door can open up this trap you can turn

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.309 
door can open up this trap you can turn
it<00:01:43.720> over<00:01:44.080> and<00:01:44.670> still<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:46.179> door<00:01:46.479> is<00:01:46.840> not<00:01:47.080> going

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
it over and still the door is not going

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.219 
it over and still the door is not going
to<00:01:47.380> come<00:01:47.560> open<00:01:47.709> a<00:01:48.250> lot<00:01:48.640> of<00:01:48.789> these<00:01:48.880> swing<00:01:49.360> cams

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
to come open a lot of these swing cams

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.100 
to come open a lot of these swing cams
the<00:01:50.830> door<00:01:51.069> can<00:01:51.369> come<00:01:51.550> back<00:01:51.729> open<00:01:52.239> again<00:01:52.300> if<00:01:52.929> you

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
the door can come back open again if you

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.279 
the door can come back open again if you
notice<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.800> door<00:01:54.039> opens<00:01:54.550> that<00:01:54.759> much<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:56.140> the

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
notice the door opens that much to the

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.400 
notice the door opens that much to the
lock<00:01:56.530> so<00:01:57.489> let's<00:01:57.940> say<00:01:58.179> if<00:01:58.300> a<00:01:58.390> gray<00:01:58.629> fox<00:01:58.899> getting

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
lock so let's say if a gray fox getting

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.350 
lock so let's say if a gray fox getting
here<00:01:59.649> and<00:01:59.830> he<00:02:00.009> gets<00:02:00.250> his<00:02:00.429> tail<00:02:00.700> foot<00:02:01.090> in<00:02:01.270> the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
here and he gets his tail foot in the

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.229 
here and he gets his tail foot in the
door<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:02.800> door<00:02:03.129> will<00:02:03.280> go<00:02:03.429> down<00:02:03.729> and<00:02:04.119> it'll

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:04.239 
door the door will go down and it'll

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:06.779 
door the door will go down and it'll
still<00:02:04.690> lock<00:02:05.020> it<00:02:05.739> doesn't<00:02:06.129> have<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.399> go<00:02:06.550> all<00:02:06.580> the

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
still lock it doesn't have to go all the

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.059 
still lock it doesn't have to go all the
way<00:02:06.940> to<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.330> ground<00:02:07.360> if<00:02:08.229> you<00:02:08.379> get<00:02:08.530> mud<00:02:08.800> or<00:02:08.979> snow

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
way to the ground if you get mud or snow

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.300 
way to the ground if you get mud or snow
or<00:02:09.369> stones<00:02:10.000> under<00:02:10.539> there<00:02:10.980> another<00:02:11.980> thing

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
or stones under there another thing

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.130 
or stones under there another thing
these<00:02:12.489> reels<00:02:12.879> jump<00:02:13.300> down<00:02:13.569> to<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.900> ground

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
these reels jump down to the ground

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.350 
these reels jump down to the ground
either<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:15.370> we<00:02:15.550> don't<00:02:15.730> have<00:02:15.819> to<00:02:15.970> worry<00:02:16.209> about

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
either so we don't have to worry about

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.640 
either so we don't have to worry about
dirt<00:02:17.400> trails<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:19.330> jamming<00:02:19.810> up<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:19.959> door<00:02:20.290> so

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
dirt trails and jamming up the door so

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.440 
dirt trails and jamming up the door so
it<00:02:20.770> doesn't<00:02:21.099> love<00:02:23.400> that's<00:02:24.400> pretty<00:02:24.640> much<00:02:24.760> we
