00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.339
 and very good situation commenting today I 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.689
 I bring a model war of 2m one 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.129
 You are asking me a lot, I've already 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.330
 created why not do it now that they have 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.910
 updated some other things remain 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.470
 I will comment but good to leave here 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.150
 reminder that the first game the 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.189
 of the candle rigor to go or cutting 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.570
 troops and such I start to stop not 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.769
 I start with one with the game and good to 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.810
 from here you can see a little bit of 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.460
 background game the good of the gameplay 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.159
 of the rigors in the combat map 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.409
 cutting some departure and map 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:29.509
 of the good the yes in play of old rules 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:30.980
 it's on the map of wars what 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.480
 same a domain cutting a little bit the 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.559
 partita in some memory in fact I think 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.120
 that is just a streak inside that 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.010
 departure but that is a 20 o streak 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.210
 more I do not remember it's pretty good like that 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.739
 how good this video to be a little more 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.420
 long because it's an interesting duel 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.410
 doing it this tied and also 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.670
 I want to deal a bit with the subject of 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.289
 accessories not the truth is that I'm 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.210
 interesting and first of all say 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.800
 also that I said it in another 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.120
 video but I think it's important 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.039
 clarify it because if not this duel 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.500
 nor it makes much sense is that 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.600
 they have worsened the rapid fire is worth what 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.309
 they have done worse as they have done 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.469
 well they have put him more backward and 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.850
 they have put the one to give it down reach 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.980
 the weapon is worth the first day in the first 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.540
 damage that the distance with the 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.010
 what the rules that fire has 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.450
 fast built in i hope 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.830
 before simply because they have fire 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.660
 Built-in radio because rapid fire 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.760
 also but a lot is that it does not 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.110
 note quite the scope and prayer what 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.100
 have gone up many moves between more 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.840
 up and you have to have a lot 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.490
 careful not then how would be the first 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.570
 gameplay is that of rigor and if interested 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.010
 see it then I carry the two weapons 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.200
 exactly the same so you see a little 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.210
 As they are tied accessories I do not carry 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.730
 the rigor with fast fire with hilt 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.080
 and with the extended charger and the riva and 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.330
 the rules more of the same the fire 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.100
 fast because it's built-in and I carry 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.170
 the draft of expanded and on the hilt 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.060
 because if it's not going to be quiet 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.710
 so if you think we are going to put 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.970
 the templates of the weapons a riverside 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.979
 left to rigor and up to the 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.690
 right of the rules the rigor then it 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.850
 it raises two precision points and lowers it 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.000
 two handling points that has been 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.220
 that is 20% worse than hip and the rule 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.229
 is what makes you climb a point 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.610
 of the cadence that this apart if it is 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.140
 independent of the rapid fire it is worth 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.460
 apart from the rapid fire it goes up more 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.960
 you know the cadence that you raise the 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.340
 second then the rapid fire goes up the 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.800
 two we'll see later the statistics 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.930
 buying a little the rigor and it lowered 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.550
 again another management point not 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.110
 then with the management, it makes that 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.580
 that point a little bit slower than 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.110
 forgiveness that go worse than hip like 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.130
 the rigor does not mean so much but it does go 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.240
 little worse 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.980
 we have in mind that it has fire 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.450
 built-in radio the rapid fire has 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.940
 prevention also race 20 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.740
 so the risk is 20 percent 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.710
 worse than the m1 of the normal of 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.150
 series and the riva and the rule is is 30% 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.490
 worse than having fast fire put 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.190
 then let's move directly and 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.200
 with the data of the two weapons the data 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.450
 real good also as you already know the 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.700
 m1 recently the loader's low 45 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.470
 to 35 so with broad this time 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.210
 they stay in 52 bullets, you can 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.100
 check in the gameplay the recharge 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.040
 exactly also the same in the 21 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.300
 with 8 the normal 1 the fast enough 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.470
 well the truth and you know how to pause in 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.470
 competitive and such has very well to 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.030
 be fast and two with one the refills 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.370
 empty of slow so try not to 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.010
 leave the empty weapon never good here 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.510
 we are with the different one not in the week 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.650
 irrigation is not 20% more accurate with what 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.810
 which process you have is very very 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.040
 under the rules and they do not lose 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.420
 processes but by bringing the rapid fire 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.490
 incorporated goes much more up 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.050
 especially with this new patch that have 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.050
 put ghost not fast fire like this 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.180
 that rigor moves very little and from 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.860
 arrange moves a lot and it's pretty 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.110
 difficult now after this patch kill 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.460
 from a distance to a person if you start to 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.980
 move like crazy alarm not 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.540
 and well we have the cadence also here 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.310
 yes they win the rules as you know 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.450
 the rule is apart from having a point of 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.770
 cadence this has the rapid fire 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.170
 incorporated so the risk stays 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.110
 the first eight 850 bullets and bullets by 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.880
 minute and the following of the charger 359 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.560
 and say that this is not like lacquer f5 that 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.660
 every time you shoot in this case 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.180
 back the high cadence is worth so it's 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.620
 very very useful with the m1 shoot let 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.140
 shoot and re- shoot take advantage 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.460
 the maximum cadence we will not say but 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.660
 with the rules as it is complicated 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.220
 extra dence causes the cadences to 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.480
 tie a little more and how has the 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.060
 fire built-in radio I've counted 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.470
 has my 61 bullets per minute eight 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.060
 first bullets in the next with an 86 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.530
 as you see more than rigor 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.910
 obviously the risk is subtracted without fire 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.930
 quick post it's worth you know what it takes 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.360
 account the accesses it takes 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.010
 incorporated and well it's pretty 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.050
 faster than short distances than the 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.790
 that the rigor not good we see that the 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.500
 reach here if you change the scope of the 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.990
 region is the normal maximum 12 with seven 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.480
 meters kills three bullets between 12 with 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.880
 71 with a mark of 5 and from there 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.580
 of seven bullets 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.530
 the m1 reckless as we are seeing 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.570
 it diminishes the first of the reaches 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.610
 this is new rapid fire project 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.410
 to 10 with 8 that you believe or you do not notice 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.140
 quite short distances two meters 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.550
 they help a lot and from good and 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.950
 damage is the same vale until ten 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.640
 meters three bullets good almost 11 we go to 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.680
 say between 12 11 meters and 31 with 1 well 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.410
 it's still 5 and from then on 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.060
 are 7 not so good then here is 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.890
 where you notice a little bit that change does not 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.570
 of the scope rapid fire 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.250
 theme that we are a little more and good 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.440
 because the cadence is still the same 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.000
 with the rapid fire set so if you 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.250
 it seems we are already going to the resolution and to 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.230
 treat the subject of accessories not so 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.270
 well as we are seeing the rigor wins 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.830
 in recoil and far-reaching by the game 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.630
 fast just do not and long that 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.370
 wins in cadence so in conclusion 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.170
 we can say that the m1 rigor is a 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.820
 more polyvalent weapon that will take you so much 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.590
 for near as for far is to say is 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.580
 a machine are very absolutely nothing and 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.660
 If we put a handle on it, 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.240
 I personally think that he does not need 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.310
 in the fast game it goes very well either 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.380
 as not in stone, nothing moves 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.760
 if it's awesome and the rules is a 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.350
 weapon destined to kill only 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.850
 exclusively up close and if you have a 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.600
 little average distance aim of 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.940
 far and yes no 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.820
 because it has no harm and because it moves 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.230
 too much then how are you like 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.970
 said earlier at the beginning in this duel 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.380
 I have tried to put weapons with 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.150
 accessories so you see how they work 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.130
 both of them and I really think that 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.360
 putting him of the same accessories we 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.800
 account that when putting the rapid fire to the 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.780
 rigor will lower the scope to the same as 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.370
 the one of the fixes continues having a little 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.620
 more than cadence the rules but 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.550
 Retreat from rigor is much much more 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.020
 under that the rules do not 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.000
 ask because I suppose it will be for 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:51.160
 those two points of precision that wins not 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.660
 so ultimately we even met 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.760
 accessories I have to give the victory of 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.230
 new to rigor and you know that I am 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.520
 quite a fan boy works this combo and 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.530
 of the three but now after this 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.900
 quick fire patch I think the 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.790
 rigor is better and even with the moon 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.890
 accessories is not to say the loose weapon 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.420
 without accessories or anything I think this 

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.770
 reckless way but if we put him 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.240
 appropriate accesses what is best the 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.370
 rigor plus rigor we have many more 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.600
 options to put things I do not think that 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.100
 the rules have to carry the 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.480
 grip and after the part of the m1 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.640
 he has to be forced practically 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.590
 or on each side if we want to contrast 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.790
 a little the fast game or the channel 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.110
 expanded if we do not want to be left without 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.760
 bullets very fast personally what 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.260
 will have expanded and the goal we have a 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.750
 lots of options the rigor can go very 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.500
 well with each one extended unsheathed 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.370
 corrugated 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.320
 is to put as I carry it and now 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.730
 fire grip fast every hour is 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.470
 say we have multiple options with the 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.940
 rigor than with the rules not so the 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.160
 rules exclusively to kill from 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.690
 near and a little bit of distance from 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.400
 far not and rigor is absolutely worth 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.900
 for all of mind the rules is better 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.130
 that the rigor of close and you found 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.840
 in the rules closely the rule is going 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.920
 to explode but the risks and you put 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.440
 little fast also works very well 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.030
 then the truth that this hard has been 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.990
 quite tied for that I said by 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.610
 twitter that was an affront thing 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.200
 matched though for example the rules 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.000
 will enter the best weapons of the game 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.680
 better said that the game and the 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.600
 rigor is not that after this change 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.800
 The truth is that things 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.690
 worth the redundancy have changed 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.400
 enough and I think rigor is a 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.720
 droplet best of promo socialism ticos 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.280
 so what you said you know you use the 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.630
 comparison do not forget to leave your me 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.350
 he liked favorites and his vision also 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.350
 goodbye 

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:27.819
 yes
