for our information let's choose the

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.999 
for our information let's choose the
trapezoid<00:00:03.240> list<00:00:03.510> which<00:00:04.110> as<00:00:04.319> you<00:00:04.500> read<00:00:04.740> in<00:00:04.980> that

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
trapezoid list which as you read in that

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.789 
trapezoid list which as you read in that
preview<00:00:05.640> window<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.450> used<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:07.109> show<00:00:07.350> grouped

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.340 
and then format and then the crop tool
and<00:03:40.920> let's<00:03:41.580> use<00:03:41.850> our<00:03:42.060> crop<00:03:42.420> tool<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:43.170> reduce

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
and let's use our crop tool to reduce

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.400 
and let's use our crop tool to reduce
that<00:03:43.980> button<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:45.060> nothing<00:03:45.510> but<00:03:45.690> green<00:03:46.110> in

that button to nothing but green in

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.680 
that button to nothing but green in
other<00:03:46.980> words<00:03:47.250> get<00:03:47.700> rid<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.000> all<00:03:48.450> the

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
other words get rid of all the

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.500 
other words get rid of all the
background<00:03:49.320> so<00:03:50.010> that<00:03:50.250> we<00:03:50.430> have<00:03:50.670> only<00:03:50.970> the

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
background so that we have only the

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.009 
background so that we have only the
green<00:03:51.840> element<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.890> work<00:03:53.160> with<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:54.019> let's

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
green element to work with and let's

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.880 
green element to work with and let's
also<00:03:55.320> reduce<00:03:56.070> it<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.820> square<00:03:57.650> so<00:03:58.650> that

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
also reduce it to a square so that

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.460 
also reduce it to a square so that
whenever<00:03:59.130> we<00:03:59.519> apply<00:03:59.970> our<00:04:00.360> oval<00:04:00.900> or<00:04:01.170> circle

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
whenever we apply our oval or circle

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.670 
whenever we apply our oval or circle
tool<00:04:01.920> that<00:04:02.640> we<00:04:02.910> get<00:04:03.239> something<00:04:03.680> approximating

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
tool that we get something approximating

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.490 
tool that we get something approximating
a<00:04:04.830> good<00:04:05.280> circle<00:04:05.630> once<00:04:06.630> we've<00:04:06.810> eliminated<00:04:07.140> the

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
a good circle once we've eliminated the

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.430 
a good circle once we've eliminated the
background<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.459> produced<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.360> square<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:10.080> by

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
background and produced a square and by

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.440 
background and produced a square and by
the<00:04:10.500> way<00:04:10.739> you<00:04:10.799> can<00:04:11.160> use<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.610> height<00:04:11.850> and<00:04:12.180> width

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450

it<00:04:17.650> has<00:04:17.919> been<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.190> simple<00:04:18.669> matter<00:04:19.030> of<00:04:19.329> going<00:04:19.959> up

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
it has been a simple matter of going up

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.340 
it has been a simple matter of going up
to<00:04:20.949> our<00:04:20.979> format<00:04:21.759> picture<00:04:22.479> shapes<00:04:22.840> and

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
to our format picture shapes and

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.060 
to our format picture shapes and
applying<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.430> oval<00:04:24.940> to<00:04:25.630> produce<00:04:25.900> a<00:04:26.440> button

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
applying the oval to produce a button

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.570 
applying the oval to produce a button
that<00:04:27.520> we<00:04:27.669> can<00:04:27.880> then<00:04:28.090> work<00:04:28.570> with<00:04:29.039> so<00:04:30.039> let's<00:04:30.400> go

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
that we can then work with so let's go

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.390 
that we can then work with so let's go
up<00:04:30.789> to<00:04:30.940> picture<00:04:31.360> shapes<00:04:31.720> click<00:04:32.169> pulldown<00:04:33.130> and

select our basic shape oval circle and
voila<00:04:37.090> we've<00:04:37.389> got<00:04:37.600> a<00:04:37.630> pretty<00:04:37.960> good-looking

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
voila we've got a pretty good-looking

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.070 
voila we've got a pretty good-looking
circular<00:04:39.220> button<00:04:39.610> there<00:04:39.940> right<00:04:40.690> now<00:04:40.870> it's

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
circular button there right now it's

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.719 
circular button there right now it's
kind<00:04:41.289> of<00:04:41.320> a<00:04:41.410> flat<00:04:41.680> image<00:04:41.889> so<00:04:42.280> let's<00:04:42.310> put<00:04:42.699> a

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
kind of a flat image so let's put a

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.610 
kind of a flat image so let's put a
border<00:04:43.240> on<00:04:43.270> it<00:04:43.509> to<00:04:43.930> give<00:04:44.080> it<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.229> little<00:04:44.350> bit

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
border on it to give it a little bit

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.430 
border on it to give it a little bit
more<00:04:44.889> relief<00:04:45.340> and<00:04:45.820> maybe<00:04:46.780> a<00:04:46.870> little<00:04:47.020> bit<00:04:47.259> more

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
bevel and the border it looks so much

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.850 
bevel and the border it looks so much
more<00:04:54.340> like<00:04:54.789> a<00:04:54.820> button<00:04:55.330> let's<00:04:55.960> go<00:04:56.169> up<00:04:56.350> to<00:04:56.830> our

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
more like a button let's go up to our

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.810 
more like a button let's go up to our
size<00:04:57.370> window<00:04:58.060> and<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.419> top<00:04:58.660> right<00:04:59.020> and<00:04:59.820> since

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
we have lock aspect ratio on we can

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.090 
we have lock aspect ratio on we can
simply<00:05:04.360> change<00:05:04.570> one<00:05:04.930> element<00:05:05.380> and<00:05:05.530> bring<00:05:05.949> it

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
simply change one element and bring it

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.420 
simply change one element and bring it
down<00:05:06.310> to<00:05:06.520> a<00:05:06.550> more<00:05:06.820> typical<00:05:07.090> bullet<00:05:07.990> size<00:05:08.430> now

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
down to a more typical bullet size now

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.700 
down to a more typical bullet size now
that<00:05:09.669> we<00:05:09.789> have<00:05:10.000> our<00:05:10.180> prototype<00:05:10.750> bullet<00:05:11.139> we've

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
that we have our prototype bullet we've

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.040 
that we have our prototype bullet we've
simply<00:05:12.160> duplicated<00:05:13.000> as<00:05:13.150> many<00:05:13.389> times<00:05:13.690> as<00:05:13.990> we

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
simply duplicated as many times as we

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.159 
simply duplicated as many times as we
need<00:05:14.400> now<00:05:15.400> let's<00:05:15.789> select<00:05:16.210> them<00:05:16.479> all<00:05:16.660> and<00:05:16.930> put

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
need now let's select them all and put

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.930 
need now let's select them all and put
them<00:05:17.289> into<00:05:17.440> a<00:05:17.590> group<00:05:17.889> so<00:05:18.220> that<00:05:18.370> we<00:05:18.490> can<00:05:18.669> align

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
them into a group so that we can align

them hold down the shift key as you
click<00:05:21.760> on<00:05:21.820> each<00:05:21.970> bullet<00:05:22.449> that<00:05:23.139> will<00:05:23.320> group

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
click on each bullet that will group

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.860 
click on each bullet that will group
them<00:05:23.860> and<00:05:24.430> then<00:05:24.610> let's<00:05:24.849> go<00:05:25.120> to<00:05:25.180> the<00:05:25.539> range

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
them and then let's go to the range

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.830 
them and then let's go to the range
align<00:05:26.620> let's<00:05:27.370> align<00:05:27.669> them<00:05:27.910> left<00:05:28.240> along<00:05:28.780> the

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
align let's align them left along the

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.500 
align let's align them left along the
vertical<00:05:29.260> axis<00:05:29.520> then<00:05:30.520> let's<00:05:30.729> go<00:05:30.880> to<00:05:30.940> arrange

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
vertical axis then let's go to arrange

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.050 
vertical axis then let's go to arrange
again<00:05:31.960> and<00:05:32.169> let's<00:05:32.710> distribute<00:05:33.340> them<00:05:33.550> equally

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
again and let's distribute them equally

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.600 
again and let's distribute them equally
in<00:05:34.330> a<00:05:34.810> vertical<00:05:35.229> fashion<00:05:35.380> making<00:05:36.099> sure<00:05:36.400> we've

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
in a vertical fashion making sure we've

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.050 
in a vertical fashion making sure we've
got<00:05:36.639> equal<00:05:37.180> spaces<00:05:37.750> between<00:05:38.470> all<00:05:38.650> three<00:05:39.060> if

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
got equal spaces between all three if

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.360 
got equal spaces between all three if
we're<00:05:40.419> satisfied<00:05:40.570> with<00:05:40.960> that<00:05:41.349> we<00:05:41.860> can<00:05:42.010> group

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
we're satisfied with that we can group

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.670 
we're satisfied with that we can group
them<00:05:42.580> all<00:05:42.849> together<00:05:43.060> more<00:05:43.630> permanently<00:05:44.440> by

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
them all together more permanently by

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.879 
them all together more permanently by
selecting<00:05:45.250> them<00:05:45.400> all<00:05:45.840> going<00:05:46.840> up<00:05:47.139> to<00:05:47.380> a<00:05:47.409> range

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889 
selecting them all going up to a range

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.960 
selecting them all going up to a range
and<00:05:48.720> selecting<00:05:49.720> group<00:05:50.280> now<00:05:51.280> they<00:05:51.550> will<00:05:51.699> always

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:51.970 
and selecting group now they will always

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.219 
and selecting group now they will always
function<00:05:52.840> as<00:05:52.990> a<00:05:53.050> single<00:05:53.530> object<00:05:54.870> until<00:05:55.870> we

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
function as a single object until we

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.520 
function as a single object until we
ungroup<00:05:57.570> another<00:05:58.570> way<00:05:58.810> to<00:05:58.870> align<00:05:59.289> your

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
ungroup another way to align your

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.430 
ungroup another way to align your
bullets<00:05:59.949> is<00:06:00.430> with<00:06:00.970> the<00:06:01.180> gridlines<00:06:01.720> and<00:06:01.990> your

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
bullets is with the gridlines and your

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.210 
bullets is with the gridlines and your
eyeballs

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
eyeballs

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.719 
eyeballs
so<00:06:03.729> let's<00:06:03.970> ungroup<00:06:04.570> these<00:06:04.870> bullets<00:06:05.349> and<00:06:05.729> then

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
so let's ungroup these bullets and then

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:09.659 
so let's ungroup these bullets and then
let's<00:06:07.090> go<00:06:07.270> over<00:06:07.510> to<00:06:07.659> the<00:06:07.780> View<00:06:08.110> tab<00:06:08.349> and<00:06:08.680> then

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
let's go over to the View tab and then

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.490 
let's go over to the View tab and then
after<00:06:10.000> the<00:06:10.090> View<00:06:10.330> tab<00:06:10.570> go<00:06:10.990> down<00:06:11.229> to<00:06:11.409> the

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
after the View tab go down to the

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.260 
after the View tab go down to the
show/hide<00:06:11.770> grouping<00:06:12.520> and<00:06:12.699> turn<00:06:12.940> on<00:06:13.120> the

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
show/hide grouping and turn on the

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.620 
show/hide grouping and turn on the
gridlines<00:06:13.690> now<00:06:14.650> we<00:06:14.710> align<00:06:15.430> the<00:06:15.909> bullets

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
gridlines now we align the bullets

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.439 
gridlines now we align the bullets
using<00:06:17.199> our<00:06:17.349> grid<00:06:17.620> lines<00:06:17.919> and<00:06:18.310> our<00:06:18.880> eyeballs

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:19.449 
using our grid lines and our eyeballs

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:21.870 
using our grid lines and our eyeballs
and<00:06:19.780> once<00:06:20.440> we've<00:06:20.680> got<00:06:20.919> them<00:06:21.250> lined<00:06:21.639> up

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
and once we've got them lined up

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.570 
and once we've got them lined up
according<00:06:22.419> to<00:06:22.570> the<00:06:22.690> docks<00:06:22.960> and<00:06:23.289> the<00:06:23.349> lines<00:06:23.650> we

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
according to the docks and the lines we

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.650 
according to the docks and the lines we
can<00:06:24.760> again<00:06:25.300> go<00:06:25.719> back<00:06:25.750> up

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
can again go back up

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.670 
can again go back up
to<00:06:26.930> the<00:06:27.230> format<00:06:27.980> tool<00:06:28.750> after<00:06:29.750> grouping<00:06:30.560> our

to the format tool after grouping our

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.050 
to the format tool after grouping our
bullets<00:06:31.100> again<00:06:31.460> and<00:06:32.240> at<00:06:32.750> the<00:06:32.900> format<00:06:33.350> tool

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060 
bullets again and at the format tool

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.000 
bullets again and at the format tool
distribute<00:06:35.060> vertically<00:06:35.690> one<00:06:36.080> more<00:06:36.380> time<00:06:36.680> just

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 
distribute vertically one more time just

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.970 
distribute vertically one more time just
to<00:06:37.700> make<00:06:37.760> sure<00:06:37.910> get<00:06:38.630> any<00:06:38.900> last<00:06:39.320> little<00:06:39.620> nudging

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:39.980 
to make sure get any last little nudging

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.940 
to make sure get any last little nudging
done<00:06:40.370> see<00:06:40.670> there<00:06:40.880> it<00:06:41.000> nudged<00:06:41.210> and<00:06:41.890> also<00:06:42.890> to

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
done see there it nudged and also to

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.850 
done see there it nudged and also to
align<00:06:43.550> left<00:06:43.940> I<00:06:44.210> see<00:06:44.570> it<00:06:44.660> nuts<00:06:44.930> just<00:06:45.380> a<00:06:45.590> little

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
align left I see it nuts just a little

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.860 
align left I see it nuts just a little
bit<00:06:46.010> and<00:06:46.190> now<00:06:46.820> we<00:06:46.850> know<00:06:47.330> that<00:06:47.360> they're

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
bit and now we know that they're

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.380 
bit and now we know that they're
absolutely<00:06:48.770> perfectly<00:06:49.670> aligned

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:50.390 
absolutely perfectly aligned

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.750 
absolutely perfectly aligned
one<00:06:51.260> other<00:06:51.410> alignment<00:06:52.040> I'm<00:06:52.130> going<00:06:52.400> to<00:06:52.520> apply

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:52.760 
one other alignment I'm going to apply

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.810 
one other alignment I'm going to apply
is<00:06:53.360> to<00:06:53.840> move<00:06:54.050> them<00:06:54.350> over<00:06:54.620> to<00:06:54.830> the<00:06:55.130> edge<00:06:55.400> of<00:06:55.760> that

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:55.820 
is to move them over to the edge of that
