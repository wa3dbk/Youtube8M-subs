as far as walking I do chase around my

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.109 
as far as walking I do chase around my
daughter<00:01:20.619> all<00:01:20.890> day<00:01:21.070> long<00:01:21.310> which<00:01:21.579> I'm<00:01:21.880> sure

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
daughter all day long which I'm sure

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.170 
daughter all day long which I'm sure
burned<00:01:22.450> some<00:01:22.689> calories<00:01:22.719> but<00:01:23.560> my<00:01:24.399> plan<00:01:24.789> was<00:01:25.149> to

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
burned some calories but my plan was to

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.270 
burned some calories but my plan was to
stick<00:01:25.780> to<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:26.110> number<00:01:26.619> one<00:01:26.799> thing<00:01:27.039> first

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
stick to the number one thing first

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.830 
stick to the number one thing first
which<00:01:27.579> in<00:01:27.789> my<00:01:28.030> opinion<00:01:28.180> is<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.810> most

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
which in my opinion is the most

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.690 
which in my opinion is the most
important<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.799> that's<00:01:29.950> what<00:01:30.250> you<00:01:30.369> put<00:01:30.579> in

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
important and that's what you put in

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.440 
important and that's what you put in
your<00:01:30.729> mouth<00:01:31.049> your<00:01:32.049> diet<00:01:32.590> is<00:01:32.829> the<00:01:33.490> number<00:01:34.060> one

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
your mouth your diet is the number one

your mouth your diet is the number one
thing<00:01:34.869> as<00:01:35.109> far<00:01:35.320> as<00:01:35.500> losing<00:01:35.710> weight<00:01:36.070> in<00:01:36.219> my

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
thing as far as losing weight in my

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.219 
thing as far as losing weight in my
opinion<00:01:36.880> now<00:01:37.119> some<00:01:37.539> people<00:01:37.810> will<00:01:38.020> say

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
opinion now some people will say

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.069 
opinion now some people will say
otherwise<00:01:38.500> but<00:01:38.710> I<00:01:39.280> can<00:01:39.609> tell<00:01:39.820> you<00:01:40.000> that<00:01:40.270> I<00:01:40.570> used

my twenty one week weigh-in - 26.2 so

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.520
