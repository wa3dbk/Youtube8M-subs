00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.210
 zero and today I make this video too 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.250
 because I was asked to do it on 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.010
 request and in this video I wanted 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.840
 talk to you about the new release of 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.920
 minecraft which will be available soon 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.500
 ie version 1.8 version 1.8 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.970
 will be very very large not like how 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.890
 those that are coming out now that 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.500
 they have added colors for example 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.260
 different in the glass or have fixed 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.330
 some bugs but with the release of 1.8 ci 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.700
 there will be many many changes 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.320
 a first change is the fact that it will be 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.880
 You can change your name and 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.010
 this is really important 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.800
 also because as people who maybe have it 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.480
 his name has long since been bought 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.790
 he doesn't like it anymore and would like to change it 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.050
 for example my name is over sel but not 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.970
 I like how I don't want to call 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.860
 miserable young people good about 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.680
 Furnishing items were 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.329
 added we say flags that 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.009
 would be much better in my opinion with 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:15.680
 however some images are anyway 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.659
 pretty and pretty to see then have 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.429
 added different types of doors depending on 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.340
 of the wood that is used for kraft 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:24.170
 arles and that some are very beautiful ad 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.719
 example this or that with the 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.450
 birch and with doors added 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.399
 also the fences and the gates on 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.929
 block has been added a new type of 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.659
 sponge block which would be sponge 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:37.670
 wet which is nothing however 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.829
 nice enough to see a thing 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.810
 very nice that has been added is it 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.549
 stand air for the armor the stand for 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.240
 the armor and allows to lay the 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.219
 own armor on this stand 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.850
 it seems to me that it has been taken and been 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:54.859
 taken as a cue from a mod I used 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.770
 I for 1.5.2 but I would not say one 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.600
 lie, however, if it is not so but it is a lot 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.329
 nice and happy added calvino 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.219
 they also added iron hatches 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.229
 which are not openable by hand but only with 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.390
 the olive buttons as well as the doors 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.399
 they added how it will know the 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.370
 most of you the slides that block 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.980
 on which it will be possible to bounce or 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.840
 make ingenious machines because of 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.390
 example with a sticky piston e 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.950
 we attach a slang cube on the slime 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.670
 cube will attack many others 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.730
 blocks 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.989
 the rabbits added that if killed 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.580
 they find the skin and the cards the meat 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.489
 so they also added many types 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.030
 of foods related to rabbits like the 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.530
 soup or or other types of parts of the 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.480
 body of the rabbit added new 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.980
 types of sea monsters such as the 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.050
 guardian who makes this kind of 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.510
 attack a lot that makes this species of 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:57.900
 attack with his eye which is a lot 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:59.819
 nice also as an animation if killed if 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.769
 killed too many fish and scales that in 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.319
 this case did not find me have 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.569
 added new types of minerals e 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.959
 also new types of marine hand minerals 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:12.120
 related to marine structures such as ad 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.590
 example the sea ​​lantern would be 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.600
 inside marine added 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.480
 different structures such as i 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.930
 new villages apparently of villagers 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.120
 then submerged by debris that is like 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.640
 of villages of villagers but more scattered and 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.170
 a little wider then they added new ones 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.420
 structures and new times very Mayan type 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.480
 wider and added i 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.730
 marine dungeons that are also very 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.709
 beautiful to see, in short, they added 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.350
 a new violet and perhaps other types of 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.910
 dungeons such as pyramids with one 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.730
 new a new type of sandstone that 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:52.230
 they would be orange findable near the 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:55.530
 Canyon biome is pretty much it is a lot 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.720
 equal or to the sandstone of the desert but 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.180
 that with the design very 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.010
 detail is nice they added the 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.329
 possibility to color the radius of the 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.329
 bie with with colored glasses 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.540
 a very beautiful thing that has been 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.090
 addition is an action for the villagers ad 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.760
 example certain types of villagers cultivate 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.340
 they grow wheat then kraft not of 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.470
 bread and give it to other villagers who 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.410
 They sell to us you can do many 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.270
 constructions related to this work of the 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.380
 villies for example leaving gods 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:36.500
 hoppers under a peasant who makes bread 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.570
 near a peasant who receives it e 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.190
 when he'll throw it if he'll go by 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.340
 luck the bread will fall into the hopper e 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.710
 so you will have a farm and bread 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.110
 automatic in short ok guys and I would say 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.940
