 so c aches that well small 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.380
 lesions that and legal fees more 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.940
 who will let out a little bit of 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.170
 calcium that will spawn small 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.960
 inflammations 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.660
 typically these 36 48 or even 72 hours 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.080
 it lasts until 72 hours after 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.040
 facts so c aches for the civic 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.260
 and you have several possibilities 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.270
 many things to do first 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.909
 think about warming up makes a 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.560
 progressive warming up on everything 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.609
 by ass or lighten your thumbs and 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.950
 charges develop loads 

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:12.140
 important in particular in ex entries 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.509
 conjugated with guys 0 well received 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.939
 especially on a jump on a good 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.799
 dynamic second tips france had 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.450
 a taste to hydrate before during and 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.259
 after the effort allow others to 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.299
 recover well 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.890
 in parallel of course when it's having 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.390
 a diet and 50 always 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.209
 balanced and varied 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.340
 then at the end of the session, think about yourself 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:33.259
 stretch yourself based on a little routine 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.780
 that lasts five to six stretches to do 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.909
 two ends with 25 to 30 seconds per 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.860
 position in order to give back to the muscle its 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.079
 initial length so that will allow 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.759
 to recover and especially to inhibit the 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.259
 top level receivers did everybody 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.000
 for aches for Jews 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.530
 were finally you can use some 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.879
 socks or stockings 6 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.719
 and a lot of killer fighting at the level 

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:53.569
 lower limbs 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.469
 it allows you to accentuate their turn 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:55.909
 solar and therefore limit 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.450
 Inflammation level of limbs 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.489
 lower 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.379
 either for a long enough effort for the 

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:01.310
 bodybuilding once the companions 

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:03.319
 are already present 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.700
 you also have several possibilities 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.289
 firstly to do massages 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.750
 can always dream the muscle is 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.039
 so favored blood return by the 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.720
 same continuity you have the baths 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.000
 hot that allowed to relax 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.560
 muscularly and you chained everything from 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.120
 suite with presents a cold shower to 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.829
 train of really understood but I will have 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.880
 a vasoconstriction at the level of 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.290
 blood vessels what will you 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.730
 to limit inflammation 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.680
 finally last 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.150
 for it's really that if your car 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.790

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.930
 take aspirin one to decrease 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.930
 this feeling of pain 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.230
 and that's it for this little video 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.090
 on fighting drama a region in 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.379

 workout do not see aches and 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.900
 yet have a progression as I 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.000
 you say it's just micro lesion 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.739
 at the muscular level that releases a type 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.340
 of calcium and therefore generates a small 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.290
 inflammation
