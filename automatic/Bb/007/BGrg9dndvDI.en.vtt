00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
better location for this which would

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.379 
better location for this which would

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
have been near the main power switch but

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.689 
have been near the main power switch but
I<00:04:52.419> still<00:04:52.840> commend<00:04:53.440> them<00:04:53.650> for<00:04:53.680> including<00:04:54.370> it<00:04:54.490> I

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
I still commend them for including it I

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.780 
I still commend them for including it I
wish<00:04:55.120> more<00:04:55.510> power<00:04:55.870> supplies<00:04:56.380> that<00:04:56.979> have<00:04:57.430> an

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
LED fan would include it because it's

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.219
