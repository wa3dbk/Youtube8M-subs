00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:13.940
 Nankai region Naa in pretty good I Ah certainly the main even when viewed from a distance 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:17.760
 It has an attraction that attracts people , but it seems to attract people in various ways. 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:21.740
 There was also a comment but maybe it could be a bit higher 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:25.690
 Yes it stands out even from afar 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.690
 I had forgotten that Ali Sonmachi 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:33.110
 It will finally come out 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:38.900
 This figure is strange for respect, because I tried to run away from this village, I can not help it 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:40.570
 If I could build such a building, I'm getting tired and now I'm building something 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.560
 But I will stand 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:50.440
 That means you can see the difference between a general person and a genius 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:52.570
 That's also true It's true that I've made everything up until now 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.760
 I If you do not Ika with more appeal 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:01:00.590
 Asore Well then who There 's also good pickup in the game or the best ones make it 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:05.840
 Well I don't mind 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:11.750
 Reimu and Marisa It is a match After zo I think about the judge in the cart 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.710
 I'm ready when I'm going to make an overwhelming difference It's fine, but the material is too short 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.630
 What 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:20.580
 I want glowstones in particular . What is glowstone? 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:25.320
 It's a mysterious stone that glows like a torch 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.830
 It is how therefore the less likely very taken by the Well catfish Glow Stone itself that chose me it 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.720
 It's on the ceiling called "Gar" and it's also special to go to the major gate gate obsidian 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.110
 I always have to light it up 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.100
 In order to remove the obsidian, you have to cool it with magma water and harden it. 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.570
 Furthermore, because obsidian is too hard to be taken with ordinary pickels, you need a diamond picker 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.550
 Well, it seems that it is very hard to go to the Nether with such a feeling 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.000
 Skin that it is or was found 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:53.090
 I understand that's that kind of thing 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.870
 It's definitely not understood It 's all right. 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:01.940
 Ageyo Let That summary tell me now talk about a word 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:05.150
 Confine the game content to the Nether Naeeee by me so the peace of this city 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.610
 Wait Wait a minute Marisa it just thank you please forgive me is anything can 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.369
 There is no, but please do forgive me 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:16.280
 No, I didn't say a word like that 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:19.790
 I 'm locked up in the respect I know and dominate this village. 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.290
 Wait Wait a minute Marisa it just will anything I ask please forgive what 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.650
 But please do not forgive me 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.650
 Ha 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.030
 par 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:37.550
 Drank the First go to collect the diamonds that 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:44.270
 But it's had said so from the beginning in that wanted to say I need a Noah diamond while ago 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:48.660
 I'll leave it to diamonds Because diamond hunter Reimu is called Whom I 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:53.820
 Because the speed of finding diamonds was fast, I was surely called by the viewers so 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:59.730
 It must have been said that when I was in the twilight forest I found it early 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:03.000
 Yeah I guess I found it so fast that it was over in a lively way 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:08.430
 Well, I will find a diamond soon 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.650
 I hope I can find it soon, but I think there will be a partner country in the near future 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.189
 Previous 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:17.890
 The sea was a strange person and I could not do anything 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:19.010
 It is likely to be under magma's presence, it seems to be likely, there's also gravel that's going down 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.360
 Do you see 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.079
 No, it's better to jump into that water and find diamonds even faster than that 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.930
 Follow 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.650
 You should stop it because it is dangerous 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:33.760
 Diamond hunter's name is shook if it is making a loud noise at such a place 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:40.239
 No one reads because no one ah ah 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:43.910
 Oh my hm hm mother 蹄 蹄 蹄 言 っ 言 っ 言 っ 言 っ 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:48.260
 Had carried out also flows or as a back pack 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:52.010
 After all conceited diamond hunter serving as a thing Yeah Yeah it's taboo 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:56.180
 I can not say that I can not do anything with pride 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:59.030
 It's just that there 's no light, no lights, no food at all, it's so crispy 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:03.930
 I'll die again if I see you're right 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:08.670
 Well it seems so calm or so rice after a long time 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:13.650
 House Lau Potsu' spoke Te's go try Kana Upotsu Upo and even return to the 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:16.739
 It is supposed to be the great variation of the pom-pom Upotsu Ugh N possum Pokkiri 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:21.690
 It seems to be about 50 kinds already 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:23.920
 I hope that it will appear in around 100 or so someday from the beginning to the end of the video 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.820
 Filled with pop comments 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:32.380
 It's too late to comment on anything other than pop 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.520
 It's no good I don't know if I'm coming to watch the video anymore, I'm coming to Pachi comment 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.410
 It becomes 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.750
 I will definitely be the first comment in the video Please be the first comment next comment 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.910
 Is it going to be a Reimu? 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:49.130
 Scenery just is not I'll say good Do interior Thor 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:54.020
 It looks like the school's reputation is good, because it's a building that looks like a sleepy face. 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:55.100
 As I said earlier, if you get into the first time, you will not be anxious but you will become a village resident 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.460
 You 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:01.580
 It's perfect to be carried out smoothly until the matchmaker registration 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:07.100
 Don't force it if you make a mistake 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:13.880
 Then the next comment will go p Does the Lord write a plan or something when building? 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:15.120
 Knoop main that question seems mon your milk has come in I feel like you are making to the appropriate not think Toka blueprint 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.180
 Also built as a watch 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:22.260
 I think to become the photos and selfish feeling 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:25.560
 It is likely that it is not a system if it is a large country or something 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:32.460
 If so, you might think of it as a design drawing 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:35.110
 Well , basically, there is a design drawing in my head, so I can't help it. 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:38.830
 Yes 100 genealogy is in my head 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:42.820
 This is awfully next 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:48.940
 I am really sorry about Reimu of my house 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:50.230
 Speaking of which I used to eat too much in the prefecture and I felt so bad that I myself 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.230
 It's bad 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:55.100
 Since then it has become impossible to eat food 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:58.910
 A solo on the spot 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:01.440
 c Still you eat a lot of meat 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:07.440
 Your meat is just another belly 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:10.670
 I wonder if that sounds so then don't make a sound like a diamond hunt 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.670
 I'm sorry I can afford 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:24.270
 Somehow still What if just a zombie Do're in the back 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:30.139
 Well I'm likely to fall to something over there of magma, but I 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:30.139
 Oh it's still room if Well about two dogs that are also dangerous assistant's 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.740
 It is 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:48.210
 I don't accept the above idiom or the clouds , which is not good ci 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:49.080
 Eyes jump up and down after Oh will too evil feelings Toka thread exits from 8 this also there are mouth clouds and Kyle 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.889
 I guess 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.360
 I think it would be cool if it were clouds 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:07:00.699
 Meat is also another chasing Ninen Yeah 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:04.689
 It feels like it can be eaten without moving while being processed properly because there is no 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:08.979
 Once processed meat there to the other is a road would flower it completely 

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:15.039
 In that respect the apple is so great it doesn't move, it stands out because it's red, and it doesn't go any further 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:20.739
 I'm gonna squeeze Apples are clearly the best food in the world 

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:21.549
 Do not mod apples come overflowing as difficult-to-work water Do because it is hard to apples make 

00:07:20.739 --> 00:07:24.680
 The 

00:07:21.549 --> 00:07:29.900
 It is not more, but somehow it is mouse arithmetically with the tool of Doraemon 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:31.520
 Increasing the apples with it I do not know's it gonna there is to increase the things 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:35.090
 It is all you can eat 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:40.070
 It's a paradise if you're a meat addict 

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:44.670
 Oh, Reimu was slowly Arm Edison It was so so to speak 

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:46.790
 Then I will look for a diamond without saying something stupid to make 

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.790
 The
