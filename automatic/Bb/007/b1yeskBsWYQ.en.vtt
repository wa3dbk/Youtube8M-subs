let's<00:00:45.510> go<00:00:45.600> ahead<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.750> jot<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.079> down<00:00:46.399> we're

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
let's go ahead and jot that down we're

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.229 
let's go ahead and jot that down we're
running<00:00:47.550> with<00:00:47.879> 12<00:00:49.399> pick<00:00:50.399> up<00:00:50.520> radius<00:00:50.850> along

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
running with 12 pick up radius along

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.200 
running with 12 pick up radius along
with<00:00:51.270> about<00:00:51.809> 11,000<00:00:52.620> goes<00:00:52.739> fine<00:00:53.010> alright<00:00:53.969> so

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
with about 11,000 goes fine alright so

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.549 
with about 11,000 goes fine alright so
let's<00:00:54.390> go<00:00:54.510> ahead<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.660> show<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.020> run<00:00:55.170> so

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
let's go ahead and show you the run so

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.779 
let's go ahead and show you the run so
we're<00:00:55.770> going<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.010> import<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.430> festering

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
we're going to import it to festering

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.779 
we're going to import it to festering
woods<00:00:57.890> what<00:00:58.890> I'd<00:00:58.980> like<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.129> do<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.550> like<00:00:59.579> to

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
woods what I'd like to do is I like to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.250 
woods what I'd like to do is I like to
go<00:00:59.879> on<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> outer<00:01:00.210> edge<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.899> circle

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
go on the outer edge so I can circle

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.170 
go on the outer edge so I can circle
around<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.559> whole<00:01:01.710> map<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.579> go<00:01:02.969> right

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
around the whole map and just go right

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.570 
around the whole map and just go right
back<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> Waypoint<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.890> let's<00:01:05.339> find<00:01:05.489> that

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
back to the Waypoint so let's find that

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:18.560 
back to the Waypoint so let's find that
outer<00:01:05.760> edge

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:36.620 

you

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.240 

so<00:01:37.630> remain<00:01:37.840> focused<00:01:38.260> during<00:01:38.590> these<00:01:38.800> runs<00:01:39.010> to

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
so remain focused during these runs to

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.390 
so remain focused during these runs to
kill<00:01:39.400> whites<00:01:39.610> and<00:01:39.820> not<00:01:39.970> elites<00:01:40.270> or<00:01:40.600> goblins

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
kill whites and not elites or goblins

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.530 
kill whites and not elites or goblins
since<00:01:42.400> we're<00:01:42.580> just<00:01:42.760> trying<00:01:42.970> to<00:01:43.030> kill<00:01:43.240> as<00:01:43.360> much

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
since we're just trying to kill as much

00:01:43.540 --> 00:02:56.119 
since we're just trying to kill as much
any<00:01:43.720> as<00:01:44.080> we<00:01:44.200> can<00:01:44.380> to<00:01:44.500> PF<00:01:44.740> drop<00:01:44.920> some<00:01:45.130> code

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.559 

and<00:02:57.129> we'll<00:02:57.340> just<00:02:57.430> kind<00:02:57.519> of<00:02:57.700> path<00:02:57.970> our<00:02:58.209> way<00:02:58.299> back

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
and we'll just kind of path our way back

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:15.990 
and we'll just kind of path our way back
to<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:59.170> Waypoint<00:03:14.400> all<00:03:15.400> right<00:03:15.519> so<00:03:15.670> we<00:03:15.760> started

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
to the Waypoint all right so we started

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.059 
to the Waypoint all right so we started
a<00:03:16.060> Simon<00:03:16.480> engine<00:03:16.810> 45<00:03:17.170> million<00:03:17.620> now<00:03:17.829> we<00:03:17.889> have

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
a Simon engine 45 million now we have

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.520 
a Simon engine 45 million now we have
submerged<00:03:18.280> in<00:03:18.609> 57<00:03:19.239> million<00:03:19.389> I<00:03:19.750> took<00:03:19.989> about<00:03:20.290> two

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
submerged in 57 million I took about two

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.410 
submerged in 57 million I took about two
minutes<00:03:20.739> I<00:03:20.980> would<00:03:21.040> say<00:03:21.220> that's<00:03:21.879> casually

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
minutes I would say that's casually

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.089 
minutes I would say that's casually
running<00:03:22.750> assured<00:03:23.049> a<00:03:23.200> min<00:03:23.349> max<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.859> you<00:03:23.920> guys

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
running assured a min max that you guys

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:25.770 
running assured a min max that you guys
can<00:03:24.250> probably<00:03:24.549> be<00:03:24.879> a<00:03:24.909> lot<00:03:25.090> more<00:03:25.150> efficient

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
can probably be a lot more efficient

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.809 
can probably be a lot more efficient
there's<00:03:26.709> a<00:03:26.829> few<00:03:27.010> out<00:03:27.099> of<00:03:27.189> the<00:03:27.280> zones<00:03:27.519> you<00:03:27.670> can

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
there's a few out of the zones you can

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:29.670 
there's a few out of the zones you can
run<00:03:27.970> like<00:03:28.150> out<00:03:28.420> if<00:03:28.989> you<00:03:29.079> guys<00:03:29.170> get<00:03:29.349> bored<00:03:29.620> or

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
run like out if you guys get bored or

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.990 
run like out if you guys get bored or
just<00:03:29.889> running<00:03:30.159> one's<00:03:30.340> own<00:03:30.519> you<00:03:30.670> can<00:03:30.790> revise

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
just running one's own you can revise

can also run also agony to that has
really<00:03:34.930> nice<00:03:35.139> density<00:03:35.560> keep<00:03:36.430> tabs<00:03:36.700> three

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
really nice density keep tabs three

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.460 
really nice density keep tabs three
maybe<00:03:39.329> filter<00:03:40.329> misery<00:03:40.629> but<00:03:40.810> filter<00:03:41.139> misery

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
maybe filter misery but filter misery

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.500 
maybe filter misery but filter misery
kind<00:03:41.709> of<00:03:41.859> it's<00:03:42.400> kind<00:03:42.519> of<00:03:42.639> a<00:03:42.760> big<00:03:42.790> map<00:03:43.150> and

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
kind of it's kind of a big map and

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.210 
kind of it's kind of a big map and
sometimes<00:03:43.989> it's<00:03:44.199> dense<00:03:44.440> sometimes<00:03:44.650> it's<00:03:45.040> not

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
sometimes it's dense sometimes it's not

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.030 
sometimes it's dense sometimes it's not
so<00:03:45.870> yeah<00:03:46.870> anyways<00:03:47.230> that's<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.620> goal<00:03:47.829> flying
