and<00:00:55.589> then<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.100> anti<00:00:56.640> situation<00:00:57.179> they're<00:00:57.300> both

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
and then the anti situation they're both

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.360 
and then the anti situation they're both
kind<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.019> know<00:00:58.050> rivaling<00:00:58.739> each<00:00:58.890> other<00:00:59.100> and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370
