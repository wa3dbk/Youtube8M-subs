 neither my most are really cool 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.680

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.460

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.170
 so I'm going to film this part of 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.210
 trope dungeons on purpose to see which 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.710
 they will normally take up oussama 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.140

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.570

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.280
 or times according to the characters then 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.480
 I am waiting to see how many will take 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.950
 these famous people or to see I look forward to 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.540
 good damage anyway violate it 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.740
 should be advanced to -15% earth know 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.780
 not if he climbs to the end for a iop 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.700
 hundred to what 950 mah it does when 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.770
 even good damage so I'm waiting for 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.810
 see with haste 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.780
 how much will they take on this famous 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.479
 dungeon and then that's so yes I'm 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.990
 entered the hesse and finally at the beginning 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.430
 as I dedicate I was not super super 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.590
 fans of playing with people who 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.110
 insult me and no it turns out that 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.979
 final most are very friendly 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.270
 good after that mouth is like 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.619
 any alliance you are on 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.110
 the brain you do not have to be film 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.759
 but it does not prevent that here I am not 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.689
 too disappointed either it's cool and I 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.399
 think it'll allow me to film 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.590
 some videos without fear and I know that 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.729
 howie my god i know you're kiffez 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.079
 the videos on the heroic server 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.820
 whatever they are in general you 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.890
 to adore that and I tell myself that it can be 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.439
 really cool to do that to you then 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.700
 for this new zapping I start so 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.840
 not an ostrich feat I can not wait to 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.220
 see that I hope I will not be too 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.070
 disappointed 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.400
 and then it might be funny so you 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:09.130
 we read team it's not going to feel like 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.130
 I find important to the rifle I believe 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.729
 I'll take one 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.299
 it seems that this cork and rebound 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.409
 for a team 199 to whatever he does to 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.060
 eight to eight it looks like it's 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.099
 complicated to these best I believe it 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.159
 told me bastos india is a friend finally 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.209
 best but alex that knew batman who 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.680
 told me that 12 days thing eight 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.939
 were relatively boring-so 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.959
 so in the end it's not bad good 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.519
 after that it's not an act of 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.870
 sick it's not that's all the same 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.290
 not a crazy double angle that it's 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.659
 not the account 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.750
 and still the account of the look of tutorials 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.700
 and it looks super easy but it 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.409
 Nevertheless, for the moment, that's it 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.019
 the good guys he'll finish it 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.340
 but if the municipality loses a country can not 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.620
 to finish it it will end this round with 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.810
 the tram how many February 10 take they 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.810
 did the anchorite challenge 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.200
 finally I'm a little disappointed for 53 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.490
 million xp is not bad but I 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.290
 was expecting a much better 10 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.880
 stars I was expecting better I 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:13.220
 was expecting me better here is a video to 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:16.900
 all these parties for the ptt we go rock 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.900
 as he asks and we will film it 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.230
 so that same chip and or to go to 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.800
 level of the front 29 she's there the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.800
 queen she is right 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.540
 in the present crisis 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.890
 so people I tell you everything from 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.000
 next says not too much bullshit either 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.629
 I finally film to see if you want 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.629
 look ridiculous 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.269
 a bit of a culture 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.319
 that's how people are from 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.560
 money that's how people get 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:23.560
 make money 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:05:17.080
 it is alexis with him this hymn 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:17.080
 ideal persimmon on mumbai to clean 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.840
 on the left I lost 4 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:43.389
 I did a little bit but I preferred 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:43.389
 she wanted to wear 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:58.700
 yet another where is it beauty 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.380
 harm to people 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.060
 it's going to be someone indeed indeed 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.620
 Persimmon Thursday warn him two people 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.620
 if someone has only three small months 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.409
 go again the baths and that is to 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:17.409
 right 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:25.240
 you guys have never been in 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:29.250
 course or what's up again and the qashqai 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.250
 still uncompleted at the weather 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:39.590
 my guitar 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.590
 I did not say which rise is not cowardly 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:56.330
 so the house invaded the old thing but 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.330
 that it's a bit nil actually
