00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:05.110
 Pendleton canvases and colors all in different sizes and colors 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.470
 Executions are used by study participants Karin 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.510
 breathe life into their chosen and that's exactly what the others do 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.750
 Participants in the first four weeks of study learn the lines 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:21.989
 and dashes when drawing let Aar and are tall and now own the 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.710
 Students the necessary knowledge about techniques and tools like brushes 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.149
 Pens and colors that is also the prerequisite for creative editing 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:34.560
 What may be the exact goal of these studies phase is the trend intact mom 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.360
 Fromm explains 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.110
 work independently and one 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.010
 really 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.930
 own 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.290
 the individual is going to develop it 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.140
 that's the main concern and here's no-meeting no 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.090
 is this really really targeted more and more driven in the direction 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.330
 her colleague and Clemens also explains the individual discussions on which 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.269
 Students have to pay attention to a painterly implementation of their ideas 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.970
 small tips then help the artists to put their finishing touches to their pictures 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:09.309
 miss and may appreciate her very special 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.720
 Finally I can do something 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.940
 as before because one is arrested in traditional 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.400
 and whoever just does not get on and whose functions were on stretchers 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.610
 Percent that were directed Elektro 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.730
 what it is this intensive course has brought me a lot 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.840
 just what I really wanted from scratch to play something that yourself 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.330
 there was nothing left of it at all 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.670
 and from this failure I may then have the strength and the firm 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.980
 Imtech ICT on 9 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.860
 to assume I had a wonderful feeling I put you down 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.470
 in essentials not for many stories 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.470
 the academy has to see quality 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.030
 and the individual ideas also reflect this quality 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.120
 When participants combine many things with their art 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.830
 personal reality 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.520
 Nature's flowers and bodies are just a few examples that are really much 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.329
 Provide inspiration 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.329
 Proof of this are the theses of the artists 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.650
 the results of the study course drawing painting and also those of the new one 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.319
 Welschingen binders Kohl will have been able to be held Thursday from 6pm to 7pm 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.949
 set up at the studios of the European Academy of Arts
