 today we have new ones with us for each model that aims to position itself 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.720
 as a reference in terms of sportsmanship between the model segment 

00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:18.679
 citizens 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:21.289
 It has developed in parallel to the Ford Fiesta 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.669
 and has many of its characteristics of somewhat larger eto'o cedems 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:27.929
 the sporting impact very 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.390
 and employs between our country will employ two engines at the time of its 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.480
 launching 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.480
 1 point 3 75 horsepower diesel 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.060
 and 1 gasoline point of 69 horses 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.890
 all below 120 grams per kilometer in terms of missions from 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.890
 2000 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.260
 despite being a small and agile car designed for the city on the road 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.770
 they have a behavior 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.610
 pretty good is very plumb 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.370
 and is backed by a 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.810
 noticas stability control 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.690
 from which we can disconnect the traction control only 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.500
 in terms of safety equipment you can also take 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.670
 It has front airbags as standard 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.990
 which can be optionally complemented with side airbags and 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.990
 curtain 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.930
 all the controls of the console is very at hand 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.600
 same as the gear lever 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.070
 high exposure for help 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.409
 to improve the driving position and also to not touch with the 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.650
 companion every time we change March 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.659
 there is little he can do 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.970
 in a job that at the height of the elbows 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.970
 a help to matsa find us wider 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.980
 another differentiating element of the glass panoramic roof holder 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.710
 for which the board quite bright and brings sensation to your 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.000
 previous 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.440
 princ 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.960
 the hind legs there is a lot of restraint for two people that is what it is for 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.980
 passed the car 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.570
 however, the height of the ceiling does not extinguish more than it will no longer be 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.480
 will get 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.480
 three people of high-bonded size when bad taste 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.430
 the panoramic roof is enjoyed by signatures of two front legs 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.719
 the feeling of space 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.689
 this form the windows 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.689
 it was a bit limited 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:21.290
 the rear passengers also have

 na invoked for pont to leave june objects 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:26.469
 frizzy for example 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:28.959
 bundle bags in the front seats 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.930
 They also have enough leg room and a lot of height from under the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.049
 seat to put the feet
