00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.490
 chronic fiscal imbalances the 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.020
 large wage differences and the 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.330
 environmental problems constitute a 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.279
 dangerous mix for the welfare of 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.110
 the five continents so revealed the 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:17.080
 global economic forum at its most 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.570
 recent report on global risks 2013 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.210
 jon risk from the consultancy wiman group 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.609
 assured on the afternoon of ntn24 that the 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.160
 combination of these factors have created 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.779
 the so-called perfect storm that 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.900
 undermines economic development and 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.800
 social in the world hunger unemployment 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.750
 inequality economic crisis drought 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.520
 hurricanes and pandemics are just some 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.500
 of the elements that constitute 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.780
 the great threat to the world in this 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.280
 This is how the last 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.970
 report of the world economic forum 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.590
 called global risks 2013 likewise 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.350
 the survey conducted over a thousand 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.610
 experts and industrial leaders 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.410
 shows that the serious differences in 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.930
 income and fiscal imbalances 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.910
 Chronic are the two biggest risks 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.620
 existing at a global level what 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.720
 reflects the current concern about 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.969
 sovereign debt and some prospects 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.800
 slightly more pessimistic in general 

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:10.600
 for the next 10 years 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.420
 I think we can have the right 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.710
 to say that the great flow of attention 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.080
 who have all these crises now 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.810
 economic is merely logical or 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.460
 something at least predictable however 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.230
 there are other issues that of course 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.120
 They should be allowed to take off and that 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.670
 course they deserve also attention 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.979
 appropriate 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.750
 for john drzik from the consulting firm white 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.820
 man group one of the organizations 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.070
 responsible for preparing this report the 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.020
 sum of economic difficulties such as 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.240
 environmental has created the call 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.090
 perfect storm that will affect 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.770
 million people matters 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.350
 climatological are going to have an increasingly 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.630
 higher weight in the economy is going to be a 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.509
 factor that will increasingly have a 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.580
 determining weight for handling or for 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.630
 that finally the governments do not achieve 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.060
 handle this type of situations 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.860
 then I do consider that of a u 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.020
 another way we can already have humans 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.670
 in some sense these elements of a 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.130
 'perfect storm' if it's completely 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.500
 possible although the imbalances 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.929
 economic and environmental 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.790
 pessimism for this year the authors of the 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.860
 report claim that it is not too late 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.080
 to change course but not 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.200
 allocate the necessary resources to 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.060
 mitigate the increasing risk of phenomena 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.080
 extreme weather prosperity 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.940
 world of future generations 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.940
 could be affected
