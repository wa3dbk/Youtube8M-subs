bigger<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.600> two<00:00:57.780> scene<00:00:57.989> because<00:00:58.260> you're

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
bigger on the two scene because you're

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.799 
bigger on the two scene because you're
covering<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.770> much<00:00:58.920> smaller<00:00:59.809> material

thickness give it any bullnose on a 2 cm
this<00:01:05.909> edge<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.360> actually<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.930> make<00:01:07.020> your

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
this edge is actually going to make your

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.679 
this edge is actually going to make your
stone<00:01:07.560> appear<00:01:08.460> thicker<00:01:08.820> than<00:01:09.180> what<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.479> is

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
stone appear thicker than what it is

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.390 
stone appear thicker than what it is
because<00:01:09.960> you're<00:01:10.260> relieved<00:01:10.619> you're<00:01:11.159> doing

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
because you're relieved you're doing

away with this up this top corner and
your<00:01:13.860> eyes<00:01:13.979> kind<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.400> skip<00:01:14.760> over<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.659> give

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
your eyes kind of skip over it and give

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.800 
your eyes kind of skip over it and give
it<00:01:16.439> gives<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> illusion<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.280> thickness

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
it gives the illusion of thickness

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.109 
it gives the illusion of thickness

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
kind of clean straight lines and this

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.390 
kind of clean straight lines and this
same<00:01:32.820> thing<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> 2<00:01:33.540> cm<00:01:36.560> this<00:01:37.560> is<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.189> only

we<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.939> we<00:01:42.090> consider<00:01:42.479> an<00:01:42.630> upgrade<00:01:43.140> with

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
we have that we consider an upgrade with

edge detail and this requires hand
sanding<00:01:52.700> typically<00:01:53.700> people<00:01:53.970> will<00:01:54.090> use<00:01:54.240> this

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
sanding typically people will use this

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.359 
sanding typically people will use this
around<00:01:54.659> islands<00:01:55.320> or<00:01:55.439> somewhere<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.860> emphasize

around islands or somewhere to emphasize
we<00:01:56.939> give<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.210> little<00:01:57.240> bit<00:01:57.420> more<00:01:57.570> dressier

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
we give it a little bit more dressier

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.069 
we give it a little bit more dressier
appearance<00:02:00.829> this<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:02.280> an<00:02:02.909> example<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.899> would

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
appearance this is an example this would

also be an upgrade FG tail this is an
example<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.409> laminated<00:02:08.369> edge<00:02:08.520> detail<00:02:08.970> and

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
example of a laminated edge detail and

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.089 
example of a laminated edge detail and
this<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.810> where<00:02:10.020> we<00:02:10.140> actually<00:02:10.500> take<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.709> strip

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
this is where we actually take a strip

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.150 
this is where we actually take a strip
of<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.370> same<00:02:11.610> material<00:02:12.209> adhere<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.500> then

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
of the same material adhere it and then

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.880 
of the same material adhere it and then
finish<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.520> out<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.060> looks<00:02:15.090> like<00:02:15.330> one<00:02:15.890> thick

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
finish it out so it looks like one thick

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.550 
finish it out so it looks like one thick
edge<00:02:18.650> this<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:20.150> 4cm<00:02:21.200> laminated<00:02:22.200> bullnose
