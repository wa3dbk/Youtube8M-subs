00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.299
 hi all guys you rude me 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.910
 keep shooting video from test 08 11 but 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.509
 for some it will only be possible 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.480
 one video that they will see right now 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:20.130
 I'm on face 155 as you may have noticed 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:23.820
 it changed a lot now i 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.160
 I'll tell you how the first alpha became 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.400
 less angle act less pierce and this 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.109
 the most basic engine taken stalma 200 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.540
 less horses now the engine is just 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.540
 thousands of horsepower dynamics significantly 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.270
 I've changed now I'm going and being surprised honestly 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.640
 to say I'm very pt no 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.670
 never loved much and did not play them 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.090
 Well there really is 8 level there Joshua 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.570
 101 such yes but higher as I did not look 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.899
 especially 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.059
 well, except that the 704's well, but the patch 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.399
 always loved on every test bought it 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.660
 and played it on it bent by the way for 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.780
 those who do not know the right lover 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.809
 tales 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.740
 I know what to say correctly flash but 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.150
 I like to say watch like this 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.700
 always loved him and now i'm on my way 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.110
 it feels like Iâ€™m on a square -1 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.380
 this speed only to 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.420
 turns faster than apt-1 or on 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.729
 kvass even kvass pancake is more dynamic like that 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.830
 very sad honestly very sad 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.900
 how we started driving very slowly 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.509
 still here booking by the way 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.829
 have changed 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:34.110
 here now a little different scheme 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.150
 booking a little less abut 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.869
 the roof and these 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:44.520
 stereo handles here and commander 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.729
 turret with a machine gun in them no longer 180 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.640
 millimeters as it was before 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.100
 150 millimeters which is sad as for me 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.689
 yes it will now be very noticeable 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.759
 it was possible to have an effect there 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.469
 to wind up the gunhole to wind up somehow there 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.200
 Well, at least a little but then ask 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.390
 that she did not punch the board and pens under 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.310
 some kind of protection now even dovorot 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.409
 no pens would even help 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.209
 Hami to nine levels to break even 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.380
 eight 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.590
 it's sad of course 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.980
 Well, to say the least though killed 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:21.120
 there could have been 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.620
 and worse but still it is very very 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.720
 significant nerve anyway very 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.580
 sad here compared to 206 from 8 mm 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.790
 which should have been harder to ponder 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.010
 patch very ponerfili 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:37.170
 that's serious because 268 is not less 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.970
 imbalanced than in the patch are not okay are not 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.110
 worth the frustration so much though i 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.510
 I'm very upset here who agrees with 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.820
 so what do you want become sad put 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.030
 likes guys i think many are with me 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:53.820
 agree many are upset with how 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.840
 changed want maybe still 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.360
 perry balance cleansing is not so 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.270
 sad can do more to the next 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.950
 dough to the second to the third there all 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:13.200
 won't be so bad okay so wik 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:15.150
 he makes his way to me too sews by the way well I 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.890
 I wanted to be able to take it 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.210
 dead tackle of the day it would be alpha the same 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:23.160
 as earlier hours he would have been killed so 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.250
 on me where he punched well understandable 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:32.210
 The case involves 2 times and has not struck two in the forehead 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.210
 times well ok not critical 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:39.130
 Yes, but now will not be so take out 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:42.410
 you want but I sympathize with the truth to all 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.530
 I own this machine very much 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.390
 sorry for everyone who loved though because 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.610
 even i'm sad because we don't have it 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.360
 those who skated on it for a thousand battles and 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.650
 more so she is very upset though 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:03.520
 for a long time it could not go on that 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:09.970
 do you want to bend it so with impunity yet 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.970
 type byte flash drive where went hit the mask 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:18.500
 Other want to try to break it even 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:22.400
 in to the points broke 600 well yes so 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.210
 damage all sadly often say with 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.550
 such info 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:31.840
 Well , then you can bend but now he 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.600
 more skill dependent became ie 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.030
 excuse me please guys i don't 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.260
 I can cut unfortunately they called me 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.990
 here I will not answer for now though 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.960
 I had to play the baida forgot to put 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:52.460
 silent I hope you are not deaf because 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.830
 that even I am deaf there is a microphone somehow 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.690
 fermenting the volume of the call to me well in 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.920
 principle already the battle is over the conclusion is 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.060
 my personal fudge 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.020
 not really changed by gameplay 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.150
 specifically on the gameplay 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.040
 he is about the same as you were before 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.780
 left shot drum left them 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.480
 the rest of the drum left that is all as 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.340
 and it was, yes, now you're so fast 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:19.640
 you will be the key position takes to a 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:25.280
 so all the same well, that's exactly how 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:28.610
 pt by tth noticeably changed 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.790
 he even got up so noticeable 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.980
 sad very sad to type clouds 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.710
 20 maybe even some will be served 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.620
 now face guys here maybe it's even 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.450
 right decision like this if you find out 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.190
