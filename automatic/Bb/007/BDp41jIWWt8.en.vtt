and<00:00:27.449> years<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.960> moving<00:00:28.920> turtles<00:00:29.369> we<00:00:29.580> finally

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
and years of moving turtles we finally

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.749 
and years of moving turtles we finally
discovered<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.170> banana<00:00:31.560> box<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:32.399> just

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
discovered the banana box and it's just

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.200 
discovered the banana box and it's just
a<00:00:32.880> great<00:00:33.530> very<00:00:34.530> well-constructed<00:00:35.190> it's<00:00:35.969> heavy

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
a great very well-constructed it's heavy

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.440 
a great very well-constructed it's heavy
duty<00:00:36.719> it's<00:00:37.070> rectangular<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.969> holds<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.420> lot

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
duty it's rectangular and it holds a lot

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.020 
duty it's rectangular and it holds a lot
of<00:00:39.750> weight<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.649> we<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:40.980> put<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.160> Terrapin<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.850> it

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
of weight so we can put a Terrapin in it

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.450 
of weight so we can put a Terrapin in it
and<00:00:42.239> then<00:00:42.360> stack<00:00:42.780> them<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.950> just<00:00:44.129> seems<00:00:44.309> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
and then stack them and it just seems to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.020 
and then stack them and it just seems to
do<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:45.120> really<00:00:45.510> really<00:00:45.660> well<00:00:46.430> maybe<00:00:47.430> five<00:00:47.730> more
