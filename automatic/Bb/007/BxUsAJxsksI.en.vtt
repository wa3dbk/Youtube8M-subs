00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.210
 Hello friends, big package 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.469
 today on my desk she even they 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.450
 placed in frame 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.380
 now i will print it see what 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.840
 is inside so inside such 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.189
 box by rc plane 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.900
 brand in lps 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:31.439
 and model kf 929 let's see what 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.399
 technique inside so here it is 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.630
 the kit I see separately lies the highway 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.870
 instruction in English 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.420
 the aircraft itself is completely made 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.050
 from the foam bent and tail him 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.570
 part 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.789
 she is very thin I even see the cracks so 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.280
 there are plane from here such 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.289
 miniature lithium batteries 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.949
 capacity and not indicated here 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.260
 I think it's about 180 milliamps an hour and 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.420
 charging the battery using such 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.880
 standard charger bottom 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.369
 Altai is a standard pro Sheba 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.030
 a tour that requires as many as 6 batteries 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.150
 We look at our plane 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.710
 how it looks very light literally 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.310
 probably 100 grams it weighs now 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.280
 I will try to put it on the scales and even 100 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.430
 gram is not here and I think you can see 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.010
 flight weight with battery 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:32.130
 just thirty nine grams it's just 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.770
 something unreal 39 grams took toys 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.680
 managed to stick a collector motor chick 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.440
 lithium battery a pair of surf using 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.729
 which is managed 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.259
 by the plane with it seems here 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.330
 all null elements are involved 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.470
 I connect the power or more precisely at first 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.470
 we set the highway 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.920
 now connect a zealous battery so 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.979
 where should we have here 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.819
 set a little incomprehensible here 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.440
 space is available but some 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.530
 caps that would hold him 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.290
 see now everything is clear here in our 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.599
 the kit comes with two sticky little you 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.440
 lie and not enough and every one of them need 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.269
 will stick 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.190
 battery and then it will be possible 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.819
 battery mount on it Velcro 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.040
 which already glued the plant well 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:41.880
 the power I turned on now the key on 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:45.190
 hardware and try to move the stick 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.580
 so look at the back of the turn 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.580
 kline 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:19.180
 somehow the delay is managed 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:27.460
 back screw so this adequately 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:31.960
 Works however with this sergo and worse 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:34.420
 some problems on the other hand can 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.830
 be it should work like everything 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.090
 as probably developed just a service 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.730
 stand thin 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.160
 and there was a lot of friction through 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.870
 foam now everything seems to be already 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.040
 ok look at the device urs 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.220
 then the left of the country will judge us 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:58.810
 double costs as you see the code 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:05.380
 becomes noticeably larger compared to 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:09.700
 single and right side nothing 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:13.300
 this is not a button here we have standard 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.290
 examples and basically all none here 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.750
 additional buttons 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:22.840
 absolutely nothing I will try to twist 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:24.910
 little motor sound is exactly the same 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:32.140
 as rent various micro 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:35.560
 quadcopters like articles will say pretty 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:39.990
 decently when such a light model without 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.990
 problems seek to drive off the table 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:49.970
 maximum speed 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:53.180
 very good and such a small plane 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.130
 but today I got to be honest I don’t know 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.680
 how will he fly or but I am very 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.380
 it will be interesting to check the proper 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.470
 than he interested me it is pretty 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.780
 the lowest price is around $ 60 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.060
 vrt included complete set 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.730
 with two batteries and instrumentation 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.830
 controls are also low flight weight and 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.310
 small size also did not like 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.080
 so that complete control is done here 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.240
 some models some elements 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.280
 control wing and just won’t 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.440
 speak as they are called since i don't 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.320
 remember the terminology that is used 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:30.980
 in aircraft construction but at least 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:34.040
 here I see that control is complete with 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.920
 by turning left right the eraser 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.720
 you need to turn the elements of Christ 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.290
 control ie using this 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.820
 the plane will turn around with 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.010
 using the movement 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:49.010
 pro eraser can be fully 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.110
 lean mallet in all directions not 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.760
 I know if the collector motor can 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:58.220
 1 jar battery with a capacity of 150 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:00.950
 185 an hour if he can keep this 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.720
 model upright position that is 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.450
 will it be enough power 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.310
 aircraft to fly up vertically all 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.260
 we will check it in tests all thanks for 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.570
 he's not really a genius channel for fast 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.770
 it was unpacking and overview 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:18.410
 product and we model vlt aircraft with ef 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:20.300
 929 shop tinydeal purchase link I 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.860
 I will mention in the description all thanks for 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.860
 attention put likes and to new meetings
