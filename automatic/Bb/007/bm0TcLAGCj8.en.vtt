00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.430
 welcome to my video and 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.880
 Today I want to show you how you get one 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.290
 keeper mixed kipa the name stands for 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.519
 cherry banana 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.920
 As you can see I already have here 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.250
 delicious cherry juice and delicious 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.609
 banana juice worried and yes that should 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.439
 shake well before and that 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.240
 I have already done so 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.470
 because you have to blow a few so you have 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.019
 maybe wait a minute until you see them 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.170
 then they're gone and maybe 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:34.020
 a bit too much okay now 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.910
 I with the description so and as 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.480
 First, this is important you are taking here 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.950
 this delicious banana juice and fills 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.430
 The glass with about three thirds 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:54.110
 that makes it short, there it is 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:57.120
 no matter how it shakes one's mind about 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:02.070
 and then, of course, the next one follows 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.290
 juice of the delicious cherry juice so and now 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.890
 it is important that we as possible on 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.650
 edge of the glass that shakes one so that 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.170
 the spread nicely on the edge and then 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.909
 also makes beautiful colors in the middle 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.920
 So that's supposed to be nice after all 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.869
 appearance 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.869
 and if you do that right I hope 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.530
 I'm gonna sit there then 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.530
 look like that 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.880
 I can already see that right here and there 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.050
 nice coloring 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.900
 So I think it's done really well 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.390
 and yes I can tell you that from now on 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.890
 Top of the page to show that you see 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.520
 how beautiful that looks that makes it 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.130
 What do I find so here you see 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.690
 I poured it here that is 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.000
 run beautifully on the edge down 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.490
 I can turn it further 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.710
 Of course it will be a little bit more now 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.900
 I have to be careful about that 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.420
 you can see better down here 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.270
 blobbing on top is nice too 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.250
 discolored so I think that's alright 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.220
 what's always on the edge here for example 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.610
 also below you see it again like that 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.680
 a nice red blob and yes it 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.790
 finished the whole already a bit can 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.360
 show it from the top again 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.890
 it has already changed color 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.959
 because I shot the glass 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.000
 of course, then the whole color changes 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.800
 always easy there would have to be a bit 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.110
 take care that if possible at the place 1 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.180
 protect where you have it 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.739
 but I wanted to find it always looks 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.510
 still nice here on the 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.950
 side of this contrast between 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.540
 banana juice and cherry juice and yes me 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.590
 I recommend you this once 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.360
 Try and java friends and stuff 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.850
 you can also shoot far below 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.769
 make alcohol pure if you want that 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.930
 then maybe it tastes better as well 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.470
 I always think so best because of it 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.090
 then just chilly and yes me 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.220
 I hope I liked the video and 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.220
 Have fun mixing bye
