demo<00:00:05.279> we<00:00:05.460> have<00:00:05.580> just<00:00:05.790> crafted<00:00:06.150> for<00:00:06.299> the<00:00:06.420> CES<00:00:06.810> so

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
demo we have just crafted for the CES so

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.930 
demo we have just crafted for the CES so
basically<00:00:07.890> you<00:00:08.010> know<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.250> drone<00:00:08.460> has<00:00:08.610> all

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
basically you know the drone has all

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.299 
basically you know the drone has all
kind<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.360> sensors<00:00:09.780> embedded<00:00:09.990> in<00:00:10.290> it<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.650> one

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
kind of sensors embedded in it and one

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.669 
kind of sensors embedded in it and one
of<00:00:11.340> them<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.880> vertical<00:00:12.660> camera<00:00:13.170> so

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
of them is a vertical camera so

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.169 
of them is a vertical camera so
basically<00:00:13.980> with<00:00:14.280> this<00:00:14.490> soil<00:00:14.730> with<00:00:15.030> this

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
basically with this soil with this

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.420 
basically with this soil with this
carpet<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:16.109> drones<00:00:16.350> are<00:00:16.529> watching<00:00:16.890> down<00:00:17.130> and

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
carpet the drones are watching down and

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.010 
carpet the drones are watching down and
seeing<00:00:17.940> all<00:00:18.150> those<00:00:18.330> times<00:00:18.600> with<00:00:18.869> different

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
seeing all those times with different

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.200 
seeing all those times with different
patterns<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.740> getting<00:00:20.250> under<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.460> size<00:00:21.000> of

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
patterns and getting under the size of

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.990 
patterns and getting under the size of
it<00:00:21.529> there<00:00:22.529> are<00:00:22.560> actually<00:00:23.100> no<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.460> space<00:00:23.760> where

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
it there are actually no in space where

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.810 
it there are actually no in space where
they<00:00:24.210> are<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.960> three<00:00:25.140> dimensions<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:26.220> if<00:00:26.519> I

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
they are in the three dimensions so if I

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.650 
they are in the three dimensions so if I
bought<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.720> 17<00:00:28.320> AR<00:00:29.160> drones<00:00:29.519> could<00:00:29.849> I<00:00:29.910> figure

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
bought like 17 AR drones could I figure

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.820 
bought like 17 AR drones could I figure
it<00:00:30.779> out<00:00:30.900> could<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.140> do<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.439> or<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.740> this

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
it out could I do it or is this

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.049 
it out could I do it or is this
something<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.430> guys<00:00:32.579> can<00:00:32.790> do<00:00:32.880> because

as a starter you can go outside and

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.670 
as a starter you can go outside and
we're<00:00:38.160> already<00:00:38.670> running<00:00:39.059> one<00:00:39.450> very<00:00:40.350> similar

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680

I didn't see any video like this I'm
here<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.360> we're<00:01:42.649> not<00:01:43.649> actually<00:01:43.829> i<00:01:44.070> think<00:01:44.130> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
here but we're not actually i think the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.490 
here but we're not actually i think the
files<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.180> first<00:01:45.390> five<00:01:45.570> days<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:46.020> just<00:01:46.049> for

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
files the first five days it just for

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.730 
files the first five days it just for
fun<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.700> turns<00:01:47.939> out<00:01:48.290> videos<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> big

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
fun and it turns out videos is a big

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.280 
fun and it turns out videos is a big
interest<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.670> one<00:01:51.509> other<00:01:51.600> thing<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.049> we

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
interest so one other thing is that we

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.069 
interest so one other thing is that we
want<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.740> give<00:01:53.100> video<00:01:53.579> people<00:01:53.820> more<00:01:54.659> tools<00:01:54.930> to

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
want to give video people more tools to

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.200 
want to give video people more tools to
actually<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.649> serious<00:01:56.070> videos<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:57.030> blue

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
actually do serious videos to blue

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.120 
actually do serious videos to blue
traveling<00:01:57.750> moves<00:01:57.960> for<00:01:58.229> example<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:59.009> do

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
traveling moves for example to do

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.770 
traveling moves for example to do
post-processing<00:01:59.729> to<00:01:59.939> stabilize<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.420> moves

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
post-processing to stabilize the moves

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.810 
post-processing to stabilize the moves
they<00:02:00.930> are<00:02:01.110> doing<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.040> do<00:02:02.130> serious<00:02:02.340> video

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
they are doing so to do serious video

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.469 
they are doing so to do serious video
but<00:02:03.600> also<00:02:03.719> we<00:02:03.930> want<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.200> extend<00:02:04.469> with<00:02:04.890> others

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
but also we want to extend with others

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.880 
but also we want to extend with others
type<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.659> users<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.049> that's<00:02:07.320> why<00:02:07.439> we<00:02:07.680> have

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
type of users and that's why we have

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.420 
type of users and that's why we have
built<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.550> gps<00:02:09.030> actually<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.720> too<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.619> it's

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
built the gps actually is too it's it's

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.100 
built the gps actually is too it's it's
a<00:02:11.580> tool<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.819> for<00:02:12.180> developers<00:02:12.780> would<00:02:12.959> be

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
a tool that for developers would be

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.610 
a tool that for developers would be
great<00:02:13.349> too

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
great too

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.619 
great too
create<00:02:13.769> new<00:02:13.830> applications<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:15.239> why<00:02:15.390> don't

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
create new applications so why don't

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.449 
create new applications so why don't
these<00:02:15.810> have<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.349> little<00:02:16.530> because<00:02:17.159> we<00:02:17.280> have

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
these have the little because we have

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.250 
these have the little because we have
one<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:17.849> our<00:02:17.940> room<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.510> has<00:02:18.659> a<00:02:18.690> little<00:02:19.080> like

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
one in our room and it has a little like

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.729 
one in our room and it has a little like
eight<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.830> know<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:20.390> big<00:02:21.390> rubber<00:02:22.019> thing<00:02:22.409> on<00:02:22.590> it

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
eight you know a big rubber thing on it

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.740 
eight you know a big rubber thing on it
or<00:02:22.830> whatever<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.340> why<00:02:23.940> don't<00:02:24.360> yours<00:02:24.540> have

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
or whatever this is why don't yours have

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.720 
or whatever this is why don't yours have
that<00:02:24.930> actually<00:02:25.500> both<00:02:25.860> coming<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.310> sandbox

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
that actually both coming the sandbox

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.789 
that actually both coming the sandbox
and<00:02:26.849> you<00:02:26.970> can<00:02:27.120> just<00:02:27.360> remove<00:02:27.690> one<00:02:27.959> just<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.620> put

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
and you can just remove one just to put

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.089 
and you can just remove one just to put
another<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.450> this<00:02:30.450> one<00:02:30.690> is<00:02:30.840> more<00:02:31.440> men<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:31.920> be

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
another and this one is more men to be

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.580 
another and this one is more men to be
outside<00:02:32.489> this<00:02:33.209> way<00:02:33.390> it's<00:02:33.659> lighter<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.440> has

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
outside this way it's lighter and it has

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.130 
outside this way it's lighter and it has
less<00:02:34.860> wind<00:02:35.430> resistance<00:02:35.629> so<00:02:36.629> the<00:02:36.750> first<00:02:36.959> one<00:02:37.079> I

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
less wind resistance so the first one I

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.080 
less wind resistance so the first one I
would<00:02:37.319> say<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.739> more<00:02:37.950> for<00:02:38.159> indoor<00:02:38.549> when<00:02:38.970> you're

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
would say is more for indoor when you're

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.430 
would say is more for indoor when you're
a<00:02:39.120> beginner<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:39.629> you<00:02:39.780> don't<00:02:39.989> want<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.200> eat

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
a beginner and you don't want to eat

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.050 
a beginner and you don't want to eat
your<00:02:40.620> plasma<00:02:41.129> screen<00:02:41.340> or<00:02:41.459> something<00:02:41.790> indoor

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
your plasma screen or something indoor

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.119 
your plasma screen or something indoor
you<00:02:42.750> would<00:02:42.870> prefer<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.560> use<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.829> other<00:02:43.860> one

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
you would prefer to use the other one

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.000 
you would prefer to use the other one
that<00:02:44.370> protects<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:45.079> propellers<00:02:46.079> for<00:02:46.739> meeting

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
that protects the propellers for meeting

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.860 
that protects the propellers for meeting
anything<00:02:47.370> can<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:47.940> make<00:02:48.150> this<00:02:48.299> one<00:02:48.480> fly<00:02:48.660> right

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
anything can you make this one fly right

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.800 
anything can you make this one fly right
now<00:02:49.430> not<00:02:50.430> right<00:02:50.670> now<00:02:50.700> because<00:02:51.329> I<00:02:51.359> wouldn't

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
now not right now because I wouldn't

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.449 
now not right now because I wouldn't
interfere<00:02:52.200> with<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.709> there<00:02:53.099> is<00:02:53.190> too

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
interfere with that and there is too

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.250 
interfere with that and there is too
many<00:02:53.579> Wi-Fi<00:02:54.120> running<00:02:54.480> around<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.019> you<00:02:55.140> know

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
many Wi-Fi running around and you know

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.050 
many Wi-Fi running around and you know
you<00:02:55.319> connect<00:02:55.650> with<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.829> Wi-Fi<00:02:56.280> but<00:02:56.730> if<00:02:56.819> you<00:02:56.940> go

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
you connect with the Wi-Fi but if you go

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.819 
you connect with the Wi-Fi but if you go
outside<00:02:57.269> maybe<00:02:57.690> later<00:02:57.989> we<00:02:58.260> can<00:02:58.379> have<00:02:58.680> one

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
outside maybe later we can have one

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.289 
outside maybe later we can have one
running<00:02:59.159> for<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.400> yeah<00:02:59.879> well<00:03:00.060> I'm<00:03:00.180> gonna

running for you yeah well I'm gonna
count<00:03:00.569> on<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:02.090> maybe<00:03:03.090> not<00:03:03.390> maybe<00:03:03.620> absolutely

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
count on it maybe not maybe absolutely

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.890 
count on it maybe not maybe absolutely
