 I've been abroad for a while 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.529
 could be a child during the day 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.269
 but no pinging 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.550

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.960
 if it's not all 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.170
 if it succeeds, it can move 3 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.360
 it is gaining everywhere as a privilege 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.579
 9 and you can find a lot of money yes if the sale is the least 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.040
 but i'm sure it's gonna be okay the night robert enke not really 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.920
 The money that I submitted to him is for going through channels without it 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.900
 mate land you do a fantastic job always dealing with a spelling mistake.i honey 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.750
 to borrow 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.750
 I know and it will not happen again may need to think better 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.819
 if you can't take me alone then i can have a couple or even triple 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.700
 wait is a moment that not then you as a person but a clinic in a panic 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.450
 also get it 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.060
 the new name why 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.660
 the clear I'm going to a police car nrc european cities 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.770
 trying themselves in the sector 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.540
 Sometimes this is a silly joke, it is not immediately known how things are going with this country 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.049
 the king has no interest in politics and it is him 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.730
 confidence of the citizens 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.220
 Tip Unemployment rate is very high Kensington Yes I have nothing on it either 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.190
 it so real story for a while that it does good for another country 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.090
 imtech does not even know what ring dike is going on 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.899
 I think the king is not very interested 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.119
 but still seems to me the place i have never gone wrong urgent 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.860
 In this petric newspaper, there is a political system for those customers to turn to 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.980
 and with sunday i can know it 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.260
 i fear my opinion and let alone and save the hartman party 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.340
 that does not seem difficult to me is it not the newspaper and not to its editors 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.659
 only be judged 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.370
 money we cannot do anything without money to discuss his opinion to it 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.560
 headquarters and to win the election you need a lot there 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.320
 have money that reported that a telekraan robert gesink will be going soon 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.000
 I knew you understand and so I want the money in the series 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:29.510
 I did that money very important for that and I don't use it for anything 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:33.150
 nonsensical as the queen repaid in addition to a ticket it has doubled or 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:37.129
 even with 3 if you are going to use that for political purposes how can you 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.069
 double the competition over threefold flight speed 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.969
 Products has done to turnover according with 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.549
 is to immediately check the campaign and that means that it is no longer long 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:51.529
 takes before I can and may take and if I then also take the stake 3m 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:55.430
 opposition parties in the first chamber spent the national income 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.989
 as I want and thank you, invest in the federal building pleasantly ten times as much as 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.389
 independent times as much money as you do my scheme that nobody nobody can 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:07.389
 more to do this 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:13.749
 view others in such a can continue to watch the capital increase I have her 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:15.369
 editors or even area 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:19.090
 registration if we confiscate the legs so it is tolerated 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.880
 get on with fraud 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.389
 I fully understood this eel 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:27.419
 It is not clear why it is a little money the clinic listen once 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:31.969
 Thunder-talk too, but I'm talking about Hiddink. You really are Seedorf 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:32.939
 I check 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:38.119
 the absolution fast short solo as your audience determine and limit viewers 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:40.540
 then we can easily manipulate interim 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.169
 just go ahead 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:46.079
 I no longer have the money here I have already given it to one 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.079
 reliable agencies and then dry land of course it was not enough 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.979
 From now on, I will continue to steal money regularly as a result of testing 

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:57.369
 I am not already free for your own country 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:59.099
 clearly his dollar 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.419
 even though I had money in house, I don't know about you, the real estate agent, the queen 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:08.229
 said anyway that that was a mistake i want to know what with their money never really 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:09.869
 not 

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:10.809
 gamble 

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:12.999
 his duties 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:14.190
 if you like that 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.900
 but that's how you see it dollar, but still 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.609
 And by the way, I can't imagine anyone gintung in your campaign 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:21.340
 more 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.979
 jar of peanut butter the plaza 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.770
 You are really sick I tell you yes I think they are too old for this country 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.160
 worth reforming if you regret that abortion had honestly been said 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:33.729
 I marry 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:34.719
 sir 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:37.860

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.860
 fortuna sittard i want a cup of tea now well me too 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.129
 grab a pair 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:45.360
 what these 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.530
 there will surely not be allowed to participate in the campaign of him 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.219
 I don't think so 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:54.069
 it would surprise me if someone out there doesn't work well anyway 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:58.430
 not many, but if projects have money, I just don't know 

00:04:58.429 --> 00:05:01.419
 fortunately it turns out to be a dollar with no one 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.210
 which easily attracts a large audience 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.699
 driven the red light 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.990
 like you again in the neighborhood songs 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.880
 has paid a supplementary pension I am still after a bad 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.120
 earn a private audience not too long 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.610
 no matter how often this asks, my answer remains the same 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.260
 practically your family so maybe I missed being paid after that that I 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.280
 it actually wilders justice i'm only really skilled at it 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.740
 this country 9 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.689
 I believe 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:35.259
 both ears not you believe with each other freely 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.650
 I am afraid not 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.400
 is not entirely clear 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.710
 remember that this evening were not like this i would never forget 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.849
 their children 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:52.039
 that is right
