same time as the ledger in order to
properly<00:00:46.379> install<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.070> flashing<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.730> create

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
properly install the flashing and create

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.600 
properly install the flashing and create
a<00:00:48.420> proper<00:00:48.930> structural<00:00:49.590> connection<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
a proper structural connection so the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.130 
a proper structural connection so the
wall<00:00:50.789> framing<00:00:51.300> will<00:00:51.420> need<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.690> be<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:51.960> place

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
wall framing will need to be in place

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.830 
wall framing will need to be in place
first<00:00:52.590> now<00:00:53.250> that's<00:00:53.460> not<00:00:53.640> always<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.059> case<00:00:54.360> so

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
first now that's not always the case so

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.510 
first now that's not always the case so
check<00:00:55.110> your<00:00:55.230> structural<00:00:55.680> plans<00:00:55.980> before

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
check your structural plans before

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.729 
check your structural plans before
continuing<00:00:56.969> let's<00:00:57.600> find<00:00:57.809> out<00:00:57.960> more<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
continuing let's find out more so the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.500 
continuing let's find out more so the
sheathing<00:00:58.949> should<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.430> installed<00:00:59.789> behind<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510

then<00:01:01.469> attach<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.129> treated<00:01:02.760> deck<00:01:02.969> ledger

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
then attach the treated deck ledger

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.299 
then attach the treated deck ledger
through<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> wall<00:01:03.989> sheathing<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.680> into<00:01:05.159> the
