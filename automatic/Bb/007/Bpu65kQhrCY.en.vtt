contrast<00:00:05.700> correction<00:00:06.270> we<00:00:06.480> call<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.750> color

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
contrast correction we call the color

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.199

for lack of a better word when this
thing<00:00:09.419> first<00:00:09.599> started<00:00:10.169> we<00:00:10.379> have<00:00:10.499> something<00:00:10.740> to

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:10.799 
thing first started we have something to

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:12.379 
thing first started we have something to
look<00:00:10.919> very<00:00:10.980> washed<00:00:11.400> up<00:00:11.669> so<00:00:12.089> what<00:00:12.269> you're

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
look very washed up so what you're

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.230 
look very washed up so what you're
trying<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.870> do<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.230> maintain<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:14.339> contrast<00:00:14.999> to

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
trying to do is maintain the contrast to

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.570 
trying to do is maintain the contrast to
make<00:00:15.419> it<00:00:15.570> look<00:00:15.690> mysterious<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.500> spooky<00:00:16.650> but

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
make it look mysterious and spooky but

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.599 
make it look mysterious and spooky but
still<00:00:18.029> see<00:00:18.599> the<00:00:18.720> detail<00:00:21.679> we<00:00:22.679> can<00:00:22.890> isolate<00:00:23.460> an

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
still see the detail we can isolate an

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.179 
still see the detail we can isolate an
area<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.089> frame<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.890> either<00:00:25.890> make<00:00:26.160> a

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
area of the frame and either make a

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.849 
area of the frame and either make a
darker<00:00:26.669> or<00:00:26.789> lighter<00:00:26.849> if<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:28.019> can<00:00:28.169> fix<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.679> and

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
darker or lighter if we can fix it and

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.070 
darker or lighter if we can fix it and
not<00:00:29.070> compromise<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.999> overall<00:00:30.419> image<00:00:30.689> we
