Eagle<00:00:50.070> they<00:00:50.879> seem<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.300> have<00:00:51.420> captured<00:00:51.780> the

elegance of this creature beautifully

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.790 
elegance of this creature beautifully
and<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.899> can<00:00:55.110> imagine<00:00:55.289> when<00:00:55.590> they're<00:00:55.710> in

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
and so I can imagine when they're in

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.069 
and so I can imagine when they're in
full<00:00:56.129> charge<00:00:56.160> on<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> battlefield<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
full charge on the battlefield the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.680 
full charge on the battlefield the
animations<00:00:58.680> will<00:00:58.890> expect<00:00:59.430> hackulo<00:01:00.090> with<00:01:00.570> that

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
animations will expect hackulo with that

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.770 
animations will expect hackulo with that
kind<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.020> graceful<00:01:01.410> sort<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.100> gallop<00:01:02.550> or

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
kind of graceful sort of gallop or

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.050 
kind of graceful sort of gallop or
stride<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:04.559> they<00:01:04.680> will<00:01:04.830> have<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.070> them<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.939> as

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
stride that they will have to them so as

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.450 
stride that they will have to them so as
we<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.330> see<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.720> Democrats<00:01:07.229> are<00:01:07.439> smaller<00:01:08.130> and

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
we can see the Democrats are smaller and

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.210 
we can see the Democrats are smaller and
have<00:01:08.939> no<00:01:09.210> wings<00:01:09.540> compared<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.830> larger

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
have no wings compared to the larger

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.250 
have no wings compared to the larger
Griffin's<00:01:11.729> ie<00:01:12.119> deathclaw<00:01:12.780> which<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.229> course

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
Griffin's ie deathclaw which of course

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.130 
Griffin's ie deathclaw which of course
called<00:01:14.070> Friends<00:01:14.700> rides<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.270> now<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.810> thought

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
called Friends rides on now I thought

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.770 
called Friends rides on now I thought
primarily<00:01:17.070> these<00:01:17.850> would<00:01:18.060> act<00:01:18.210> as<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.420> sort<00:01:18.630> of

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
primarily these would act as a sort of

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.050 
primarily these would act as a sort of
shock<00:01:19.189> cavalry<00:01:20.189> unit<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:20.670> now<00:01:20.880> I'm<00:01:21.000> thinking

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
shock cavalry unit but now I'm thinking

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.530 
shock cavalry unit but now I'm thinking
about<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.049> bit<00:01:22.080> more<00:01:22.380> they<00:01:22.979> could<00:01:23.369> be<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.880> lot

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
about it a bit more they could be a lot

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.300 
about it a bit more they could be a lot
more<00:01:24.600> versatile<00:01:25.530> than<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.159> actually

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
more versatile than that and actually

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.630 
more versatile than that and actually
offer<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.939> player<00:01:27.150> even<00:01:27.869> more<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:29.280> they<00:01:29.430> could

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
offer the player even more so they could

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.399 
offer the player even more so they could
still<00:01:29.850> have<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.270> initial<00:01:30.570> shock<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.259> them

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
still have that initial shock to them

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.230 
still have that initial shock to them
when<00:01:31.590> they<00:01:31.680> charge<00:01:31.979> which<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.850> course<00:01:32.880> will

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
when they charge which of course will

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.899 
when they charge which of course will
cause<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.600> huge<00:01:33.869> amount<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.350> fear<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.520> enemy

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
cause a huge amount of fear to the enemy

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.760 
cause a huge amount of fear to the enemy
but<00:01:36.090> once<00:01:36.299> you've<00:01:36.509> engaged<00:01:36.689> because<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.619> their

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
but once you've engaged because of their

but once you've engaged because of their
thick<00:01:38.070> armor<00:01:38.579> they<00:01:39.210> will<00:01:39.420> be<00:01:39.450> extremely

swan<00:02:09.000> or<00:02:09.300> how<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.660> had<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> swan<00:02:10.289> on<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:11.129> top<00:02:11.370> of

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
swan or how you had a swan on the top of

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.100 
swan or how you had a swan on the top of
his<00:02:11.640> helmet<00:02:11.879> so

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
his helmet so

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.050 
his helmet so
that<00:02:13.320> does<00:02:13.500> remind<00:02:13.770> me<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.310> bit<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.670> these

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
that does remind me a bit of these

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.180 
that does remind me a bit of these
nights<00:02:15.390> in<00:02:15.720> warhammer<00:02:16.170> but<00:02:16.950> they<00:02:17.070> have

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
nights in warhammer but they have

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.850 
nights in warhammer but they have
splendidly<00:02:17.790> captured<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.570> elite<00:02:18.930> aspect<00:02:19.620> of

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
splendidly captured that elite aspect of

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.520 
splendidly captured that elite aspect of
the<00:02:20.610> unit<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.300> get<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.720> feeling<00:02:22.050> these<00:02:22.290> will

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
the unit so I get the feeling these will

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.040 
the unit so I get the feeling these will
be<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.710> later<00:02:23.040> game<00:02:23.190> unit<00:02:23.760> perhaps<00:02:24.090> or<00:02:24.300> even<00:02:24.960> a

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
be a later game unit perhaps or even a

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.410 
be a later game unit perhaps or even a
special<00:02:25.650> unit<00:02:25.800> which<00:02:26.490> you<00:02:26.640> can<00:02:26.790> only<00:02:26.910> recruit

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
special unit which you can only recruit

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.500 
special unit which you can only recruit
a<00:02:27.600> certain<00:02:28.470> number<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:28.980> them<00:02:29.460> given<00:02:30.270> their

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
a certain number of them given their

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.600 
a certain number of them given their
rarity<00:02:30.960> but<00:02:31.320> it'd<00:02:31.680> be<00:02:31.770> very<00:02:31.800> interesting<00:02:32.580> to

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
rarity but it'd be very interesting to

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.520 
rarity but it'd be very interesting to
see<00:02:32.820> as<00:02:32.850> well<00:02:33.060> how<00:02:33.300> clave<00:02:33.600> assembly<00:02:34.080> capture

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
see as well how clave assembly capture

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.850 
see as well how clave assembly capture
the<00:02:34.650> impact<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.520> these<00:02:36.330> charges<00:02:37.020> by<00:02:37.320> units<00:02:37.710> of

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
the impact of these charges by units of

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.620 
the impact of these charges by units of
this<00:02:37.980> nature<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.820> know<00:02:38.940> when<00:02:39.090> they<00:02:39.209> collide

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
this nature you know when they collide

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.630 
this nature you know when they collide
and<00:02:39.930> launch<00:02:40.200> themselves<00:02:40.560> into<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.400> enemy

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
and launch themselves into the enemy

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.850 
and launch themselves into the enemy
lines<00:02:41.880> but<00:02:42.660> yeah<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.930> initial<00:02:43.290> animations

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
lines but yeah the initial animations

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.880 
lines but yeah the initial animations
look<00:02:44.459> splendid<00:02:45.030> but<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.930> course<00:02:46.170> we<00:02:46.380> will<00:02:46.530> get

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
look splendid but of course we will get

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.890 
look splendid but of course we will get
a<00:02:47.130> better<00:02:47.490> chance<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:48.030> see<00:02:48.330> this<00:02:48.510> all<00:02:48.750> in

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
a better chance to see this all in
