grass<00:02:04.049> not<00:02:04.380> even<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:05.100> plus<00:02:05.880> two<00:02:06.149> won't<00:02:06.450> do<00:02:06.689> a

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
grass not even like plus two won't do a

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.660 
grass not even like plus two won't do a
lot<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.350> me<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.680> actually<00:02:07.890> does<00:02:08.220> like<00:02:08.399> more

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
lot to me and it actually does like more

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.070 
lot to me and it actually does like more
than

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
than

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.650 
than
off<00:02:09.140> like<00:02:09.680> a<00:02:10.000> little<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.030> little<00:02:11.270> more<00:02:11.630> than

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
off like a little a little more than

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.650 
off like a little a little more than
half<00:02:12.140> so<00:02:12.470> ya<00:02:13.460> better<00:02:13.790> in<00:02:14.240> mind<00:02:14.450> that<00:02:14.630> i

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
half so ya better in mind that i

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.140 
half so ya better in mind that i
actually<00:02:14.810> just<00:02:15.050> woke<00:02:15.440> up<00:02:15.710> so<00:02:16.070> I<00:02:16.340> mean<00:02:16.580> woke<00:02:16.910> up

it right terrakion out and goes for the

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.660 
it right terrakion out and goes for the
close<00:02:37.670> combat<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.780> I<00:02:39.050> was<00:02:40.010> pretty<00:02:40.220> sure<00:02:40.490> I<00:02:40.550> can

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
close combat and I was pretty sure I can

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.600 
close combat and I was pretty sure I can
live<00:02:40.970> this<00:02:41.120> because<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.540> have<00:02:41.720> 50<00:02:42.410> for<00:02:43.010> defense

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
live this because I have 50 for defense

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.960 
live this because I have 50 for defense
and<00:02:44.320> then<00:02:45.320> i<00:02:45.350> go<00:02:45.530> for<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.710> razor<00:02:46.010> shell<00:02:46.460> and<00:02:46.760> i

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
and then i go for the razor shell and i

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.420 
and then i go for the razor shell and i
think<00:02:47.240> he<00:02:47.330> doesn't<00:02:47.690> have<00:02:47.810> entry<00:02:48.410> harris<00:02:48.680> entry

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
think he doesn't have entry harris entry

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.480 
think he doesn't have entry harris entry
had<00:02:49.810> every<00:02:50.810> hazards<00:02:51.320> up<00:02:51.530> that's<00:02:51.920> why<00:02:52.190> i<00:02:52.220> didn't

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
had every hazards up that's why i didn't

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.410 
had every hazards up that's why i didn't
go<00:02:52.610> for<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.820> rapid<00:02:53.270> spin<00:02:53.660> but<00:02:54.560> unfortunately

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
go for the rapid spin but unfortunately

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.120 
go for the rapid spin but unfortunately
yeah<00:02:56.420> close<00:02:57.170> combat<00:02:57.380> did<00:02:57.620> more<00:02:57.830> than<00:02:57.860> I

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
yeah close combat did more than I

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.280 
yeah close combat did more than I
thought<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.610> be<00:02:58.730> honest<00:02:59.030> even<00:02:59.180> though<00:02:59.330> I<00:03:00.080> don't

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
thought to be honest even though I don't

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.930 
thought to be honest even though I don't
resist<00:03:00.830> that<00:03:01.070> it's<00:03:01.250> actually<00:03:01.610> super<00:03:01.910> a

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
resist that it's actually super a

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.449 
resist that it's actually super a
fricative<00:03:02.300> on<00:03:02.600> me<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:02.990> but<00:03:03.980> then<00:03:04.070> I'm<00:03:04.190> going<00:03:04.430> to

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
fricative on me so but then I'm going to

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.210 
fricative on me so but then I'm going to
saw<00:03:05.090> my<00:03:05.270> door<00:03:05.480> cut<00:03:06.140> my<00:03:06.350> door<00:03:06.590> with<00:03:06.860> a<00:03:06.890> saw

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
saw my door cut my door with a saw

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.630 
saw my door cut my door with a saw
whatever<00:03:08.180> so<00:03:08.600> and<00:03:08.870> i<00:03:09.140> go<00:03:09.530> for<00:03:09.740> the<00:03:09.800> protect<00:03:10.430> and

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
whatever so and i go for the protect and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.880 
whatever so and i go for the protect and
he<00:03:10.790> fucking<00:03:11.060> predicts<00:03:11.750> that<00:03:11.810> what<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.530> hell

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
he fucking predicts that what the hell

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.550 
he fucking predicts that what the hell
so<00:03:13.730> that<00:03:14.120> was<00:03:14.239> a<00:03:14.269> nice<00:03:14.570> play<00:03:14.870> on<00:03:14.900> his<00:03:15.140> part<00:03:15.170> i

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
so that was a nice play on his part i

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.560 
so that was a nice play on his part i
can<00:03:15.769> see<00:03:15.950> because<00:03:16.100> I'm<00:03:16.730> shitting<00:03:17.209> right<00:03:17.420> now

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
can see because I'm shitting right now

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.199 
can see because I'm shitting right now
if<00:03:17.900> probably<00:03:18.769> a<00:03:18.800> stone<00:03:19.310> edge<00:03:19.489> could<00:03:19.730> kill<00:03:20.030> me

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
if probably a stone edge could kill me

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.360 
if probably a stone edge could kill me
but<00:03:20.540> apparently<00:03:21.440> he<00:03:21.590> doesn't<00:03:21.830> have<00:03:22.100> stone

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
but apparently he doesn't have stone

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.220 
but apparently he doesn't have stone
edge<00:03:22.580> I<00:03:22.850> don't<00:03:23.269> know<00:03:23.360> why<00:03:23.510> he<00:03:23.750> went<00:03:23.989> for<00:03:24.110> the

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
edge I don't know why he went for the

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.800 
edge I don't know why he went for the
close<00:03:24.530> combat<00:03:24.860> maybe<00:03:25.700> he<00:03:26.000> was<00:03:26.120> predicting<00:03:26.690> my

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
close combat maybe he was predicting my

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.800 
close combat maybe he was predicting my
switch<00:03:27.200> but<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:28.070> don't<00:03:28.730> know<00:03:28.820> I<00:03:29.060> doubt<00:03:29.390> it<00:03:29.420> maybe

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
switch but I don't know I doubt it maybe

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.750 
switch but I don't know I doubt it maybe
he<00:03:30.170> was<00:03:30.380> like<00:03:30.560> he's<00:03:30.769> only<00:03:30.950> attacking<00:03:31.340> which

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
he was like he's only attacking which

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.449 
he was like he's only attacking which
would<00:03:32.000> be<00:03:32.180> pretty<00:03:32.510> weird<00:03:32.840> so<00:03:33.230> then<00:03:33.950> he<00:03:34.160> goes<00:03:34.340> to

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
would be pretty weird so then he goes to

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.610 
would be pretty weird so then he goes to
the<00:03:34.519> chomp<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.330> go<00:03:35.510> for<00:03:35.720> the<00:03:35.750> protect<00:03:36.350> and

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
the chomp and I go for the protect and

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.180 
the chomp and I go for the protect and
right<00:03:36.860> here<00:03:37.280> I'm<00:03:37.430> gonna<00:03:37.550> predict<00:03:38.120> his<00:03:38.300> switch

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
right here I'm gonna predict his switch

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.009 
right here I'm gonna predict his switch
predicting<00:03:40.190> my<00:03:40.370> switch<00:03:40.760> but<00:03:41.060> he<00:03:41.239> doesn't<00:03:41.900> I

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
predicting my switch but he doesn't I

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.690 
predicting my switch but he doesn't I
mean<00:03:42.200> he<00:03:42.350> doesn't<00:03:42.709> predict<00:03:43.010> my<00:03:43.160> switch<00:03:43.489> which

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
mean he doesn't predict my switch which

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.270 
mean he doesn't predict my switch which
is<00:03:43.910> bad<00:03:44.180> because<00:03:44.230> he<00:03:45.230> kills<00:03:45.470> me<00:03:45.650> with<00:03:45.800> a<00:03:45.830> credit

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
is bad because he kills me with a credit

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.250 
is bad because he kills me with a credit
reiko<00:03:46.640> me<00:03:46.790> year<00:03:47.000> but<00:03:47.269> I<00:03:47.420> don't<00:03:47.959> think<00:03:48.170> it

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
reiko me year but I don't think it

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.710 
reiko me year but I don't think it
mattered<00:03:48.650> just<00:03:48.890> because<00:03:49.190> it<00:03:49.550> was<00:03:49.640> specs<00:03:50.360> I

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
mattered just because it was specs I

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.229 
mattered just because it was specs I
mean<00:03:51.320> a<00:03:51.560> spike<00:03:51.920> strike<00:03:52.310> on<00:03:52.519> me<00:03:52.640> or<00:03:52.820> even<00:03:52.970> though
