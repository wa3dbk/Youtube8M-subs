tata group because you know South Africa

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.630 
tata group because you know South Africa
the<00:00:36.270> number<00:00:36.450> one<00:00:36.600> team<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.930> world<00:00:37.170> and

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
the number one team in the world and

India<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.760> Pakistan<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.270> don't<00:00:39.540> have<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.750> say

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930

India and Pakistan I don't have to say
much<00:00:39.960> about<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.640> think<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.930> will<00:00:43.050> be<00:00:43.200> best

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
much about it so I think it will be best

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.590 
much about it so I think it will be best
if<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.920> know<00:00:44.460> India<00:00:44.820> crying<00:00:45.120> when<00:00:45.329> they<00:00:45.450> wrote

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
if you know India crying when they wrote

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.600 
if you know India crying when they wrote

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
Indies and then you know they can

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.580 
Indies and then you know they can
perhaps<00:00:50.670> not<00:00:51.180> have<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.930> must-win<00:00:52.410> situation

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
perhaps not have a must-win situation

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.260 
perhaps not have a must-win situation
against<00:00:53.190> Pakistan<00:00:53.699> which<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.000> going<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.210> be
