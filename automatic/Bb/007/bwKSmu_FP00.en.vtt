more<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:10.909> more<00:03:11.299> rosy<00:03:12.790> in<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:14.000> future<00:03:14.680> so<00:03:15.680> it's

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
more and more rosy in the future so it's

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.539 
more and more rosy in the future so it's
why<00:03:16.430> champagne<00:03:17.299> want<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.500> position<00:03:18.980> pan

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
why champagne want to a position pan

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.080 
why champagne want to a position pan
it's<00:03:20.150> why<00:03:20.450> bottle<00:03:21.049> wants<00:03:21.799> to<00:03:22.060> watch<00:03:23.060> the

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
it's why bottle wants to watch the

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.379 
it's why bottle wants to watch the
bottle<00:03:23.599> every<00:03:24.069> country<00:03:25.069> is<00:03:25.129> in<00:03:25.400> France<00:03:25.700> want

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
bottle every country is in France want

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.080 
bottle every country is in France want
to<00:03:26.569> oppose<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:26.930> because<00:03:27.290> they<00:03:28.090> understand

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
to oppose it because they understand

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.729 
to oppose it because they understand
that<00:03:29.620> Rosie<00:03:30.620> is<00:03:30.799> become<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.670> third<00:03:31.939> color<00:03:32.329> and

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
that Rosie is become the third color and

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.819 
that Rosie is become the third color and
it's<00:03:33.739> cheaper<00:03:34.459> than<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:35.599> other<00:03:35.870> coral

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
it's cheaper than the other coral

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.910 
it's cheaper than the other coral
actually<00:03:37.489> so<00:03:38.090> you<00:03:38.750> know<00:03:38.900> what<00:03:39.349> happens<00:03:39.680> today

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
actually so you know what happens today

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.059 
actually so you know what happens today
with<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.430> economy<00:03:40.790> so<00:03:41.090> it's<00:03:41.810> a<00:03:41.959> good<00:03:42.139> market

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
with the economy so it's a good market

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.270 
with the economy so it's a good market
but<00:03:44.000> if<00:03:44.569> I<00:03:44.720> can<00:03:44.930> say<00:03:45.079> something<00:03:45.139> that<00:03:45.709> my

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
but if I can say something that my

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.770 
but if I can say something that my
country<00:03:46.639> neurons<00:03:47.060> we<00:03:47.750> come<00:03:48.019> to<00:03:48.230> red<00:03:48.799> light

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
country neurons we come to red light

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.680 
country neurons we come to red light
bottle<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:51.019> we<00:03:51.949> can<00:03:52.129> do<00:03:52.280> white<00:03:52.579> wines<00:03:53.269> like

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
bottle and we can do white wines like

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.430 
bottle and we can do white wines like
burgundy<00:03:54.470> but<00:03:55.069> they<00:03:55.220> can't<00:03:55.489> do<00:03:55.639> Rosie<00:03:56.030> like<00:03:56.599> we

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
burgundy but they can't do Rosie like we

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.520 
burgundy but they can't do Rosie like we
do<00:03:57.949> other<00:03:58.340> year<00:03:58.669> so<00:03:59.449> we<00:03:59.780> are<00:03:59.900> very<00:04:00.079> confident

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
do other year so we are very confident

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.780 
do other year so we are very confident
about<00:04:00.739> this<00:04:01.669> color<00:04:02.480> and<00:04:02.780> we<00:04:03.019> are<00:04:03.230> sure<00:04:03.620> that<00:04:03.980> in

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
about this color and we are sure that in

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.740 
about this color and we are sure that in
Provence<00:04:05.299> we<00:04:06.169> are<00:04:06.799> we<00:04:07.489> make<00:04:07.699> the<00:04:07.909> one<00:04:08.480> of<00:04:08.629> the

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
Provence we are we make the one of the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.140 
Provence we are we make the one of the
best<00:04:08.959> rosy<00:04:09.349> on<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.889> world

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.880 

it's<00:04:14.150> very<00:04:14.360> difficult<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:14.900> make<00:04:15.080> OSA<00:04:15.500> because

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
it's very difficult to make OSA because

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.570 
it's very difficult to make OSA because
um<00:04:17.290> when<00:04:18.290> you<00:04:18.440> make<00:04:18.620> a<00:04:18.650> white<00:04:18.920> or<00:04:19.160> white<00:04:19.340> wine

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
um when you make a white or white wine

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.750 
um when you make a white or white wine
you<00:04:20.440> don't<00:04:21.440> care<00:04:21.680> about<00:04:21.830> the<00:04:22.070> color<00:04:22.310> because

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
you don't care about the color because

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.240 
you don't care about the color because
the<00:04:23.060> color<00:04:23.090> it<00:04:23.450> is<00:04:23.690> otherwise<00:04:24.470> is<00:04:24.680> on<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:24.980> food

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
the color it is otherwise is on the food

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.550 
the color it is otherwise is on the food
and<00:04:25.430> for<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.150> white<00:04:26.390> you<00:04:27.050> don't<00:04:27.230> need<00:04:27.350> color

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
and for the white you don't need color

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.580 
and for the white you don't need color
but<00:04:28.280> for<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:28.580> rosy<00:04:28.880> you<00:04:29.150> have<00:04:29.900> a<00:04:30.110> certain

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
but for the rosy you have a certain

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.550 
but for the rosy you have a certain
power<00:04:30.860> power<00:04:31.460> mat<00:04:31.670> which<00:04:31.850> is<00:04:32.000> the<00:04:32.120> color<00:04:32.560> you

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
power power mat which is the color you

pearl with not a lot of hardcore and
it's<00:05:20.270> very<00:05:20.570> difficult<00:05:20.840> because<00:05:21.290> it's<00:05:21.710> it's<00:05:21.980> a

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
it's very difficult because it's it's a

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.970 
it's very difficult because it's it's a
balance<00:05:22.370> and<00:05:22.700> this<00:05:23.690> balance<00:05:23.840> is<00:05:24.110> very<00:05:24.350> hard<00:05:24.590> to

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
balance and this balance is very hard to

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.190

find so you have to have a lot of

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.630 
find so you have to have a lot of
experience<00:05:27.860> to<00:05:29.320> to<00:05:30.320> make<00:05:30.530> good<00:05:31.130> were<00:05:31.370> say
