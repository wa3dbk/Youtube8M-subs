00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
this is actually because of deficiency

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.960 
this is actually because of deficiency
and<00:04:36.140> they're<00:04:36.350> saying<00:04:36.710> it's<00:04:37.130> more

specifically zinc and iron no zinc and

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.990 
specifically zinc and iron no zinc and
 what<00:04:46.490> was<00:04:46.520> it

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.890 
 what was it
Oh<00:04:48.080> zinc<00:04:48.620> and<00:04:48.860> magnesium<00:04:49.360> deficiency<00:04:50.360> is<00:04:50.600> what

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
Oh zinc and magnesium deficiency is what

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.620 
Oh zinc and magnesium deficiency is what
they're<00:04:51.080> saying<00:04:51.500> that<00:04:51.800> um<00:04:52.040> the<00:04:52.850> cause<00:04:53.090> is<00:04:53.420> sort

up<00:04:56.570> zinc<00:04:56.870> and<00:04:56.990> magnesium<00:04:57.110> magnesium

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
up zinc and magnesium magnesium

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.880 
up zinc and magnesium magnesium
deficiency<00:04:58.640> to<00:04:58.760> see<00:04:58.970> if<00:04:59.060> it<00:04:59.180> kind<00:04:59.330> of<00:04:59.450> was<00:04:59.690> like

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
deficiency to see if it kind of was like

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.950 
deficiency to see if it kind of was like
what's<00:05:00.890> going<00:05:00.980> on<00:05:01.370> and<00:05:01.670> I'm<00:05:02.210> not<00:05:02.390> too<00:05:02.630> sure<00:05:02.930> I

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
what's going on and I'm not too sure I

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.930 
what's going on and I'm not too sure I
might<00:05:03.650> see<00:05:03.950> a<00:05:03.980> doctor<00:05:04.400> and<00:05:04.580> see<00:05:04.730> like<00:05:04.910> a

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
might see a doctor and see like a

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.490 
might see a doctor and see like a
checkup<00:05:05.360> maybe<00:05:05.840> you<00:05:05.960> can<00:05:06.080> tell<00:05:06.260> me<00:05:06.410> about

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
checkup maybe you can tell me about

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.130 
checkup maybe you can tell me about
deficient<00:05:07.100> of<00:05:07.220> nutrients<00:05:07.730> or<00:05:07.820> something<00:05:08.150> but

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
deficient of nutrients or something but

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.590 
deficient of nutrients or something but
basically<00:05:09.650> if<00:05:09.920> you<00:05:10.220> are<00:05:10.610> zinc<00:05:11.300> and<00:05:11.450> magnesium

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
basically if you are zinc and magnesium

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.450 
basically if you are zinc and magnesium
are<00:05:12.140> important<00:05:12.560> nutrients<00:05:13.040> that<00:05:13.130> need<00:05:13.310> to<00:05:13.400> be

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
are important nutrients that need to be

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.120 
are important nutrients that need to be
consumed<00:05:14.030> in<00:05:14.150> a<00:05:14.270> diet<00:05:14.540> zinc<00:05:15.380> is<00:05:15.500> an<00:05:15.650> important

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
consumed in a diet zinc is an important

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.100 
consumed in a diet zinc is an important
for<00:05:16.430> wound<00:05:16.640> healing<00:05:16.790> growth<00:05:17.480> and<00:05:17.750> healthy

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
for wound healing growth and healthy

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.850 
for wound healing growth and healthy
skin<00:05:18.170> and<00:05:18.740> the<00:05:19.010> production<00:05:19.340> of<00:05:19.580> RNA<00:05:19.940> and<00:05:19.970> DNA

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
skin and the production of RNA and DNA

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.110 
skin and the production of RNA and DNA
magnesium<00:05:21.860> is<00:05:21.950> used<00:05:22.160> by<00:05:22.280> the<00:05:22.340> bones<00:05:22.670> heart

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
magnesium is used by the bones heart

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.290 
magnesium is used by the bones heart
nerves<00:05:23.510> muscles<00:05:23.900> and<00:05:24.260> immune<00:05:24.560> system<00:05:25.300> so

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
nerves muscles and immune system so

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.580 
nerves muscles and immune system so
basically<00:05:26.570> the<00:05:26.750> more<00:05:26.900> zinc<00:05:27.200> you<00:05:27.290> have<00:05:27.410> in<00:05:27.530> your

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
basically the more zinc you have in your

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.620 
basically the more zinc you have in your
system<00:05:27.800> the<00:05:28.130> better<00:05:28.550> your<00:05:28.790> skin<00:05:29.180> is<00:05:29.420> going<00:05:29.540> to

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
system the better your skin is going to

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.590 
system the better your skin is going to
turn<00:05:29.870> out<00:05:30.280> so<00:05:31.280> basically<00:05:31.880> keep<00:05:32.180> your<00:05:32.360> diet

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
turn out so basically keep your diet

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.460 
turn out so basically keep your diet
balanced<00:05:33.320> and<00:05:35.020> make<00:05:36.020> sure<00:05:36.200> you're<00:05:36.380> getting

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
all the nutrients and enrichments you

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.540 
all the nutrients and enrichments you
need<00:05:38.600> from<00:05:38.870> your<00:05:39.050> foods<00:05:39.380> and<00:05:39.740> drink<00:05:40.250> lots<00:05:40.430> of
