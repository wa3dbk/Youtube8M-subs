the<00:00:01.970> next<00:00:02.300> innovation<00:00:02.540> football<00:00:03.290> helmet

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:03.620 
the next innovation football helmet

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.950 
the next innovation football helmet
technology<00:00:04.129> is<00:00:04.310> actually<00:00:04.669> long<00:00:05.060> overdue<00:00:05.420> if

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:05.960 
technology is actually long overdue if

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.960 
technology is actually long overdue if
you<00:00:06.170> look<00:00:06.350> at<00:00:06.470> most<00:00:06.819> products<00:00:07.819> or

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
you look at most products or

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.640 
you look at most products or
technologies<00:00:08.139> there's<00:00:09.139> been<00:00:09.320> a<00:00:09.349> lot<00:00:09.620> of

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
technologies there's been a lot of

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.650 
technologies there's been a lot of
innovation<00:00:09.950> but<00:00:10.610> in<00:00:10.730> football<00:00:11.120> helmets<00:00:11.480> there

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:11.660 
innovation but in football helmets there

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.749 
innovation but in football helmets there
hasn't<00:00:11.870> been<00:00:15.129> current<00:00:16.129> helmets<00:00:16.550> were

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:16.759 
hasn't been current helmets were

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:18.399 
hasn't been current helmets were
designed<00:00:17.179> to<00:00:17.419> protect<00:00:17.569> against<00:00:18.050> skull

after<00:00:20.509> motorcycle<00:00:21.289> helmets<00:00:21.649> and<00:00:21.739> they<00:00:21.829> do<00:00:21.890> a

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
after motorcycle helmets and they do a

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.759 
after motorcycle helmets and they do a
terrific<00:00:22.609> job<00:00:22.880> at<00:00:23.419> that<00:00:23.479> but<00:00:24.169> they're<00:00:24.649> not

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
terrific job at that but they're not

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.249 
terrific job at that but they're not

concussions<00:00:40.160> reduce<00:00:40.820> our<00:00:41.210> helmet<00:00:41.660> will

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:41.839 
concussions reduce our helmet will

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:44.169 
concussions reduce our helmet will
protect<00:00:42.230> against<00:00:42.500> both<00:00:42.769> skull<00:00:43.219> fracture<00:00:43.760> and

protect against both skull fracture and

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.000 
protect against both skull fracture and
traumatic<00:00:44.750> brain<00:00:44.929> injury<00:00:45.440> that's<00:00:45.649> really<00:00:45.920> the

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
traumatic brain injury that's really the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.709 
traumatic brain injury that's really the
breakthrough<00:00:46.219> we're<00:00:46.910> not<00:00:47.059> saying<00:00:47.329> we<00:00:47.570> can

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 
breakthrough we're not saying we can

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.779 
breakthrough we're not saying we can
ever<00:00:48.019> prevent<00:00:48.469> a<00:00:48.620> concussion<00:00:48.769> but<00:00:49.429> we<00:00:49.609> think

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
ever prevent a concussion but we think

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.689 
ever prevent a concussion but we think
we<00:00:49.969> can<00:00:50.120> do<00:00:50.300> a<00:00:50.329> much<00:00:50.600> better<00:00:50.960> job<00:00:51.140> at

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
we can do a much better job at

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.829 
we can do a much better job at
mitigating<00:00:52.699> the<00:00:52.820> forces<00:00:53.359> that<00:00:53.510> are<00:00:53.629> thought

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
to cause concussion we're developing

to cause concussion we're developing
what<00:00:55.760> we<00:00:55.789> believe<00:00:56.179> is<00:00:56.300> going<00:00:56.449> to<00:00:56.510> be<00:00:56.600> the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
what we believe is going to be the

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.509 
what we believe is going to be the

safest football helmet out there we

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.729 
safest football helmet out there we
don't<00:00:58.699> want<00:00:58.999> this<00:00:59.420> helmet<00:00:59.629> to<00:00:59.899> provide<00:01:00.710> a
