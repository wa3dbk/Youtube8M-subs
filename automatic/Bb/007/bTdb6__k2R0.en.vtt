00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.380
 the most environment television today to a 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.029
 element that always 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.429
 we interact is the water I already told you 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.290
 I just a moment ago but we really 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.300
 we realize its value and its 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.320
 importance this is the first part of 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.700
 a special report that we have 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.700
 prepared for you here in chain 3 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.840
 the water cycle is very diverse in 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.760
 our country the liquid is obtained and 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.170
 distributed in different ways and methods 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.650
 throughout the republic 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.140
 mexicana there are people who possess certain 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.930
 knowledge about how it is that water 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.330
 however, most of the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.000
 people do not have a remote idea of the value 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.040
 of water is even misused and 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.140
 deliberately wasted 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.080
 our country is divided into three 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.630
 large areas the southern part with wide 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.540
 Water availability in the downtown area 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.660
 with some deficiencies and the north with 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.060
 serious water problems reflection is 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.570
 that there is less and less water and 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.220
 it is getting contaminated is what we 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.199
 refers the engineer olive groves of the 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.090
 national association of water companies 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.930
 and sanitation services today 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.570
 of water by 80% you get the 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.610
 availability of underground sources and 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.869
 this is not good at all because we have 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:23.290
 exhausted the water rolled to the mantos 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.380
 immediate this is the case of 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.550
 streams rivers lagoons 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.190
 paradoxically the north of mexico where 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.860
 It is generated 60 percent of the product 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.229
 national gross domestic live a deficit 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.270
 important water part of the abundant 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.700
 amount of water in the basins 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.500
 from the south has been transferred to the basins 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.670
 north but it has not turned out 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.920
 enough then the procedure 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.170
 the real production cost for the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.000
 water supply is over 14 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.360
 pesos for a one cubic meter water tank 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.149
 which can fit 1100 liters nonetheless 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.790
 in Mexico the same content of the tinaco 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.799
 fluctuates by 8 pesos so it 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.380
 considers that there is an imbalance for the 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.299
 water collection there are not only sectors of 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.890
 the population that by the way have the 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.769
 great privilege to have access to 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.269
 resource and they do not pay it but that 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.920
 we also face the issue and 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.380
 authorities that charge us by the way 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.080
 we face the water problem and the 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.630
 challenge that the prices the prices of 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.880
 water the costs that all how are these 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.680
 paying do not reflect the real costs not 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.019
 in all states and municipalities 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.239
 they handle the same rate depends on the 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.709
 accessibility the infrastructure the 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.870
 closeness to sources of 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.220
 supplying the efforts of 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.580
 operators that provide the service 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.519
 hydraulic is huge and yet still 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.319
 there are poor people without water or inhabitants of 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.170
 middle class with deficiencies that have 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.640
 already become a custom an example of 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.630
 eagerness to carry water 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.330
 the federal district is the lerma system 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.520
 this complex moves daily 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.130
 million cubic meters and the branches 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.450
 until pumping the to each house to each 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:05.820
 office to each school to each hospital to 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.459
 each commercial plaza and other condominiums 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.980
 or public and private buildings the 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.610
 The state of Mexico has a lot of water and 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.370
 that the federal district thrives on it 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.020
 from lerma near toluca the water falls 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.180
 by gravity and reaches these 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.820
 hydraulic installations located in 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.910
 the west zone and that lead it towards 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.800
 the capital the hydraulic works of this 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.560
 place in huixquilucan state of mexico 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.720
 they are called fall the drunkard is one of 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.930
 the most important channels that carry 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.030
 water to much of the federal district 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.580
 in the next installment of the water cycle 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.920
 we will graphically show you how it is that 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.380
 the water travels and drives until it arrives 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.200
 the human being to be used 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.060
 pigeons informed our channel
