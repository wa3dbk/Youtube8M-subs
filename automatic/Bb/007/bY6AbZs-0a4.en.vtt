00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
kind of more accepting of Michelle now

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.880

because<00:01:17.930> what<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.110> think<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.470> it's<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
because what do you think that it's a

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.649 
because what do you think that it's a
real<00:01:20.189> acceptance<00:01:20.790> or<00:01:20.939> do<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.119> think<00:01:21.180> that

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
real acceptance or do you think that

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.840 
real acceptance or do you think that
just<00:01:21.900> because<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.619> know<00:01:22.740> Emily<00:01:23.220> wasn't<00:01:23.700> there

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
just because you know Emily wasn't there

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.130 
just because you know Emily wasn't there
that<00:01:23.880> maybe<00:01:24.240> they<00:01:24.450> were<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.570> little<00:01:24.780> bit<00:01:24.869> nicer

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
that maybe they were a little bit nicer

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.270 
that maybe they were a little bit nicer
do<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.409> think<00:01:25.560> it'll<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.830> same<00:01:26.070> when<00:01:26.189> they

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
do you think it'll be the same when they

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.550 
do you think it'll be the same when they
get<00:01:26.400> back<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.790> studio<00:01:29.840> one<00:01:30.840> was<00:01:31.229> always
