00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
do a dive card the dive cartwheel is

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.530 
do a dive card the dive cartwheel is
simply<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.590> cartwheel<00:02:33.920> which<00:02:34.370> look<00:02:34.609> like<00:02:34.730> this

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.539 

but<00:02:38.540> what<00:02:39.230> are<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.379> doing<00:02:39.620> it<00:02:39.709> you<00:02:40.159> want<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.430> go

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
but what are you doing it you want to go

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.849 
but what are you doing it you want to go
as<00:02:40.670> long<00:02:41.000> as<00:02:41.209> you<00:02:41.329> can<00:02:41.599> without<00:02:42.139> hitting<00:02:42.620> the

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
as long as you can without hitting the

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:53.500 
ground and then hit the ground and push
them<00:02:46.159> so<00:02:46.670> it<00:02:46.939> looks<00:02:47.120> like<00:02:47.239> this<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:53.000> another

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
them so it looks like this and another

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.490 
them so it looks like this and another
way<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.840> do<00:02:54.049> it<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:55.569> when<00:02:56.569> you<00:02:56.750> almost<00:02:56.959> do<00:02:57.470> a

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
way to do it is when you almost do a

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.159 
way to do it is when you almost do a
side<00:02:57.859> aerial<00:02:58.340> for<00:02:58.609> when<00:02:59.120> you're<00:02:59.299> used<00:02:59.599> to<00:02:59.870> this

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.169 
side aerial for when you're used to this

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:05.170 
side aerial for when you're used to this
you<00:03:01.129> go<00:03:01.250> like<00:03:01.400> this

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:13.370 

and<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:07.020> a<00:03:07.050> siding<00:03:11.450> so<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.750> last<00:03:13.020> scale

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
and that is a siding so the last scale

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.990 
and that is a siding so the last scale
we're<00:03:13.650> going<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.890> show<00:03:14.130> you<00:03:14.190> is<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.550> front

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
we're going to show you is the front

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.360 
we're going to show you is the front
handspring<00:03:15.569> a<00:03:15.840> front<00:03:16.440> handspring<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:17.010> very

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
handspring a front handspring is very

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:35.600 
handspring a front handspring is very
simple<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:27.290> with<00:03:28.290> both<00:03:28.560> feet<00:03:34.340> another<00:03:35.340> way<00:03:35.580> to

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
simple and with both feet another way to

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.610 
simple and with both feet another way to
do<00:03:35.849> a<00:03:35.880> front<00:03:36.180> handspring<00:03:36.690> is<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.380> front

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
do a front handspring is the front

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.590 
do a front handspring is the front
handspring<00:03:38.100> step-out<00:03:38.299> looks<00:03:39.299> almost

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
handspring step-out looks almost

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.320 
handspring step-out looks almost
identical<00:03:39.989> to<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.799> front<00:03:41.100> walkover<00:03:41.610> but<00:03:42.120> once

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330
