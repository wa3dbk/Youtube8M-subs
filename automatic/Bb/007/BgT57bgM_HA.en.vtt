 new video tutorial good is my first 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.180
 video tutorial that I'm just going to do 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.880
 this is how to play two 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.420
 players in 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.540
 in the nes emulator in my case I would 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.869
 I will teach in the super against how 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.030
 play two players good since they have 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:30.460
 your games downloaded 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.460

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.690
 we open it select your game 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.920
 in my case I already told them that I'm going to 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.920
 select super cons 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.770

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.820
