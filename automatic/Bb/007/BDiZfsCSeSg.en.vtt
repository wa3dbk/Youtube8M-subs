00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.559
 hello everybody welcome to another one 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.389
 video here from cala bydesign in this video 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.710
 we'll be fine in the wet on the plate 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.710
 mother asus model 87 sabertooth a 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.449
 This plate 1150 targets the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.560
 fourth-generation intel processors 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.000
 with support cross cross father and already comes ready 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.920
 for windows 8 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.290
 the accessories part of it is well 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.100
 complex that she has a lot more 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.680
 Let's take a look at everything in Canada. 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.980
 good backwards obviously we have a 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.289
 small manual logic guide 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.300
 talking about the board itself all the 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.719
 her accessories as you do to 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.899
 set it have a certificate of 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.820
 cyber series four cables already in the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.949
 standard of about 10 seconds tired 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.980
 32 connections for easy assembly 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.769
 of the cabinet connections on the reset stage 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.390
 and usb a saddle bridge with the panel 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:12.180
 that you are going to put on the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.860
 site cabinet 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.229
 if you want to take a look at how 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.240
 it is applied in the cabinet 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.640
 Can you guys take a look at our albums? 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.740
 there on facebook we have several machines 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.340
 with this adhesive applied and now has the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.090
 second part of the vintage accessories in 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.159
 great 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.490
 all this is part of the technology 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.900
 have higher value of sabertooth series where 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.689
 I 'm going to show a little over to 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:43.220
 You're right that you can. 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:48.659
 use for is sealing let's say so 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:50.670
 the motherboard cover inputs 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.590
 that you are not using to 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.240
 improve its cooling system 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.740
 and two small lines that also 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.930
 would be showing you where 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.549
 put the team is already right outside the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.579
 Let's start by taking a look at the 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.500
 basic you can see here is the place 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.570
 where you put a processor pass 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.420
 1 RG 50 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.670
 and here we have a little protection 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.050
 so that nothing happens with the tires that 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.910
 under the team 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.770
 he knows he can not bend any 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.960
 so there how from 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.840
 memory we have four slots that know 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:27.120
 total of up to 32 gigabytes with ddr3 memories 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:30.000
 and frequencies until 1866 we do not have many 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.910
 other characteristics displayed on the cervix 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.070
 and handed the gun that one there we 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.400
 Let's talk, we have it here. 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.400
 the heatsinks earning 6 pci 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.400
 express being that these here are pci 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.310
 express 1 x this guy here a pci 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.070
 16x these two cases are that they are 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.160
 accurate express 8x we have some buttons 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:57.090
 as the memorial that the direct kim several 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.620
 connections to speak as well as the panel 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.380
 cabinet front 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.360
 the usb and all other devices that 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.800
 You can put this card in this 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.950
 part that you can see that it comes with 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.190
 eight connections and one more connection 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.130
 usb3 direct to the cabinet connections from her 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.950
 with the rest of the computer you can see that 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.870
 she's going to have 4s of this one here 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.959
 piercing shows two usb 3.0 two exact 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.930
 an optical HDD audio output and 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.830
 displayport a heartthrob network entry 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.850
 plus two usb 3.0 and one 7.1 audio 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.800
 channels 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.930
 This hole everything she has here too. 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.060
 is part of the time warner technology 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.680
 I'll tell you how it works 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.080
 let's talk now the big 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.110
 highlight this cyber series for the data 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.330
 that it is the court that the delay is all this 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.100
 layer you are seeing here 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.020
 black around the plate 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.730
 contrary to what many people think 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.790
 which is not a heat sink 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.890
 This one here is plastic, this is nothing. 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.370
 more is than a cover for the plate 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.940
 to channel the cabinet airflow 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.280
 so that it passes the entire motherboard 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.800
 helping to cool it but not here 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.959
 It's the same material as that. 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.280
 as I already mentioned how this topic 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.930
 organ works 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.700
 he has some fans that I 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.200
 I'll show you that I 'd put it on 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.890
 which is also you see neither the installation 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.690
 but especially when you put the 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.360
 body of your processor here 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.310
 the retiree says pull the air down 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.860
 so at the time you pull it off 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.410
 by the process it hits on the motherboard it 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.630
 ends up entering by the 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.850
 issue order and because of that time 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.850
 This way, he's going to force the 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.950
 what if the motherboard runs to have it 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.470
 exit independently from the sides 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.020
 above or below the two places 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.720
 where you put in does well with it are 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.240
 exactly here to shake playing the 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.580
 target on that bottom and the other is 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.250
 in this corner where you will put 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.090
 standing that resembles that hole starting 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.680
 it's for you 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.670
 it will pull the air out of the cabinet 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.400
 it seems the parts here in these parts here 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:11.040
 it has four specific escape 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.530
 being here down this side 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.420
 on this side and here it is a 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.550
 specific refrigeration for 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.050
 sinks that are taking over the 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.860
 cooling of the good sites of 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.020
 processor 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:27.030
 a team new one series tree 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.919
 of 87 are those of the two keys have here 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.890
 to know that these keys you will not 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:34.620
 can see in the video but this one and 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:37.680
 this guy here like I said he is 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.720
 deciph air outlets so far in 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.750
 who leaves here to help the 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.460
 processor is here to judge the air for 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.990
 down but if you are using a 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.700
 rotor you are using a 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.200
 Look for you, you know that here it goes. 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:55.290
 stay the bomb then you come here 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.630
 I make it here, it closes this withdrawal exit 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.230
 causing the architect's appeal 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.150
 face 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.919
 leave on these sides not 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.870
 wasting the attack he 's sending 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.910
 why are not you going to have the 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.250
 course is one of the great differentials of 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:11.310
 delay of the c 87 series 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:14.520
 another new technology that only comes out of 87 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:17.610
 to know everything right now is this 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.220
 the card that comes back that it 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:22.980
 plate an iron plate and she's here 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.080
 screwed up a motherboard so that it 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.360
 Do not end up in Pernambuco because of the 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.310
 weight of water that has increased 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.500
 considerably the weight of the motherboard 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.870
 so that her sign is here for 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.669
 prevent this kab plate by deforming 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.870
 cause your own prisoner give it to you 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:39.660
 want to be in the look 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.250
 in theme 100% water mounted is 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.100
 available in the video description 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.200
 video link of the talking asus itself 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.080
 about knowing where they will be 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.570
 showing all the points in the term 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.600
 armando talks to ride if you liked 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:56.070
 know that ufc 87 wants to buy his in 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.410
 description of the video will also have a 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.270
 link for you to detect our site may 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.280
 I got it and I hope you all 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:04.320
 liked the video if you liked it 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.300
 stop giving that little joke down here 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.250
 to share the video to be on the 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.990
 disclosure of the same as taking a look 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.120
 also our other social networks 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.160
 facebook on twitter that everything is with 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.780
 link in the description of the video to you all 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:20.480
 who have watched so far my very 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.480
 Thank you and until our next video already 

00:07:36.899 --> 00:07:39.899
