00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
believe this car has a an option that's

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:10.230 
believe this car has a an option that's
quite<00:05:59.539> rare<00:05:59.780> these<00:05:59.960> days<00:06:00.020> a<00:06:02.020> smoker's<00:06:03.020> package

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.760 

so<00:06:11.240> this<00:06:11.599> is<00:06:11.719> why<00:06:11.840> we<00:06:11.990> always<00:06:12.139> ordered<00:06:12.650> the

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
so this is why we always ordered the

smoker smoking package because then the

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.050 
smoker smoking package because then the
whole<00:06:15.169> thing<00:06:15.469> looks<00:06:15.680> more<00:06:16.009> harmonic<00:06:16.909> because

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
whole thing looks more harmonic because

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.480 
whole thing looks more harmonic because
