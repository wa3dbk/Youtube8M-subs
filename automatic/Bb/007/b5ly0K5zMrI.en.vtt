00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
because I've got the pictures of this

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.450 
because I've got the pictures of this
thing<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.320> fully<00:00:52.590> unassembled<00:00:53.100> but

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
thing like fully unassembled but

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.939 
thing like fully unassembled but
essentially<00:00:54.180> right<00:00:54.510> there<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> adhesive

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
essentially right there is a adhesive

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.670 
essentially right there is a adhesive
and<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:57.000> suction<00:00:57.420> cup<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.989> adhesive<00:00:58.289> is

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
and a suction cup and the adhesive is

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.069 
and a suction cup and the adhesive is
like<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.489> washable<00:01:00.000> kind<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.510> when<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.899> take

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
like the washable kind so when you take

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.229 
like the washable kind so when you take
it<00:01:01.230> down<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.980> can<00:01:02.129> rinse<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.550> off<00:01:02.730> under<00:01:03.059> water

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
it down you can rinse it off under water

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.270 
it down you can rinse it off under water
to<00:01:03.480> reactivate<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.140> adhesive<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.860> then

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
to reactivate the adhesive and then

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.039 
to reactivate the adhesive and then
place<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.580> again<00:01:05.939> somewhere<00:01:06.330> else<00:01:06.390> now<00:01:06.810> that

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
place it again somewhere else now that

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.859 
place it again somewhere else now that
adhesive<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.950> super<00:01:08.640> strong<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.540> mean<00:01:09.720> it's

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
adhesive is super strong I mean it's

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.469 
adhesive is super strong I mean it's
like<00:01:10.020> Krazy<00:01:10.439> Glue<00:01:10.890> when<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.580> suck<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.119> to

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
like Krazy Glue when you suck it on to

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.320
