a special rule so that means the animals

a special rule so that means the animals
the<00:01:23.140> crabs<00:01:23.410> belong<00:01:23.770> to<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.100> game<00:01:24.280> which<00:01:24.910> means

the crabs belong to the game which means
if<00:01:25.869> a<00:01:26.080> crap<00:01:26.319> pushes<00:01:26.800> a<00:01:26.830> ball<00:01:27.100> into<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.520> hole

it's in but if you think this is bad it

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.050 
it's in but if you think this is bad it
gets<00:01:31.810> even<00:01:32.020> worse
