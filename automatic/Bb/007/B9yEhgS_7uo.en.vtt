00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
that's pretty nice so now he goes into

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.830 
that's pretty nice so now he goes into
his<00:01:01.500> own<00:01:01.920> Caesar<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.910> I'm<00:01:03.420> going<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.600> go<00:01:03.690> out

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
his own Caesar and I'm going to go out

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.980 
his own Caesar and I'm going to go out
into<00:01:04.080> Charizard<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:06.330> bullet<00:01:06.600> punch<00:01:06.780> is

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
into Charizard and the bullet punch is

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.109 
into Charizard and the bullet punch is
not<00:01:07.290> very<00:01:07.500> effective<00:01:07.710> obviously<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.700> I

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
not very effective obviously and I

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.880 
not very effective obviously and I
thought<00:01:09.330> he'd<00:01:09.510> switch<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> belly<00:01:10.350> drum<00:01:10.619> and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
thought he'd switch to a belly drum and

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.950 
thought he'd switch to a belly drum and
he<00:01:11.280> stays<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.670> I'm<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:11.909> crap<00:01:12.299> he<00:01:12.510> figured<00:01:12.840> out

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
he stays in I'm like crap he figured out

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.920 
he stays in I'm like crap he figured out
my<00:01:13.110> bluff<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.520> get<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> max<00:01:15.060> attack<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.659> I

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
my bluff so I get the max attack and I

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.780 
my bluff so I get the max attack and I
get<00:01:16.110> some<00:01:16.290> speed<00:01:16.560> boost<00:01:16.830> with<00:01:17.100> CELAC<00:01:17.490> berry

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
get some speed boost with CELAC berry

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.090 
get some speed boost with CELAC berry
but<00:01:18.540> thankfully<00:01:19.049> he<00:01:19.170> put<00:01:19.320> Tom<00:01:19.530> passes<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.040> I

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
but thankfully he put Tom passes so I

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.320 
but thankfully he put Tom passes so I
guess<00:01:20.250> he<00:01:20.369> wanted<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.610> see<00:01:20.700> what<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.850> would<00:01:21.119> do

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
guess he wanted to see what I would do

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.870 
guess he wanted to see what I would do
um<00:01:21.570> he<00:01:22.259> took<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.500> real<00:01:22.950> risk<00:01:23.009> there<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.700> he's

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
um he took a real risk there and he's

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.399 
um he took a real risk there and he's
lucky<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.180> didn't<00:01:24.420> go<00:01:24.540> for<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> fire<00:01:24.930> type<00:01:25.170> move

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
lucky I didn't go for the fire type move

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.770 
lucky I didn't go for the fire type move
but<00:01:26.220> he<00:01:26.280> goes<00:01:26.430> into<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.610> Vaporeon<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.390> +6

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
but he goes into a Vaporeon and a +6

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.719 
but he goes into a Vaporeon and a +6
attack<00:01:28.049> I'm<00:01:28.259> really<00:01:28.829> hoping<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.220> can<00:01:29.280> kill<00:01:29.610> this

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
attack I'm really hoping I can kill this

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.810 
attack I'm really hoping I can kill this
thing<00:01:29.970> with<00:01:30.240> earthquake<00:01:30.750> but<00:01:31.590> Vaporeon<00:01:32.430> you

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
thing with earthquake but Vaporeon you

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.120 
thing with earthquake but Vaporeon you
know<00:01:32.970> bulkiness<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.840> showing<00:01:34.079> off<00:01:34.200> once<00:01:34.799> again

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
know bulkiness is showing off once again

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.520 
know bulkiness is showing off once again
and<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.759> survives<00:01:36.119> my<00:01:36.390> earthquake<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.110> serves

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
and it survives my earthquake and serves

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.520 
and it survives my earthquake and serves
me<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.490> Charizard<00:01:39.479> didn't<00:01:40.140> do<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> whole<00:01:40.470> lot

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
with a Vaporeon and I go into claydol

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.190 
with a Vaporeon and I go into claydol
pretty<00:01:54.360> much<00:01:54.509> because<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.780> want<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:54.960> set<00:01:55.110> up

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
pretty much because I want to set up

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.469 
pretty much because I want to set up
stealth<00:01:55.470> rocks<00:01:55.850> but<00:01:56.850> here<00:01:57.060> I'm<00:01:57.180> going<00:01:57.360> to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
stealth rocks but here I'm going to

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.600 
stealth rocks but here I'm going to
actually<00:01:57.659> miss<00:01:58.110> click<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.590> meant<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.340> set<00:01:59.520> up

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
actually miss click I meant to set up

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.370 
actually miss click I meant to set up
stealth<00:01:59.880> rocks<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.479> instead<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.840> accidentally

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
stealth rocks but instead I accidentally

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.620 
stealth rocks but instead I accidentally
clicked<00:02:01.710> rapid<00:02:02.100> spin<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.000> rabbits<00:02:03.450> been

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
clicked rapid spin so I rabbits been

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.300 
clicked rapid spin so I rabbits been
here<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:03.960> that's<00:02:04.079> obviously<00:02:04.619> not<00:02:04.860> good<00:02:05.100> for

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
here and that's obviously not good for

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.920 
here and that's obviously not good for
me<00:02:05.460> because<00:02:05.670> there<00:02:06.119> was<00:02:06.240> really<00:02:06.270> no<00:02:06.689> reason

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
me because there was really no reason

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.219 
me because there was really no reason
for<00:02:07.079> me<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.290> rapid<00:02:07.710> spin<00:02:07.979> um<00:02:08.899> except<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.080> get

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
for me to rapid spin um except I get

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.979 
for me to rapid spin um except I get
minut<00:02:10.649> damage<00:02:11.039> on<00:02:11.280> Ninjask<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:12.390> um<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.810> makes

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
minut damage on Ninjask but um it makes

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.460 
minut damage on Ninjask but um it makes
up<00:02:13.200> for

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
up for

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.650 
up for
here<00:02:13.880> because<00:02:14.880> I<00:02:14.910> guess<00:02:15.150> he<00:02:15.270> predicted<00:02:15.570> to

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
here because I guess he predicted to

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.720 
here because I guess he predicted to
switch<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.110> went<00:02:16.230> for<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.440> sub<00:02:16.710> as<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.550> just

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
switch and went for the sub as I just

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.020 
switch and went for the sub as I just
set<00:02:18.090> up<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.270> stealth<00:02:18.510> rocks<00:02:18.780> now<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.470> yeah<00:02:20.310> so

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
set up the stealth rocks now and yeah so

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.030 
set up the stealth rocks now and yeah so
the<00:02:21.180> stealth<00:02:21.390> rocks<00:02:21.600> are<00:02:21.750> set<00:02:21.900> up<00:02:22.020> he<00:02:22.920> has<00:02:23.010> a

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
the stealth rocks are set up he has a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.090 
the stealth rocks are set up he has a
sub<00:02:23.520> up<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.000> tries<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.240> exes<00:02:24.660> were<00:02:24.780> me<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.200> he

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
sub up and tries to exes were me and he

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.260 
sub up and tries to exes were me and he
doesn't<00:02:26.310> quite<00:02:26.550> kill<00:02:26.760> me<00:02:26.850> which<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.060> good

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
doesn't quite kill me which is good

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.000 
doesn't quite kill me which is good
because<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.720> allows<00:02:28.080> me<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.320> break<00:02:28.590> his<00:02:28.770> sub

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
because that allows me to break his sub

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.910 
because that allows me to break his sub
with<00:02:29.190> Shadow<00:02:29.430> Ball<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.110> as<00:02:31.110> long<00:02:31.320> as<00:02:31.560> this

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
with Shadow Ball and as long as this

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.740 
with Shadow Ball and as long as this
ninja<00:02:32.310> doesn't<00:02:32.580> have<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.820> sub<00:02:33.210> when<00:02:33.390> my<00:02:33.510> clay

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
ninja doesn't have a sub when my clay

stealth<00:02:37.650> rocks<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.910> don't<00:02:39.900> think<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.500> have

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
stealth rocks I don't think I have

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.410

stealth rocks it's in case he sets it up
which<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:44.730> don't<00:02:44.910> think<00:02:45.090> even<00:02:45.330> has<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.720> because

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.350 
that's pretty much it my clay doll goes
down<00:03:01.140> but<00:03:01.860> um<00:03:02.070> good<00:03:02.700> thing<00:03:02.880> he<00:03:03.030> doesn't<00:03:03.060> have<00:03:03.330> a

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
down but um good thing he doesn't have a

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.850 
down but um good thing he doesn't have a
sub<00:03:03.630> because<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.080> means<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.380> can<00:03:04.530> just<00:03:04.709> go

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
sub because that means I can just go

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.160 
sub because that means I can just go
into<00:03:05.040> Caesar<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.970> bullet<00:03:06.570> punch<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.930> for<00:03:07.080> the

ko you could have switched out I don't

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.170 
ko you could have switched out I don't
really<00:03:10.380> know<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:10.950> guess<00:03:11.190> he<00:03:11.730> was<00:03:11.820> trying<00:03:11.850> to
