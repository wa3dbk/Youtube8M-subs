00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.950
 hello everyone today we will spawn 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:11.880
 walked the store came across here on such 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:16.109
 the game is capelin roe once it was sold 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:20.039
 ice cream already and how much she herself 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:23.369
 I began to use it from bullets 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:27.449
 just lay in the fridge 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.330
 melted away, and yesterday I quit survived and his 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.579
 usually the refrigerator compartment and here it is 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.120
 we have unfrozen gently 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.510
 neatly and get such a crust 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.660
 here we are we salt for it 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.190
 in order to pickle it we will need 2 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.329
 tablespoons of coarse salt not 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:56.520
 iodized 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:01:00.120
 on a liter of water we can take a quarrel 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.730
 put more of course but two spoons 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.820
 enough if you take a half liter 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:13.430
 water and it means 3 spoons pour it 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.430
 made some water blew up 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:30.470
 stir and set to 1 and we 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:30.470
 boil we need boiling water until our 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:37.909
 a vessel that will salt it and 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:41.400
 cover gauze here gauze in two layers 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:45.440
 to cling 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.440
 and here we will lay out our game 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.550
 happy nenko 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.010
 here you go 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.540
 and the crust laid out 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.380
 and now we are waiting for the water to boil and 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:38.630
 pour our caviar boiling water draw your 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:44.000
 attention that exactly boiling water is needed 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:47.400
 here and stir it well 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:56.840
 so that each egg we have soap with 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:03:02.370
 boiling water to avoid lumps all 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:05.430
 leave for about five minutes with us 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.120
 Caviar, in principle, clean from the store 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.910
 therefore this procedure can be done in total 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.010
 but itâ€™s better to do two times 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.140
 have five minutes we will wait and then 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.230
 change my water we can wash three 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.330
 times of thought are pure and good play 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.140
 once was enough just buried 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:32.120
 boiling water and 10-15 minutes so that she 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:40.519
 I swam but just in case 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:40.519
 twice about my beauty 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.150
 five minutes have passed we are now 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:03.650
 vodichku merge in principle , we have not 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:08.150
 dirty neat survived it and when 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:13.150
 can be a second time and not fill well 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.150
 so I cooked boiling water I envy 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.770
 everything 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:39.169
 leave for 10 minutes and then 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:44.240
 water, you also want to peel and crust yes 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.240
 well, I'll sprinkle a couple of spoons 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:58.150
 That's the kind of beauty we get all 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:03.640
 waiting for 10-15 minutes well, here we have passed 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:08.230
 ten minutes and now we reach ours 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:14.020
 the edges here this time the water will be seen 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:18.160
 or not quite transparent slightly she 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:25.140
 stained but transparent ie second 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:27.090
 since all the same, it is desirable to drain all the water 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.890
 our game 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:34.210
 leave a little thing on the glass and 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:40.240
 so cold a colt 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:43.210
 the colander is now slightly cooled and and in 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.620
 a jar and in the fridge for a couple of hours 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:50.220
 to cool 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.220
 we can try it right now 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.659
 not hedgehogs 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.139
 say so tasteless I myself surf 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:08.449
