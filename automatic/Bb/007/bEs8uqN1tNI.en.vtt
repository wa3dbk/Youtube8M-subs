four colors and all of the other color

four colors and all of the other color
were<00:02:14.340> either<00:02:14.610> too<00:02:14.940> dark<00:02:15.180> or<00:02:15.420> too<00:02:15.660> yellowy<00:02:15.990> and

I've gone for a pink one which is

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.180 
I've gone for a pink one which is

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
unusual because all of the other ones I

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.120 
unusual because all of the other ones I
think<00:02:20.490> are<00:02:20.790> pretty<00:02:21.030> much<00:02:21.330> yellow<00:02:21.840> based<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.830> I

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
and powders and etc so it's unusual for

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.160 
and powders and etc so it's unusual for
me<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.090> go<00:02:30.210> for<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.450> pink<00:02:30.630> one<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:31.050> this

impressed with it I'll give you a little

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.860 
impressed with it I'll give you a little
swatch<00:03:14.850> of<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:16.820> that's<00:03:17.820> what<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.090> looks<00:03:18.269> like

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
swatch of it that's what it looks like

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.370 
swatch of it that's what it looks like
so<00:03:19.140> whether<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.380> can<00:03:19.500> even<00:03:19.650> see<00:03:19.890> that<00:03:19.920> can<00:03:20.340> you

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
so whether you can even see that can you

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.920 
so whether you can even see that can you
see<00:03:22.380> that<00:03:22.880> it<00:03:23.880> looks<00:03:23.910> very<00:03:24.090> skin<00:03:24.540> colored<00:03:24.810> it

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
see that it looks very skin colored it

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.570 
see that it looks very skin colored it
actually<00:03:25.320> looks<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.650> lot<00:03:25.830> brighter<00:03:26.100> on<00:03:26.550> the

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
actually looks a lot brighter on the

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.640 
actually looks a lot brighter on the
skin<00:03:26.970> than<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.239> does<00:03:27.420> on<00:03:27.600> my<00:03:27.750> hands<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.440> it

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
skin than it does on my hands and it

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.080 
skin than it does on my hands and it
looked<00:03:28.830> a<00:03:28.920> lot<00:03:29.070> brighter<00:03:29.280> in<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.580> shop<00:03:29.880> as

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
looked a lot brighter in the shop as

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.910 
looked a lot brighter in the shop as
well<00:03:30.269> what<00:03:30.959> you<00:03:31.080> won't<00:03:31.290> be<00:03:31.440> able<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.650> see<00:03:31.800> on

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
well what you won't be able to see on

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.009 
well what you won't be able to see on
camera<00:03:31.950> is<00:03:32.459> that<00:03:32.489> it's<00:03:32.820> got<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.330> little<00:03:33.570> bit<00:03:33.810> of

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
camera is that it's got a little bit of

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.050 
camera is that it's got a little bit of
luminosity<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.830> it<00:03:35.040> which<00:03:35.640> is<00:03:35.790> funny<00:03:35.970> because

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
luminosity to it which is funny because

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.670 
luminosity to it which is funny because
it's<00:03:36.360> called<00:03:36.540> luminous<00:03:36.959> one<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.230> think<00:03:37.410> they've

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
it's called luminous one I think they've

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.979 
it's called luminous one I think they've
all<00:03:37.800> got<00:03:37.980> say<00:03:38.280> luminous<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.510> it's<00:03:39.750> good

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
all got say luminous and it's good

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.090 
all got say luminous and it's good
because<00:03:40.320> it's<00:03:40.470> not<00:03:41.420> there's<00:03:42.420> no<00:03:42.769> Sheen<00:03:43.769> or

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
because it's not there's no Sheen or

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.000 
because it's not there's no Sheen or
shimmer<00:03:44.459> or<00:03:44.790> anything<00:03:45.090> like<00:03:45.390> that<00:03:45.450> it's<00:03:45.810> just

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
shimmer or anything like that it's just

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.210 
shimmer or anything like that it's just
luminous

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
luminous

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.979 
luminous
so<00:03:47.610> there's<00:03:47.850> obviously<00:03:47.910> something<00:03:48.510> in<00:03:48.840> it

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
so there's obviously something in it

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.140 
so there's obviously something in it
that<00:03:49.170> just<00:03:49.500> does<00:03:49.769> really<00:03:50.160> brighten<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.730> area

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
that just does really brighten the area

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.180 
that just does really brighten the area
now<00:03:51.660> I<00:03:51.900> don't<00:03:51.989> think<00:03:52.410> on<00:03:52.560> camera<00:03:52.920> you'll<00:03:53.070> be

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
now I don't think on camera you'll be

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.710 
now I don't think on camera you'll be
able<00:03:53.310> to<00:03:53.519> see<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.820> difference<00:03:54.209> between<00:03:54.239> the

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
able to see the difference between the

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.690 
able to see the difference between the
two<00:03:54.870> eyes<00:03:55.050> but<00:03:55.080> I<00:03:55.440> did<00:03:55.709> definitely<00:03:55.980> notice

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
two eyes but I did definitely notice

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.280 
two eyes but I did definitely notice
that<00:03:56.820> I<00:03:56.880> felt<00:03:57.180> like<00:03:57.360> this<00:03:57.540> one<00:03:57.780> was<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:57.989> lot

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
that I felt like this one was a lot

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.699 
that I felt like this one was a lot
brighter<00:03:59.510> it's<00:04:00.510> lasted<00:04:01.019> all<00:04:01.140> day<00:04:01.320> like<00:04:01.530> I<00:04:01.620> said

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
brighter it's lasted all day like I said

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.750 
brighter it's lasted all day like I said
I<00:04:01.769> put<00:04:02.010> this<00:04:02.160> on<00:04:02.430> at<00:04:04.250> 6<00:04:05.250> o'clock<00:04:05.459> this<00:04:05.640> morning

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
I put this on at 6 o'clock this morning

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.600 
I put this on at 6 o'clock this morning
and<00:04:06.330> it<00:04:06.420> is<00:04:06.450> now<00:04:06.720> 20<00:04:07.230> to<00:04:07.350> 6<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:07.890> it<00:04:08.310> hasn't

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
and it is now 20 to 6 and it hasn't

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.770 
and it is now 20 to 6 and it hasn't
moved<00:04:09.120> barely<00:04:10.019> at<00:04:10.140> all<00:04:10.790> it<00:04:11.790> hasn't<00:04:12.060> caked<00:04:12.420> it

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
moved barely at all it hasn't caked it

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.870 
moved barely at all it hasn't caked it
hasn't<00:04:13.170> made<00:04:13.380> my<00:04:13.590> lines<00:04:13.980> noticeable<00:04:14.670> and

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
hasn't made my lines noticeable and

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.460 
hasn't made my lines noticeable and
neither<00:04:15.150> as<00:04:15.390> it<00:04:15.510> disappeared<00:04:15.989> so<00:04:16.200> I'm<00:04:16.320> really

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
neither as it disappeared so I'm really

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.630 
neither as it disappeared so I'm really
really<00:04:16.620> impressed<00:04:16.890> with<00:04:17.250> this<00:04:17.400> and<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:17.580> do

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
really impressed with this and I do

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.940 
really impressed with this and I do
think<00:04:17.940> it's<00:04:18.060> worth<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.390> money<00:04:18.419> I<00:04:18.840> can't<00:04:19.739> say

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
think it's worth the money I can't say

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.120 
think it's worth the money I can't say
that<00:04:20.100> this<00:04:20.190> will<00:04:20.340> be<00:04:20.489> a<00:04:20.519> repurchase<00:04:20.970> because

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
that this will be a repurchase because

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.440 
that this will be a repurchase because
as<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.280> said<00:04:23.460> I'm<00:04:23.580> still<00:04:23.820> in<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.000> middle<00:04:24.210> of<00:04:24.270> my

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
as I said I'm still in the middle of my

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.000 
as I said I'm still in the middle of my
research<00:04:24.780> for<00:04:24.840> all<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.200> other<00:04:25.350> concealer

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
research for all the other concealer

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.680 
research for all the other concealer
and<00:04:26.160> until<00:04:26.790> I<00:04:26.910> get<00:04:27.150> through<00:04:27.360> them<00:04:27.510> all<00:04:27.660> and

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
and until I get through them all and

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.380 
and until I get through them all and
maybe<00:04:28.020> try<00:04:28.410> ones<00:04:29.190> that<00:04:29.400> I<00:04:29.430> feel<00:04:29.820> like<00:04:29.850> haven't

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
maybe try ones that I feel like haven't

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.580 
maybe try ones that I feel like haven't
worked<00:04:30.540> I'll<00:04:30.810> maybe<00:04:30.960> try<00:04:31.260> them<00:04:31.440> with<00:04:31.560> a

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
worked I'll maybe try them with a

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.250 
worked I'll maybe try them with a
lighter<00:04:31.860> hand<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:32.670> you<00:04:33.510> know<00:04:33.630> see<00:04:33.840> how<00:04:33.870> I<00:04:34.020> got

enjoying this and I'm really impressed

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.460 
enjoying this and I'm really impressed
with<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.960> other<00:04:40.080> thing<00:04:40.170> I<00:04:40.350> would<00:04:40.410> say

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
with it the other thing I would say

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.230

coverage<00:04:42.630> like<00:04:43.380> I<00:04:43.410> said<00:04:43.650> I<00:04:43.710> don't<00:04:43.830> have<00:04:43.980> dark

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.690 
circles no so I'm not a hundred percent
sure<00:04:46.170> that<00:04:46.290> it<00:04:46.530> would<00:04:46.650> cover<00:04:46.860> dark<00:04:47.160> circles

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
sure that it would cover dark circles

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.930 
sure that it would cover dark circles
but<00:04:48.420> when<00:04:49.230> I<00:04:49.260> put<00:04:49.530> it<00:04:49.620> on<00:04:49.800> it<00:04:50.070> covers<00:04:50.580> the

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
but when I put it on it covers the

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.310 
but when I put it on it covers the
little<00:04:51.060> freckles<00:04:51.600> that<00:04:51.690> I<00:04:51.840> have<00:04:52.050> under<00:04:52.290> my

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
little freckles that I have under my

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.740 
little freckles that I have under my
eyes<00:04:52.590> it<00:04:53.430> more<00:04:53.850> or<00:04:54.000> less<00:04:54.150> covers<00:04:54.570> them

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
eyes it more or less covers them

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.380 
eyes it more or less covers them
completely<00:04:55.350> and<00:04:56.130> so<00:04:56.370> it's<00:04:56.520> very<00:04:56.700> opaque<00:04:57.120> when

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
completely and so it's very opaque when

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.930 
completely and so it's very opaque when
it<00:04:57.480> goes<00:04:57.630> on<00:04:57.840> with<00:04:57.870> only<00:04:58.290> a<00:04:58.470> light<00:04:58.740> layer<00:04:59.010> which

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
it goes on with only a light layer which

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.970 
it goes on with only a light layer which
is<00:05:00.180> why<00:05:00.480> I<00:05:00.510> really<00:05:00.900> as<00:05:01.200> soon<00:05:01.350> as<00:05:01.500> I<00:05:01.590> put<00:05:01.770> it<00:05:01.860> on<00:05:01.950> I

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
is why I really as soon as I put it on I

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.470 
is why I really as soon as I put it on I
thought<00:05:02.220> oh<00:05:02.280> this<00:05:02.520> is<00:05:02.700> gonna<00:05:02.880> you<00:05:03.090> know<00:05:03.240> I'm
