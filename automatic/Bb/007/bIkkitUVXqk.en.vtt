rocket<00:02:04.409> scientist<00:02:05.159> dreams<00:02:05.940> you<00:02:06.210> set<00:02:06.450> out<00:02:06.479> when

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
rocket scientist dreams you set out when

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:09.290 
rocket scientist dreams you set out when
you<00:02:07.020> are<00:02:07.050> little<00:02:07.409> child<00:02:07.679> I<00:02:08.039> didn't<00:02:08.580> quite<00:02:08.819> you

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
you are little child I didn't quite you

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.180 
you are little child I didn't quite you
know<00:02:09.420> set<00:02:09.750> out<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.080> say<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.440> I'm<00:02:10.649> going<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.100> be

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
know set out to say that I'm going to be

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.550 
know set out to say that I'm going to be
a<00:02:11.250> scientist<00:02:12.030> it's<00:02:12.269> just<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.230> knew<00:02:13.530> I

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
a scientist it's just that I knew I

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.319 
a scientist it's just that I knew I
wanted<00:02:13.799> to<00:02:14.010> do<00:02:14.100> something<00:02:14.310> with<00:02:14.640> technology

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
wanted to do something with technology

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.420 
wanted to do something with technology
and<00:02:15.540> so<00:02:15.989> I<00:02:16.019> just<00:02:16.380> kept<00:02:16.590> taking<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.340> know

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
and so I just kept taking you know

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.150 
and so I just kept taking you know
different<00:02:17.730> math<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.030> science<00:02:18.360> classes<00:02:19.160> and

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
different math and science classes and

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.300 
different math and science classes and
as<00:02:20.820> each<00:02:21.299> opportunity<00:02:21.989> came<00:02:22.530> up<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:23.070> led<00:02:23.280> to

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
as each opportunity came up and led to

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.220 
as each opportunity came up and led to
the<00:02:23.459> other<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.570> different<00:02:24.959> from

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
the other is it a different from

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.350 
the other is it a different from
launching<00:02:25.739> satellites<00:02:25.950> into<00:02:26.459> space<00:02:26.670> and

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
launching satellites into space and

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.990 
launching satellites into space and
launching<00:02:28.170> your<00:02:28.290> own<00:02:28.500> company<00:02:29.130> it's<00:02:29.730> very

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
launching your own company it's very

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.210 
launching your own company it's very
actually<00:02:30.480> a<00:02:30.510> lot<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.840> principles<00:02:31.019> that<00:02:31.590> I

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
actually a lot of the principles that I

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.100 
actually a lot of the principles that I
employed<00:02:32.700> launching<00:02:33.269> satellites<00:02:33.480> into<00:02:33.959> space

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
employed launching satellites into space

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.560 
employed launching satellites into space
in<00:02:34.620> terms<00:02:34.799> of<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.100> planning<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:36.180> requires

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
in terms of the planning it requires

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.210 
in terms of the planning it requires
very<00:02:36.840> meticulous<00:02:37.440> planning<00:02:37.829> and<00:02:38.130> attention

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
very meticulous planning and attention

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.670 
very meticulous planning and attention
to<00:02:38.700> detail<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.510> coming<00:02:40.110> up<00:02:40.260> with<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.440> lot<00:02:40.650> of

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
to detail and coming up with a lot of

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.910 
to detail and coming up with a lot of
backup<00:02:40.950> plans<00:02:41.400> etc<00:02:42.269> so<00:02:42.750> all<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.230> applies

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
backup plans etc so all of that applies

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.759 
backup plans etc so all of that applies
now<00:02:44.549> to<00:02:44.610> launch<00:02:45.329> into<00:02:45.600> business<00:02:45.930> as<00:02:46.110> well<00:02:46.290> you

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
now to launch into business as well you

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.250 
now to launch into business as well you
are<00:02:46.920> an<00:02:47.070> expert<00:02:47.430> on<00:02:47.670> digital<00:02:48.150> media<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:49.049> what

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
are an expert on digital media so what

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.050 
are an expert on digital media so what
do<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.470> think<00:02:49.739> so<00:02:49.980> future<00:02:50.400> me<00:02:50.430> there<00:02:50.730> will<00:02:51.030> be

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
do you think so future me there will be

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.210 
do you think so future me there will be
I<00:02:51.450> think<00:02:51.900> definitely<00:02:52.079> you<00:02:52.739> know<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:52.950> future

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
I think definitely you know the future

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.970 
I think definitely you know the future
of<00:02:53.609> media<00:02:53.820> is<00:02:54.299> mobile<00:02:54.840> mobile<00:02:55.680> applications

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
of media is mobile mobile applications

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.009 
of media is mobile mobile applications
then<00:02:57.159> maybe<00:02:57.430> even<00:02:57.879> in<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.330> further<00:02:58.659> future

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
then maybe even in the further future

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.229 
then maybe even in the further future
we're<00:02:59.379> going<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.620> see<00:02:59.739> more<00:03:00.280> mobile<00:03:01.209> devices

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
we're going to see more mobile devices

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.990 
we're going to see more mobile devices
such<00:03:02.110> as<00:03:02.310> having<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:03.640> know<00:03:03.730> maybe<00:03:03.909> a

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
such as having you know maybe a

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.660 
such as having you know maybe a
wristwatch<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:04.569> also<00:03:05.080> sub<00:03:05.680> says<00:03:06.010> your

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
wristwatch that also sub says your

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.899 
wristwatch that also sub says your
mobile<00:03:07.060> phone<00:03:07.769> also<00:03:08.769> recently<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.730> with<00:03:09.879> a

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
mobile phone also recently that with a

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.050 
mobile phone also recently that with a
2010<00:03:10.720> Nobel<00:03:11.080> Peace<00:03:11.319> Prize<00:03:11.650> in<00:03:12.400> Physics<00:03:12.700> which

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
2010 Nobel Peace Prize in Physics which

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.190 
2010 Nobel Peace Prize in Physics which
was<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.360> graphene<00:03:13.840> which<00:03:14.470> is<00:03:14.799> a<00:03:14.830> one<00:03:15.370> atom

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
was the graphene which is a one atom

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.229 
was the graphene which is a one atom
sheet<00:03:17.200> which<00:03:17.799> allows<00:03:18.190> for<00:03:18.220> a<00:03:18.489> lot<00:03:18.819> of<00:03:19.000> options

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
sheet which allows for a lot of options

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.199 
sheet which allows for a lot of options
so<00:03:19.750> we're<00:03:19.900> going<00:03:20.049> to<00:03:20.170> see<00:03:20.379> a<00:03:20.410> lot<00:03:20.560> of<00:03:20.590> thinner

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
so we're going to see a lot of thinner

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.199 
so we're going to see a lot of thinner
smaller<00:03:22.209> devices<00:03:23.200> so<00:03:23.530> I<00:03:23.769> think<00:03:24.280> that<00:03:24.790> you<00:03:25.120> know

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
smaller devices so I think that you know

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.449 
smaller devices so I think that you know
the<00:03:25.420> future<00:03:25.750> is<00:03:26.260> going<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.829> be<00:03:26.890> just<00:03:27.040> wearable

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
the future is going to be just wearable

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.000 
the future is going to be just wearable
technology<00:03:28.120> where<00:03:28.450> your<00:03:28.989> contact<00:03:29.500> lenses<00:03:29.950> are

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
technology where your contact lenses are

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.400 
technology where your contact lenses are
going<00:03:30.370> to<00:03:30.519> serve<00:03:30.730> as<00:03:31.030> your<00:03:31.390> alarm<00:03:31.780> clock<00:03:31.959> and

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
going to serve as your alarm clock and

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.130 
going to serve as your alarm clock and
you<00:03:33.069> know<00:03:33.220> your<00:03:33.519> search<00:03:33.790> engine<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.480> so<00:03:34.660> on

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
you know your search engine and so on

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.280 
you know your search engine and so on
American<00:03:35.769> media<00:03:35.920> named<00:03:36.370> us<00:03:36.819> one<00:03:37.120> of<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.480> 100

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
American media named us one of the 100

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.009 
American media named us one of the 100
and<00:03:38.640> history<00:03:39.640> makers<00:03:40.060> things<00:03:40.269> are<00:03:40.420> making<00:03:40.569> so

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
and history makers things are making so

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.420 
and history makers things are making so
what<00:03:41.230> do<00:03:41.319> you<00:03:41.410> think<00:03:41.650> some<00:03:41.920> factors

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
what do you think some factors

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.020 
what do you think some factors
contribute<00:03:43.329> to<00:03:43.390> your<00:03:43.750> success<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.980> think<00:03:45.160> the

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
contribute to your success I think the

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.569 
contribute to your success I think the
three<00:03:46.900> factors<00:03:47.319> that<00:03:47.799> I<00:03:48.040> believe<00:03:48.340> have

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
three factors that I believe have

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.660 
three factors that I believe have
