00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.350 
fix a screen flicker issue with the ATI
graphics<00:00:06.980> cards<00:00:07.980> I'm<00:00:08.460> not<00:00:08.580> sure<00:00:08.730> which<00:00:08.880> series

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
graphics cards I'm not sure which series

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.690 
graphics cards I'm not sure which series
this<00:00:09.570> works<00:00:09.840> on<00:00:10.050> but<00:00:10.200> as<00:00:10.349> you<00:00:10.500> can<00:00:10.590> see

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
this works on but as you can see

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.690 
this works on but as you can see
whenever<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:11.790> move<00:00:12.139> this<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:14.009> flickers<00:00:14.429> at<00:00:14.610> the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
whenever I move this it flickers at the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.179 
whenever I move this it flickers at the
top<00:00:15.529> it's<00:00:16.529> been<00:00:16.770> worse<00:00:17.010> if<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:18.920> hook<00:00:19.920> up<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
top it's been worse if I hook up the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.120 
top it's been worse if I hook up the
monitor<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.300> different<00:00:21.840> port<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
monitor to a different port in the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.710 
monitor to a different port in the
graphics<00:00:23.550> cards<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.119> that's<00:00:24.300> why<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.600> only

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
graphics cards so that's why it's only

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.560 
graphics cards so that's why it's only
at<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.900> top<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.590> also<00:00:26.010> just<00:00:26.310> went<00:00:26.519> crossfire<00:00:27.090> so

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
at the top I also just went crossfire so

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.490 
at the top I also just went crossfire so
this<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.230> when<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.500> started<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.949> happen<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.400> me

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
this is when it started to happen to me

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.580 
this is when it started to happen to me
but<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.560> found<00:00:31.859> out<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.189> forum<00:00:32.669> which<00:00:33.590> works

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
but I found out on a forum which works

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.650 
but I found out on a forum which works
perfectly<00:00:34.910> so<00:00:35.910> I'm<00:00:36.149> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> show<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.510> how

to fix it so you have to do you have to
open<00:00:40.739> up<00:00:40.829> pot<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> catalyst<00:00:41.760> control

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
open up pot of the catalyst control

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.380 
open up pot of the catalyst control

center so you have it up you go to

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.850 
center so you have it up you go to
options<00:00:46.250> you<00:00:47.250> go<00:00:47.399> profiles<00:00:48.350> your<00:00:49.350> profile

is<00:00:53.640> we're<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.910> create<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.239> new<00:00:54.329> one<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.510> I

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
is we're going to create a new one so I

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.880 
is we're going to create a new one so I
already<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:55.620> one<00:00:55.770> created<00:00:55.800> but<00:00:56.430> right<00:00:57.329> in

and personalization

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.899 
and personalization
there<00:01:36.990> we<00:01:37.079> go<00:01:37.200> show<00:01:37.500> hidden<00:01:37.710> files<00:01:37.909> where

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
there we go show hidden files where

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.200 
there we go show hidden files where
there's<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.570> folder<00:01:40.079> option<00:01:40.970> once<00:01:41.970> we're

test<00:05:25.740> pilot<00:05:26.660> exit<00:05:27.660> that<00:05:27.870> and<00:05:30.890> we<00:05:31.890> are<00:05:32.010> fixed

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
test pilot exit that and we are fixed

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.710 
test pilot exit that and we are fixed
and<00:05:32.750> the<00:05:33.750> reason<00:05:34.080> because<00:05:34.470> this<00:05:34.710> happens<00:05:35.720> we

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
and the reason because this happens we

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.510 
and the reason because this happens we
can<00:05:36.870> open<00:05:36.990> it<00:05:37.230> up<00:05:37.350> again<00:05:37.650> is<00:05:38.270> because<00:05:39.350> ETI<00:05:40.520> they

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
can open it up again is because ETI they

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.040 
can open it up again is because ETI they
have<00:05:41.730> set<00:05:42.090> the<00:05:43.640> current<00:05:44.640> like<00:05:44.970> the<00:05:45.210> idle<00:05:45.600> temps

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
have set the current like the idle temps

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.560 
have set the current like the idle temps
through<00:05:46.350> the<00:05:46.500> idle<00:05:46.890> speeds<00:05:47.370> really<00:05:48.180> really

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
through the idle speeds really really

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.570 
through the idle speeds really really
low<00:05:48.780> and<00:05:49.020> that's<00:05:49.440> what<00:05:49.620> makes<00:05:49.830> it<00:05:49.950> happen<00:05:50.340> so

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
low and that's what makes it happen so

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.550 
low and that's what makes it happen so
we're<00:05:50.820> setting<00:05:51.060> it<00:05:51.270> to<00:05:51.480> four<00:05:51.870> thousand<00:05:52.380> and

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
we're setting it to four thousand and

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.460 
we're setting it to four thousand and
nine<00:05:52.770> or<00:05:53.490> sorry<00:05:53.730> four<00:05:54.000> hundred<00:05:54.330> and<00:05:54.480> nine

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
nine or sorry four hundred and nine

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.070 
nine or sorry four hundred and nine
hundred<00:05:55.860> megahertz<00:05:56.160> for<00:05:56.550> core<00:05:56.940> or<00:05:57.330> GPU<00:05:57.750> and

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
hundred megahertz for core or GPU and

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.830 
hundred megahertz for core or GPU and
then<00:05:58.200> the<00:05:59.070> memory<00:05:59.310> and<00:05:59.580> that's<00:05:59.970> that<00:06:00.390> fixes<00:06:00.810> it

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
then the memory and that's that fixes it

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.950 
then the memory and that's that fixes it
so<00:06:01.380> I<00:06:01.410> hope<00:06:01.560> this<00:06:01.710> helped<00:06:01.920> you<00:06:02.040> guys<00:06:02.870> give<00:06:03.870> me

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
so I hope this helped you guys give me

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.220 
so I hope this helped you guys give me
