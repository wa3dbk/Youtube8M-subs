00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.839
 I am not 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.029
 yes 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.599
 and we are going to prepare ping lemonade or 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:20.509
 pink lemonade the ingredients that 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:23.570
 we need are 100 milliliters of juice 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:26.509
 of lemon 100 grams of sugar 500 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:30.630
 milliliters of water 60 milliliters of juice 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:33.480
 of blueberries ice and slices of lemon 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.640
 squeeze the lemons until you get 10 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.399
 milliliters of juice 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.390
 we put it on or we can leave it without straining 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.820
 that's how we prefer 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.640
 in a saucepan we are going to put the juice of 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.640
 lemon sugar and water 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.780
 and we're going to put it on high heat until 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.780
 that starts to boil 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.790
 once it has started to boil what 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.890
 let's leave like that one minute on fire more 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.810
 low 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.390
 and then we remove it from the fire and 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.460
 we have to let it cool completely 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.460
 once it is cold we add the 60 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.710
 milliliters of cranberry juice 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.690
 we mix and we pass it to a jar 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.610
 we will keep it in the fridge until 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.980
 the time to serve 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.510
 when we go to serve we put some 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.510
 how many ice cubes in the glass 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.700
 we put a slice of lemon to each 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.700
 glass 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.740
 and a straw and ready we have our 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.670
