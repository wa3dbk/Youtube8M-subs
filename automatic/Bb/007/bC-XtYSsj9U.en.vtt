00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
bar that just helped the chassis give a

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.170

which<00:04:27.080> is<00:04:27.230> a<00:04:27.380> bit<00:04:27.560> annoying<00:04:27.980> because

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
which is a bit annoying because

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.130 
which is a bit annoying because
sometimes<00:04:28.850> you<00:04:28.970> feel<00:04:29.120> like<00:04:29.210> you're<00:04:29.540> you're<00:04:30.080> in

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
sometimes you feel like you're you're in

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.770 
sometimes you feel like you're you're in
control<00:04:30.470> when<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:30.920> car<00:04:31.100> says<00:04:31.310> you're<00:04:31.490> not

control when the car says you're not
we're<00:04:32.780> surprised<00:04:33.200> that<00:04:33.410> the<00:04:33.500> limiting<00:04:33.950> factor

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
we're surprised that the limiting factor

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.010 
we're surprised that the limiting factor
on<00:04:34.400> this<00:04:34.550> car<00:04:34.730> isn't<00:04:35.210> really<00:04:35.450> the<00:04:35.570> brakes<00:04:35.840> or

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
on this car isn't really the brakes or

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.450 
on this car isn't really the brakes or
tires<00:04:36.200> and<00:04:36.380> that<00:04:36.440> usually<00:04:36.680> is<00:04:36.980> true<00:04:37.220> with<00:04:37.370> any

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
tires and that usually is true with any

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.580 
tires and that usually is true with any
street<00:04:38.180> car<00:04:38.390> no<00:04:38.540> matter<00:04:38.690> what<00:04:38.930> the<00:04:39.050> type<00:04:39.230> it

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
street car no matter what the type it

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.050 
street car no matter what the type it
really<00:04:39.950> is<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.280> fact<00:04:40.490> that<00:04:40.580> believes<00:04:40.940> that

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
really is the fact that believes that

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.909 
really is the fact that believes that
engine<00:04:41.419> cooler<00:04:41.630> and<00:04:42.260> if<00:04:42.380> we<00:04:42.470> can<00:04:42.590> get<00:04:42.710> that<00:04:42.800> in

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
engine cooler and if we can get that in

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.890 
engine cooler and if we can get that in
this<00:04:43.010> car<00:04:43.250> or<00:04:43.640> an<00:04:43.730> aftermarket<00:04:44.090> version<00:04:44.570> it's

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
this car or an aftermarket version it's

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.090 
this car or an aftermarket version it's
definitely<00:04:45.320> worth<00:04:45.470> it<00:04:45.590> we<00:04:45.710> wouldn't<00:04:46.010> write

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
definitely worth it we wouldn't write

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.320 
definitely worth it we wouldn't write
the<00:04:46.190> car<00:04:46.340> off<00:04:46.430> because<00:04:46.580> of<00:04:46.820> it<00:04:46.910> it's<00:04:47.060> a<00:04:47.120> shame

the car off because of it it's a shame
it<00:04:47.540> doesn't<00:04:47.630> have<00:04:47.900> it<00:04:48.020> but<00:04:48.440> if<00:04:48.919> you<00:04:49.340> know<00:04:49.460> you

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
it doesn't have it but if you know you

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.070

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
about forty five hundred more than sort

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.190 
about forty five hundred more than sort
of<00:05:00.590> a<00:05:00.680> fully<00:05:01.010> upgraded<00:05:01.669> version<00:05:02.120> of<00:05:02.270> the<00:05:02.480> Z<00:05:02.690> it

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
of a fully upgraded version of the Z it

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.320 
of a fully upgraded version of the Z it
is<00:05:03.260> ten<00:05:03.740> thousand<00:05:04.280> more<00:05:04.430> than<00:05:04.669> a<00:05:04.700> base<00:05:05.030> model

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
is ten thousand more than a base model

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.600 
is ten thousand more than a base model
of<00:05:05.570> the<00:05:05.660> car<00:05:05.870> so<00:05:06.260> it's<00:05:06.470> a<00:05:06.590> pretty<00:05:06.830> big<00:05:07.100> upgrade

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
of the car so it's a pretty big upgrade

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.670 
of the car so it's a pretty big upgrade
but<00:05:07.760> you<00:05:07.910> really<00:05:08.330> do<00:05:08.600> get<00:05:08.840> a<00:05:08.900> lot<00:05:09.110> of<00:05:09.230> stuff<00:05:09.470> and

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
but you really do get a lot of stuff and

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.200 
but you really do get a lot of stuff and
as<00:05:09.890> we've<00:05:10.040> seen<00:05:10.190> on<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.460> track<00:05:10.669> it's<00:05:10.910> a<00:05:11.000> pretty

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
as we've seen on the track it's a pretty

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.030 
as we've seen on the track it's a pretty
significant<00:05:11.780> difference<00:05:11.930> especially<00:05:12.680> even

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.040 
significant difference especially even

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.530 
significant difference especially even
with<00:05:13.160> some<00:05:13.460> simple<00:05:13.790> things<00:05:14.000> like<00:05:14.120> the<00:05:14.330> wheels

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
with some simple things like the wheels

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.390 
with some simple things like the wheels
and<00:05:14.690> tires<00:05:14.750> and<00:05:15.050> of<00:05:15.320> course<00:05:15.620> those<00:05:15.830> big<00:05:16.100> brakes

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
and tires and of course those big brakes

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.780 
and tires and of course those big brakes
but<00:05:17.330> if<00:05:17.479> you<00:05:17.600> do<00:05:17.780> want<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.050> 317<00:05:19.040> is<00:05:19.220> MOSI

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
but if you do want the 317 is MOSI

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.730
