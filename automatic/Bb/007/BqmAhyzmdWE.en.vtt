00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.640 
tell once you get used to the two
motions<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.710> 1<00:01:57.920> &amp;<00:01:58.190> 2<00:01:58.460> 1<00:01:59.060> &amp;<00:01:59.120> 2<00:01:59.660> you<00:02:00.200> can<00:02:00.380> start

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
motions the 1 &amp; 2 1 &amp; 2 you can start

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.770 
motions the 1 &amp; 2 1 &amp; 2 you can start
smoothening<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.460> movement<00:02:02.030> out<00:02:02.180> and<00:02:02.420> turning

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
smoothening the movement out and turning

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.050 
smoothening the movement out and turning
it<00:02:02.900> into<00:02:03.050> the<00:02:03.410> wave<00:02:03.860> type<00:02:04.310> of<00:02:04.460> movement<00:02:04.850> so

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
it into the wave type of movement so

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.180 
it into the wave type of movement so
it's<00:02:09.040> okay

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190
