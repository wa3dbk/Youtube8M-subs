00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.819
 Hi everyone, everything good, so it's ending. 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.250
 Vacations 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.590
 it's time to go back to school to 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.929
 the faculty and bet that most 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.969
 you have already started to reorganize the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.119
 stuff who was not soon enough already has 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.800
 to go because there is little time and a lot of 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.410
 people will probably continue with 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.470
 material from the beginning of the year or did not like 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.539
 will change material or how I will 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.039
 semester in which each semester are classes 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.710
 difference then but not necessarily 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.410
 I need to use the same notebook as the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.360
 Last semester, but I came to 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.399
 feedback from the material I 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.149
 I started with my father earlier in the year. 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.789
 I do not know if you remember that I 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:46.440
 2013 school supplies 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.000
 In the video I did I said that I 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.610
 had bought that 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.230
 caprice that is a binder that is 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.140
 the booklet that you can open 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.210
 now take the leaves and a lot of people 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.680
 talked about you going to the bar is very good and 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.690
 a lot of people there and you will not 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.750
 like the leaves fall and if that 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.110
 So I tested it that way for a certain 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.000
 I like it, it looks nice, but then it was 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.619
 lots of weight to carry I started to 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.369
 take several sheets to let you know 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.200
 smaller 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.760
 and then I started to visit with that 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.850
 leaf fall business because really 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.140
 hour that ripped leaf he a week is 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.210
 malleable 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.920
 It's not like a notebook you can 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.780
 still play handbags and could not play 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.150
 so the stock take some precautions 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.110
 and I'm not at all careful about this 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.540
 kind of thing I started to bother 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.119
 I took all the leaves from him 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.430
 put that my accordion folder and 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.670
 I used that folding folder but not only 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.009
 our already notice much something and passes 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.320
 are spoken also had to load in the 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.939
 very easy, then I was not 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.390
 nothing satisfied with my material 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.159
 beginning of the semester is and boy had his day 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.049
 The day I took it, I got it. 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.299
 fare worse was sandwiched carrying sheet 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.180
 folded at home, then it became a 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.850
 I lost a lot like the mess I 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.810
 I did good this semester, I'll do it. 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.280
 different 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.990
 first I do not like to carry too much 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.179
 weight does not like to take some are very 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.500
 great that already takes the notebook for that 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.950
 I'm not even going to take a notebook for the semester. 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.560
 for college because 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.739
 I'm going to study in the morning in college. 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.260
 It's now morning and how I came from July. 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.459
 already faced back ordered by day 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.989
 in the morning I do not think I'll even take a 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.810
 notebook one day or another I think 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.700
 missing is probably not 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.000
 anyway I did not like that much weight 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.370
 have to take the bus and keira bothers 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.200
 So I will not have much weight. I bought it. 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.239
 this little notebook here looks so cute 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.260
 see water with bird houses as well 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.620
 cuddly 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.450
 I bought it at na at stationery 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.849
 questioned the role magic has several 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.420
 malls is a bakery kind of me 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:55.060
 I paid from $ 50 of it is very clear has 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.130
 160 sheets but I love this kind of 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.910
 notebook that is the kind of agenda that I 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:04.920
 I used it, I really wanted to carry it. 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:10.239
 those sheets so have up to line 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.489
 line luted and i loved it 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.989
 I do not know, I like the kind of thing 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.730
 That thing, I 'm not going to lose what. 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.680
 It's in here, I'm going to have to do it. 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.040
 a separation with adhesive here in 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.660
 Above will be done another matter and I will 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.970
 using up 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:29.530
 I do not know the way you even have a pastry 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:32.139
 here in the background a loose leaf envelope 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.370
 but I prefer it as small as it is 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.030
 one thing I'll make sure I 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.530
 I will take it 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.790
 it's not going to be that thing, I'm not going 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.769
 Take mine with the accordion, nothing. 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.829
 she is very big I'll leave it at home 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.989
 end up needing he's tiny if 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.790
 I use the other but I prefer 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.530
 we never end, we always think 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.019
 use lots of sheets and do not use 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.260
 So many things like that so I bought it 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.120
 It is cute 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.599
 I bought mine and was using that 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.310
 agenda is that the agenda 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.620
 Alone very small and she's done 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.630
 I managed to finish the agenda. 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.389
 adopting took this craze of advancing 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.609
 every day what I'm going to do is what I 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:11.260
 I have to write it down a lot, I'll do it until 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.810
 drama, my life, what I did, I drew 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.120
 before the paper in we had before 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.859
 make the video then it's over me 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.150
 I bought another one I also bought in abseiling 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.949
 magic this here green water and rosinha 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.009
 was a little bigger than the 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:30.389
 which I wore only a little more than 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:34.320
 used is because more vague actually only and 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:36.930
 she is without anything written down from 100 lines is 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.229
 Lisa and I'm already using her a lot 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:44.820
 here o 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:47.130
 I've used quite noticeable 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.020
 sometimes the note is what I'm going to talk about 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.020
 some videos so some questions 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.539
 That you send me another pretty thing. 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.320
 and agenda I take her so always with the 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:02.070
 Pen inside has already trapped her 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.960
 By the way, I was already in the kit. 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.449
 but then it started that thing also a 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.240
 day I took the game led now takes 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:11.490
 a pen only within the agenda and 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.740
 probably taking the notebook with me 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.260
 I'm going to take a pencil, it does not take much 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.780
 thing is the rubber in the bag 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.270
 knows simplicity but I'll take it alone 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.720
 a pen and a cigar holder I will not take 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.550
 agenda is I had that mania 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.699
 write each part with a color 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.410
 different but then you get that 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.539
 thing you have to write fast copy 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.419
 fast and if you miss it 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:39.510
 write little color is all blue 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:44.849
 It 's all pencil and so on. 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:46.680
 so now my stuff is just this 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:48.930
 I'll continue as you get sanctioned in 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.340
 house to store something or other that 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.780
 I need to, I will not be taking 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.510
 she's going to college to save 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.070
 things at home to take to college 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.020
 even in the bag, which led him to see if 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.060
 this is the notebook and agency 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:04.229
 so we here the size of the agenda 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.729
 near the notebook is this that I take 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:07.919
 I have people with her this weekend. 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:09.750
 anywhere I'll time 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.650
 everything and now I'm going to start taking the 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.800
 notebook 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.210
 during the week for college and is 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.400
 I wanted to give feedback to 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.010
 You, many people wanted to know how 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.510
 It was the experience of the binder I 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.110
 I ended up liking it because I do not 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.340
 I am an organized person is the leaves 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.229
 they ended up ripping it is not a thing 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.840
 so practical when a notebook that is 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:32.070
 everything here but will or will not tear 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.110
 will not fall 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.910
 and the way he's wanting to be tough 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.590
 cover of the game there inside the bag that 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.550
 nothing is going to happen, nothing has 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.020
 problem 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.020
 even more that he has this elastic 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.870
 not to open I thought it great then 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.920
 I 'm going to stay with these two agents . 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.510
 notebook 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.910
 It has neither spiral that the sheet does not 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:53.820
 to tear anyway 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.890
 but everyone has people who love me 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.840
 I have friends that until today use to close 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.400
 those closed little ones know 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.200
 those very little ones that the leaf - 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.020
 What I mean, people, how can you? 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.270
 write and she writes writes awaiting handwriting 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.610
 another sheet ends up using multiple sheets is 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:10.770
 for being little, but love 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.370
 organizes in a very easy way that 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.200
 way 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.240
 so everyone has a way I have friends 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.100
 love the accordion, I have nothing 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.380
 friends who carry a notebook just for all 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.640
 the material then goes from each of the 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.070
 The way you get organized 

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.020
 better and I realized that I have to 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.730
 use a notebook even because I have to 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.610
 have a practical thing at the time of playing 

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:31.980
 in the bag you know then it's the notebook I came 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.570
 Just give me feedback to show you the 

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.450
 which I'm using now in this 

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.920
 semester at the end of 2013 

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:41.040
 so this is what I will use when 

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:43.530
 start classes and you and you 

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.470
 they will give notebooks already decided 

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.400
 already tested both tell me here in 

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.590
 comments 

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.040
 this is until the next kiss videos 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.040
 bye
