00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.140
 how friends are welcome breeders 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:07.960
 I am a genius and the girl of fortune 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.780
 the draws of the clover and we already started a 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.089
 new year 2013 many congratulations to 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.919
 everyone really hope that this year there 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.920
 many winners and win thousands and 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:19.990
 thousands of pesos is more millions getting 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.240
 all the pools with desire for that 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.099
 you have to participate and we will start with 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.230
 this week's pool begins a 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.839
 new tournament and juana is going to defend her 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.460
 title coins and stone and let's see 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.590
 new faces new faces in the 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.210
 majorities of the teams so let's 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.809
 start with the first day of 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.090
 closing 2013 match number 1 starts 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.820
 the mx league in the aztec will be 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.350
 great match between the america 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.079
 against monterrey 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.359
 confirmed signings of narcissus mine and 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.430
 of osvaldito martínez that renews the 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.379
 illusion of a new title 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.750
 monterrey finished third in the 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.309
 world club but still this 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.739
 party I think it's going to be pretty 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.620
 closed so as not to risk ourselves better 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.600
 let's leave in a sad match 2 the 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.210
 tigers of the tuca ferretti face 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.369
 jaguars after the tics of that 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.190
 Tigers did not qualify in the group stage 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.530
 tournament past the team was reinforced and 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.020
 wants to go with everything for the title in this 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.569
 closing day and I do not think it 's 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.780
 difficult because it has tito villa al 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:26.090
 gringo Torres hugo Rodríguez and danilinho 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.610
 so I think they're going to be playing 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.800
 with everything and that they will give very good 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.860
 matches therefore we are left with 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.560
 the local party 3 pachuca before the 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.270
 Atlante the tournament past los tusos 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.479
 they disappointed because they were in the place 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.990
 number 13 now gabriel knight is 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.509
 already as coach the atlante continues with 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.909
 the scorer were walls and reinforced 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.820
 with the Argentine the riva and the 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.280
 Ecuadorian 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.729
 we leave it to not miss it in a 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.979
 double local and tie 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:03.310
 let's go with the match number 4 duel 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.500
 of the empty lion before the querétaro the lion 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.709
 will want to confirm itself as a team of 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.840
 first and first division and 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.630
 enjoy the liberators with nery 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.120
 castillo and rafa marquez el querétaro 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.340
 must avoid the decline in which it is 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.770
 tied with the atlas the party is going to 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.190
 be quite uneven and I think the 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.190
 victory will be for the local team 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.260
 5 San Luis party that receives the saints 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.840
 san luis already has several tournaments in the 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.820
 that does not appear as a league team on 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.040
 saints on the contrary were left out 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.620
 of the previous tournament but you do not have to 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.530
 forget that they were champions in the of 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.480
 closing 2012 and the truth I do not think that 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.700
 lose this match of saints 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.620
 we always give good games so 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.519
 I think they 're going to win this time so 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.430
 so much visitor party 6 people in the 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.560
 Cuauhtémoc to the champion alone and to them 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.180
 I said that I am poblana should give 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.370
 to the town but good 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.439
 reasons the town has like a new 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.379
 technical director to the bridge and it's going to 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:07.359
 xolos face the champion who will 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.129
 try to endorse your title and go to 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:12.430
 be enjoying also in the cup 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:15.579
 liberators unfortunately and for me 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.790
 pain I do not think the fringe plays better 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:21.849
 that alone so to be honest 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.709
 now yes to tell you what is good 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.840
 and not my convenience, I think it's going 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.660
 to win the visiting team alone 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.349
 match 7 the cougars that receive the atlas 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.269
 the atlas is very urged of triumphs 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:38.390
 since he does not want to descend both 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.730
 teams come from good in hard after 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.500
 of the preseason so the safest thing 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.239
 is that the two give a good game or 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.849
 good match safe pig goes to 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.360
 be very close to the meeting and 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.510
 we predict a tie 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.360
 match 8 last of the league mx las 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.670
 chivas before toluca miguel sabrá 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.740
 go back to the chivas and it's going to be a 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.540
 good couple with rafa marquez with whom 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.310
 he has played before because they remember that 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.100
 He met in Morelia and there they did 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.140
 how they did like dumbbell toluca 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.720
 kept the majority of the campus so 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.030
 that comes with all we are not going to 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.780
 risk and we 're going to go for a double 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.640
 tie and visit ok match moves the league 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.430
 Spanish the sevilla that receives the 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.200
 osasuna would have not been raised and it 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.870
 keeps below the average table 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.060
 but the osasuna is in positions 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.360
 of descent and it is difficult to be able to 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.600
 get out of there so we go better with 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.310
 the local like that paints more sevilla 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.400
 party days the Vallecano ray before the 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.280
 getafe both teams are half board 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.650
 but they are nowhere to be able to get 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.260
 European posts but the Vallecano ray 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.300
 It has two consecutive wins or is 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.210
 popcorn for them so we're going 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.990
 with the local team match 11 in the 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.570
 call 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.060
 the napoli that receives the roma the 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.160
 Naples you get good results 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.980
 can be up to second 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.140
 place of the table roma will seek to get 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:09.070
 instead of European competitions since 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.680
 is two points will be a match with the 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.500
 best puppy offensive mind one of 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.020
 the best defenses napoles and so for 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.540
 not miss him we are left with double room 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.930
 and visit is if it's going to be games or 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:27.250
 it is difficult game 12 he took 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.530
 atalanta duel to even as well 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.780
 faces number 12 with number 11 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.540
 of the table respectively but without 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.580
 no doubt the break is very strong and 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.890
 always defends his swashbuckling 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.740
 stadium so for the same reason we're going to 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.990
 support the local team and well 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.450
 remember that for five pesos more they can 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.150
 take the accumulated bag wins goal that 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.770
 every time it gets more good so five 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.280
 kisses more and they will see that they are going to 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.900
 bring a huge surprise and great and 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.169
 Remember also that you can put your 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.240
 pools at www.uach.mx 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:04.060
 easy fast and super secure through 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.889
 your mobile devices and with respect 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.729
 to the number of goals, as it is 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:12.490
 starting this from the league mx then I 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:14.529
 I think it's not going to start with very many 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:18.129
 goals and I calculate him more or less than 

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:20.319
 They will be quiet nes at about 28 ok and 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:23.199
 Remember also that you win goals 

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:24.699
 a surprise soon but seriously and 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:27.550
 very soon so be very careful 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:30.009
 because they will love happy year to 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.199
 I give you all the best vibes 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:34.860
 very lucky and see you next 

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:34.860
 week
