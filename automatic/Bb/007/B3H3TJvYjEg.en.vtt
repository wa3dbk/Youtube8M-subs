very shiny so and it's not it's pliable

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.920 
very shiny so and it's not it's pliable
but<00:02:27.579> it<00:02:27.730> does<00:02:28.030> what<00:02:28.180> it's<00:02:28.299> supposed<00:02:28.329> to<00:02:28.540> do

but it does what it's supposed to do

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.660 
but it does what it's supposed to do
when<00:02:29.439> you<00:02:29.530> do<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.739> this<00:02:29.859> way<00:02:30.040> but<00:02:30.310> when<00:02:30.489> I<00:02:30.519> have

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
when you do it this way but when I have

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.819 
when you do it this way but when I have
to<00:02:30.730> do<00:02:30.819> it<00:02:31.000> like<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:31.659> would<00:02:31.840> normally<00:02:32.680> with

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
to do it like you would normally with

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:35.429 
to do it like you would normally with
gel<00:02:33.040> it's<00:02:33.819> not<00:02:33.939> a<00:02:33.969> good<00:02:34.120> look

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
gel it's not a good look

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.619 
gel it's not a good look
because<00:02:36.250> my<00:02:36.370> hair<00:02:36.549> just<00:02:36.760> curls<00:02:37.060> up<00:02:37.239> it<00:02:37.450> doesn't

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
because my hair just curls up it doesn't

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.399 
because my hair just curls up it doesn't
lay<00:02:38.049> flat<00:02:38.379> you<00:02:39.370> could<00:02:39.519> also<00:02:39.670> use<00:02:40.200> here<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:41.290> is

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
lay flat you could also use here it is

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.369 
lay flat you could also use here it is

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
the olive oil edge control you can use

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.729 
the olive oil edge control you can use
that<00:02:44.560> too<00:02:45.329> but<00:02:46.329> this<00:02:46.480> tends<00:02:47.079> to<00:02:47.200> make<00:02:47.290> my<00:02:47.560> ear

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
that is what is smoothing out that hair

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:30.149 
that is what is smoothing out that hair
you<00:05:18.370> see<00:05:18.580> that<00:05:19.320> smooths<00:05:20.320> out<00:05:21.720> it<00:05:22.720> is

but see the toothbrush is definitely not

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:43.259 
but see the toothbrush is definitely not
as<00:05:33.429> harsh<00:05:34.360> as<00:05:36.419> your<00:05:37.419> regular<00:05:41.909> boar<00:05:42.909> bristle

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:43.269

brush and it's I feel like it's more

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:52.109 
brush and it's I feel like it's more
effective<00:05:48.369> because<00:05:49.259> it<00:05:50.259> gets<00:05:50.529> all<00:05:51.119> little

00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:52.119 
effective because it gets all little

00:05:52.119 --> 00:05:57.269 
effective because it gets all little
hairs<00:05:52.419> as<00:05:53.819> opposed<00:05:54.819> to<00:05:55.089> a<00:05:55.569> brush<00:05:55.989> it<00:05:56.889> doesn't

00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:57.279 
hairs as opposed to a brush it doesn't

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:04.739 
hairs as opposed to a brush it doesn't
really<00:05:57.399> get<00:05:57.789> all<00:05:57.999> those<00:05:58.269> hairs<00:06:03.209> we<00:06:04.209> just<00:06:04.509> do
