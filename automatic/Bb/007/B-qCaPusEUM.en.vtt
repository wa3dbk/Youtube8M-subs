that<00:02:10.670> black<00:02:11.120> ops<00:02:11.360> 1<00:02:11.540> didn't<00:02:12.140> really<00:02:12.290> have

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
that black ops 1 didn't really have

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.530 
that black ops 1 didn't really have
really<00:02:12.680> nice<00:02:12.920> hit<00:02:13.190> detection<00:02:13.310> some<00:02:14.150> late<00:02:14.300> see

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
really nice hit detection some late see

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.600 
really nice hit detection some late see
lag<00:02:14.780> issues<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.320> whatnot<00:02:15.560> but<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.430> has<00:02:16.580> been

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
lag issues and whatnot but it has been

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.640 
lag issues and whatnot but it has been
confirmed<00:02:16.940> that<00:02:17.330> black<00:02:17.540> ops<00:02:17.750> 2<00:02:17.960> will<00:02:18.170> be<00:02:18.380> using

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
confirmed that black ops 2 will be using

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.330 
confirmed that black ops 2 will be using
black<00:02:19.220> ops<00:02:19.460> ones<00:02:19.820> engine<00:02:20.630> still<00:02:21.530> but<00:02:22.160> they're

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
black ops ones engine still but they're

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.860 
black ops ones engine still but they're
going<00:02:22.520> to<00:02:22.640> enhance<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.060> graphics<00:02:23.510> plus

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
going to enhance the graphics plus

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.870 
going to enhance the graphics plus
lighting<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:24.470> performance<00:02:24.650> for<00:02:25.250> black<00:02:25.400> ops<00:02:25.580> 2

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
lighting and performance for black ops 2

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.720 
lighting and performance for black ops 2
so<00:02:26.690> it<00:02:27.140> basically<00:02:27.380> just<00:02:27.800> got<00:02:28.070> to<00:02:28.160> be<00:02:28.220> enhanced

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
so it basically just got to be enhanced

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.480 
so it basically just got to be enhanced
you<00:02:29.540> know<00:02:29.660> built<00:02:29.900> up<00:02:30.050> better<00:02:30.230> to<00:02:30.860> withstand

um there has also been a hint of a nuke
and<00:02:42.140> black<00:02:42.800> ops<00:02:42.980> 2<00:02:43.190> which<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.550> truly<00:02:43.910> do<00:02:44.120> not

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
and black ops 2 which I truly do not

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.000 
and black ops 2 which I truly do not
believe<00:02:44.540> at<00:02:44.750> all<00:02:44.780> I<00:02:45.200> don't<00:02:45.680> think<00:02:45.709> it's<00:02:45.890> going

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
believe at all I don't think it's going

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.920

what I mean you could you have to get

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.960 
what I mean you could you have to get
the<00:03:00.350> full<00:03:00.500> 25<00:03:00.890> killstreak<00:03:01.160> or<00:03:01.550> maybe<00:03:01.700> going<00:03:01.910> to

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
the full 25 killstreak or maybe going to

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.750 
the full 25 killstreak or maybe going to
make<00:03:02.060> it<00:03:02.180> more<00:03:02.330> because<00:03:02.510> black<00:03:03.260> ops<00:03:03.500> 1<00:03:03.800> did

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
make it more because black ops 1 did

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.130 
make it more because black ops 1 did
make<00:03:04.940> big<00:03:05.180> kill<00:03:05.330> streak<00:03:05.570> you<00:03:05.690> know<00:03:05.750> pretty<00:03:05.930> up

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140

multiplayer<00:03:12.410> will<00:03:12.680> be<00:03:12.800> taking<00:03:13.130> place<00:03:13.250> in<00:03:14.830> 2025

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
multiplayer will be taking place in 2025

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.270 
multiplayer will be taking place in 2025
so<00:03:16.340> in<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:17.090> near<00:03:17.209> future<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:18.470> that's<00:03:19.160> not

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
so in the near future and that's not

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.710 
so in the near future and that's not
that<00:03:19.430> bad<00:03:19.610> i<00:03:19.670> mean<00:03:19.910> that<00:03:20.180> explains<00:03:20.510> all<00:03:20.630> the

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
that bad i mean that explains all the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.810 
that bad i mean that explains all the
drones<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.320> new<00:03:21.350> flying<00:03:22.010> drone<00:03:22.280> things<00:03:22.580> we're

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
drones the new flying drone things we're

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.930 
drones the new flying drone things we're
not<00:03:22.970> so<00:03:23.420> we<00:03:23.780> can't<00:03:23.959> speculate<00:03:24.380> saying<00:03:24.920> oh<00:03:25.130> this

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
not so we can't speculate saying oh this

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.160 
not so we can't speculate saying oh this
game<00:03:26.120> is<00:03:26.180> going<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.330> be<00:03:26.390> terrible<00:03:26.810> something

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
game is going to be terrible something

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.900 
game is going to be terrible something
because<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:28.040> drones<00:03:28.340> are<00:03:28.549> going<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.730> be<00:03:28.790> in

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
because the drones are going to be in

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.300 
because the drones are going to be in
the<00:03:29.000> game<00:03:29.180> you<00:03:29.480> know<00:03:29.600> they<00:03:30.019> sell<00:03:30.260> drone<00:03:30.470> in<00:03:30.620> mw3

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
the game you know they sell drone in mw3

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.580 
the game you know they sell drone in mw3
yeah<00:03:31.640> annoying<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.420> i'm<00:03:33.080> sure<00:03:33.260> they<00:03:33.410> learn

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
yeah annoying and i'm sure they learn

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.740 
yeah annoying and i'm sure they learn
from<00:03:33.620> her<00:03:33.980> from<00:03:34.280> it<00:03:34.430> so<00:03:34.610> they<00:03:34.700> could<00:03:34.820> probably

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
from her from it so they could probably

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.240 
from her from it so they could probably
gonna<00:03:35.930> make<00:03:36.080> it<00:03:36.170> easier<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:36.500> kill<00:03:36.709> it's

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
gonna make it easier to kill it's

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.650 
gonna make it easier to kill it's
probably<00:03:37.489> going<00:03:37.610> to<00:03:37.670> be<00:03:37.730> a<00:03:37.790> lot<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:38.030> equipment

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
probably going to be a lot of equipment

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.750 
probably going to be a lot of equipment
that<00:03:39.110> they<00:03:39.380> have<00:03:39.590> EMP<00:03:40.040> burst<00:03:40.190> and<00:03:40.549> all<00:03:40.610> that

stuff<00:03:40.880> to<00:03:41.090> get<00:03:41.180> rid<00:03:41.330> of<00:03:41.360> it<00:03:41.570> obviously<00:03:42.049> it's

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
stuff to get rid of it obviously it's

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.390 
stuff to get rid of it obviously it's
the<00:03:42.500> future<00:03:42.709> i'm<00:03:42.950> sure<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.250> lot<00:03:43.370> of<00:03:43.549> EMP

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
the future i'm sure a lot of EMP

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.970

for it's an x-ray vision kind of thing

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.760 
for it's an x-ray vision kind of thing
it's<00:05:07.560> a<00:05:07.680> scope<00:05:07.949> called<00:05:08.280> that<00:05:08.970> uses<00:05:09.240> a

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
it's a scope called that uses a

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.920 
it's a scope called that uses a
millimeter<00:05:10.770> wave<00:05:11.400> technology<00:05:11.760> basically<00:05:12.659> the

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
millimeter wave technology basically the

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.420 
millimeter wave technology basically the
same<00:05:13.080> stuff<00:05:13.320> that<00:05:13.349> using<00:05:13.620> airports<00:05:14.099> to<00:05:14.250> look

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
same stuff that using airports to look

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.040 
same stuff that using airports to look
at<00:05:14.610> your<00:05:14.760> luggage<00:05:15.090> you<00:05:15.300> know<00:05:15.389> x<00:05:15.570> rays<00:05:15.720> why<00:05:15.870> not

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
at your luggage you know x rays why not

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.920 
at your luggage you know x rays why not
and<00:05:16.610> it's<00:05:17.610> able<00:05:17.849> to<00:05:18.000> you<00:05:18.479> know<00:05:18.599> look<00:05:18.750> through

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
and it's able to you know look through

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.730 
and it's able to you know look through
walls<00:05:19.169> I'm<00:05:20.010> sure<00:05:20.220> there's<00:05:20.430> a<00:05:20.490> range

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
walls I'm sure there's a range

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.659 
walls I'm sure there's a range
difference<00:05:22.740> or<00:05:22.949> I'm<00:05:23.220> sure<00:05:23.400> they're<00:05:23.520> going<00:05:23.610> to

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
difference or I'm sure they're going to

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.210 
difference or I'm sure they're going to
do<00:05:23.760> something<00:05:23.970> so<00:05:24.590> it's<00:05:25.590> either<00:05:25.800> you<00:05:26.190> know

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
do something so it's either you know

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.210 
do something so it's either you know
killstreak<00:05:26.849> or<00:05:27.150> a<00:05:27.479> perk<00:05:27.960> maybe<00:05:28.260> there<00:05:29.070> may<00:05:29.190> be

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
killstreak or a perk maybe there may be

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.790 
killstreak or a perk maybe there may be
a<00:05:29.340> perk<00:05:29.610> to<00:05:29.760> counter<00:05:30.150> it<00:05:30.180> like<00:05:30.720> assassin<00:05:31.500> my

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
a perk to counter it like assassin my

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.439 
a perk to counter it like assassin my
counter<00:05:32.159> that<00:05:32.340> which<00:05:32.610> you<00:05:32.970> know<00:05:33.090> is<00:05:33.210> fair

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
counter that which you know is fair

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.820 
counter that which you know is fair
enough<00:05:33.889> also<00:05:34.889> they<00:05:35.510> said<00:05:36.510> this<00:05:36.690> because<00:05:36.930> it's

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
enough also they said this because it's

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.589 
enough also they said this because it's
the<00:05:38.039> compact<00:05:38.430> camper<00:05:38.760> so<00:05:38.789> Tareq<00:05:39.389> is

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
the compact camper so Tareq is

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.080 
the compact camper so Tareq is
definitely<00:05:39.960> on<00:05:40.050> our<00:05:40.080> side<00:05:40.440> to<00:05:41.039> combat<00:05:41.250> campers

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
definitely on our side to combat campers

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.590 
definitely on our side to combat campers
and<00:05:42.300> I'm<00:05:42.419> very<00:05:42.630> glad<00:05:42.750> about<00:05:42.930> that

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
and I'm very glad about that

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.190 
and I'm very glad about that
and<00:05:43.720> also<00:05:44.440> there's<00:05:44.830> a<00:05:44.970> chart<00:05:45.970> shot<00:05:46.270> while

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
and also there's a chart shot while

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.480 
and also there's a chart shot while
first<00:05:47.500> sniper<00:05:47.650> rifles<00:05:47.980> I<00:05:48.100> don't<00:05:48.220> know<00:05:48.280> if<00:05:48.370> it's

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
first sniper rifles I don't know if it's

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.310 
first sniper rifles I don't know if it's
for<00:05:48.640> other<00:05:48.820> guns<00:05:49.000> that<00:05:49.660> are<00:05:49.720> basically<00:05:50.110> the

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
for other guns that are basically the

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.440 
for other guns that are basically the
option<00:05:50.860> to<00:05:50.890> shoot<00:05:51.190> through<00:05:51.460> different<00:05:52.150> types

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
option to shoot through different types

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.900 
option to shoot through different types
of<00:05:52.600> walls<00:05:52.870> of<00:05:53.170> different<00:05:53.860> densities<00:05:54.340> so

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
of walls of different densities so

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.070 
of walls of different densities so
basically<00:05:55.210> what<00:05:55.450> you<00:05:55.540> have<00:05:55.600> to<00:05:55.780> do<00:05:55.870> with<00:05:55.990> the

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
basically what you have to do with the

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.690 
basically what you have to do with the
shot<00:05:56.290> is<00:05:56.530> prime<00:05:56.830> it<00:05:57.010> you<00:05:57.160> know<00:05:57.250> hold<00:05:57.490> it<00:05:57.580> like

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:57.700 
shot is prime it you know hold it like

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.460 
shot is prime it you know hold it like
frag<00:05:58.300> grenade<00:05:58.540> look<00:05:58.750> how<00:05:58.870> you<00:05:58.930> cook<00:05:59.170> it<00:05:59.200> and

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
frag grenade look how you cook it and

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.680 
frag grenade look how you cook it and
the<00:06:00.130> longer<00:06:00.400> you<00:06:00.490> hold<00:06:00.700> you<00:06:01.000> prime<00:06:01.270> it<00:06:01.300> I<00:06:01.480> guess

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
the longer you hold you prime it I guess

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.380 
the longer you hold you prime it I guess
the<00:06:02.020> stronger<00:06:02.830> it<00:06:03.010> is<00:06:03.190> or<00:06:03.430> something<00:06:03.760> I'm<00:06:04.150> sure

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
the stronger it is or something I'm sure

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.600 
the stronger it is or something I'm sure
there's<00:06:04.570> going<00:06:04.600> to<00:06:04.750> be<00:06:04.780> perks<00:06:05.200> and<00:06:05.490> angle<00:06:06.490> pose

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
there's going to be perks and angle pose

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.670 
there's going to be perks and angle pose
and<00:06:06.850> Collins<00:06:07.090> about<00:06:07.180> that<00:06:07.480> I<00:06:07.720> don't<00:06:08.230> know<00:06:08.290> if

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
and Collins about that I don't know if

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.080 
and Collins about that I don't know if
that's<00:06:08.890> confirmed<00:06:09.190> it's<00:06:09.400> been<00:06:09.550> hinted<00:06:09.820> but

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
that's confirmed it's been hinted but

that's confirmed it's been hinted but
it's<00:06:10.240> not<00:06:10.420> confirmed<00:06:10.720> at<00:06:10.930> all<00:06:11.050> what<00:06:11.590> if<00:06:11.680> it's

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
it's not confirmed at all what if it's

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.710 
it's not confirmed at all what if it's
true<00:06:11.890> I'm<00:06:12.700> thinking<00:06:12.910> that<00:06:13.120> that<00:06:13.360> you<00:06:13.480> probably

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.420 
true I'm thinking that that you probably
have<00:06:13.930> to<00:06:13.960> have<00:06:14.140> like<00:06:14.260> a<00:06:14.290> perp<00:06:14.560> like<00:06:14.710> hard<00:06:14.950> on<00:06:15.160> to

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
have to have like a perp like hard on to

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.000 
have to have like a perp like hard on to
be<00:06:15.550> able<00:06:15.700> to<00:06:15.790> use<00:06:15.940> it<00:06:16.120> effectively<00:06:16.810> at<00:06:17.800> least

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
be able to use it effectively at least

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.560 
be able to use it effectively at least
or<00:06:18.280> something<00:06:18.610> or<00:06:18.760> maybe<00:06:18.880> it's<00:06:19.090> a<00:06:19.240> type<00:06:19.540> of

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570

or something or maybe it's a type of
ammo<00:06:19.810> like<00:06:20.050> a<00:06:20.110> proficiency<00:06:20.680> or<00:06:20.830> something

ammo like a proficiency or something

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.370 
ammo like a proficiency or something
that<00:06:21.820> can<00:06:21.970> be<00:06:22.000> added<00:06:22.300> on<00:06:22.420> which<00:06:22.750> is<00:06:23.020> you<00:06:23.350> know

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
that can be added on which is you know

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.900 
that can be added on which is you know
not<00:06:23.620> not<00:06:23.830> bad<00:06:24.010> like<00:06:24.190> impact<00:06:24.520> you<00:06:24.700> know<00:06:24.790> what<00:06:24.880> I
