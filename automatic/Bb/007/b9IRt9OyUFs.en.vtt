courses<00:00:31.920> now<00:00:32.070> let's<00:00:32.250> see<00:00:32.340> what<00:00:32.460> he<00:00:32.550> looks<00:00:32.700> like

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.630 

he's<00:00:36.570> sadly<00:00:36.840> got<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> seat<00:00:37.320> he<00:00:38.010> looks<00:00:38.280> crazy

he's sadly got the seat he looks crazy

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.459 
he's sadly got the seat he looks crazy
well<00:00:39.480> we'll<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.690> see<00:00:39.809> how<00:00:40.050> he<00:00:40.110> does<00:00:40.320> in

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
well we'll have to see how he does in

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:40.910 
well we'll have to see how he does in
the<00:00:40.559> game

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the game

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.709 
the game
surely<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.460> disadvantage<00:00:42.149> not<00:00:42.420> being

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
surely that a disadvantage not being

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.240 
surely that a disadvantage not being
able<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.930> reach<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.320> steering<00:00:43.620> wheel<00:00:43.770> he

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
able to reach the steering wheel he

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.619 
able to reach the steering wheel he
seems<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.579> be<00:00:44.670> doing<00:00:44.789> okay<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.120> didn't<00:00:45.360> quite

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
seems to be doing okay I didn't quite

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.869 
seems to be doing okay I didn't quite
hit<00:00:45.989> my<00:00:46.260> my<00:00:47.100> launch<00:00:48.059> boom<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:49.350> he's<00:00:49.559> okay<00:00:50.250> or

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
hit my my launch boom but he's okay or

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.420 
hit my my launch boom but he's okay or
maybe<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:52.110> fact<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.440> he's<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.739> tiny<00:00:52.980> means

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
maybe the fact that he's so tiny means

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.189 
maybe the fact that he's so tiny means
that<00:00:53.610> we've<00:00:53.730> got<00:00:53.910> an<00:00:54.030> extra<00:00:54.629> bonus<00:00:54.899> because

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
that we've got an extra bonus because

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.900 
that we've got an extra bonus because
he's<00:00:55.320> not<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.620> heavy<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.370> maybe<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:56.670> can<00:00:56.789> go<00:00:56.879> a

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
he's not as heavy so maybe we can go a

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.529 
he's not as heavy so maybe we can go a
bit<00:00:56.940> faster

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
bit faster

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.599 
bit faster
either<00:00:57.899> way<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> look<00:00:59.190> from<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.460> front

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
either way have a look from the front

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.490 
either way have a look from the front
doesn't<00:00:59.910> make<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.090> easy<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.390> steer<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:01.320> see

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
doesn't make it easy to steer you see

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.319 
doesn't make it easy to steer you see
that<00:01:01.710> he<00:01:02.039> jumps<00:01:02.430> out<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.760> seat<00:01:03.059> well<00:01:03.210> he

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
that he jumps out of the seat well he

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.109 
that he jumps out of the seat well he
gets<00:01:03.539> hit<00:01:03.780> he<00:01:04.140> does<00:01:04.290> look<00:01:04.500> rather<00:01:04.710> cool<00:01:05.189> um<00:01:05.700> so

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
gets hit he does look rather cool um so

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.179 
gets hit he does look rather cool um so
if<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.510> get<00:01:06.689> back<00:01:06.750> behind<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:07.950> actually

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
if we get back behind we can actually

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.710 
if we get back behind we can actually
see<00:01:08.580> where<00:01:08.880> we're<00:01:09.000> going

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
see where we're going

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.870

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
look at that we hit the we hit the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.950 
look at that we hit the we hit the
shortcut<00:01:12.210> without<00:01:12.420> even<00:01:12.570> looking<00:01:12.780> where<00:01:12.900> we

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960

whole load of smoke so you can see when

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.710 
whole load of smoke so you can see when
it's<00:02:58.950> open<00:02:59.160> just<00:02:59.340> keep<00:02:59.640> this<00:02:59.760> inside<00:03:00.180> line<00:03:00.450> I

to<00:05:07.950> get<00:05:08.040> up<00:05:08.130> into<00:05:08.250> first<00:05:08.520> and<00:05:08.790> then<00:05:09.000> pick<00:05:09.360> up

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
to get up into first and then pick up

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.570 
to get up into first and then pick up
some<00:05:10.290> Evie<00:05:10.530> owned<00:05:10.710> at<00:05:10.860> first<00:05:11.070> now<00:05:11.310> I<00:05:11.340> can<00:05:11.550> I

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
some Evie owned at first now I can I

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.260 
some Evie owned at first now I can I
pick<00:05:11.790> up<00:05:11.940> some<00:05:12.180> defensive<00:05:13.910> defensive<00:05:14.910> boxes

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
pick up some defensive defensive boxes

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.300 
pick up some defensive defensive boxes
cuz<00:05:15.450> that's<00:05:15.570> what<00:05:15.660> we<00:05:15.750> need<00:05:15.900> a<00:05:15.930> shield<00:05:16.350> just

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
cuz that's what we need a shield just

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.910 
cuz that's what we need a shield just
stop<00:05:17.520> us<00:05:17.670> getting<00:05:17.820> hit<00:05:18.180> or<00:05:18.600> potentially<00:05:19.410> they

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
stop us getting hit or potentially they

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.170 
stop us getting hit or potentially they
go<00:05:20.100> yes<00:05:20.550> that's<00:05:20.820> it

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
go yes that's it

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.140 
go yes that's it
so<00:05:22.050> for<00:05:22.770> a<00:05:22.800> minute<00:05:23.160> we're<00:05:23.340> safe<00:05:23.640> and<00:05:23.940> we're

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
so for a minute we're safe and we're

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.190 
so for a minute we're safe and we're
just<00:05:24.270> coming<00:05:24.480> around<00:05:24.600> the<00:05:24.780> final<00:05:25.050> straight

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
just coming around the final straight

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.750 
just coming around the final straight
now<00:05:25.320> this<00:05:25.470> is<00:05:25.560> a<00:05:25.710> Mario<00:05:25.920> Kart<00:05:25.980> I<00:05:26.310> would<00:05:26.460> be<00:05:26.550> hit

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
now this is a Mario Kart I would be hit

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.160 
now this is a Mario Kart I would be hit
by<00:05:26.940> a<00:05:26.970> whole<00:05:27.150> bunch<00:05:27.180> of<00:05:27.480> red<00:05:27.690> shells<00:05:27.990> around

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
by a whole bunch of red shells around

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.620 
by a whole bunch of red shells around
now<00:05:28.470> so<00:05:28.500> I'm<00:05:28.740> suspecting<00:05:29.160> that<00:05:29.640> I'm<00:05:30.330> going<00:05:30.540> to

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
now so I'm suspecting that I'm going to

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.240 
now so I'm suspecting that I'm going to
be<00:05:30.690> overtaken<00:05:31.380> any<00:05:31.530> minute<00:05:31.830> by<00:05:31.950> the<00:05:32.010> people

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
be overtaken any minute by the people

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.010 
be overtaken any minute by the people
behind<00:05:32.490> me<00:05:32.610> are<00:05:32.880> they<00:05:33.360> there<00:05:33.540> I<00:05:33.750> think<00:05:33.870> that

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
behind me are they there I think that

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.200 
behind me are they there I think that
have<00:05:34.230> I<00:05:34.260> done<00:05:34.440> it<00:05:34.590> I<00:05:34.800> feel<00:05:35.670> like<00:05:35.910> I've<00:05:36.030> put

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
have I done it I feel like I've put

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.270 
have I done it I feel like I've put
enough<00:05:36.450> distance<00:05:36.630> between<00:05:36.930> myself<00:05:37.260> and<00:05:37.770> these

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
enough distance between myself and these

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.850 
enough distance between myself and these
guys<00:05:38.490> coming<00:05:38.790> behind<00:05:38.940> me<00:05:39.240> to<00:05:39.990> win<00:05:40.170> yes<00:05:40.560> look<00:05:40.800> at

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
guys coming behind me to win yes look at

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.110 
guys coming behind me to win yes look at
that

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
that

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.060 
that
terabyte<00:05:42.120> despite<00:05:42.660> his<00:05:42.840> small<00:05:42.960> size<00:05:43.290> comes<00:05:43.830> in

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
terabyte despite his small size comes in

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.220 
terabyte despite his small size comes in
for<00:05:44.490> the<00:05:44.550> win<00:05:44.760> in<00:05:45.060> what<00:05:45.660> is<00:05:45.780> my<00:05:45.930> think<00:05:46.050> one<00:05:46.140> of

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
for the win in what is my think one of

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.900 
for the win in what is my think one of
my<00:05:46.290> first<00:05:46.560> wins<00:05:46.950> and<00:05:47.190> Skylanders<00:05:47.700> super

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
my first wins and Skylanders super

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.000 
my first wins and Skylanders super
charges<00:05:48.270> so<00:05:49.020> we'll<00:05:49.260> be<00:05:49.350> back<00:05:49.530> with<00:05:49.710> more

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
charges so we'll be back with more

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.010 
charges so we'll be back with more
different<00:05:50.820> Skylanders<00:05:51.330> in<00:05:51.510> more<00:05:51.750> different

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
different Skylanders in more different

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.100 
different Skylanders in more different
races<00:05:52.170> very<00:05:52.860> soon
