00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
honestly there's not enough quality

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.869 
honestly there's not enough quality
projects<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.500> companies<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.070> absorb<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.579> so

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
projects and companies to absorb that so

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.229 
projects and companies to absorb that so
a<00:00:45.149> lot<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.780> money<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.110> going<00:00:46.289> into<00:00:46.440> substandard

a lot of money is going into substandard

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.639 
a lot of money is going into substandard
projects<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.360> companies<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.200> that's<00:00:49.350> kind<00:00:49.590> of

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
projects and companies so that's kind of

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.410 
projects and companies so that's kind of
what's<00:00:49.800> really<00:00:50.579> striking<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.149> don't<00:00:51.270> know<00:00:51.329> how

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
what's really striking I don't know how

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.389 
what's really striking I don't know how
much<00:00:51.539> longer<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.230> go<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:53.010> probably

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
much longer this can go it's probably

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.459 
much longer this can go it's probably
not<00:00:53.579> going<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.789> end<00:00:53.940> well<00:00:54.000> well<00:00:54.840> I'm<00:00:54.930> not

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
not going to end well well I'm not

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.770 
not going to end well well I'm not
shocked<00:00:55.739> at<00:00:55.860> all<00:00:55.980> Daniella<00:00:56.370> every<00:00:57.300> investment

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
shocked at all Daniella every investment

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.590 
shocked at all Daniella every investment
cycle<00:00:58.050> has<00:00:58.829> his<00:00:59.039> top<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.879> his<00:00:59.969> bottom<00:01:00.329> and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
cycle has his top and his bottom and

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.450 
cycle has his top and his bottom and
it's<00:01:01.170> obvious<00:01:01.500> we're<00:01:01.620> not<00:01:01.770> at<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.980> bottom<00:01:02.340> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
it's obvious we're not at the bottom and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.520 
it's obvious we're not at the bottom and
I<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.629> question<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.049> we're<00:01:04.199> close<00:01:04.379> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
I so the question is that we're close to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.980 
I so the question is that we're close to
the<00:01:04.589> top<00:01:04.799> well<00:01:05.369> if<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.150> see<00:01:06.360> people<00:01:06.630> rushing

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the top well if you see people rushing

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.660 
the top well if you see people rushing
in<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.409> number<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.890> people<00:01:07.979> rushing<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
in a number of people rushing in the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.920 
in a number of people rushing in the
number<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:08.970> new<00:01:10.340> players<00:01:11.340> coming<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.600> looks

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
number of new players coming in it looks

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.830 
number of new players coming in it looks
frothy<00:01:13.909> it's<00:01:14.909> difficult<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.360> quantify<00:01:15.450> but

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
frothy it's difficult to quantify but

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.289 
frothy it's difficult to quantify but
certainly<00:01:16.409> if<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.159> look<00:01:17.340> at<00:01:17.549> what<00:01:18.000> we've<00:01:18.119> seen

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
certainly if you look at what we've seen

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.850 
certainly if you look at what we've seen
in<00:01:18.479> Mexico<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.080> there's<00:01:19.500> something<00:01:19.740> like

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
in Mexico this there's something like

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.880 
in Mexico this there's something like
almost<00:01:20.280> 400<00:01:20.850> gold<00:01:21.060> strokes<00:01:21.990> silver<00:01:22.409> projects

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
almost 400 gold strokes silver projects

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.980 
almost 400 gold strokes silver projects
that<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.100> looked<00:01:23.280> at<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:24.240> that's<00:01:24.450> there's

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
that we looked at and that's there's

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.249 
that we looked at and that's there's
probably<00:01:25.259> more<00:01:25.640> in<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.780> country<00:01:28.140> than

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
probably more in in that country than

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.630 
probably more in in that country than
any<00:01:28.320> country<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.040> world<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> moment

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
any country in the world at the moment

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.149 
any country in the world at the moment
and<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.180> lot<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.860> through<00:01:31.860> junior

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
and a lot of that is through junior

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.490 
and a lot of that is through junior
companies<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.060> course<00:01:33.240> they<00:01:33.420> are<00:01:33.930> funded

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
companies and of course they are funded

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.440 
companies and of course they are funded
by<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> market<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.430> yes<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.759> would<00:01:35.909> say<00:01:36.090> judging

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
by the market so yes I would say judging

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.080 
by the market so yes I would say judging
by<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.720> level<00:01:37.380> activity<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:38.070> Mexico<00:01:38.520> there<00:01:38.939> is

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
by the level activity in Mexico there is

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.910 
by the level activity in Mexico there is
there's<00:01:39.659> still<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.930> lot<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.110> money<00:01:40.229> going<00:01:40.619> into

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
there's still a lot of money going into

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.830 
there's still a lot of money going into
the<00:01:41.159> junior<00:01:41.340> sector<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.329> there<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> danger

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
the junior sector is there a danger

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.539 
the junior sector is there a danger
there<00:01:43.229> does<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.409> mean<00:01:43.680> that's<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.159> sign<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.369> a

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
there does that mean that's a sign of a

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.160 
there does that mean that's a sign of a
top<00:01:45.290> well<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.500> could<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:47.250> but<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.579> think<00:01:47.880> what

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
top well it could be but I think what

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.139

it's difficult to say what we are seeing
a<00:01:56.900> lot<00:01:57.170> of<00:01:57.200> new<00:01:57.470> people<00:01:57.860> coming<00:01:58.070> into<00:01:58.190> this

industry now sometimes in the parties or

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.950 
industry now sometimes in the parties or
maybe<00:02:01.340> this<00:02:01.640> is<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:02.030> sign<00:02:02.180> of<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:02.630> top<00:02:02.780> but<00:02:02.900> i

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
maybe this is a sign of the top but i

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.720 
maybe this is a sign of the top but i
