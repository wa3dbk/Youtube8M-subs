bitter<00:04:44.210> on<00:04:44.419> the<00:04:44.540> backend<00:04:44.720> but<00:04:46.540> other<00:04:47.540> than<00:04:47.840> the

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
bitter on the backend but other than the

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.520 
bitter on the backend but other than the
bitterness<00:04:48.380> it's<00:04:48.919> alright<00:04:50.139> I'm<00:04:51.139> gonna<00:04:51.350> say

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
bitterness it's alright I'm gonna say

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.590 
bitterness it's alright I'm gonna say
it's<00:04:51.830> okay<00:04:52.190> it's<00:04:53.120> uh<00:04:53.479> it's<00:04:53.960> a<00:04:54.080> little<00:04:54.200> warm<00:04:54.590> but

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
it's okay it's uh it's a little warm but

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:08.890 
it's okay it's uh it's a little warm but
maybe<00:04:56.600> that<00:04:56.870> sounds<00:05:07.030> like<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.210> Sierra<00:05:08.510> Nevada

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
maybe that sounds like the Sierra Nevada

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.770 
maybe that sounds like the Sierra Nevada
it's<00:05:09.740> a<00:05:09.770> very<00:05:09.979> nice<00:05:10.220> place<00:05:10.520> it<00:05:11.300> is<00:05:11.419> a<00:05:11.450> little

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
it's a very nice place it is a little

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.270 
it's a very nice place it is a little
warmer<00:05:12.169> than<00:05:12.229> it<00:05:12.410> should<00:05:12.470> have<00:05:12.590> been<00:05:12.740> at<00:05:12.950> it's

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
warmer than it should have been at it's

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.370 
warmer than it should have been at it's
probably<00:05:14.000> one<00:05:14.389> degree<00:05:14.750> higher<00:05:14.780> than<00:05:15.289> it

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
probably one degree higher than it

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.840 
probably one degree higher than it
should've<00:05:15.620> been

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
should've been

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.150 
should've been
which<00:05:16.850> is<00:05:17.360> not<00:05:17.539> the<00:05:17.630> finest<00:05:18.050> quality<00:05:18.470> and<00:05:18.740> the

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
which is not the finest quality and the

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.310 
which is not the finest quality and the
purest<00:05:19.610> ingredients<00:05:19.760> in<00:05:20.419> truth<00:05:20.750> one<00:05:21.020> degree

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
purest ingredients in truth one degree

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.800 
purest ingredients in truth one degree
isn't<00:05:21.620> going<00:05:22.010> to<00:05:22.160> really<00:05:22.789> make<00:05:23.479> it<00:05:23.600> or<00:05:23.780> break

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
isn't going to really make it or break

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.219 
isn't going to really make it or break
it<00:05:24.020> so<00:05:24.440> I<00:05:24.470> don't<00:05:24.800> really<00:05:24.889> care<00:05:25.120> but<00:05:26.120> it<00:05:26.960> tastes

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
it so I don't really care but it tastes

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:29.140 
it so I don't really care but it tastes
nice<00:05:27.440> I<00:05:27.740> would<00:05:28.039> easily<00:05:28.280> give<00:05:28.700> this<00:05:28.820> an<00:05:29.000> eight
