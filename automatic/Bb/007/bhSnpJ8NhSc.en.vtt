knowledge of your on thwart so that's

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:36.920 
knowledge of your on thwart so that's

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
negative comments where they're like bad

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.360 
negative comments where they're like bad
voice<00:03:33.810> or<00:03:34.810> like<00:03:35.109> yeah<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.799> beginning<00:03:36.250> is

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
voice or like yeah the beginning is

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.610 
voice or like yeah the beginning is
great<00:03:36.699> but<00:03:37.000> when<00:03:37.359> the<00:03:37.389> rep<00:03:37.599> starts<00:03:37.930> I<00:03:40.290> get<00:03:41.290> that

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
great but when the rep starts I get that

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.379 
great but when the rep starts I get that
but<00:03:42.519> it<00:03:43.120> was<00:03:43.329> intentionally<00:03:43.689> and<00:03:44.319> I<00:03:45.220> think<00:03:45.819> it

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:46.389 
but it was intentionally and I think it

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:48.629 
but it was intentionally and I think it
just<00:03:46.629> takes<00:03:46.870> a<00:03:47.049> bit<00:03:47.229> of<00:03:47.259> getting<00:03:47.379> used<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:48.040> like

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
just takes a bit of getting used to like

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:53.749

what to expect maybe it's an

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.790 
what to expect maybe it's an
instrumental<00:04:54.500> maybe<00:04:56.110> it's<00:04:57.110> even<00:04:57.470> more

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
instrumental maybe it's even more

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.790 
instrumental maybe it's even more
intense<00:04:58.250> because<00:04:59.260> most<00:05:00.260> of<00:05:00.380> the<00:05:00.530> killing

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
intense because most of the killing

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.150 
intense because most of the killing
sprees<00:05:01.100> are<00:05:01.340> kind<00:05:01.880> of<00:05:02.000> like<00:05:02.200> hyped<00:05:03.200> up<00:05:03.410> faster

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
sprees are kind of like hyped up faster

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.000 
sprees are kind of like hyped up faster

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
future I will probably do an

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.660 
future I will probably do an
impersonation<00:05:53.300> video<00:05:54.050> of<00:05:54.490> all<00:05:55.490> the

Awesomenauts<00:05:56.150> characters<00:05:56.720> yeah<00:05:57.260> I<00:05:57.560> think<00:05:57.830> it

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 
Awesomenauts characters yeah I think it

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.950 
Awesomenauts characters yeah I think it
will<00:05:58.100> be<00:05:58.220> fun<00:05:58.400> at<00:05:58.910> least<00:05:59.060> for<00:05:59.330> me<00:05:59.420> to<00:05:59.450> do<00:05:59.690> maybe

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
will be fun at least for me to do maybe

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.080 
will be fun at least for me to do maybe
not<00:06:00.080> for<00:06:00.410> you<00:06:00.470> to<00:06:00.590> watch<00:06:00.770> but<00:06:01.070> that's<00:06:01.820> for<00:06:02.000> you

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
not for you to watch but that's for you

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.480 
not for you to watch but that's for you
to<00:06:02.120> decide<00:06:02.600> Xenia<00:06:03.470> will<00:06:03.680> be<00:06:03.800> released<00:06:04.160> in<00:06:04.400> the

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
to decide Xenia will be released in the

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.670 
to decide Xenia will be released in the
new<00:06:04.640> patch<00:06:04.940> for<00:06:05.360> Awesomenauts<00:06:05.870> which<00:06:06.410> will

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
new patch for Awesomenauts which will

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.250 
new patch for Awesomenauts which will
probably<00:06:07.220> be<00:06:07.520> there<00:06:07.970> somewhere<00:06:08.870> in<00:06:09.020> the<00:06:09.050> next

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
probably be there somewhere in the next

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.890 
probably be there somewhere in the next
couple<00:06:09.620> of<00:06:09.650> days<00:06:09.850> along<00:06:10.850> with<00:06:11.090> the<00:06:11.330> killing

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
couple of days along with the killing

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.980 
couple of days along with the killing
spree<00:06:11.990> theme<00:06:12.380> and<00:06:12.770> I<00:06:13.280> think<00:06:13.550> a<00:06:13.700> video<00:06:13.850> of<00:06:14.420> the

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
spree theme and I think a video of the

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.910 
spree theme and I think a video of the
voice<00:06:15.200> of<00:06:15.910> Xenia<00:06:16.930> which<00:06:17.930> is<00:06:18.110> awesome<00:06:18.770> because

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:18.920 
voice of Xenia which is awesome because

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.790 
voice of Xenia which is awesome because

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.430 
Lanie is autumn in a new patch there
will<00:06:21.980> also<00:06:22.190> be<00:06:22.370> a<00:06:22.940> new<00:06:23.240> map<00:06:23.510> the<00:06:23.900> star<00:06:24.170> store

will also be a new map the star store
map<00:06:24.680> oh<00:06:24.980> and<00:06:25.790> I'm<00:06:25.880> not<00:06:26.150> sure<00:06:26.480> if<00:06:26.750> you<00:06:26.900> need<00:06:27.080> the

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
map oh and I'm not sure if you need the

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.830 
map oh and I'm not sure if you need the
star<00:06:27.860> storm<00:06:28.130> expansion<00:06:28.760> to<00:06:28.970> play<00:06:29.150> with<00:06:29.360> Xenia

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
star storm expansion to play with Xenia

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.620 
star storm expansion to play with Xenia

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
recommend it because the the new players

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.170 
recommend it because the the new players
that<00:06:35.840> are<00:06:36.230> unlocked<00:06:36.710> with<00:06:36.980> that<00:06:37.190> are<00:06:37.760> just
