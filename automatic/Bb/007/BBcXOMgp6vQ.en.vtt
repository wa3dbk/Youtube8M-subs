the writer now what's really nice about

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.720 
the writer now what's really nice about
this<00:00:49.660> is<00:00:49.899> that<00:00:49.930> it<00:00:50.170> does<00:00:50.350> taper<00:00:50.680> down<00:00:50.829> to<00:00:51.160> a<00:00:51.190> 7/8

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
this is that it does taper down to a 7/8

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.060 
this is that it does taper down to a 7/8
inch<00:00:52.000> at<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.480> end<00:00:52.840> of<00:00:52.930> the<00:00:52.989> bar<00:00:53.200> so<00:00:53.680> it<00:00:53.829> still

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
inch at the end of the bar so it still
