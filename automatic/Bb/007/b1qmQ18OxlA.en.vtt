well<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.439> why<00:01:55.590> do<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.710> take<00:01:55.920> us<00:01:56.070> through<00:01:56.250> a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
well and so why do you take us through a

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.190 
well and so why do you take us through a
kind<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.729> high<00:01:56.880> C<00:01:57.119> scenario<00:01:57.630> here<00:01:57.840> let's<00:01:58.049> say

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
kind of a high C scenario here let's say

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.389 
kind of a high C scenario here let's say
you<00:01:58.259> know<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> captain<00:01:58.920> spots<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.369> suspicious

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
vessel on the high seas what how does he

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.160 
vessel on the high seas what how does he
use<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> device<00:02:02.700> what<00:02:02.909> how<00:02:03.570> do<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.689> know<00:02:03.990> just

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
use the device what how do you know just

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.010 
use the device what how do you know just
walk<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.649> through<00:02:05.270> okay<00:02:06.270> first<00:02:06.630> what<00:02:06.869> they

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
walk it through okay first what they

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.869 
walk it through okay first what they
would<00:02:07.170> basically<00:02:07.380> do<00:02:08.039> their<00:02:08.310> protocol

want and the basic thing there was if
you<00:02:59.329> recall<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.840> couple<00:03:00.349> of<00:03:00.439> years<00:03:00.470> ago<00:03:00.769> there

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
you recall a couple of years ago there

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.220 
you recall a couple of years ago there

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
checkpoint so they blew the car up

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.409 
checkpoint so they blew the car up
trying<00:03:12.919> to<00:03:13.069> find<00:03:13.400> out<00:03:13.579> that<00:03:13.849> he<00:03:13.970> was<00:03:14.120> running

away from the bad guys and that's this

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.149 
away from the bad guys and that's this
technology<00:03:17.329> but<00:03:17.569> this<00:03:18.139> technology<00:03:18.799> believe
