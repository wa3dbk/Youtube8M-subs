beekeeping if you have a good feeling

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.870 
beekeeping if you have a good feeling
that<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:24.110> would<00:01:24.260> enjoy<00:01:25.299> then<00:01:26.299> that<00:01:26.840> probably

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
that you would enjoy then that probably

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.630 
that you would enjoy then that probably
probably<00:01:28.880> is<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.210> only<00:01:29.240> good<00:01:29.810> answer<00:01:32.140> now<00:01:33.640> how

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
probably is the only good answer now how

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.320 
probably is the only good answer now how
often<00:01:35.619> should<00:01:36.619> going<00:01:36.950> to<00:01:37.010> my<00:01:37.159> bees<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:38.000> why

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
often should going to my bees and why

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.320 
often should going to my bees and why
should<00:01:38.780> I<00:01:38.810> go<00:01:39.020> into<00:01:39.170> my<00:01:39.350> beings<00:01:39.770> if<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:41.090> don't

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
should I go into my beings if you don't

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.960 
should I go into my beings if you don't
have<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:42.310> desire<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.640> go<00:01:43.909> into<00:01:44.270> your<00:01:44.450> bees<00:01:45.850> and<00:01:46.850> I

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
have a desire to go into your bees and I

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.320 
have a desire to go into your bees and I
don't<00:01:47.030> mean<00:01:47.299> to<00:01:47.420> be<00:01:47.510> ugly<00:01:47.900> when<00:01:48.020> I<00:01:48.110> say<00:01:48.350> this

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
don't mean to be ugly when I say this

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.300 
don't mean to be ugly when I say this
but<00:01:50.330> you<00:01:50.570> probably<00:01:50.900> should<00:01:51.680> not<00:01:51.860> be<00:01:51.920> having

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
but you probably should not be having

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.580 
but you probably should not be having
beatings

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.890 

I<00:01:56.619> think<00:01:57.340> that<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:59.409> is<00:01:59.710> a<00:01:59.820> specific<00:02:00.820> answer<00:02:01.090> to

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
I think that it is a specific answer to

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.289 
I think that it is a specific answer to
that<00:02:02.020> question<00:02:02.470> should<00:02:02.710> I<00:02:02.740> have<00:02:03.010> beans<00:02:03.299> and

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
that question should I have beans and

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.350 
that question should I have beans and
after<00:02:04.540> you<00:02:04.600> have<00:02:04.810> these<00:02:05.080> after<00:02:05.440> you<00:02:05.920> get<00:02:06.100> them

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
after you have these after you get them

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.050 
after you have these after you get them
if<00:02:07.360> you<00:02:07.570> don't<00:02:07.659> have<00:02:07.900> a<00:02:08.100> burning<00:02:09.100> desire<00:02:09.340> to<00:02:09.640> go

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
if you don't have a burning desire to go

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.260 
if you don't have a burning desire to go
into<00:02:10.509> them<00:02:11.040> then<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.250> probably<00:02:12.520> should<00:02:13.120> not

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
into them then you probably should not

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.979 
into them then you probably should not
have<00:02:13.330> beans<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.280> is<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.670> specific<00:02:16.120> answer

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
have beans so that is a specific answer

into<00:05:03.470> a<00:05:03.620> high<00:05:04.660> when<00:05:05.660> I<00:05:05.690> first<00:05:05.990> got<00:05:06.170> bees<00:05:06.440> I<00:05:06.860> was

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
into a high when I first got bees I was

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.510 
into a high when I first got bees I was
obsessed<00:05:08.300> with<00:05:08.420> it<00:05:08.570> I<00:05:08.960> couldn't<00:05:09.770> I<00:05:09.920> want<00:05:10.340> to<00:05:10.430> go

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
into them all the time and beekeepers

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.680 
into them all the time and beekeepers
told<00:05:13.220> me<00:05:13.340> don't<00:05:13.490> go<00:05:13.670> into<00:05:13.850> your<00:05:14.060> hive<00:05:14.300> more

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
than once a week it will disturb them

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.090 
than once a week it will disturb them
there's<00:05:17.480> a<00:05:17.570> lot<00:05:17.810> of<00:05:18.020> things<00:05:18.230> that<00:05:18.530> the<00:05:18.710> humans

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
there's a lot of things that the humans

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.370 
there's a lot of things that the humans
don't<00:05:19.250> know<00:05:19.460> about<00:05:19.550> beings<00:05:20.060> there's<00:05:21.020> a<00:05:21.110> lot<00:05:21.290> of

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
don't know about beings there's a lot of

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.470 
don't know about beings there's a lot of
beekeepers<00:05:21.680> that<00:05:21.920> that<00:05:22.700> act<00:05:22.970> like<00:05:23.150> they<00:05:23.330> know

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
beekeepers that that act like they know

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.780 
beekeepers that that act like they know
it<00:05:23.600> all<00:05:23.800> but<00:05:24.800> there's<00:05:24.980> a<00:05:25.070> lot<00:05:25.280> of<00:05:25.400> things<00:05:25.640> that

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
it all but there's a lot of things that

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.110 
it all but there's a lot of things that
beekeepers<00:05:26.360> do<00:05:26.540> not<00:05:26.750> know<00:05:26.960> about<00:05:27.110> beings<00:05:28.120> and

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
beekeepers do not know about beings and

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.360 
beekeepers do not know about beings and
so<00:05:29.630> I<00:05:29.660> was<00:05:30.050> told<00:05:30.290> don't<00:05:30.650> go<00:05:30.770> into<00:05:30.950> your<00:05:31.160> hive

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
so I was told don't go into your hive

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.210 
so I was told don't go into your hive
more<00:05:31.970> than<00:05:32.320> once<00:05:33.320> a<00:05:33.440> week<00:05:33.470> because<00:05:33.830> you<00:05:33.950> would

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
more than once a week because you would

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.140 
more than once a week because you would
disturb<00:05:34.610> them<00:05:34.790> through<00:05:35.000> too<00:05:35.210> much<00:05:35.830> so<00:05:36.830> I

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
disturb them through too much so I

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.600 
disturb them through too much so I
couldn't<00:05:38.150> wait<00:05:38.390> till<00:05:38.570> I<00:05:38.660> got<00:05:38.780> seven<00:05:39.230> hives<00:05:39.610> so

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
couldn't wait till I got seven hives so

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.510 
couldn't wait till I got seven hives so
I<00:05:40.700> can<00:05:40.880> go<00:05:41.030> into<00:05:41.150> a<00:05:41.270> hive<00:05:41.540> every<00:05:42.110> day<00:05:42.290> I<00:05:42.620> was

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
I can go into a hive every day I was

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.940 
I can go into a hive every day I was
obsessed<00:05:43.970> with<00:05:44.090> it<00:05:44.240> that<00:05:44.780> that's<00:05:45.050> that's<00:05:45.620> the

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
obsessed with it that that's that's the

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.240 
obsessed with it that that's that's the
extreme<00:05:46.400> that's<00:05:46.700> probably<00:05:47.030> not<00:05:47.210> good<00:05:47.770> but<00:05:48.770> but

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250
