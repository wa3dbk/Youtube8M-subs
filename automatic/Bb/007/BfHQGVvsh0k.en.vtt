00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.500
 hi I love today I want to answer tag 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.020
 boy dress sent to celebrate 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.170
 its three-year channel and the 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.279
 hall and the first question is do you do 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.980
 your nails alone 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:33.230
 I just think it's 2 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.220
 how long the enamel lasts in your 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.670
 nails 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.480
 Good, I'll do one after another and already 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.520
 they played 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.190
 but when I really like the nail or not 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.149
 I have time to change it lasts until one 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.829
 week 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.710
 only the times I need to repair the 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.649
 because she can not stand and 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.160
 washing dishes all day right 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:59.300
 3 What is the preferred day of the week for 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:04.580
 to do the nails any dawn with a 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:08.000
 filminho 4 gave a hint of care or 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.310
 Enameled action that for you is infallible 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.380
 if you do not have time to do the nail 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.590
 you can always be passing a base 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.630
 and if you always make the 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.510
 Let the nail rest. 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.370
 of good enameling already taking advantage of 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.730

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.900
 accident on my commercial nail 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.690
 closing the lid of the washing machine 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:37.970
 I'm going to teach you how to fix the tips I 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:42.100
 I'll get the same good one I used 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.240

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.600
 experience and here I come with a 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.810
 an extra brightness to give 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.810
 roof 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:05.640
 sure you do the repair when 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.460

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.140
 cuticles or did not buy any cream 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.960

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.190

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.940
 several of these attacks to the house 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.400

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.630
