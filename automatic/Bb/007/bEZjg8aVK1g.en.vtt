00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.100 
it sort of snuck up on me that I can see
the<00:02:45.530> bicycle<00:02:46.100> as<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.519> form<00:02:46.970> of<00:02:47.150> transport<00:02:47.660> just

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
the bicycle as a form of transport just

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.350 
the bicycle as a form of transport just
forgetting<00:02:48.590> about<00:02:48.799> something<00:02:49.190> for<00:02:49.820> normal

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
forgetting about something for normal

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.410 
forgetting about something for normal

people to do in normal clothes every day

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.550 
people to do in normal clothes every day
and<00:02:53.739> I<00:02:54.739> can<00:02:55.370> see<00:02:55.670> what<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.570> does<00:02:56.750> for<00:02:56.810> for

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
and I can see what it does for for

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.620 
and I can see what it does for for
pollution<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.489> for<00:02:58.700> health<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.480> for

year-on-year<00:03:21.180> out<00:03:21.720> that<00:03:21.870> you<00:03:21.930> need<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.170> see

year-on-year out that you need to see
but<00:03:23.040> at<00:03:23.129> the<00:03:23.220> moment<00:03:23.790> it's<00:03:23.970> still<00:03:24.150> about<00:03:24.569> grant

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
but at the moment it's still about grant

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.960 
but at the moment it's still about grant
income<00:03:25.500> is<00:03:25.650> still<00:03:25.830> about<00:03:26.010> one-off<00:03:26.430> spending

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
income is still about one-off spending

income is still about one-off spending
so<00:03:27.390> it's<00:03:27.540> brilliant<00:03:28.019> that<00:03:28.050> we<00:03:28.170> started<00:03:28.440> that

what<00:04:22.380> we're<00:04:22.530> asking<00:04:22.680> for<00:04:22.919> is<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.370> equivalent

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
what we're asking for is the equivalent

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.750 
what we're asking for is the equivalent
of<00:04:23.940> ten<00:04:24.210> pounds<00:04:24.600> a<00:04:24.690> head<00:04:24.870> so<00:04:25.650> it's<00:04:25.800> not<00:04:25.919> twenty

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
of ten pounds a head so it's not twenty

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.159 
of ten pounds a head so it's not twenty
pounds<00:04:27.060> a<00:04:27.120> head<00:04:27.240> that<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.479> Dutch<00:04:27.630> spent<00:04:27.900> ten

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
pounds a head that the Dutch spent ten

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.620 
pounds a head that the Dutch spent ten
pounds<00:04:28.590> ahead<00:04:28.860> just<00:04:29.580> consistently<00:04:30.389> and<00:04:30.510> to

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
pounds ahead just consistently and to

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.200 
pounds ahead just consistently and to
put<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:30.960> into<00:04:31.110> context<00:04:31.889> that's<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.910> same

you get around and I find that really

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.129 
you get around and I find that really
fascinating<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:48.000> it<00:04:48.419> seems<00:04:48.660> to<00:04:48.750> me<00:04:48.960> that

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
fascinating and it seems to me that

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:50.480 
fascinating and it seems to me that
we're<00:04:49.260> not<00:04:49.349> operating<00:04:49.860> on<00:04:49.979> a<00:04:50.010> level<00:04:50.310> playing

you could trade all that for

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.100 
you could trade all that for
our<00:05:05.500> country<00:05:06.040> getting<00:05:06.490> around<00:05:06.850> by<00:05:07.120> bikes<00:05:07.420> that

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
maybe 10 to 20% of the trips that we

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.870 
maybe 10 to 20% of the trips that we
