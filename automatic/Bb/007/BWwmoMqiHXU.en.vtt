is the snow forecast that we are

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.050 
is the snow forecast that we are
anticipating<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:37.049> if<00:01:37.170> we<00:01:37.799> pull<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.070> up<00:01:38.250> you

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
anticipating here if we pull this up you

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.170 
anticipating here if we pull this up you
can<00:01:39.240> actually<00:01:39.450> see<00:01:40.430> five<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.579> nine<00:01:41.759> inches<00:01:42.030> of

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
can actually see five to nine inches of

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.840 
can actually see five to nine inches of
snow<00:01:42.329> basically<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.930> i-70<00:01:43.590> corridor<00:01:43.850> north

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
snow basically the i-70 corridor north

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.130 
snow basically the i-70 corridor north
where<00:01:45.090> these<00:01:45.210> snow<00:01:45.450> totals<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:45.990> been

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
where these snow totals have been

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.230 
where these snow totals have been
brought<00:01:46.799> down<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.399> will<00:01:47.490> show<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.700> why<00:01:47.970> here

brought down and will show you why here

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.410 
brought down and will show you why here
in<00:01:48.270> just<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.630> second<00:01:49.049> will<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:50.009> kind<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.000> analyze

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
in just a second will in kind of analyze

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.359 
in just a second will in kind of analyze
that<00:01:51.689> here<00:01:51.899> three<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.290> six<00:01:52.530> inches<00:01:52.710> south<00:01:53.130> we

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
that here three to six inches south we

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.280 
that here three to six inches south we
could<00:01:53.579> see<00:01:53.759> some<00:01:53.790> ice<00:01:54.090> accumulation<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.990> maybe

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
could see some ice accumulation of maybe

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.230 
could see some ice accumulation of maybe
about<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.799> tenth<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.340> an<00:01:56.490> inch<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.909> then<00:01:57.000> as<00:01:57.149> you

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
about a tenth of an inch and then as you

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.730 
about a tenth of an inch and then as you
go<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> little<00:01:57.570> farther<00:01:57.840> south<00:01:58.200> down<00:01:58.469> towards

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
go a little farther south down towards

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.100 
go a little farther south down towards
Jasper<00:01:59.250> Louisville<00:01:59.670> Evansville<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.840> could

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
Jasper Louisville Evansville you could

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.810 
Jasper Louisville Evansville you could
see<00:02:01.290> as<00:02:01.409> much<00:02:01.590> as<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> quarter<00:02:02.219> inch<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.700> ice

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
see as much as a quarter inch of ice

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.780 
see as much as a quarter inch of ice

big<00:02:30.430> high<00:02:30.640> pressure<00:02:30.970> system<00:02:31.450> and<00:02:31.570> I'll<00:02:31.660> show

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
big high pressure system and I'll show

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.510 
big high pressure system and I'll show
you<00:02:31.870> where<00:02:32.110> this<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.380> that<00:02:32.590> it's<00:02:33.040> this<00:02:33.220> big

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
you where this is that it's this big

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.100 
you where this is that it's this big
high<00:02:33.730> pressure<00:02:34.030> system<00:02:34.510> that's<00:02:34.690> setting<00:02:34.990> up

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
high pressure system that's setting up

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.780 
high pressure system that's setting up
across<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.500> northern<00:02:36.100> portion<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.670> the

across the northern portion of the
country<00:02:36.970> that's<00:02:37.300> coming<00:02:37.570> out<00:02:37.660> of<00:02:37.720> Canada<00:02:37.990> and

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
country that's coming out of Canada and

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.980 
country that's coming out of Canada and
it's<00:02:38.770> this<00:02:38.920> big<00:02:39.340> system<00:02:40.240> out<00:02:40.360> here<00:02:40.390> out<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.870> our

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
it's this big system out here out to our

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.690 
it's this big system out here out to our
West<00:02:41.230> it's<00:02:41.410> going<00:02:41.590> to<00:02:41.650> kind<00:02:41.770> of<00:02:41.890> continue<00:02:42.370> to

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
West it's going to kind of continue to

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.870 
West it's going to kind of continue to
move<00:02:42.820> off<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.240> the<00:02:43.390> east<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.830> we'll<00:02:45.040> get<00:02:45.670> this

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
move off to the east and we'll get this

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.930 
move off to the east and we'll get this
in<00:02:46.060> motion<00:02:46.270> here<00:02:46.690> over<00:02:46.960> the<00:02:46.990> next<00:02:47.640> 12<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.700> 24

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
in motion here over the next 12 to 24

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.900 
in motion here over the next 12 to 24
hours<00:02:49.330> as<00:02:49.840> we<00:02:49.990> get<00:02:50.140> into<00:02:50.370> tomorrow<00:02:51.370> now<00:02:51.550> we

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
hours as we get into tomorrow now we

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.270 
hours as we get into tomorrow now we
were<00:02:52.090> originally<00:02:52.360> thinking<00:02:52.720> as<00:02:53.170> we<00:02:53.980> get<00:02:54.130> into

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
were originally thinking as we get into

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.830 
were originally thinking as we get into
the<00:02:54.460> daytime<00:02:54.820> hours<00:02:55.000> tomorrow<00:02:55.480> this<00:02:55.690> high

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
the daytime hours tomorrow this high

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.750 
the daytime hours tomorrow this high
would<00:02:56.050> be<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.380> little<00:02:57.010> farther<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.610> north

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
would be a little farther to the north

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.400 
would be a little farther to the north
as<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.240> can<00:02:58.390> see<00:02:58.570> this<00:02:58.720> high<00:02:58.900> is<00:02:58.960> kind<00:02:59.320> of

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
as you can see this high is kind of

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.930 
as you can see this high is kind of
sitting<00:02:59.620> right<00:02:59.830> up<00:03:00.010> here<00:03:00.250> we<00:03:00.670> were<00:03:00.790> actually

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
sitting right up here we were actually

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.520 
sitting right up here we were actually
thinking<00:03:01.180> it<00:03:01.570> would<00:03:01.690> be<00:03:01.720> more<00:03:02.080> up<00:03:02.200> in<00:03:02.350> this

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
thinking it would be more up in this

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.010 
thinking it would be more up in this
range<00:03:02.800> well<00:03:02.950> what<00:03:03.100> happens<00:03:03.670> is<00:03:03.910> as<00:03:04.090> this<00:03:04.660> rich

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
range well what happens is as this rich

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.650 
range well what happens is as this rich
kind<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.500> builds<00:03:06.010> in<00:03:06.160> along<00:03:06.490> this<00:03:06.700> high<00:03:06.940> it'll

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
kind of builds in along this high it'll

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.750 
kind of builds in along this high it'll
actually<00:03:07.900> what<00:03:08.350> we<00:03:08.440> call<00:03:08.470> suppress<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.430> storm

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
actually what we call suppress the storm

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.970 
actually what we call suppress the storm
and<00:03:09.880> it'll<00:03:10.120> suppress<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:10.780> moisture<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.440> this

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
and it'll suppress the moisture and this
