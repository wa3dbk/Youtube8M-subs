00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.029
 they have 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.330
 We arrived at the start of the walk 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.970
 nine days that will take us to the base camp 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.160
 of the everest this region is inhabited 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.670
 by the ethnicity of the Sherpas and by the 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.410
 tourism 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.360
 many converted their homes 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.099
 mountain shelters but also 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.789
 they work carrying cargo to each town 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.739
 with human strength mules or yachts as the 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.160
 only means of transportation here is 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.160
 walking 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.590
 Wow 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.210
 undoubtedly one of the most panoramic days 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.160
 from this trekking you can see the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.860
 left 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.570
 and on the right the lhotse both covered 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.309
 in something that looks like the new one but in 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.379
 reality is a very strong wind that 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.379
 is moving snow on the summits 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.150
 the sherpas consider the mountains 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:26.220
 sacred places and that's why 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.220
 we will receive the blessing of a lama 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:39.869
 and we just received the blessing with 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.850
 the important gay lama who asked him to 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.860
 the mother goddess of the earth who inhabits 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.780
 in the everest that protects us so that 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.119
 the whole group back home healthy and 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.850
 saved the three recommendations that we 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.500
 gave were that we think positive that 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.000
 let's help others whenever we can 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.000
 and that we respect nature 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.119
 we walk an average of 6 hours a day 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.230
 and it is very beautiful to see the landscape 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.960
 changing as we gain altitude 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.330
 after 3000 meters it is necessary 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.790
 that the body adapts slowly to the 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.520
 altitude because you need to produce 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.270
 red blood cells that compensate for the lack of 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.320
 oxygen this process is one of the most 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.630
 important things that we are going to do in the 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.020
 mountain to reach the 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.840
 summit without suffering the famous evils of 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.740
 altitude that include symptoms such as pain 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.500
 of nausea head and so on and that's why 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.470
 that today we are doing this climate 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.960
 action up to four thousand 900 meters but 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.730
 I will continue a little more to follow 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.730
 helping my body in this process 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.540
 a greeting finally from the base camp 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:16.519
 of the everest the starting point for 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.989
 climbing I send all my love from 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:22.150
 here and do not miss the next episode 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.150
 because it will be climbing on the mountain
