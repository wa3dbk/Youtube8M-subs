00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.090 
dustin pedroia has a very specific game
model<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:34.050> we<00:00:34.140> started<00:00:34.410> working<00:00:34.680> with<00:00:34.739> dustin

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
model so we started working with dustin

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.940 
model so we started working with dustin
extensively<00:00:35.790> about<00:00:36.090> two<00:00:36.450> years<00:00:36.600> ago<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.170> he

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
extensively about two years ago and he

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.280 
extensively about two years ago and he
happened<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.280> need<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.700> unique<00:00:39.149> size<00:00:39.510> glove<00:00:39.899> he

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
happened to need a unique size glove he

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.420 
happened to need a unique size glove he
doesn't<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.620> smaller<00:00:40.829> than<00:00:40.950> average<00:00:41.100> heart

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
doesn't have smaller than average heart

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.560 
doesn't have smaller than average heart
he<00:00:41.579> doesn't<00:00:41.820> play<00:00:41.969> smaller<00:00:42.270> than<00:00:42.420> average

he doesn't play smaller than average

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.660 
he doesn't play smaller than average
that's<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:43.050> damn<00:00:43.170> sure<00:00:43.250> but<00:00:44.250> one<00:00:44.399> thing<00:00:44.579> he

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
that's for damn sure but one thing he

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.130 
that's for damn sure but one thing he
does<00:00:44.820> have<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> smaller<00:00:45.270> than<00:00:45.390> average<00:00:45.539> ham<00:00:45.870> so

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
does have a smaller than average ham so

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.990 
does have a smaller than average ham so
as<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> result<00:00:46.500> we've<00:00:47.129> customized<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.760> lot<00:00:47.789> of

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
as a result we've customized a lot of

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.729 
as a result we've customized a lot of
things<00:00:48.180> on<00:00:48.329> Dustin's<00:00:48.780> glove<00:00:48.989> his<00:00:49.230> game<00:00:49.410> models

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
hand is smaller than average so

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.770
