00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:18.260
 we are here in rome today and on land and rice for the presentation of the new gf 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:20.689
 3d panasonic 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:21.919
 santoro 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.919
 much discussed 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.599
 is today the lightest and most compact machine in the world adjectives 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.310
 interchangeable 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.950
 just look at it 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.950
 to realize what I'm talking about 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.830
 I am so compact in the world so light with the built-in flash 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.250
 fracid 11 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.500
 of guide number 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.070
 with interchangeable optics at this time and with the 14 42 roma will be 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.580
 I had 14 millimeters available 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.580
 in this case it also presented a good 25 millimeters 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.190
 a machine that stands out for its compactness 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.150
 the law of attraction 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.150
 salad of time save the date the link of the evening 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.920
 press to start 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.920
 from being commanded and collection 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.220
 civita castellana 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.330
 so for the home on the market you are not 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.909
 via button you are not 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:22.920
 vLC 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.280
 but both 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.500
 idv will hate 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.410
 you will be able to shoot, command death will take you 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.920
 in this way 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.160
 oximetry simply do 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.400
 command everything through lakes 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.820
 they have also been improved 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.770
 jude law the focus 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.370
 appendices 140 reaches zero, a century 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.410
 to focus 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.560
 fir tree 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.040
 where 14 45 14 42 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.160
 zero, 18 seconds is required 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.380
 for mass 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.820
 other things, as we said, two 25mm blogs were presented 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.520
 fixed lay optic 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.540
 which is added to the 45 'already present 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.019
 and who is added to the cream 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.200
 while pissing and we already have verres panasonic it works this we see at a 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.289
 total berenice targets 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:17.339
 illumix owner of which 2 like that 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:20.339
 my time on all interchangeable optical winners 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.019
 pages to be added to the already present gh2 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:28.089
 darren dream of all the interchangeable lumix optics 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.639
 such modernity 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:36.959
 and here it is 25 millimeters equivalent to 50 millimeters in size 35 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:38.999
 the limits 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:41.999
 developed in collaboration between raika lumix 

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:47.259
 that's a s1e4 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:50.529
 thanks also to pineapples or parties with g 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.629
 created with rice developed here also with jute 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.250
 external investment of the glottis which clearly allows to lower the 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:00.249
 reverberation and cancel here on the shadows 

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:04.579
 and those that are reflections this clearly allows an article 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.769
 benefits other than the absolutely new and innovative goal that you 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:08.700
 goes to add up 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.109
 at 45 'rigoni while you are already 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.539
 on the ranch of goals 

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:17.529
 light inside the computer plus large lumix optics park
