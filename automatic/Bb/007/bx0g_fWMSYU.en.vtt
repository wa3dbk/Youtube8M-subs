then<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.560> new<00:02:34.920> growth<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.580> people<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.180> going<00:02:36.660> to

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
then a new growth of people is going to

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.710 
then a new growth of people is going to
appear<00:02:36.960> out<00:02:37.020> of<00:02:37.140> nowhere<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:38.450> that's<00:02:39.450> how<00:02:39.570> it

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
appear out of nowhere and that's how it

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.040 
appear out of nowhere and that's how it
happens<00:02:40.050> it's<00:02:40.200> like<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.380> new<00:02:40.620> cycle<00:02:41.750> now<00:02:42.750> let's

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
happens it's like a new cycle now let's

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.830

they're scared you know they got water

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.240 
they're scared you know they got water
supply<00:03:09.420> you<00:03:09.960> got<00:03:10.140> food<00:03:10.380> supply<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:11.100> will

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
supply you got food supply that will

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.220 
supply you got food supply that will
last<00:03:11.460> them<00:03:11.700> months<00:03:12.300> or<00:03:12.450> even<00:03:12.510> years<00:03:12.960> and<00:03:14.870> in<00:03:15.870> my

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
last them months or even years and in my

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.229 
last them months or even years and in my
opinion<00:03:16.340> that's<00:03:17.340> just<00:03:17.460> going<00:03:17.880> a<00:03:18.000> little<00:03:18.150> too

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
opinion that's just going a little too

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.370 
opinion that's just going a little too
far<00:03:19.459> but<00:03:20.459> in<00:03:20.610> my<00:03:20.760> perspective<00:03:21.350> there<00:03:22.350> is

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
far but in my perspective there is

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.620 
far but in my perspective there is
something<00:03:22.920> would<00:03:23.070> happen<00:03:23.250> something<00:03:23.850> big<00:03:24.120> but

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
something would happen something big but

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.600 
something would happen something big but
it<00:03:24.750> won't<00:03:24.900> destroy<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.500> whole<00:03:25.650> civilization

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
it won't destroy the whole civilization

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.650 
it won't destroy the whole civilization
it'll<00:03:27.540> probably<00:03:27.780> destroy<00:03:28.580> thousands

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
it'll probably destroy thousands

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.600 
it'll probably destroy thousands
hundreds<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.750> thousands<00:03:31.170> of<00:03:31.230> people<00:03:31.610> but

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
hundreds of thousands of people but

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.000 
hundreds of thousands of people but
what's<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.300> difference<00:03:33.450> we<00:03:33.780> always<00:03:34.770> lose<00:03:34.950> a

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
what's the difference we always lose a

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.610 
what's the difference we always lose a
hundred<00:03:35.250> thousand<00:03:35.670> people<00:03:35.820> each<00:03:36.150> month<00:03:37.050> each

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
hundred thousand people each month each

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.949 
hundred thousand people each month each
year<00:03:38.070> there's<00:03:38.970> no<00:03:39.090> difference<00:03:39.480> about<00:03:39.690> that

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
year there's no difference about that

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.120 
year there's no difference about that
