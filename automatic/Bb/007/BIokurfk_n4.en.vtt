like Elmo but I used is a 1.3 megapixel
genius<00:00:18.390> i<00:00:22.250> sling<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.550> he<00:00:23.850> says<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.510> has<00:00:24.750> through

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
genius i sling it he says it has through

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.810 
genius i sling it he says it has through
1.3<00:00:26.760> megapixel<00:00:28.519> sensor<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.929> put<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.610> took<00:00:32.610> it

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
1.3 megapixel sensor I put it I took it

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.020 
1.3 megapixel sensor I put it I took it
out<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.480> took<00:00:33.809> off<00:00:34.170> some<00:00:34.950> part<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.520> base<00:00:35.730> and

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
out I took off some part of the base and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.709 
out I took off some part of the base and
tied<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.020> on<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:38.780> this<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:41.719> lampshade

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
tied it on to this this is a lampshade

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.369 
tied it on to this this is a lampshade
as<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.290> see<00:00:43.550> it's<00:00:44.550> just<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.940> cheap<00:00:45.379> lampshade

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
as you see it's just a cheap lampshade

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.410 
as you see it's just a cheap lampshade
with<00:00:47.370> LED<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.350> got<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.530> may<00:00:49.770> be<00:00:49.829> for<00:00:50.309> 100<00:00:50.969> peso

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
with LED I got it may be for 100 peso

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.029 
with LED I got it may be for 100 peso
that's<00:00:51.690> about<00:00:51.989> two<00:00:52.230> dollars<00:00:52.379> or<00:00:52.800> three

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
dollars and this is my automata book I

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.410 
dollars and this is my automata book I
am<00:00:57.840> teaching<00:00:58.129> introduction<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.609> automata<00:01:00.390> and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
am teaching introduction to automata and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.319 
am teaching introduction to automata and
language<00:01:01.109> theory<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.670> want<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.180> to

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
language theory and I want really to

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.370 
language theory and I want really to
look<00:01:04.580> to<00:01:05.580> seal<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.630> project<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:09.479> text<00:01:10.020> here

look to seal and project the text here
so<00:01:10.710> what<00:01:11.040> i<00:01:11.070> did<00:01:11.460> i<00:01:11.700> bought<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.510> camera<00:01:12.990> by

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
so what i did i bought this camera by

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.910 
so what i did i bought this camera by
the<00:01:13.439> way<00:01:13.619> i<00:01:13.650> have<00:01:13.920> tried<00:01:14.509> this<00:01:15.509> one<00:01:15.810> i<00:01:16.110> have

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
the way i have tried this one i have

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.730 
the way i have tried this one i have
tried<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.310> one<00:01:17.909> i<00:01:18.180> also<00:01:19.080> have<00:01:19.350> tried<00:01:19.710> this

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
tried this one i also have tried this

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.840 
tried this one i also have tried this
one<00:01:20.720> but<00:01:21.720> all<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.900> them<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.860> think<00:01:23.340> maybe

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
one but all of them have I think maybe

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.130 
one but all of them have I think maybe
not<00:01:24.360> through<00:01:24.750> 1.3<00:01:25.560> megapixel<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.520> i<00:01:26.900> got<00:01:27.900> this

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
not through 1.3 megapixel so i got this

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.850 
not through 1.3 megapixel so i got this
through<00:01:28.890> 1.3<00:01:29.670> megapixels<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.570> i<00:01:31.470> tried<00:01:31.829> to

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
through 1.3 megapixels and i tried to

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.510 
through 1.3 megapixels and i tried to
use<00:01:32.990> VLC<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.560> key<00:01:34.770> here<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.570> because<00:01:36.570> my<00:01:37.170> other

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
use VLC the key here is because my other

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.990 
use VLC the key here is because my other
screen<00:01:38.810> capture<00:01:40.009> webcam<00:01:41.009> capture<00:01:41.430> programs

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
screen capture webcam capture programs

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.830 
screen capture webcam capture programs
like<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.600> cup<00:01:43.399> like<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.700> cup<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:47.270> pick<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.570> and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
like a cup like a cup and pick up and

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.800 
like a cup like a cup and pick up and
the<00:01:49.110> other<00:01:49.290> one<00:01:49.619> they<00:01:50.430> don't<00:01:50.700> really<00:01:51.060> give<00:01:51.570> me

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
the other one they don't really give me

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.749 
the other one they don't really give me
the<00:01:52.110> whole<00:01:52.290> distribution<00:01:52.710> but<00:01:53.189> i<00:01:53.250> found<00:01:53.549> out

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
the whole distribution but i found out

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.469 
the whole distribution but i found out
that<00:01:54.229> VLC<00:01:56.240> can<00:01:57.240> give<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.659> really<00:01:57.990> 1.3

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
that VLC can give you really 1.3

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.450 
that VLC can give you really 1.3
megapixels<00:02:01.040> if<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.640> check

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
megapixels if you check

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.229 
megapixels if you check
it's<00:02:05.460> really<00:02:05.729> 1.3<00:02:06.539> megapixels<00:02:07.459> if<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.879> check

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
it's really 1.3 megapixels if you check

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.530 
it's really 1.3 megapixels if you check
tools<00:02:10.640> media<00:02:11.640> information<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:14.540> codec

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
tools media information and codec

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.839 
tools media information and codec
details<00:02:16.099> that<00:02:17.099> will<00:02:17.370> show<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.730> one<00:02:18.150> 280<00:02:19.050> x

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
details that will show you one 280 x

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.520 
details that will show you one 280 x
1024<00:02:21.680> video<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.069> really<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.459> one

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
1024 video so it really is one

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.820 
1024 video so it really is one
megapixels<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.650> just<00:02:25.920> have<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:27.170> aspect<00:02:28.170> ratio

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
megapixels you just have to aspect ratio

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.520 
megapixels you just have to aspect ratio
eight<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.459> sixteen<00:02:30.299> by<00:02:30.599> nine<00:02:30.629> and<00:02:33.019> zoom<00:02:34.019> full

eight to sixteen by nine and zoom full
screen<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:35.780> can<00:02:36.780> point<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.470> my<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:39.390> my<00:02:39.450> book<00:02:39.750> here

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
screen I can point to my to my book here

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:45.350 
screen I can point to my to my book here
and<00:02:41.329> look<00:02:42.329> what<00:02:42.599> goes<00:02:43.049> out<00:02:43.319> of<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.709> monitor<00:02:44.360> so

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
and look what goes out of the monitor so

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.170 
and look what goes out of the monitor so
I<00:02:45.390> can<00:02:45.480> breathe<00:02:45.959> in<00:02:46.230> here<00:02:46.829> and<00:02:47.810> have<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:49.170> very

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
I can breathe in here and have a very

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.759 
I can breathe in here and have a very
bright<00:02:52.700> text<00:02:53.700> in<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.329> monitor<00:02:54.840> as<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.470> see

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
bright text in the monitor as you see

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.030 
bright text in the monitor as you see
here<00:02:56.180> now<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.239> can<00:02:57.720> be<00:02:57.959> reading<00:02:58.380> it's<00:02:58.680> very

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
graph except except M Prime and then it

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.590 
graph except except M Prime and then it
is<00:03:16.859> more<00:03:17.100> clear<00:03:17.400> in<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.940> laptop<00:03:18.389> and

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
therefore it is also clear in the

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.569 
therefore it is also clear in the
projector<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.889> have<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.190> projector<00:03:23.489> here<00:03:24.530> yeah
