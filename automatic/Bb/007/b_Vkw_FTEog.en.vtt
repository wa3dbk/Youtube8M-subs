season and I'm hoping that he plays very
well<00:02:21.330> this<00:02:21.600> season<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.050> can<00:02:22.230> get<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.410> couple

of<00:02:22.740> uniforms<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.280> might<00:02:23.430> pick<00:02:23.580> those<00:02:23.790> up

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
of uniforms and I might pick those up

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.670 
of uniforms and I might pick those up
but<00:02:24.510> this<00:02:24.600> year<00:02:24.810> he<00:02:24.930> does<00:02:25.140> have<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.440> pretty

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
but this year he does have a pretty

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.520 
but this year he does have a pretty
decent<00:02:26.250> card<00:02:26.430> he<00:02:26.550> has<00:02:26.640> 70<00:02:27.090> pays<00:02:27.270> 78<00:02:28.200> defendant

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
decent card he has 70 pays 78 defendant

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.440 
decent card he has 70 pays 78 defendant
and<00:02:28.710> 76<00:02:29.310> head<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.580> does<00:02:29.700> look<00:02:29.850> like<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.030> quality

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
and 76 head and does look like a quality

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.270 
and 76 head and does look like a quality
player<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:31.110> i<00:02:31.170> believe<00:02:31.710> i<00:02:31.740> did<00:02:31.920> pick<00:02:32.070> him<00:02:32.220> up

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
player and i believe i did pick him up

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.860 
player and i believe i did pick him up
for<00:02:32.460> quite<00:02:32.640> cheap<00:02:32.970> only<00:02:33.210> six<00:02:33.450> hundred<00:02:33.750> coins

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
for quite cheap only six hundred coins

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.450 
for quite cheap only six hundred coins
yet<00:02:34.110> so<00:02:34.530> he's<00:02:34.620> definitely<00:02:34.710> worth<00:02:35.040> picking<00:02:35.070> up

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
yet so he's definitely worth picking up

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.730 
yet so he's definitely worth picking up
for<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.730> squad<00:02:36.120> if<00:02:36.330> you<00:02:36.450> want<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.810> non<00:02:37.110> rare<00:02:37.350> BPO

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
for a squad if you want a non rare BPO

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.560 
for a squad if you want a non rare BPO
team<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.430> he<00:02:38.490> definitely<00:02:38.670> does<00:02:39.000> look<00:02:39.240> like<00:02:39.390> a

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
team and he definitely does look like a

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.000 
team and he definitely does look like a
call<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.900> apply<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.320> I<00:02:40.350> can't<00:02:40.590> wait<00:02:40.710> to<00:02:40.740> use

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010
