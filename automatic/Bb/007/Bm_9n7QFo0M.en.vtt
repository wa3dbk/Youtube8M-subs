compared<00:01:03.050> to<00:01:03.199> a<00:01:03.230> USBC<00:01:03.680> deck<00:01:04.009> that's<00:01:04.820> about<00:01:05.409> 3/4

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
compared to a USBC deck that's about 3/4

compared to a USBC deck that's about 3/4
of<00:01:06.499> the<00:01:06.560> size<00:01:06.829> almost<00:01:07.810> pretty<00:01:08.810> weird

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:11.139 

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:14.980 

nothing<00:01:12.139> on<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.350> flaps<00:01:12.590> nothing<00:01:13.539> on<00:01:14.539> the<00:01:14.749> box

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
nothing anyway so then you get to the

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.429 
nothing anyway so then you get to the
cards<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:20.060> there's<00:01:20.810> nothing<00:01:21.079> on<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:21.229> car

work for you if you're not then it might

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:38.859 
work for you if you're not then it might
work<00:01:36.429> the<00:01:37.429> cards<00:01:37.700> like<00:01:37.759> I<00:01:37.819> said<00:01:38.060> are<00:01:38.179> very<00:01:38.209> very

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869

probably<00:01:43.490> don't<00:01:43.669> want<00:01:43.789> this<00:01:43.880> deck

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:02.280 

we<00:01:52.540> spread<00:01:52.810> somewhat<00:01:53.290> decently<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:01.570> they

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
we spread somewhat decently and they

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.770 
we spread somewhat decently and they
