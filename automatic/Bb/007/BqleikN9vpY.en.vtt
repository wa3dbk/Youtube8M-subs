00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
damn it man there are lives at stake I'd

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.250 
damn it man there are lives at stake I'd
be<00:03:31.260> surprised<00:03:31.800> if<00:03:32.160> we<00:03:32.250> could<00:03:32.460> get<00:03:32.580> higher<00:03:32.760> than

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
be surprised if we could get higher than

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.890 
be surprised if we could get higher than
53<00:03:34.260> percent<00:03:34.770> right<00:03:35.070> now<00:03:35.100> then<00:03:35.820> you<00:03:35.910> give<00:03:36.120> me<00:03:36.270> 54

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
53 percent right now then you give me 54

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.160 
53 percent right now then you give me 54
percent<00:03:37.380> on<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.890> double<00:03:38.250> I<00:03:38.430> suppose<00:03:39.300> we<00:03:40.020> could

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
percent on the double I suppose we could

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.940 
percent on the double I suppose we could
go<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.380> 54%<00:03:41.130> for<00:03:41.700> like<00:03:41.850> 80<00:03:42.270> or<00:03:42.630> 90<00:03:43.140> seconds<00:03:43.740> but

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
go to 54% for like 80 or 90 seconds but

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.880 
go to 54% for like 80 or 90 seconds but
then<00:03:44.100> we'd<00:03:44.250> have<00:03:44.720> massive<00:03:45.720> radiation<00:03:46.230> leaks

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
then we'd have massive radiation leaks

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.850 
then we'd have massive radiation leaks
and<00:03:47.250> fire<00:03:48.530> everywhere

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
and fire everywhere

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.090 
and fire everywhere
all<00:03:50.010> right<00:03:50.220> 53<00:03:50.580> percent<00:03:51.150> actually<00:03:52.080> 51<00:03:52.740> percent

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
all right 53 percent actually 51 percent

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.830 
all right 53 percent actually 51 percent
would<00:03:53.250> probably<00:03:53.580> be<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.820> best<00:03:54.030> way<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.240> go<00:03:54.480> and

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
would probably be the best way to go and

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.590 
would probably be the best way to go and
if<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:55.530> look<00:03:55.680> at<00:03:55.770> the<00:03:55.830> data<00:03:56.040> it's<00:03:56.730> virtually
