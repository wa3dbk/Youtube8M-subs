 Ok, then I'll show you how it is. 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.140
 that I did 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.719
 we will simply need the 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.859
 Brush and paint rollers are what you 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.589

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.840
 so continue to watch a tutorial 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.460

 then after you take the book you will 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.780
 Expect to go out to 1 and go to the old vegetable garden 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.060
 but 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:51.930
 I see more or less one of them is a 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:56.520
 there are many institutions that 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.820
 had size looks have a lot of 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.310
 Which two bags does it say 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.200
 guess if you talk about an asset was to sell 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.289

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.320
 joining his aunt he gave one and 70 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.140
 then you painted 16 hairs and go karting 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.569

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.370

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.720
 It'll cut like I'm teaching a video. 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.310
 that you cut will you have 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.310
 will simply fit the parts 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.910
 glue with normal glue 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.800
 glue will they put the trash at home I 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.270
 I'll use hot glue I think it will. 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.060
 be faster 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.100
 There you will be intercalating her. 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.050
 talking hand in the fire is easy just going 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.340
 including one in the other and automatically 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:06.340
 will have long flower also the shape it 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.459
 and so you will do several 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:13.230
 other flowers should realize that the 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.230
 how many gestures you made 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.360
 I made the assembly that on the same floor for me 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.640
 see how I want you to stay 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.590
 The wall has stayed like this only 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.840
 next I did not stick I just went 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.900
 fitting in I'll get one here 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:03.549
 seeing from home you do the following you 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.609
 put each other flower you fit 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:09.189
 within that angle of her and so you go 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:12.670
 fit the way you want sp1 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:16.060
 I'll put the right one because I'll get the 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.940
 Hot glue I'm going to put here and it goes 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:23.169
 to do so I hope you have 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:29.860
 I like it right to do that amount 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:33.460
 I spent where paper rolls in a 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.680
 dream and the result has been that way for 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.740
 Wind I particularly loved the 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.840
 result is easy is one thing 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.970
 disposable you throw away then 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.370
 several things we throw in the trash 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.360
 people can reuse and this is a 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.550
 option 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.650
