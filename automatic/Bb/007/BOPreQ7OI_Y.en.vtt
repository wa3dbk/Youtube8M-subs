00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.580 
another reason why I'm ruling out over
previous<00:03:31.650> fabric<00:03:32.070> of<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.340> chairs<00:03:33.230> so<00:03:34.230> onto

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
previous fabric of the chairs so onto

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.310 
previous fabric of the chairs so onto
non<00:03:35.010> fabric<00:03:35.430> ones<00:03:35.640> try<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.540> find<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.900> chair<00:03:37.170> that

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
non fabric ones try to find a chair that

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.990 
non fabric ones try to find a chair that
has<00:03:37.440> long<00:03:37.650> arm<00:03:37.890> rest<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:38.580> run<00:03:38.730> horizontally

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
has long arm rest that run horizontally

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.840 
has long arm rest that run horizontally
to<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.840> ground<00:03:40.200> before<00:03:40.920> arms<00:03:41.430> are<00:03:41.550> straight

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
to the ground before arms are straight

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.120 
to the ground before arms are straight
and<00:03:42.300> so<00:03:42.480> should<00:03:42.660> your<00:03:42.870> arm<00:03:43.020> recipe<00:03:43.590> not

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
and so should your arm recipe not

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.850 
and so should your arm recipe not
rounded<00:03:44.550> like<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.820> ones<00:03:44.970> in<00:03:45.120> this<00:03:45.239> picture

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
rounded like the ones in this picture

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.890 
rounded like the ones in this picture
also<00:03:46.860> try<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.370> avoid<00:03:47.550> seat<00:03:47.970> cushions<00:03:48.420> or<00:03:48.630> split

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
also try to avoid seat cushions or split

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.449 
also try to avoid seat cushions or split
into<00:03:49.020> different<00:03:49.110> segments<00:03:49.860> like<00:03:50.040> this<00:03:50.220> one

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
into different segments like this one

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.640 
into different segments like this one
because<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.300> plastic<00:03:51.690> or<00:03:51.870> leather<00:03:52.080> material

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
because the plastic or leather material

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.500 
because the plastic or leather material
is<00:03:52.709> tougher<00:03:53.190> if<00:03:53.670> you<00:03:53.790> sit<00:03:53.970> down<00:03:54.000> with<00:03:54.180> bare

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
is tougher if you sit down with bare

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.360 
is tougher if you sit down with bare
legs<00:03:54.840> for<00:03:55.230> joints<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.709> cushions<00:03:56.100> might

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
legs for joints and the cushions might

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.060 
legs for joints and the cushions might
pinch<00:03:56.580> or<00:03:56.790> scrape<00:03:57.090> your<00:03:57.209> scale<00:03:57.540> try<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.590> find<00:03:58.830> C

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
pinch or scrape your scale try to find C

like this one

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.050 
like this one
