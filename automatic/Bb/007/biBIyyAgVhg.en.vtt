00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:05.469
 Y 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.450
 that there are boys and girls what you see in 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.790
 screen is a kind of power rangers 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.790
 good ps for years they're really called 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.940
 ryder truck show climates heroes and rolls 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:25.780
 English English would be like walking by 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.760
 street to walk around house and good to leave the 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.920
 trailer there in a corner for what 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.830
 you want to see it and such among this kind of 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.440
 lesbian roll and I'm going to give you versus 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.100
 well it 's all in Japanese that I can 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.980
 say of the game 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.630
 but that does have many forms of 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.520
 game 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.270
 I think yes, you have to push 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.190
 circle neglects to see my carelessness 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.700
 see to see what options they have 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.530
 you can fight 2 everything I remember not what 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.860
 I know but well not on the same screen is 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.810
 some kind of tekken tag tournament that 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.500
 appear at the moment but good now 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:06.800
 I hope we can teach that modality there 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.350
 many crimes truth many characters 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.470
 As you can see I do not know I do not know 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.300
 series I do not know if a series of hbo that will be 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.550
 well I've been playing the story mode 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.110
 and it's very cool the fighting mode is not 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.940
 not bad a bit repetitive but good 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.150
 that always happens in fighting games 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.710
 but but you can choose different 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.100
 characters I think you do not make a 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.960
 little so repetitive choose something give 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.720
 blows and all that kind of roll these 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.330
 Real photos seems if they are real is that 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.190
 it's real I 've never seen this series my 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.670
 life is like the Japanese power rangers 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.040
 let's choose this robot medium 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.150
 this I think this is to fight with 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.640
 two characters and so what I was 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.560
 counting right now and we're going to choose 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.509
 a Japanese batman batman 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:59.750
 this that it looks so smug 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.270
 deceive them to this and to which more or the 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.119
 just come accompanied or I think that 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.850
 This is to have more strength to know 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.060
 I'm going to leave it alone we're not going to put 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.340
 of another program wins I hope not 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.980
 I won that does not tell me but that I do not 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:21.280
 win from the east that is wearing a hat 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.280
 what map 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.460
 come I leave it in the hands of god and now 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:32.500
 is 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:32.500
 and see how it goes but I wanted to record 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.810
 we are in a park I hope you have not 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.660
 children and do not see good blood there is no 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.500
 blood or anything for the game style of 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.980
 fight for any type of gender 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.170
 of ages we would say 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.110
 although I do not know anything about the series but the 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.190
 game is an entertaining 3d game for 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.810
 the psp you can have fun for what they are 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.350
 those letters 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.860
 ballack 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.230
 I think yes a little yes 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.860
 I think so, but you do well because 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.080
 I'm recording it seems to me because before 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.920
 I was playing and I was going fancy 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.920
 it seems that in slow motion 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.569
 good thing is that they have gone to so many 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.180
 characters that when I was going in the 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.260
 subway the same itself was was 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.810
 playing with different kind of 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.209
 characters the good combos are not so 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.519
 complicated as for what what I've 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.000
 fact 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.000
 have little music 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.940
 my partner is right there but good 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.190
 it does not seem to be stopping in the distance 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.190
 a little bit educated me embarrassing 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.390
 I've beaten it 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.610
 It has not been easy, I do not know what 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.370
 difficulty was surely will be able 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:08.170
 can put more difficult and such we go with 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.819
 Round 2 and with this beautiful green robot 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.909
 what have you done 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.739
 eye would not let him do anything to see if 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.370
 can i get some combo some things 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.370
 impressive 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:24.820
 I think the sword is finished a sword 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:28.500
 a bionic hand 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.500
 very legal years 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:36.669
 come mate help me 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:39.570
 come I changed it the two good 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.570
 work shoot 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.500
 and that I do not like the graphics are 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:49.440
 impressive 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.920
 I think I like it better than this one 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.920
 Zodiac Knight 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.040
 is that the game mode and such is a lot 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.040
 plus 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.169
 much more entertaining with the types of 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.789
 digital characters 2 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.820
 and if it is easy to remove the compounds 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:10.510
 good although it has little band 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.520
 that is movements but good has 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:16.810
 many characters but good 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:19.030
 the khanate to teach a little like that the 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.270
 menu that I think it has not made very clear 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.340
 as I totally recommend it is a 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.940
 good game you can download from this 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.729
 the big bug in google you put it because 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.039
 buying it is impossible since it is a 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:37.840
 game you put that does not come out in the market 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:39.449
 Western for nothing or in the American 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.510
 total 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:44.930
 of the western market 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:47.580
 that I was going to give him ere to move more 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:51.439
 fast but I'm going back 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.439
 back to back 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:00.220
 here we can see the story mode the 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:03.440
 truth is that no no no no you can not 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.780
 help us a lot of what is going but good m 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.419
 here we see how the stadiums or the 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.900
 sites where we fight has several 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:14.690
 good several places to fight and I would 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.970
 I'm going through it and it so entertains me 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:20.210
 It entertains to go fighting in the subway 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:25.020
 while internet and how I speak alone and 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:30.030
 this is versus I do not know if it's a way 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:34.180
 wine online to know I think that that is 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:36.160
 a way with the internet good cool 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.940
 I do not know what's wrong with my baby 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.090
 that is not going at all this is options 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:45.380
 they were 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.850
 the CPU will not be options but I do not know 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.050
 nothing Japanese I'm sorry 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.340
 until the video I hope you have them 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.320
 liked 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.630
 I do not know if I left something good is that 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.820
 I know this series or anything good anymore 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:07:00.650
 yourselves watch the video 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:03.320
 kite you are looking for you judge what it is 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:07.370
 the game decreased sacred yes or no yes 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:09.260
 they lowered the good questions your not 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:13.300
 tomÃ©is most important drug because 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.300
 then you will see strange things like these 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.120
 do not
