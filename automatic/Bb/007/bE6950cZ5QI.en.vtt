00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.769
 good 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.950
 as you see today we 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:10.950
 are 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.710
 lyon 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.830
 the region and I believe touchard between 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.510
 the island of olÃ©ron and there we are facing 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.070
 oceanfront 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.700
 so I decided to talk to you here 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.740
 because I have an idea this morning I saw 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.470
 a failed wreck I'm going to 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.210
 show it gave me right away a 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.940
 flash a message I wanted you 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.290
 forward then it was not I'm going 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.620
 present 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.230
 see this and she is behind me so 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.490
 also that she is there and that made me 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.980
 think a little bit about failure 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.610
 the concept of waste is what I want 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.590
 say that 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.740
 well there are studies that have been 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.780
 made by people who have 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.850
 really try to dissect the 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.350
 life of people who have succeeded people who 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.390
 have failed 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.390
 is what is called failure actually it's 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.840
 not not achieving a goal 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.510
 in the vast majority of people who are 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.910
 say they have failed this is it's a 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.760
 true that it did that those people there 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.640
 have not started a project do not have 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.240
 started and initiated to achieve something 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.000
 thing and that's the immense the immense 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.930
 majority of people so it's not 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.270
 that they failed 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.680
 is that they did not start any 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.840
 start thing 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.420
 what is the relationship with this wreck 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.590
 who behind me 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.659
 well for me it's 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.119
 a bit of the picture of what is happening at 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.560
 a lot of people why what 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.780
 happened with this forest time 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.439
 similarly it did not take 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.509
 the wide 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.210
 she stayed too close to the coast and 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.209
 so she got soggy and so she is 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.890
 remained unsuccessful and in much the same way 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:56.289
 what I had a message from you 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.469
 to transmit is that if you do not want to 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:02.409
 do not risk failure is to take 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.969
 the wide and to take off 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.390
 you have to step away from our 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:10.119
 comfort zones you were going very 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.769
 far in your ambitions and your goals 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.599
 and for that you have to take the first step 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.220
 do not believe this muse the more 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.079
 difficult it's true but at the same time 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.510
 a first step is a second and a 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.340
 third would finish in advance and so this 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.620
 that I want to tell you is that for 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.810
 avoid what are called checks 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.970
 so do not be able to leave 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.860
 not to start do not initiate a 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.790
 project and risk doing a little 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.519
 like this wreck 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.680
 that is, not to move and to 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.099
 staying on the status quo is to take the 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.290
 large 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.170
 now towards my goals and 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.060
 legs 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.099
 you can do it and that's the message 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.239
 that I wanted to tell you where I live it's 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.239
 a very good day soon after
