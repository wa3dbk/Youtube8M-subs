investigating suspicious objects so what
it's<00:01:51.420> doing<00:01:51.690> is<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.960> sending<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.260> robot

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
it's doing is it's sending the robot

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.500

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
right but what they're doing is they're

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.359 
right but what they're doing is they're
going<00:02:04.080> into<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.290> dangerous<00:02:04.649> situation<00:02:04.710> and

these robots are actually helping to

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.809

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
certainly the days of robots being very

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.729 
certainly the days of robots being very
very<00:02:32.939> expensive<00:02:33.569> in<00:02:33.840> these<00:02:33.989> closed<00:02:34.290> off<00:02:34.470> rooms

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
very expensive in these closed off rooms

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.559 
very expensive in these closed off rooms

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
biggest advances are probably going to

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.089 
biggest advances are probably going to
be<00:03:00.180> in<00:03:00.420> mobility<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.590> we're<00:03:01.739> going<00:03:01.859> to<00:03:01.920> come

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
be in mobility that we're going to come

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.849 
be in mobility that we're going to come
much<00:03:02.340> much<00:03:02.609> more<00:03:02.879> mobile<00:03:03.239> as<00:03:03.569> opposed<00:03:04.049> to<00:03:04.290> the

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
much much more mobile as opposed to the

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.199 
much much more mobile as opposed to the

fixed there are going to become also

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:21.470 
fixed there are going to become also
much<00:03:10.620> more<00:03:10.650> autonomous

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.180 

autonomy<00:03:22.480> drives<00:03:22.930> down<00:03:23.140> costs<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.860> it<00:03:24.040> gives

you greater functionality is a big push

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.340 
you greater functionality is a big push
now<00:03:25.990> to<00:03:26.200> make<00:03:26.530> things<00:03:26.710> more<00:03:27.120> autonomous

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
now to make things more autonomous
