00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
got it's got a nice immediate taste the

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.600 
got it's got a nice immediate taste the
very<00:01:41.200> when<00:01:41.440> you<00:01:41.530> take<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.830> first<00:01:42.010> swig<00:01:42.370> it's

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
very when you take the first swig it's

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.730 
very when you take the first swig it's
good<00:01:42.820> but<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.510> aftertaste<00:01:44.020> kicks<00:01:44.410> in<00:01:44.560> pretty

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
good but the aftertaste kicks in pretty

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.440 
good but the aftertaste kicks in pretty
fast<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.250> it<00:01:45.370> ruins<00:01:45.730> the<00:01:45.820> whole<00:01:45.880> thing<00:01:46.180> the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
fast and it ruins the whole thing the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.790 
fast and it ruins the whole thing the
entire<00:01:46.660> experience<00:01:47.020> just<00:01:47.230> go<00:01:47.350> down<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.680> hill

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
entire experience just go down the hill

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.130 
entire experience just go down the hill
so<00:01:48.460> I<00:01:48.490> personally<00:01:49.120> say<00:01:49.330> avoid<00:01:49.450> this<00:01:49.810> at<00:01:50.020> all

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
so I personally say avoid this at all

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.250 
so I personally say avoid this at all
costs<00:01:50.940> it's<00:01:51.940> not<00:01:52.090> worth<00:01:52.270> it<00:01:52.420> but<00:01:52.630> but<00:01:52.900> that

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
costs it's not worth it but but that

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.470 
costs it's not worth it but but that
