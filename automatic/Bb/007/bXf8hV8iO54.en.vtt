00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:08.220
 I'm going to teach you how to make these rolls 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.650
 super good and super easy for a photo 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.270
 what we are going to occupy is going to be that it gives you 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.280
 sugar cookies half bar of cheese 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.260
 half cream about creativity one 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.730
 vanilla spoon a lemon a quarter 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.950
 of a cup of sugar a quarter cup 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.330
 water and half a cup of sour cream first 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.119
 let's grab our bag now 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.849
 prepared sugar cookies and what 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.009
 let's continue to step and as he says 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.950
 in my case it would be that you had to 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.110
 add water and butter then let's go 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.810
 to grab our mold of cupcakes and 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.280
 let's put the upside we will put 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.110
 of butter and then we're going to put the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.420
 little pieces of cupcakes we're going to 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.250
 put it that way super well instead of putting them 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.100
 as we are typically going to put it upside down 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.470
 let's grab a bit of masses and 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.560
 we 're going to put it up doing it like this 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:55.020
 like a little leaf like putting them like that 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.200
 like a hat type to stay 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.140
 like a pot if getting in like 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.110
 I'm doing and that's how we do all 6 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.670
 leave for 12 little things but 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.979
 depending on there are also cookies of those 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.180
 they already sell them after I go 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.680
 to put in the oven 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.780
 and when it is 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.510
 we have to get it super fast from 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.940
 mold because if it is not going to stay stuck 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.800
 and hard there is what he said and right now they are 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.140
 selling many of those cookies in the 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.880
 shop we installed well easy not us 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.910
 it occupies buying them and nothing else can 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.350
 do with me right now and for the 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.720
 part let's grab the grenetina and 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.670
 let's heat the water let's take 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.440
 the big tub packet and we're going to 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.380
 beat carefully so you do not 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.380
 lose like what is going to get hard 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.860
 on the cream cheese then the vanilla 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.860
 the sugar 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.750
 the lemon 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.520
 legos grab the sour cream and for 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.500
 last again we're going to grab the 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.620
 grenetina that have to have passed five 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.320
 minutes we're going to start super good 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.840
 and taking care of the lumps by removing them and 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.070
 this is how it is as we think milestone already 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.420
 when they have left the little rolls 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.650
 this had already happened a long time ago we are going to 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.600
 grab the Sicilians were left 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.580
 exactly tailored we're going to cut out 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.780
 with the scissors I'm going to grab two 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.240
 spoonfuls of the cheese creamer and 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.880
 he had put on and with half to remain 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.740
 as good paradito will not be successful 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.540
 I'm going to be like that and stir for 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.150
 that is planito and it is not like this everything 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.680
 ugly and so I will do all those who 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.959
 They left 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.670
 two tablespoons and then I'm going as well as 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.299
 beat to make bubbles and 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.299
 let it be clear 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.860
 and this cream cheese is super good 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.349
 well that cream is then on top of the 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.450
 cheese cake exactly this cake 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.610
 of cheese is rather super good and 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.819
 well then we're going to put it in the fridge 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.769
 freezer and now I got in for two hours 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.219
 already when they have left if they should be seen 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.109
 so pretty and I'll put filling 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.430
 to decorate I'm going to put strawberries and not 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.079
 believe that the strawberry were made to 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.120
 to lose my nothing is to buy strawberries 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.829
 frozen because they must 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.859
 right now those who look white and 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:21.000
 used is not that they were frozen and 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.000
 good and this is how they are 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.260
 I hope you liked it and really what 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.209
 do because it's super easy super 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.209
 good and super fast bye 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.129

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.200
