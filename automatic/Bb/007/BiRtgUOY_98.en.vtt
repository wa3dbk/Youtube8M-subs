00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.920
 We're back with field magazines and 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.169
 Now let's talk about cultivating 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.439
 greenhouse greenhouses 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:22.140
 the system has many advantages 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.260
 the farmer spends less on control 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.900
 pest and disease and can produce the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.310
 year so the activity guarantees 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.650
 more income 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.710
 who said peppers can not be 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.440
 cultivated with less pesticide family 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.129
 me zone of ibitinga sÃ£o paulo says that 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.799
 yea 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.309
 on the site the chilies are grown in 

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:46.379
 greenhouses with irrigation system ferti 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.799
 which carries the nutrients using water 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.489
 conductive to the exact measurement for each 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:53.070
 foot 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.860
 besides saving water is a resource 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.830
 increasingly scarce people 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.510
 uniform fertilization because in the hand a 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.519
 time and will do an hour in the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.680
 plant a little more or a little less 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.810
 the greenhouse chili and do not comment 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.710
 differentiated and does not support the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.740
 the direct sun and neither rain it in the field 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.859
 they spoil easily and in the greenhouse and 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.689
 can produce both at the time of 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:21.240
 winter that does not go out in the field 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.159
 summer season where you are most likely to 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.409
 rainfall also decreases the amount of 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.780
 pulverization of the amount of 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.460
 in the greenhouse is half in the field to it 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.439
 you go against the field produces 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.270
 always what is being planted in the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.399
 field then you always get the job 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.039
 family ensures high-quality peppers 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.799
 without the need for much 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.539
 pesticides we also works one 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.939
 week with biological 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.679
 the other week with a chemist and comes 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.109
 alternating then today you pick up 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:52.079
 pimental ours a tomato if analyze it 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:54.329
 precisely it will not appear and 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.249
 formerly used in vegetables as well. 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.200
 too much systemic poison today is not today. 

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:00.299
 more is contact you making a greenhouse 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.880
 thinking of everything before you do is not only 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.819
 make screen fence bringing a 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.270
 well-irrigated one moult with 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:12.180
 nebulization and working 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.580
 not letting pest research create root 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.890
 always controlling otherwise you will have a 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.590
 that said product is not more organic 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.180
 a far less poison today than the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.730
 people today search a farming 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.500
 precision 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.480
 even though it is small, the first is a 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.379
 culture that can not go wrong is a 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.510
 lap 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:32.319
 always all right care you form 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.360
 an apparent beautiful mex adult with 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.730
 quality production of this history of 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.980
 London model has a thousand square meters 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.319
 and the producers of this site expect 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.120
 pick a thousand and 500 boxes of chili 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.900
 they even developed a new 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.829
 technology to improve mowing here in 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.230
 field right 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.079
 already what he invented here because it is so 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.129
 hard to work with 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.410
 crouched by the climb rate Quinho 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.290
 cares can leave great because it goes 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.510
 consumed organic matter 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.269
 so we do what the body does 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.760
 authorizing the development of the 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:09.160
 here and they end up working and today everyone 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.829
 the tinga producers are already zone 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.440
 years it is that today it cuts the yew and 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.629
 something that always gets until it's cpj 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.030
 screen for fifa not down 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.400
 business is good thank you in 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.200
 they are investing in 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.640
 new greenhouses to increase 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.459
 productivity 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.919
 in this bow they expect to reap two 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.669
 thousand and 500 boxes of chili in the year 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:34.060
 comes 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:37.440
 quality product since even the seedlings 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:41.859
 are traced and the end consumer 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.530
 thanks that 3a is a chile it does not 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:47.560
 it may be defective it is usually 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.230
 thicker it is much used in tempering 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.950
 in ready-made dishes so cutting has to 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.930
 to be forever to them is more the ford one 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.989
 dish decoration 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.230
 here comes the 2-2 years in fact it 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.470
 remains straight only slightly smaller 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.579
 which would give less use to a 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:11.650
 dish garnish 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:16.450
 Then I'm 11 and he's usually crooked. 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:19.180
 it is not thick some defect it 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.180
 this type is already used most often in 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.880
 restaurants for them and poke where not 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.760
 will be presented neither the size nor the 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.620
 family farming is 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.280
 one of the best deals we have 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.710
 saw review can range from 8 reais 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.010
 beginning of January up to 90 reais 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.220
 on the peak in August and September but the people 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:45.810
 gives an average of 15 to 20 reais per box 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.810
 It's already a big deal.
