okay let's get started with this one

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.779 
okay let's get started with this one
miles<00:00:22.020> per<00:00:22.230> gallon<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:23.100> need<00:00:23.250> two<00:00:23.430> pieces<00:00:23.609> of

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
miles per gallon you need two pieces of

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.040 
miles per gallon you need two pieces of
information<00:00:24.380> recorded<00:00:25.380> accurately<00:00:26.779> to<00:00:27.779> get

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
information recorded accurately to get

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.609 
information recorded accurately to get
this<00:00:28.199> calculation<00:00:28.830> done<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.400> first<00:00:29.640> one<00:00:29.849> is

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
this calculation done the first one is

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.229 
this calculation done the first one is
that<00:00:32.750> no<00:00:33.750> matter<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.770> per<00:00:35.340> display<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.059> first

that no matter is per display the first

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.160 
that no matter is per display the first
one<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:37.469> need<00:00:37.620> your<00:00:38.190> mileage<00:00:42.020> from<00:00:43.020> your

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
one is you need your mileage from your

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.240 
one is you need your mileage from your
AMA<00:00:43.320> from<00:00:44.010> your<00:00:44.250> odometer<00:00:44.460> on<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.510> usually

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
AMA from your odometer on it usually

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.090 
AMA from your odometer on it usually
there<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.430> little<00:00:47.640> trip<00:00:47.969> counter<00:00:49.100> that

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
there is a little trip counter that

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.139 
there is a little trip counter that
displays<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.410> number<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.649> miles<00:00:52.890> since<00:00:53.850> last

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
displays the number of miles since last

displays the number of miles since last
reset<00:00:54.960> now<00:00:56.210> you<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.480> make<00:00:57.629> sure<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:58.109> you

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
reset now you have to make sure that you

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.040 
reset now you have to make sure that you
reset<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.030> when<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.149> fill<00:01:00.329> up<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.600> gas<00:01:00.780> tank

reset it when you fill up the gas tank

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.690 
reset it when you fill up the gas tank
and<00:01:02.059> between<00:01:03.059> two<00:01:03.239> Phillips<00:01:03.600> say<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:05.519> have

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
and between two Phillips say you have

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.330 
and between two Phillips say you have
162<00:01:08.700> miles<00:01:09.600> how<00:01:10.080> about<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.439> say<00:01:11.280> you

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
162 miles how about that say you

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.120 
162 miles how about that say you
recorded<00:01:11.880> 162<00:01:12.780> miles<00:01:13.070> between<00:01:14.070> two<00:01:14.490> Phillips

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
the second piece of information that you

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.440 
the second piece of information that you
need<00:01:19.280> is<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:21.479> volume<00:01:22.140> or<00:01:22.470> amount<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:24.140> gas<00:01:25.140> that

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
need is the volume or amount of gas that

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.859 
need is the volume or amount of gas that
your<00:01:27.450> vehicle<00:01:27.900> consumed<00:01:28.350> over<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.549> same<00:01:29.869> 162

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
your vehicle consumed over the same 162

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.310 
your vehicle consumed over the same 162
my<00:01:31.110> distance<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:33.390> do<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:35.390> it<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.689> probably

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
my distance to do that it is probably

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.740 
my distance to do that it is probably
the<00:01:37.409> best<00:01:37.680> thing<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.979> do<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.759> go<00:01:38.909> from<00:01:39.240> full

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
the best thing to do is to go from full

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.499 
the best thing to do is to go from full
tank<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.530> full<00:01:40.770> tank<00:01:41.130> again<00:01:41.400> because<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.360> it's

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
tank to full tank again because if it's

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.499 
tank to full tank again because if it's
not<00:01:42.600> full<00:01:43.350> it's<00:01:44.070> really<00:01:44.159> hard<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.820> get<00:01:45.270> started

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
not full it's really hard to get started

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.960 
not full it's really hard to get started
from<00:01:45.930> half<00:01:46.259> a<00:01:46.380> tank<00:01:46.590> consume<00:01:47.280> some<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.759> gas

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
from half a tank consume some of the gas

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.350 
from half a tank consume some of the gas
and<00:01:48.240> then<00:01:49.200> refill<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.430> exactly<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.149> same

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
and then refill it to exactly the same

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.980 
and then refill it to exactly the same
level<00:01:52.460> it's<00:01:53.460> not<00:01:53.670> happening<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.780> best

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
level it's not happening so the best

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.550 
level it's not happening so the best
thing<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.470> do<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.070> go<00:01:56.250> from<00:01:57.170> full

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
thing to do is go from full

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.170 
thing to do is go from full
that's<00:02:00.190> a<00:02:00.340> you<00:02:00.520> full<00:02:01.320> full<00:02:02.320> time<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.680> full<00:02:02.890> time

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
that's a you full full time to full time

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.730 
that's a you full full time to full time
and<00:02:04.180> when<00:02:04.479> you<00:02:04.600> do<00:02:04.750> so<00:02:04.960> you<00:02:05.200> can<00:02:06.159> see<00:02:06.400> on<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.790> on

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
and when you do so you can see on the on

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.590 
and when you do so you can see on the on
the<00:02:10.170> gas<00:02:11.170> stations<00:02:11.760> counter<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:12.970> maybe<00:02:13.360> you

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
the gas stations counter that maybe you

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.960 
the gas stations counter that maybe you
had<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:14.260> don't<00:02:14.440> know<00:02:14.790> 5.4<00:02:16.170> gallons<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.350> fuel

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
had I don't know 5.4 gallons of fuel

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.449 
had I don't know 5.4 gallons of fuel
consumed<00:02:18.970> by<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.150> vehicle<00:02:19.630> over<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.110> same

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
consumed by the vehicle over the same

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.580 
consumed by the vehicle over the same
162<00:02:21.459> mile<00:02:21.670> distance<00:02:22.180> so<00:02:23.080> what<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.410> do<00:02:23.560> then

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
162 mile distance so what you do then

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.220 
162 mile distance so what you do then
with<00:02:24.280> your<00:02:24.430> calculator<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:25.150> you<00:02:25.810> do<00:02:25.959> one

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
with your calculator is you do one

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:37.490 
with your calculator is you do one
division<00:02:27.660> 162<00:02:28.660> miles<00:02:31.350> divided<00:02:32.350> by<00:02:32.910> 5<00:02:33.910> point<00:02:35.130> 4

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
division 162 miles divided by 5 point 4

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.380 
division 162 miles divided by 5 point 4
gallons<00:02:38.670> let's<00:02:39.670> say<00:02:39.850> what<00:02:40.030> does<00:02:40.120> that<00:02:40.150> equal

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
gallons let's say what does that equal

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.300 
gallons let's say what does that equal
to

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
to

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.840 
to
it<00:02:42.310> was<00:02:42.430> calculator<00:02:43.060> 162<00:02:44.069> divided<00:02:45.069> by<00:02:45.250> 5<00:02:45.550> point

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
it was calculator 162 divided by 5 point

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.350 
it was calculator 162 divided by 5 point
4<00:02:46.170> equals<00:02:47.170> 30<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:50.260> that's<00:02:50.470> 30<00:02:50.860> miles<00:02:51.360> per

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
4 equals 30 so that's 30 miles per

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.920 
4 equals 30 so that's 30 miles per
gallon

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930

amount you got out of it

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:13.410 
amount you got out of it
say<00:04:06.659> you<00:04:07.659> had<00:04:09.599> 403<00:04:10.599> kilometres<00:04:12.209> okay<00:04:13.209> because

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
say you had 403 kilometres okay because

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.590 
say you had 403 kilometres okay because
if<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.859> final<00:04:15.099> amount<00:04:15.400> is<00:04:15.579> expressed<00:04:16.030> per<00:04:16.209> 100

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
if the final amount is expressed per 100

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.180 
if the final amount is expressed per 100
kilometer<00:04:17.049> you're<00:04:17.530> going<00:04:17.650> to<00:04:17.709> have<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:17.919> divide

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
kilometer you're going to have to divide

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.099 
kilometer you're going to have to divide
it<00:04:18.250> by<00:04:18.579> a<00:04:18.850> hundred<00:04:19.209> right<00:04:19.660> away

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
it by a hundred right away

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.890 
it by a hundred right away
so<00:04:20.669> when<00:04:21.669> you<00:04:21.789> divide<00:04:22.030> it<00:04:22.240> by<00:04:22.389> a<00:04:22.419> hundred<00:04:22.570> you

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
so when you divide it by a hundred you

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.580 
so when you divide it by a hundred you
shift<00:04:23.380> decimal<00:04:23.889> point<00:04:24.240> two<00:04:25.240> spots<00:04:25.570> over<00:04:25.900> so

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
shift decimal point two spots over so

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.159 
shift decimal point two spots over so
you<00:04:27.160> have<00:04:27.370> a<00:04:27.610> four<00:04:28.000> point<00:04:28.270> zero<00:04:28.360> three<00:04:28.930> a

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
you have a four point zero three a

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.659 
you have a four point zero three a
number<00:04:30.010> to<00:04:30.130> work<00:04:30.310> with<00:04:30.930> and<00:04:32.550> you're<00:04:33.550> also

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
number to work with and you're also

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.730 
number to work with and you're also
gonna<00:04:33.880> need<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.330> record<00:04:35.110> the<00:04:36.449> volume<00:04:37.449> of<00:04:37.740> the

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
gonna need to record the volume of the

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.250 
gonna need to record the volume of the
gas<00:04:38.770> that<00:04:39.340> you<00:04:41.400> put<00:04:42.400> into<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:42.699> vehicle<00:04:43.260> say

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
gas that you put into the vehicle say

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.339

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
gun on the gas station clicks you set it

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.909 
gun on the gas station clicks you set it
to<00:05:00.220> refill<00:05:00.849> and<00:05:01.090> when<00:05:01.690> it<00:05:01.810> reaches<00:05:02.380> a<00:05:02.410> point<00:05:02.680> in

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
to refill and when it reaches a point in

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:06.719 
to refill and when it reaches a point in
the<00:05:03.039> gas<00:05:03.190> tank<00:05:03.400> it<00:05:04.360> it<00:05:05.229> cuts<00:05:05.500> off<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:05.860> fuel<00:05:06.490> and

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
the gas tank it it cuts off the fuel and

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.500 
the gas tank it it cuts off the fuel and
the<00:05:06.880> and<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.950> gun<00:05:09.130> clicks<00:05:09.460> so<00:05:10.030> you<00:05:10.120> go<00:05:10.270> from

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
the and the gun clicks so you go from

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.200 
the and the gun clicks so you go from
one<00:05:10.690> click<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:11.380> one<00:05:11.500> click<00:05:11.770> full<00:05:12.220> to<00:05:12.669> full<00:05:12.910> and

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
one click to one click full to full and

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.540 
one click to one click full to full and
say<00:05:13.990> put<00:05:14.260> in<00:05:14.410> thirty<00:05:14.710> eight<00:05:14.860> liters<00:05:15.190> of<00:05:15.370> gas

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
say put in thirty eight liters of gas

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.129 
say put in thirty eight liters of gas
and<00:05:16.590> what<00:05:17.590> you<00:05:17.710> do<00:05:17.860> is<00:05:18.849> very<00:05:19.090> simple<00:05:19.539> you<00:05:19.720> do

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
and what you do is very simple you do

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:22.650 
and what you do is very simple you do
another<00:05:20.380> division<00:05:20.710> here<00:05:21.300> because<00:05:22.300> this<00:05:22.479> one

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
another division here because this one

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.010 
another division here because this one
is<00:05:22.810> expressed<00:05:23.580> volume<00:05:24.580> over<00:05:25.090> distance<00:05:25.479> so<00:05:25.930> you

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
is expressed volume over distance so you

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:31.070 
is expressed volume over distance so you
put<00:05:26.260> the<00:05:26.349> volume<00:05:26.530> up<00:05:26.830> top<00:05:27.240> 38<00:05:28.240> liters<00:05:28.599> over

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
put the volume up top 38 liters over

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.560 
put the volume up top 38 liters over
4.03<00:05:32.760> because<00:05:33.760> four<00:05:33.970> hundred<00:05:34.270> and<00:05:34.419> three

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
4.03 because four hundred and three

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.750 
4.03 because four hundred and three
kilometers<00:05:35.169> is<00:05:35.380> four<00:05:35.949> point<00:05:36.220> zero<00:05:36.280> three

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
kilometers is four point zero three

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.080 
kilometers is four point zero three
hundred<00:05:37.539> kilometers<00:05:38.139> okay<00:05:38.740> so<00:05:39.639> four<00:05:39.849> point

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
hundred kilometers okay so four point

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.590 
hundred kilometers okay so four point
zero<00:05:40.150> three

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
zero three

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.400 
zero three
hundred<00:05:42.790> kilometers<00:05:44.260> okay

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
hundred kilometers okay

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.470 
hundred kilometers okay
I<00:05:45.440> needed<00:05:45.830> a<00:05:45.920> division<00:05:46.310> you're<00:05:47.180> gonna<00:05:47.330> get

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.480 
I needed a division you're gonna get

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.100 
I needed a division you're gonna get
another<00:05:47.690> number<00:05:47.930> out<00:05:48.170> of<00:05:48.320> it<00:05:48.790> 38<00:05:49.810> divided<00:05:50.810> by

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
another number out of it 38 divided by

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.410 
another number out of it 38 divided by
four<00:05:51.620> point<00:05:52.010> zero<00:05:52.100> three<00:05:52.610> and<00:05:53.470> that<00:05:54.470> equals<00:05:54.860> to

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
four point zero three and that equals to

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:02.100 
four point zero three and that equals to
nine<00:05:56.420> point<00:05:56.840> four<00:05:58.600> liters<00:05:59.600> over<00:06:00.230> a<00:06:00.260> hundred

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
nine point four liters over a hundred

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.440 
nine point four liters over a hundred
kilometer<00:06:03.160> so<00:06:04.160> that's<00:06:04.610> how<00:06:04.730> you<00:06:04.790> can<00:06:05.030> check

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450 
kilometer so that's how you can check

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.850 
kilometer so that's how you can check
your<00:06:05.630> fuel<00:06:05.840> economy<00:06:06.140> and<00:06:06.910> I<00:06:08.740> recommend<00:06:09.740> that

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
your fuel economy and I recommend that

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.760 
your fuel economy and I recommend that
you<00:06:10.040> do<00:06:10.370> so<00:06:10.580> to<00:06:10.640> people<00:06:11.540> tap<00:06:11.690> on<00:06:11.870> things<00:06:12.170> to

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
you do so to people tap on things to

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.530 
you do so to people tap on things to
make<00:06:12.950> sure<00:06:12.980> that<00:06:13.190> your<00:06:13.520> vehicle<00:06:14.180> is<00:06:14.270> not

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:14.540 
make sure that your vehicle is not

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:21.130 
make sure that your vehicle is not
consuming<00:06:16.000> gas<00:06:17.000> excessively<00:06:19.510> if<00:06:20.510> it<00:06:20.720> does<00:06:20.900> so

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.140 
consuming gas excessively if it does so

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.610 
consuming gas excessively if it does so
you<00:06:21.830> might<00:06:22.010> have<00:06:22.160> some<00:06:22.570> mechanical<00:06:23.620> problems

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
you might have some mechanical problems

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.590 
you might have some mechanical problems
or<00:06:25.400> maybe<00:06:25.610> as<00:06:25.820> simple<00:06:26.000> as<00:06:26.300> a<00:06:26.510> flat<00:06:26.960> tire<00:06:27.260> so

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
or maybe as simple as a flat tire so

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.690 
or maybe as simple as a flat tire so
that's<00:06:29.600> right<00:06:29.750> useful<00:06:30.530> to<00:06:30.680> check<00:06:31.070> your<00:06:31.490> fuel

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.700 
that's right useful to check your fuel

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.760 
that's right useful to check your fuel
economy<00:06:31.970> for<00:06:32.360> example<00:06:32.450> and<00:06:32.960> that's<00:06:33.530> exactly

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
economy for example and that's exactly

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.890 
economy for example and that's exactly
how<00:06:34.070> you<00:06:34.130> do<00:06:34.310> it<00:06:34.400> one<00:06:34.940> division<00:06:35.240> with<00:06:35.540> two

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
how you do it one division with two

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.810 
how you do it one division with two
pieces<00:06:36.080> of<00:06:36.260> numbers<00:06:36.620> and<00:06:36.830> a<00:06:37.400> little<00:06:37.640> bit<00:06:37.730> of

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820 
pieces of numbers and a little bit of

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.020 
pieces of numbers and a little bit of
attention<00:06:38.050> how<00:06:39.050> you<00:06:39.110> get<00:06:39.520> or<00:06:40.520> when<00:06:40.730> you<00:06:40.850> get

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
attention how you get or when you get

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.590 
attention how you get or when you get
the<00:06:41.380> distance<00:06:42.380> and<00:06:42.620> when<00:06:42.980> you<00:06:43.100> get<00:06:43.280> the<00:06:43.600> amount

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
the distance and when you get the amount

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.960 
the distance and when you get the amount
of<00:06:44.720> gas
