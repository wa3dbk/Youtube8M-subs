00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.500
 and in fact what is true by alex the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.210
 spot it's you who will decide when 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.560
 is that the enemies will reappear 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.420
 there you saw that in the small 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.530
 window to nobody there you go 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.240
 in the same place as me in the video 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.280
 you jump on the small edge of the 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.380
 fed who is here here you come out here 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.270
 until you see the little green wall see here 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.220
 on the left and there you go down and the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.930
 enemies they will have spawn then here 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.759
 wanted to kill all and you start again 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.470
 and frankly it's really a spot 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.390
 which is very interesting to watch 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.220

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.360
 it's really a crazy thing 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.430
 there as soon as you have to kill the enemies 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.350
