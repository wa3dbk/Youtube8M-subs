00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.090
 in our time so many models have divorced 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.520
 and even more photographers and all because 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.530
 SLR cameras have become available and their 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.400
 quality characteristic is so 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.820
 fascinate 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.249
 I want to give it to me right away 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.099
 seller all the money earned for it 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:22.409
 miracle and if before many were afraid 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.810
 budget DSLRs you even now 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:29.009
 experienced profile will always find differences in 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.499
 pictures between nikon d300 and no dc psto 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:35.039
 and here in my hands is the dream of any 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:38.399
 novice photographer award winner 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:43.399
 best beginner reflex camera 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.399
 level nikon d3 300 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.800
 surely having rummaged the internet to 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.130
 you can still find sales dates 200 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.409
 save 150 dollars but let's all 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.340
 let's see what the difference is 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.430
 of our conversation 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.920
 from its predecessor first processor in 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.039
 case with a bet or 200 we get expeed 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.930
 3 and catch guides 3 300 fourth 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:24.080
 version it gives speed boost 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.659
 continuous shooting of 5 shots against four 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.360
 predecessor video full hd 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.899
 You can now shoot up to 60 frames per 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.869
 give me a sec 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.580
 slightly increased and the matrix is ​​of course not 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.729
 will affect the quality of the photo 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.530
 but we all know what the matrix is 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.380
 the more the better 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.020
 so definitely this course compared 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.459
 I will add that in d3 300 is much wider 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.149
 iso range 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:53.060
 if in d3 200 the maximum iso was 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.069
 it seems 6,400 now we have a stock 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.659
 up to 12,800 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:01.069
 and we can expand the war up to 25600 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.920
 Of course there is noise in the frame 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.000
 but the blessing did not spoil the detail 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.830
 you will agree 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.410
 nicer to store in the album pictures with 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.330
 good detail than to save simple 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.459
 soap photos also added 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.650
 wireless connectivity 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.099
 remote controller and 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.239
 appeared easy panorama 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.690
 I doubt what looks like such cameras 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.590
 will sit and glue everything manually by photoshop 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.180
 and here you and the panorama and a lot of others 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.700
 preset shooting modes which 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.269
 allow to diversify 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.849
 snapshot 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:38.540
 I'll tell you about another whale innovation 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:41.860
 camera lens is now 1855 what else 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.550
 more compact what makes the gt300 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.580
 indispensable companion in any 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.890
 traveling by pressing a special button 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.360
 you can rotate the lens and 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.220
 unlock it such a design 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.140
 recalled mirrorless models not from 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.850
 samsung is true the lens is not there 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.320
 fixed in working position 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.150
 during the shooting it was possible to just 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.000
 turn off the camera by accidentally blocking 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.790
 The lens here is not a disadvantage 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.280
 can so as not pressing the button you do this 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.370
 You do not make the object as it passed 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.290
 version is equipped with a stabilization system 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.260
 which can be turned on or off 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.540
 lever on the lens body right there 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.540
 you can translate lenses mode manual 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.820
 focusing and back the outer lens is not 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.770
 says goodbye and now you can wear 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.220
 any polarizing and gradient 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.100
 filters 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.830
 despite its simplicity the lens here 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:35.210
 high-quality and smart gods with her 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.490
 it turns out soft and without nuts assembly under 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.720
 separate plugs are ports 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.200
 to connect a wired remote 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.230
 remote control yusbi visible 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.430
 cables as well as a microphone 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.460
 effective megapixels 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.920
 equals 24 2 so much on professional 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.200
 carcasses rarely meet detail for 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.020
 this score works great 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.940
 It is very convenient to take photos in manual mode 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.070
 despite the fact that the camera refers to 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.070
 entry level here can be fast and 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.690
 easy to adjust all manual settings 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.700

 fn on the left there is a row of buttons 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.230
 and not cut down as sometimes 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.480
 This happens for manual setup novices. 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.299
 will help to understand conveniently and intuitively 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.090
 clear menu you can deal with it 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.950
 as far as response diaphragm and how much it costs 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.890
 set sensitivity or shutter speed 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:28.190
 using the joystick is very easy to choose 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.290
 focus point of 11 available camera 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.960
 offers a series of automatic settings 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.640
 for different shooting conditions even if you 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.510
 for the first time holding 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.670
 camera 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.530
 it is difficult to get confused as the camera 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.050
 always gives a hint for each of 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.890
 modes yes it is pictograms understand everything 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.710
 pretty easy 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.510
 camera settings are not overloaded but this 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.090
 doesn't mean you customize it 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.160
 every camera setting will be difficult 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.169
 can be customized and customized 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.759
 needs and to whom rather 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.289
 can not wait to lay out quality 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.749

 amazing but the video also not 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.800
 appeared weak embroidery side of the camera 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:09.139
 can be adjusted 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.789
 iso and shutter speed but the aperture 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.180
 adjust in catch mode not 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:16.279
 it turns out that you need 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.249
 go into normal mode you set a 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:20.749
 fragma as you like and then 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:23.120
 go back to shooting 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:25.189
 let it not very convenient but let's 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.389
 remember that before this was not 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:28.729

 is only 410 grams per compact 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:45.750
 The new lens also affects 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:48.660
 The advantages of the camera are high 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:53.070
 Photo resolution is still 24 megapixels 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:55.890
