for<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.699> laser<00:00:56.850> pointer<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.539> it's<00:00:57.690> doubles

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
for the laser pointer and it's doubles

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.920 
for the laser pointer and it's doubles
up<00:00:58.230> as<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.410> stylus<00:00:58.949> as<00:00:59.100> well<00:00:59.430> which<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.760> great<00:00:59.940> so

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
up as a stylus as well which is great so

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.939 
up as a stylus as well which is great so
let's<00:01:01.109> go<00:01:01.230> ahead<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.680> look<00:01:01.800> at<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
let's go ahead and have a look at the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.889 
let's go ahead and have a look at the
stylus<00:01:02.340> first<00:01:02.609> now<00:01:03.090> as<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.449> can<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.570> with<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
stylus first now as you can see with the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.780 
stylus first now as you can see with the
stylus<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.350> made<00:01:04.619> from<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.860> silicon<00:01:05.250> material

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
stylus is made from a silicon material

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.030 
stylus is made from a silicon material
and<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.270> does<00:01:06.479> double<00:01:06.780> up<00:01:06.869> as<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.140> protection

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
and it does double up as a protection

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.460 
and it does double up as a protection
and<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.939> lore<00:01:09.180> pocket<00:01:09.570> for<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> laser<00:01:10.140> pointer

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
and a lore pocket for the laser pointer

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.530 
and a lore pocket for the laser pointer
which<00:01:10.590> I'll<00:01:10.740> get<00:01:10.830> into<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.100> second<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:12.390> can

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
which I'll get into a second and you can

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.270 
which I'll get into a second and you can
see<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.020> very<00:01:13.229> soft<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.710> front<00:01:14.040> and

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
see that is very soft on the front and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.850 
see that is very soft on the front and
like<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.760> mentioned<00:01:15.240> before<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:16.229> doubles<00:01:16.560> up<00:01:16.680> as

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
like I mentioned before it doubles up as

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.830 
like I mentioned before it doubles up as
a<00:01:16.920> protector<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.820> laser<00:01:18.060> pointer<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:18.750> you

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
a protector for the laser pointer so you

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.840 
a protector for the laser pointer so you
just<00:01:18.990> put<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.009> will<00:01:20.159> make<00:01:20.610> sure<00:01:20.729> you

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
just put it in and it will make sure you

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.609 
just put it in and it will make sure you
don't<00:01:20.939> lose<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.240> or<00:01:21.420> anything<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.020> and

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
don't lose it or anything like that and

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.780 
don't lose it or anything like that and
it's<00:01:22.770> got<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> little<00:01:23.070> attachment<00:01:23.640> at<00:01:23.729> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
it's got a little attachment at the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.190 
it's got a little attachment at the
bottom<00:01:24.000> made<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.270> silicon<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:24.810> I'm<00:01:25.049> not

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
bottom made of silicon so I'm not

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.929 
bottom made of silicon so I'm not
breaking<00:01:25.439> your<00:01:25.650> headphone<00:01:26.009> jack<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.759> just

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
breaking your headphone jack so you just

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.340 
breaking your headphone jack so you just
plug<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.299> there<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.840> make<00:01:27.869> sure<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.200> don't

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
plug it in there so make sure you don't

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.039 
plug it in there so make sure you don't
lose<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.619> as<00:01:28.829> well<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:30.270> stylus<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.750> very

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
lose it as well so the stylus is very

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.600 
lose it as well so the stylus is very
responsive<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.920> works<00:01:32.100> really<00:01:32.340> nicely

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
responsive and it works really nicely

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.640 
responsive and it works really nicely
with<00:01:32.790> my<00:01:32.880> iPad<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.509> load<00:01:33.689> up<00:01:33.869> some<00:01:34.049> applications

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
with my iPad I load up some applications

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.319 
with my iPad I load up some applications
and<00:01:34.770> try<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.040> out<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.759> works<00:01:35.970> really

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
and try it out and it works really

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.670 
and try it out and it works really
nicely<00:01:36.600> they've<00:01:36.810> got<00:01:36.960> no<00:01:37.140> problem<00:01:37.470> with<00:01:37.500> that

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
nicely they've got no problem with that

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.800 
nicely they've got no problem with that
and<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.040> we've<00:01:38.880> having<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.270> look<00:01:39.360> at<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.540> laser

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
and so we've having a look at the laser

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.840 
and so we've having a look at the laser
pointer<00:01:40.200> right<00:01:40.380> now<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.369> see<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.729> just

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
pointer right now so you can see it just

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.160 
pointer right now so you can see it just
goes<00:01:42.030> straight<00:01:42.210> into<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> headphone<00:01:42.960> jack

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
goes straight into the headphone jack

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.170 
goes straight into the headphone jack
and<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:44.009> load<00:01:44.159> up<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.430> free<00:01:44.610> application

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and we load up the free application

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.399 
and we load up the free application
which<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.479> can<00:01:45.630> download<00:01:45.810> from<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.290> App

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
which you can download from the App

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.080 
which you can download from the App
Store<00:01:46.439> for<00:01:46.770> free<00:01:47.040> or<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.549> Google<00:01:47.850> Play<00:01:47.880> Store

books<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.659> works<00:01:48.930> on<00:01:49.079> both<00:01:49.259> platforms<00:01:49.530> so

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
books this works on both platforms so

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.160 
books this works on both platforms so
you<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:50.700> see<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.970> we've<00:01:51.149> got<00:01:51.329> options<00:01:51.540> with

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
you can see that we've got options with

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.289 
you can see that we've got options with
the<00:01:52.350> application<00:01:53.340> we've<00:01:53.490> got<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.030> off<00:01:54.090> and

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
the application we've got on and off and

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.429 
the application we've got on and off and
we've<00:01:54.390> got<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.630> bar<00:01:54.810> at<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.049> bottom<00:01:55.320> which

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
we've got the bar at the bottom which

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.530 
we've got the bar at the bottom which
I'll<00:01:55.590> discuss<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.189> second<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.149> on<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.509> off

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
I'll discuss in a second the on and off

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.170 
I'll discuss in a second the on and off
more<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.130> self-explanatory<00:01:59.130> so<00:02:00.119> you

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
more and it's a self-explanatory so you

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.819 
more and it's a self-explanatory so you
can<00:02:00.450> see<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.840> laser<00:02:01.020> point<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.439> working

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
can see that the laser point is working

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:02.660 
can see that the laser point is working
in<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:01.979> background<00:02:02.399> with<00:02:02.579> this

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
in the background with this

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.030 
in the background with this
demonstration<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.619> basically<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.799> bottom

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
demonstration and basically the bottom

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.950 
demonstration and basically the bottom
bar<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.850> bond<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.299> effects<00:02:06.689> with<00:02:06.840> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
bar of the bond it effects with the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.270 
bar of the bond it effects with the
distance<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.530> how<00:02:07.649> strong<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.039> want<00:02:08.190> the

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
distance and how strong you want the

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.119 
distance and how strong you want the
laser<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.759> be<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.539> laser<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.959> one<00:02:10.709> milliwatts

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
laser to be the laser is one milliwatts

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.100 
laser to be the laser is one milliwatts
so<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:11.520> not<00:02:11.610> that<00:02:11.670> much<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.209> strong<00:02:12.810> laser

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
so it's not that much of a strong laser

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.820 
so it's not that much of a strong laser
so

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
so

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.310 
so
expect<00:02:14.340> far<00:02:14.610> distance<00:02:15.030> laser<00:02:15.360> pointing<00:02:15.840> books

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
expect far distance laser pointing books

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.350 
expect far distance laser pointing books
it<00:02:16.470> won't<00:02:16.710> work<00:02:16.890> like<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.460> it's<00:02:17.820> just<00:02:17.910> for

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
it won't work like that it's just for

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.900 
it won't work like that it's just for
not<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.470> strong<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.800> laser<00:02:20.010> it's<00:02:20.550> just<00:02:20.760> for

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
not that strong of laser it's just for

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.230 
not that strong of laser it's just for
like<00:02:21.060> messing<00:02:21.900> about<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.350> do<00:02:22.440> some<00:02:22.680> work<00:02:22.890> with

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
like messing about and do some work with

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.090 
like messing about and do some work with
so<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.570> compatible<00:02:24.900> with<00:02:25.170> many<00:02:25.320> devices<00:02:25.950> as

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
so it is compatible with many devices as

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.580 
so it is compatible with many devices as
you<00:02:26.160> see<00:02:26.370> iPad<00:02:26.790> iPods<00:02:27.390> many<00:02:27.960> Apple<00:02:28.320> devices

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
you see iPad iPods many Apple devices

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.770 
you see iPad iPods many Apple devices
and<00:02:28.860> many<00:02:28.950> Android<00:02:29.400> devices<00:02:29.730> as<00:02:30.060> well<00:02:30.240> that's

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
and many Android devices as well that's

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.110 
and many Android devices as well that's
why<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:30.990> is<00:02:31.110> available<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:31.680> both<00:02:31.860> platforms<00:02:32.190> so

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
why it is available on both platforms so

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.280 
why it is available on both platforms so
