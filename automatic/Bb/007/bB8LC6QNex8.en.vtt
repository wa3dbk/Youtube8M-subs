quite painless and what I do is with
this<00:04:55.590> instrument<00:04:56.010> call<00:04:56.400> a<00:04:56.430> slit<00:04:56.850> lamp<00:04:57.090> I

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
this instrument call a slit lamp I

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.220 
this instrument call a slit lamp I
actually<00:04:58.770> can<00:04:59.280> look<00:05:00.030> at<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.360> tear<00:05:00.630> film<00:05:00.660> and

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
actually can look at the tear film and

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.340 
actually can look at the tear film and
two<00:05:02.070> things<00:05:02.370> number<00:05:02.820> one<00:05:03.150> it<00:05:03.480> will<00:05:03.990> help<00:05:04.230> me

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
two things number one it will help me

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.270 
two things number one it will help me
determine<00:05:04.560> the<00:05:05.040> server<00:05:05.370> if<00:05:05.670> the<00:05:05.820> dry<00:05:06.120> eyes<00:05:06.360> and

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
determine the server if the dry eyes and

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.790 
determine the server if the dry eyes and
secondly<00:05:08.280> I<00:05:08.670> can<00:05:09.660> see<00:05:09.870> if<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.080> dry<00:05:10.320> ice<00:05:10.530> is

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
secondly I can see if the dry ice is

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.000 
secondly I can see if the dry ice is
causing<00:05:11.250> irritation<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:12.240> your<00:05:12.420> cornea<00:05:13.020> which

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
house may determine number one what's

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.670 
house may determine number one what's
the<00:05:23.730> root<00:05:23.910> cause<00:05:24.120> of<00:05:24.360> dry<00:05:24.510> eyes<00:05:24.810> and<00:05:25.260> how<00:05:25.620> we
