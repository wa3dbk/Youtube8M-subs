I<00:07:27.720> don't<00:07:28.050> think<00:07:28.230> two<00:07:28.830> of<00:07:28.860> us<00:07:29.160> are<00:07:29.370> a<00:07:29.400> match<00:07:29.610> for

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:34.490 
them maybe not but all of us together

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:49.490 
them maybe not but all of us together
can<00:07:35.490> defeat<00:07:36.060> them
