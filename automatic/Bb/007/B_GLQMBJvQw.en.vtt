00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
two for the piezo igniter a couple of

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.060 
two for the piezo igniter a couple of
conductor<00:01:32.369> here<00:01:32.990> at<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.079> bottom<00:01:34.439> here<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.860> two

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
to remove the control here there are two

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:32.559 
to remove the control here there are two
Torx<00:01:59.940> screws<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.720> side<00:02:00.930> here

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.160 

you

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
bottom have these two conductor for the

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.250 
bottom have these two conductor for the
igniter<00:02:40.739> so<00:02:41.780> definitely<00:02:42.780> don't<00:02:42.870> want<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.110> bend

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
igniter so definitely don't want to bend

00:02:43.260 --> 00:03:05.800 
igniter so definitely don't want to bend
those<00:03:00.440> igniter<00:03:01.440> probe<00:03:01.739> are<00:03:01.950> hitting<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.370> so

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.229 

gotta<00:03:06.810> figure<00:03:07.080> out<00:03:07.380> how<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.250> put<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:08.610> in<00:03:11.239> the

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
gotta figure out how to put that in the

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.840 
gotta figure out how to put that in the
next<00:03:12.450> thing<00:03:12.630> I'm<00:03:12.750> going<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.959> do<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.519> this<00:03:14.519> piece

next thing I'm going to do is this piece

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.930 
next thing I'm going to do is this piece
of<00:03:14.880> metal<00:03:15.239> is<00:03:15.750> actually<00:03:16.430> gonna<00:03:17.430> be<00:03:17.519> replaced

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
of metal is actually gonna be replaced

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.400

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
with this one that came with a burner I

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.500 
with this one that came with a burner I
can't<00:03:20.310> remember<00:03:20.549> if<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.910> original<00:03:21.090> one's

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.820 
that big and just rusted away but there
are<00:03:25.170> two<00:03:25.319> screws<00:03:25.620> here<00:03:25.860> that<00:03:26.069> is<00:03:26.880> pretty<00:03:27.180> much

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
are two screws here that is pretty much

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.289 
are two screws here that is pretty much
gone<00:03:28.830> it's<00:03:29.519> all<00:03:29.640> rounded<00:03:30.060> up<00:03:30.209> so<00:03:30.860> try<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:32.299> get

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
gone it's all rounded up so try to get

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:48.780 
gone it's all rounded up so try to get
it<00:03:33.420> off

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.699 

I<00:03:51.599> guess<00:03:52.599> I'd<00:03:52.720> try<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:52.930> drill<00:03:53.230> those<00:03:53.409> two

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
I guess I'd try to drill those two

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.369 
I guess I'd try to drill those two
screws<00:03:54.310> out<00:03:54.459> that<00:03:54.909> might<00:03:55.060> be<00:03:55.150> you<00:03:55.450> let's<00:03:56.200> do

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
screws out that might be you let's do

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:57.979 
screws out that might be you let's do
that

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
that

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.289

for<00:06:33.860> the<00:06:33.920> cover<00:06:34.100> plate<00:06:34.430> I<00:06:34.690> just<00:06:35.690> got<00:06:35.840> to

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.170 
for the cover plate I just got to

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.040 
for the cover plate I just got to
regular<00:06:36.680> machine<00:06:37.010> screws<00:06:37.720> that's<00:06:38.720> what<00:06:38.960> I'll

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
regular machine screws that's what I'll

00:06:39.050 --> 00:07:08.340 
regular machine screws that's what I'll
use

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.350 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.420 

everything's<00:07:09.350> put<00:07:09.650> back<00:07:09.770> together<00:07:09.920> and<00:07:10.220> now

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430 
everything's put back together and now

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:11.830 
everything's put back together and now
let's<00:07:11.090> test<00:07:11.300> it<00:07:11.450> out

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 
let's test it out

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.170 
let's test it out
I<00:07:11.870> notice<00:07:12.590> the<00:07:12.740> igniter<00:07:13.400> is<00:07:13.580> not<00:07:13.730> working<00:07:14.090> it

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.180 
I notice the igniter is not working it

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.780 
I notice the igniter is not working it
might<00:07:14.330> be<00:07:14.450> just<00:07:14.660> a<00:07:14.780> dead<00:07:15.080> battery<00:07:15.320> but<00:07:18.790> that's

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:19.790 
might be just a dead battery but that's

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.540 
might be just a dead battery but that's
a<00:07:19.910> left<00:07:20.120> one

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:24.550 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.730 

so<00:07:25.550> it's<00:07:25.699> working

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:26.740 
so it's working

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.219 
so it's working
flip<00:07:27.740> the<00:07:27.889> heat<00:07:28.250> tent<00:07:28.460> back<00:07:28.639> on<00:07:29.139> putting<00:07:30.139> it

00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:30.229 
flip the heat tent back on putting it

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:34.540 
flip the heat tent back on putting it
back<00:07:30.319> together<00:07:30.500> and<00:07:33.069> hopefully<00:07:34.069> I'll<00:07:34.400> get

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:34.550 
back together and hopefully I'll get

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.159 
back together and hopefully I'll get
another<00:07:34.639> couple<00:07:35.060> of<00:07:35.150> a<00:07:35.180> couple<00:07:35.599> more<00:07:35.750> years<00:07:35.990> of

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:36.169 
another couple of a couple more years of

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:38.319 
another couple of a couple more years of
use
