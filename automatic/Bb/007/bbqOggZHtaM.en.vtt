 "How to prevent pre-diabetes from turning into diabetes" 

00:00:07.536 --> 00:00:13.316
 In just a decade, the number of people with diabetes has more than doubled. 

00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:17.186
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, by 2050, 

00:00:17.186 --> 00:00:20.667
 One in every three of us may have diabetes. 

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:22.938
 Is there anything big about this? 

00:00:22.938 --> 00:00:26.574
 The consequences of diabetes are unimaginable; 

00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:30.506
 It is the number one murderer of blindness in adults and the leading cause of kidney failure. 

00:00:30.506 --> 00:00:33.439
 It is also the first source of patients who have to undergo amputation. 

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:36.529
 So how do we prevent it? 

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:39.837
 The onset of type 2 diabetes is gradual, 

00:00:39.837 --> 00:00:43.252
 Most people will first experience a stage called pre-diabetes. 

00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:47.596
 About one-third of Americans are at this stage. 

00:00:47.596 --> 00:00:52.004
 But only about one in ten people are aware of their condition. 

00:00:52.004 --> 00:00:55.161
 Because the current treatment of diabetes is not very effective, 

00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:58.745
 Make prevention very necessary. So how to prevent the effect? 

00:00:58.745 --> 00:01:01.194
 Is it a lifestyle change? Still taking drugs? 

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:06.593
 The answer to this question was once different, until the New England Journal of Medicine published a landmark study. 

00:01:06.593 --> 00:01:09.561
 In this study, the researchers randomly divided thousands of patients into two groups. 

00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:13.729
 One group used double doses of the best anti-diabetic drugs, and the other group changed diet and exercise. 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.995
 The drug used here is metformin, which is probably the safest of antidiabetic drugs. 

00:01:19.995 --> 00:01:24.058
 Although half of the patients will have diarrhea, 

00:01:24.058 --> 00:01:27.625
 One quarter will feel sick, and one tenth will feel fatigue. 

00:01:27.625 --> 00:01:33.113
 The word “fatigue” comes from Greek, meaning lack of strength, leading to weakness and fatigue. 

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:38.643
 But the risk of death from drugs is only 66,000 per year. 

00:01:38.643 --> 00:01:41.800
 And this medicine does have an effect. 

00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:46.020
 Compared with placebo, the person taking the drug during the four-year study period 

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:48.530
 Significantly fewer cases of progression to diabetes. 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.260
 However, compared to people who change their diet and exercise, 

00:01:52.263 --> 00:01:58.430
 The latter effect is even better. 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.510
 Lifestyle interventions reduce the incidence of diabetes by as much as 50%, 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.330
 In contrast, drug interventions were only reduced by 31%. 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.600
 It is clear that lifestyle interventions work better. 

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:12.440
 And fewer side effects. 

00:02:12.442 --> 00:02:16.080
 More than 3/4 of the people who take the drug say gastrointestinal discomfort, 

00:02:16.087 --> 00:02:20.000
 And people who change their lifestyles only say that muscles are sour! 

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:24.300
 That's because these people did exercise as required. 

00:02:24.395 --> 00:02:29.600
 Other subsequent studies have reached the same conclusion. 

00:02:29.697 --> 00:02:34.940
 However, this conclusion has a flaw. 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.440
 Just by the number of people who participated in this trial 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.560
 To calculate the result, 

00:02:40.565 --> 00:02:43.750
 As for whether these people have done it as required, 

00:02:43.754 --> 00:02:46.110
 No consideration has been made in the calculation. 

00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:51.260
 Another study is arguably one of the most famous diabetes studies. 

00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:55.760
 In this study, 500 prediabetes patients were randomized into two groups, one receiving lifestyle interventions and the other receiving controls. 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.520
 During the trial, the lifestyle-changing group also had a 50%-60% reduction in the risk of developing diabetes. 

00:03:01.524 --> 00:03:06.230
 But only a small percentage of these people have achieved their pre-set lifestyle goals. 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.830
 About a quarter of people eat enough fiber, that is, all food, 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.790
 And reduce the intake of saturated fat as required, 

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:18.960
 The main sources of saturated fat in the United States are dairy products, desserts, chicken and pork. 

00:03:18.964 --> 00:03:21.280
 Even so, they are generally better than the people in the control group. 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.940
 And thus reduce the number of people suffering from diabetes. 

00:03:24.945 --> 00:03:30.510
 If at the end, only those who change their lifestyles as required, 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.100
 What are the conclusions of those who have met at least four-fifths of the lifestyle goals? 

00:03:34.198 --> 00:03:41.180
 None of these people have diabetes. 

00:03:41.182 --> 00:03:44.060
 Their risk of getting diabetes has dropped by 100%. 

00:03:44.064 --> 00:03:48.700
 The bottom line is that type 2 diabetes is preventable. 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.860
 Even pre-diabetes patients who are already at high risk can be prevented. 

00:03:51.863 --> 00:03:56.050
 However, we are actually watching this preventable disease flooding, 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:03.930
 This is really a shameful shame for the public health management department.
