impressions of the Breedlove Oregon are

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.500 
impressions of the Breedlove Oregon are
that<00:04:44.370> this<00:04:44.520> is<00:04:44.580> a<00:04:44.700> very<00:04:45.090> very<00:04:45.330> high<00:04:45.480> quality

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
that this is a very very high quality

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.260 
that this is a very very high quality
guitar<00:04:46.260> everything<00:04:47.130> about<00:04:47.340> it<00:04:47.670> from<00:04:48.030> its

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
guitar everything about it from its

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.270 
guitar everything about it from its
ancillary<00:04:48.720> equipment<00:04:49.170> including<00:04:50.160> the

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
ancillary equipment including the

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.970 
ancillary equipment including the
Fishman<00:04:51.180> preamp<00:04:51.510> everything<00:04:52.410> works<00:04:52.710> very

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
Fishman preamp everything works very

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.410

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.090 
very well as a whole unit
I<00:04:54.450> think<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.170> acoustic<00:04:55.680> sound<00:04:55.920> of<00:04:56.010> this

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
I think the acoustic sound of this

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.190 
I think the acoustic sound of this
guitar<00:04:56.490> is<00:04:56.700> really<00:04:57.150> good<00:04:57.330> it<00:04:57.720> has<00:04:57.930> lovely

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200

sparkling<00:04:58.890> highs<00:04:59.100> a<00:04:59.520> nice<00:05:00.090> firm<00:05:00.510> bass<00:05:00.900> and<00:05:01.280> the

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
sparkling highs a nice firm bass and the

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.610 
sparkling highs a nice firm bass and the
projection<00:05:03.000> and<00:05:03.150> consistency<00:05:04.140> that<00:05:04.320> you

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
projection and consistency that you

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.810 
projection and consistency that you
would<00:05:04.770> associate<00:05:05.070> with<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:06.240> traditional

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
would associate with the traditional

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.030 
would associate with the traditional
dreadnought<00:05:08.820> design<00:05:09.180> however<00:05:10.080> I<00:05:10.200> do<00:05:10.350> like<00:05:10.770> the

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
dreadnought design however I do like the

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.130 
dreadnought design however I do like the
slightly<00:05:11.730> more<00:05:11.880> compact<00:05:12.390> shoulders<00:05:12.870> it<00:05:12.960> does

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
slightly more compact shoulders it does

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.600 
slightly more compact shoulders it does
