00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.670
 hello to all music lovers today we will talk 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.160
 dynamics and intensity 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.950
 with which force is played in words 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.220
 poor and can be as the word says 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:38.590
 the same dynamic and variable can 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:41.239
 go from one to a very intensity 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.910
 we say reduced that generally on 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.390
 score is indicated with a sign p 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.220
 in italics that means floor up to 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.840
 a greater intensity than is indicated with 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.120
 he always extracts it in italics 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.440
 quite intuitive score where 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.230
 instead we play with an intensity 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.420
 greater than the notation 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.430
 however quite intuitive we go to 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.750
 see how it works on the side 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.090
 practical for training a little before 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.240
 variable to take into consideration is 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.240
 definitely the pick of course 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.420
 playing in a guitar type context 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.110
 from bonfire that is acoustic guitar with born 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.290
 with the club there are so many picks each 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.990
 he has his own way of playing 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:32.450
 we begin to feel this plectrum in 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:37.370
 very light nylon 38 mm bends a lot 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.460
 easily and with some kind of delay 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.350
 in the attack of the sound 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.590
 because the pick from a string 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.070
 at the other it bends and then points to 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.080
 next string is nice as an effect e 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.630
 which has a kind of dddd of 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.200
 natural reverberation a little grainy like 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.860
 sound and sound roughly in this 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.860
 in this way 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:16.230
 and comfortable to play because it does not give big 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.410
 however, wrist impediments are difficult 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.870
 manage the dynamics because they play 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.930
 strong or better trying to play loud 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.660
 however, always bends too much 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.300
 plectrum and therefore fails to give a 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.300
 powerful intensity we say 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:42.200
 there is little difference in substance playing 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.980
 from the piano reduced the range of 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.980
 excursion 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.890
 let's see what happens instead with a 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.460
 plectrum a little harder still in nylon 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.460
 however this is 73 mm 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.930
 certainly a little stronger the attack and 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.450
 the dynamic in the sense is more manageable 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.590
 that we can give a little more strength 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.590
 strong here 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.120
 ok the situation is still different instead 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:44.660
 complete in plastic or other carbon 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.290
 materials a little harder and even more 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.290
 often 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:08.840
 it is certainly the strongest attack of the gods 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:11.390
 however, on the other hand it is the let's say 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.860
 fault in quotation marks let's say it has less 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.100
 possibility to give that effect 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:19.450
 shelled typical of the soft plectrum that 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.450
 we heard this at the beginning 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.890
 I will produce them is different 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.840
 on the other hand I can play louder 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:41.269
 that is, using the same strength, not yes 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.689
 never comes to here at those levels of 

00:04:41.269 --> 00:04:48.079
 intensity so let's also adjust with 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:51.439
 which one can play according to the song 

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:54.529
 to be performed generally on the agreements goes 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:57.679
 well what we heard that 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:05:00.279
 second there is a rom and it is a kind of 

00:04:57.679 --> 00:05:02.359
 middle ground that allows us to play 

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:06.399
 comfortable and have a good excursion 

00:05:02.359 --> 00:05:06.399
 dynamic on the agreements at least 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:15.380
 summing up instead on riffs or maybe 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:22.070
 more parts we say in quotes from 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:24.200
 solo the very soft body 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:29.180
 it has no great attack and even a sound 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:36.830
 annoying to some that this one 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:39.669
 cha cha before clearing up her a little 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:39.669
 knackered 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.069
 only with the same strength with the most 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:06:04.210
 the last project instead that a little 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:06:07.650
 the harder it means there is a difference 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.650
 huge difference
