00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:13.710
 hello welcome saun or video of 3 of luis tutorials in this video and teach 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.980
 pretty basic materials d dv 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.650
 the rendered rendering lviv and 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.460
 with it I will demonstrate how the most basic materials can be made to 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.169
 architectural project 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.599
 here I have the scene just create wait with the materials 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.490
 and here you can see an render inc 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.600
 colom materials that we are going to see 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.470
 I'm going to open the first material 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.000
 will give the black material 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.890
 with white lines that it would be this one that in this case is seen crisis by the 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:42.830
 illumination 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.890
 and the way he has done it is 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.890
 leaving all the adjustments that come to 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.900
 by default in lives 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.870
 and the only thing he has done is in the diffuse channel 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.280
 I've got him or a map called Viceroy Echevers 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.400
 when I put that channel I can convert here I can put the color that I want 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.820
 in this case white 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.979
 if I go back and in pixels I have zero point 3 you can put 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.830
 wider or you can narrow all the lines 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.850
 chery back and here it looks 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.200
 in the diffuse channel 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.310
 here I have 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.770
 to another matter those that are called mild 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.220
 here you can appreciate 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.869
 here what I have done is 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.990
 also with all the viceroy's materials for foster what I've done 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.740
 is that in the channel 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.430
 I just left him 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.030
 this picture 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.030
 that you can appreciate a photo of skin 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.920
 In the channel 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.820
 of pomp 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.159
 I've got the same image but skinny January 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.760
 ciu to transcend channel of purchase I have left it to 35 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.170
 here what is done is simply touching the reflection I have lowered the one that 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.850
 cinemas the clos and one steel points 65 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.330
 in the color of the flec 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.640
 I've uploaded it to 45 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.640
 with that we only get this shine and that material 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.810
 The following material is 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.279
 galvanized metal 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:17.019
 here you can see the material next 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.329
 i the only thing i have done here in this material is to touch the diffuse channel the 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:22.009
 colour 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:26.309
 and the reflections the reflections has only dropped to zero point fact 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:29.519
 the color of the reflections proposed to 109 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.789
 you can put it to 110 it does not matter 115 120 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:38.240
 i the diffuse color can be raised to 64 65 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.319
 between 60 70 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.339
 that's why we get this material and here 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:46.339
 the chrome one was very similar 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.549
 the only difference from the chromium is that the diffuser channel the color is left 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.309
 totally black 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:56.159
 yes in the reflecta reflections channel 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.209
 we have been able to seat 50 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.609
 right now I have three divisions but for materials that 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:07.329
 have reflections are quite as blas as glass bocco lomo can be 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.120
 put around 25 sup and cep divisions to come out 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.239
 perfectly when there are lights 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.559
 here the only thing that I have touched was the scriptwriter 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:20.689
 elena in refraction that jealousy rose to almost three units 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.249
 the brick material 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:25.409
 does not have 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:26.650
 greater mystery 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.140
 that's all 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.470
 assoluta mind 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.860
 d 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.560
 costolo default settings of the kid 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:37.069
 and in the diffuse channel 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.809
 I have put him 

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:40.010
 an image 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.729
 of bricks 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:44.120
 and in the pump channel 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.780
 I have uploaded it to 100 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.309
 and well dressed an image 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:51.289
 the mine image of bricks but in black and white 

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:54.550
 it could bring a little reflection 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.799
 to suppose that brick is a bit wet 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.339
 but now in this case I have only left the reflex channel 

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:02.480
 it has been left in black 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.290
 the diffuse as you can see is gray but it does not matter if they turn gray 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.290
 with black because the really the diffuse channel is taking ownership of the 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.599
 Photos 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.309
 the next Adam material is this gold 

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:19.129
 Ekin cheese factory 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:23.659
 this material is a bit more complicated in the diffuse channel got him 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:27.189
 the color that I want in this case has put a color similar to the two 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.200
 in the reflection reflection channel 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.419
 I have put a color similar to gold like the other 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.330
 but a little bit darker 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.439
 I've gone down in the cinemas steel point 95 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.330
 and now 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.330
 I have put a texture 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.479
 he has gotten into the pomp channel 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.419
 which only went up 100 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.069
 I have put it 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:56.819
 in reflection in theaters they only go to 85 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.020
 ian reflecta 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.740
 isern has dropped arias 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.819
 with that we get this material 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:04.580
 and this one that damon hill 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.970
 here we have the material of the wood 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.860
 the one of the mother the one of the wood quite similar 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.080
 to anyone we've seen of gold or deputies 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:20.409
 it was lowered in reflections the cinemas in the reflection is going to do or point 85 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:24.379
 i the color goes up to 25 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:30.740
 here in the fuzzy house simply issued a photograph 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.849
 of wood 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.149
 and in the pump channel I left it 30 and I have put the same picture 

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:39.819
 colored wood 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:43.129
 in this case I care it does not necessarily have to be blank and 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:45.280
 black and take a little 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.990
 there you can appreciate 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.689
 take a little when he took it 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:52.159
 and when I put him 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.739
 took a little bit the properties in the drum and the wood is given a little more 

00:05:55.739 --> 00:05:57.759
 real and appointment as you can appreciate 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:59.919
 and finally the crystal 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.539
 this crystal we want to wear right that is completely clean 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:07.180
 it's very easy to do the only thing that needs to be done is the diffuse channel opposes 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.529
 totally black 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:11.609
 the canary of reflections turns completely white 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.249
 the refraction is also completely white 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:19.659
 we mark the box where to put fresnel reflections 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:24.090
 i the trio r we're just going to put each one points 52 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.440
 to declare the crystal look completely transparent 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:32.949
 if we have lights that the most normal in a scene we have to put that mark 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:35.949
 in accepting the shadows 15 years ago 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.469
 and finally 

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:41.240
 the glass 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.630
 to be corrugated or is it totally thefts or 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.640
 thick as glass is transparent glass 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.020
 white diffuse white reflector 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.490
 white in refracts 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.800
 lemos on slow down reflection 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.669
 1 points 59 child r and we have raised their divisions in reflections 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:02.119
 infractions 

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:05.119
 so you do not look arctic side when it comes to profitability 

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:08.509
 and to get this effect 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:10.930
 alak corrugated 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.389
 eye frost ed 

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:17.419
 what we can do is lower the steel explosions points 6 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:21.340
 we can only go down to zero points 6 0 points 7 by 0 points 8 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.340
 with that we get practically the same effect 

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:28.280
 well I hope that this video tutorial has helped 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.669
 do not forget what my channel says 3d luis tutorías 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:32.230
 thank you
