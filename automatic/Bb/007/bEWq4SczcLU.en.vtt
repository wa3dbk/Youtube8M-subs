00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.300
 the sky is the limit for those who like 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.300
 rotate without hood 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.910

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.340
 steering wheel 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.300
 the market for convertibles still limited 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.200
 in Brazil 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.750
 but what is not lacking is style and has a lot 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.689
 who dreams and buys this 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.939
 idea is there are models of all sizes and 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.150

 prices start at 60 thousand reais 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.140
 Whatever the case, this pleasure includes 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:44.060
 a hood and can also mean 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.060
 cut the car a month 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.879
 will go in the time of the jalopicks in the 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.699
 Most popular cars did not have a roof 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:06.380
 then because they were lighter they became 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:09.979
 synonymous with sports today take off the roof 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.979
 brings a sophisticated and creative air 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.780
 the factory- fitted convertible fusca was only 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:20.420
 made for the European and 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:22.549
 American here they are handcrafted requires 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.850
 ability with the saw to leave the 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.649
 traditional frustam super black 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.369
 contemporary give a touch of magic in the 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:34.340
 Celtic or re-read article 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.060
 karman day in meadows in the interior of 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.490
 Sao Paulo 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.440
 this company does the full service but 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.770
 waiting for up to 15 months 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.119
 they work with all three models 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.600
 transformation to the convertible part 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.310
 of 11,800 the whole transformation is a 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.830
 engineering the car is not simply 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.509
 remove the ceiling they do not by you take the 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.009
 technician took a shoebox in 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.390
 field it gets very soft 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.310
 then there must be a system of 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.800
 structural reinforcements to give 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.090
 enhanced strength required on 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.220
 to the car 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.269
 the first reinforced the whole 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.580
 internal 

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:09.769
 This increases the weight of the car after it comes 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.080
 clipping and removal of the ceiling 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.819
 customization is at the discretion and 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.129
 customer's fashion 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.319
 and all this including the certification that 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.090
 It's the cat, it's all for the record. 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.010
 convertible into document 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.010
 I talked the folder version 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.540
 the group we have here three models of 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.730
 Convertible Car with Ceiling Solutions 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.160
 explains very different for us because 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.200
 first here that the red they in that 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.150
 If they rescued a solution that already 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.240
 had been adopted in the original model of 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.130
 50's that you have part of the close 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.320
 removed was replaced by the ceiling 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.210
 retractable canvas with this large part 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:53.240
 of the original structure of the car remains 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:56.270
 traditional mini lost two seats and 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.670
 won a small quota brings convertible 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.390
 with the front wider than the rear as 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.390
 send the flight 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.140
 In this model the hard top stored in the 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.610
 rear of the vehicle and with four seats 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.610
 It's up to the whole family. 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:22.459
 charm freedom style but how do you 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.489
 because the technologies are 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.099
 This issue is dominated by 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.040
 internalisation of the water check 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.319
 was practically solved always goes 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.910
 having some difference obviously gives life 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.110
 the durability of the material 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.489
 when you have a fabric soft top 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.760
 when you have a metal bonnet 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.330
 craftmanship one thing does not change 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.530
 what's missing in a convertible roof 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.530
 left over identity
