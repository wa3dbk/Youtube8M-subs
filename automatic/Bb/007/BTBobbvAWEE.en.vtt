00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.160
 so hello everyone to the next snapshot 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.639
 imagination and this time it is the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.710
 minecraft 13 w 18 10 sep schott the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.090
 now comes out weekly 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.010
 there are always so small updates 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.810
 I just wanted to introduce you 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.100
 mojang is shooting at the update again 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.390
 screw that means there are some again 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.220
 I would like to make minor changes 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.420
 Imagine it and it became one 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.130
 new blog introduced that means we 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.689
 can take coal now and we can 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.239
 create a carbon block from it 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.340
 We already know the whole thing about iron 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.899
 and gold and diamond like son 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.300
 That's coal for now 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.440
 so to speak, exists as a single blog 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.879
 finally with it a small gap 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.230
 that means we can already place 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.210
 that was the only one 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.649
 material or raw material is the only one 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.629
 raw material as a complete block 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.360
 was missing looks like the normal 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.039
 redstone block and only the hall dark 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.379
 is colored or black after the 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.300
 comparison ok works strangely enough 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.810
 By the way, not if you use charcoal 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.430
 that means there 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.840
 Unfortunately, this does not work 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.550
 we have to do that with the normal coal 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.030
 we also do it through normal 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.890
 mine then get this kohl block 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.660
 who is also responsible for what that means 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.040
 he also does what that means we have 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.810
 it could be enough now a normal 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.640
 customer block was always good for him 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.830
 Eight I'll say items or eight 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.330
 Doctors in the oven could melt that he 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.070
 Eight meat roasts could be eight 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.440
 Burning predecessor could make a total 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.420
 and now you can count together there 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.040
 we nine of these little coal 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.840
 Take a piece for a big block 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.630
 means that in plain text is a song 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.490
 Carbon Block 72 blocks can burn through 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.190
 Well, well then once put into it 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.310
 would need the complete stack once 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.050
 accordingly, then blow as then 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.740
 There is another one next 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.820
 crafting recipe for the hay bale because 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.350
 he in the last ten or the 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.520
 previous snapshots did not exist yet 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.250
 who just thought now 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.410
 freeze those who wii take then 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.810
 Once he completes everything completely he can 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.220
 now the woodblock forces and 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.530
 sit down accordingly and there 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.660
 is now also Mr Block last 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.039
 Snapshot or where I get the horses 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.509
 That was not the case yet 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.460
 that means that's where it comes from 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.830
 not see it but it 's a hay bale 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.610
 they have a point from the end 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.560
 few asked okay okay then next 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.720
 there is still one for this load from the one 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.100
 not yet comes from the last forces 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.900
 snapshot now also a new crafting 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.340
 Then you should do it this way 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.860
 The strings makes you feel like this 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.180
 small triangle at the top a chic there 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.850
 in the corner into the corner and then comes 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.650
 here's a seemingly one person like that 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.790
 be how to say such a shape 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.190
 after sony crÃ¶mer short and 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.770
 mirrored you go to know 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.230
 also and then we would finally have it 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.030
 as these snare where you can then horses 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.980
 among other things can connect with somewhere 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.420
 or shaaf can also offer 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.000
 here is still out of the can now 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:51.580
 take a quick and have the jo 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.410
 somewhere sauna fans me animal too 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.240
 Objects then take the loop 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.650
 I'm her and then the thing is watch 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.900
 so you can catch the sling 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.850
 now from now forces accordingly 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.440
 okay then next one was 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.730
 crafting concept changed that 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.470
 of wool, if I am now now 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.780
 once here want to lay side by side 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.180
 and the carport or the carpet forces 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.030
 then arise three carpets and not 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.880
 only one as in the previous zdh 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.860
 There is a bit more okay now 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.690
 These carpets can also be put on glass 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.880
 since latest place on or on 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.020
 transport on blocks where you know yes 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.550
 put nothing on it you can you know 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:29.489
 On glass you can not, among other things 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:31.050
 to place a board and so well me 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.700
 Now go and then step 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.020
 Accordingly, add something to it 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.880
 otherwise works and accordingly 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.560
 Also carpet wants ok then as well 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.120
 next following here in front there 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.940
 a little change at or one 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.340
 small re- introduction at ender portal 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.870
 blogs so to speak and at boil this 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.160
 ie if we are filling a kettle 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.140
 it also in output this time 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.810
 Signal and if I end the back 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.739
 Portal block with an eye then slip 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.600
 There is also a break signal here 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.700
 that means complete register now 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.200
 even if the things is occupied or if 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.519
 the kettle is full and if I am now 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.200
 For example, take water out here 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.540
 You can see the boiler that the track 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.010
 every time one gets smaller until nothing 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.420
 more is there and is in the checkout empty 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.400
 the accordingly also the output 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.519
 their turn also empty 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.959
 ok next was the thing 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.650
 sent with the zombies that is if 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:22.049
 you spawn here now and then burn 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.850
 We will not start again the next day 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.229
 to spawn new zombies and to become one 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.790
 there was a little something calling 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.810
 changed how that works exactly 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.030
 not sure yet 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.830
 at least they are not spawning anymore 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.350
 unchecked wild through the area 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.110
 ok then there is another small one 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:40.200
 thing and there are now in the 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.000
 Hell in Never Fortress also crates the 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.130
 you can find and where things in it 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.720
 they are just as normal as I say it 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.120
 times was tight was in it and 2 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.130
 and you can have a look 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.870
 that was the last point otherwise 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.800
 are there any other little bugfixes that 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.600
 maybe not all right now 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.490
 worth mentioning may still be that 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.080
 most important or worth mentioning 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.640
 all now it is so that the 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.380
 lava room disappears he knows it yes 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.030
 sometimes still even getting the 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.760
 at first word of lava degrades and must 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.220
 a little and remains and that 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.570
 was now gefixed that is to say if 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.010
 her the source of lava is destroyed 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.270
 even after the time actually the 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.919
 complete rest from there was also 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.260
 disappear so there are none 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.090
 remainders more of it 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.510
 then short hell and then seek 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.710
 forgotten by ok then the one in the hall 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.150
 and I 've got a fortress here 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.599
 also tracked down from the box 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.350
 found 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:27.660
 that makes a little one 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.880
 therefore come up with and before that 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.500
 Surely you could still use this armor for 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.400
 horses forces and lately goes 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.320
 not anymore 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.680
 You can find horse armor and saddle 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.420
 generally only in chests 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.440
 dungeons or never fortresses 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.700
 so it is here because now 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.060
 I also like watching 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.740
 the golden horse armor with in it and 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.520
 also a saddle and a little gold 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.200
 for example 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.250
 otherwise there are more here 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.450
 boxes distributed as I would now 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.890
 just a bit groups throughout 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.760
 I look at it all because I know it 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.950
 the first one I found 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.150
 in any case, that has been changed 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.840
 I personally think maybe one too 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.670
 little better something is laid because then 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.050
 It's not that easy anymore 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.280
 to get everything you want 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.680
 that means you have to do a little bit more 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.880
 for driving a sensible one 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.680
 for example, and then gets 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.900
 Immediately it may be a little bit 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:16.650
 more realistic so always strikes by the 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:18.180
 crates are then there's 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.730
 accordingly not as often 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.900
 comparatively I have to go through now 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.880
 fly and search 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.200
 I make time let's see briefly in karts 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.860
 If I can find one more thing there 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:31.470
 it is inside was in it 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.910
 you can ok then I would have a few more 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.080
 found boxes differently told 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.770
 for example, there is one 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.180
 golden sword in it and again goldner 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.370
 horse armor again normal two 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.850
 gold in fawn and here we would have here 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.630
 watched 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:47.900
 an iron armor and here too gold 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:51.150
 armor for horses and normal gold and 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:52.560
 So essentially that's what I say 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.670
 times with the armor here will not 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.290
 then they are pissed off 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.120
 comparatively a little more often still 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:01.350
 here is normal gold armor in it 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:03.270
 twice saddle and yes okay so if you
