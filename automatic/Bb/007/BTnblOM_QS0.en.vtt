this<00:07:42.170> franchise<00:07:42.650> to<00:07:42.830> seven<00:07:43.100> minutes<00:07:43.130> before

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:43.640 
this franchise to seven minutes before

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.280 
this franchise to seven minutes before
is<00:07:43.760> because<00:07:43.790> I<00:07:43.970> think<00:07:44.180> six<00:07:44.450> minutes<00:07:44.780> go<00:07:44.960> but

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:45.290 
is because I think six minutes go but

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.890 
is because I think six minutes go but
goes<00:07:45.500> by<00:07:45.650> way<00:07:45.860> too<00:07:45.920> fast<00:07:46.100> and<00:07:46.640> man<00:07:47.330> compared<00:07:47.840> to

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:47.900 
goes by way too fast and man compared to

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.830 
goes by way too fast and man compared to
in<00:07:48.020> it<00:07:48.140> and<00:07:48.260> compared<00:07:49.010> to<00:07:49.100> MCA<00:07:49.430> so<00:07:49.660> you<00:07:50.660> guys

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:50.840 
in it and compared to MCA so you guys

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.030 
in it and compared to MCA so you guys
think<00:07:51.080> I<00:07:51.110> should<00:07:51.140> do<00:07:51.410> that<00:07:51.440> and<00:07:51.710> think<00:07:51.860> it's<00:07:51.950> a

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:52.040 
think I should do that and think it's a

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.560 
think I should do that and think it's a
good<00:07:52.190> idea<00:07:52.340> let<00:07:53.000> me<00:07:53.090> know<00:07:53.150> in<00:07:53.210> the<00:07:53.240> comments
