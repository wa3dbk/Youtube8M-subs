00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the first thing you just noticed about

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.040 
the first thing you just noticed about
the<00:00:36.960> still<00:00:37.200> web<00:00:37.320> browser<00:00:38.630> it's<00:00:39.630> auto<00:00:40.080> rotated

the still web browser it's auto rotated

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.950 
the still web browser it's auto rotated
it's<00:00:43.050> not<00:00:43.200> open<00:00:43.530> sea

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960

range

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.280 

it's<00:00:50.460> pretty<00:00:50.790> much<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.090> same<00:00:51.510> thing<00:00:51.570> as<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
it's pretty much the same thing as the

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.270 
it's pretty much the same thing as the
default<00:00:53.100> web<00:00:53.580> browser<00:00:53.930> except<00:00:54.980> it<00:00:55.980> looks<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
default web browser except it looks a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.340 
default web browser except it looks a
little<00:00:56.400> different<00:00:56.810> an<00:00:57.810> auto<00:00:58.170> rotate<00:00:59.150> then<00:01:00.350> I'm

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
little different an auto rotate then I'm

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.440 
little different an auto rotate then I'm
soon<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.830> be<00:01:02.070> with<00:01:02.220> the<00:01:02.310> next<00:01:02.550> update<00:01:02.700> they

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
soon to be with the next update they

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.350 
soon to be with the next update they
should<00:01:03.660> add<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.020> the<00:01:04.520> virtual<00:01:05.520> keyboard<00:01:05.730> on

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
should add on the virtual keyboard on

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.290 
should add on the virtual keyboard on
the<00:01:06.390> screen<00:01:07.520> but<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.820> don't<00:01:08.970> think<00:01:09.090> that's

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
the screen but I don't think that's

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:17.110 
the screen but I don't think that's
happening<00:01:09.450> yet<00:01:11.330> so<00:01:12.330> let's<00:01:12.630> go<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.990> myspace<00:01:15.620> /

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
happening yet so let's go to myspace /

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:26.700 
happening yet so let's go to myspace /
you<00:01:18.120> have<00:01:18.360> myspace

no<00:01:29.990> it's<00:01:30.170> not

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.540 

as<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.460> see<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.790> pretty<00:01:41.970> fast<00:01:42.300> but

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
as you can see it's pretty fast but

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.370 
as you can see it's pretty fast but
that's<00:01:44.550> also<00:01:44.760> because<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.180> have<00:01:45.330> three<00:01:45.690> bars<00:01:45.930> on

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
that's also because I have three bars on

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:55.450 
that's also because I have three bars on
my<00:01:47.630> Wi-Fi<00:01:49.850> okay

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:35.000 

it<00:02:13.430> seems<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:13.879> be<00:02:14.000> as<00:02:14.090> elf<00:02:14.269> slow<00:02:14.480> right<00:02:14.659> now

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.860 

I<00:02:35.099> don't<00:02:36.000> know<00:02:36.120> what's<00:02:36.269> happening<00:02:36.629> right<00:02:36.720> now

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.460 
I don't know what's happening right now
but<00:02:37.409> it<00:02:37.860> usually<00:02:38.099> does<00:02:38.519> not<00:02:38.549> do<00:02:38.879> this<00:02:39.470> let's
