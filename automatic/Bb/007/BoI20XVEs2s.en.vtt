a specialist didn't really want the

thing baddies and smoke grenades so it's

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.210 
thing baddies and smoke grenades so it's
a<00:01:10.300> bit<00:01:10.450> more<00:01:10.600> more<00:01:10.840> Mellie<00:01:11.260> orientated<00:01:11.950> and

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
a bit more more Mellie orientated and

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.120 
a bit more more Mellie orientated and
this<00:01:13.210> if<00:01:13.479> you<00:01:13.630> put<00:01:13.780> flashes<00:01:14.170> on<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.350> spamming

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
this if you put flashes on the spamming

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.130 
this if you put flashes on the spamming
of<00:01:15.550> the<00:01:15.760> flashes<00:01:16.150> can<00:01:16.329> get<00:01:16.509> really<00:01:16.719> a<00:01:16.869> routine

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
of the flashes can get really a routine

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.649 
of the flashes can get really a routine
quite<00:01:17.409> fast<00:01:17.680> I<00:01:17.979> gave<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.790> juggernaut<00:01:19.149> 50<00:01:19.570> is

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
quite fast I gave the juggernaut 50 is

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.179 
quite fast I gave the juggernaut 50 is
this<00:01:19.810> one<00:01:19.930> of<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.079> slowest<00:01:20.469> mobility<00:01:20.920> weapons

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
this one of the slowest mobility weapons

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.100 
this one of the slowest mobility weapons
in<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.340> game<00:01:21.369> is<00:01:22.270> silenced<00:01:22.780> to<00:01:22.840> make<00:01:22.990> it

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
in the game is silenced to make it

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.779 
in the game is silenced to make it
slower<00:01:24.600> weaker<00:01:25.600> sorry<00:01:25.810> I<00:01:26.079> prefer<00:01:26.560> it<00:01:26.950> so<00:01:27.640> that

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
slower weaker sorry I prefer it so that

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.069 
slower weaker sorry I prefer it so that
the<00:01:27.880> juggernaut<00:01:28.240> really<00:01:28.450> uses<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.899> melee

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
the juggernaut really uses the melee

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.050 
the juggernaut really uses the melee
attack<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.500> most<00:01:29.680> him<00:01:30.100> help<00:01:30.340> with<00:01:30.549> the<00:01:30.700> sniper

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
attack the most him help with the sniper

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.940 
attack the most him help with the sniper
rifle<00:01:31.450> bar<00:01:31.630> I<00:01:31.840> think<00:01:32.469> it's<00:01:32.590> best<00:01:32.710> if<00:01:32.829> you<00:01:32.920> just

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
rifle bar I think it's best if you just

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.999 
rifle bar I think it's best if you just
mean<00:01:33.219> in<00:01:33.399> life<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:35.439> could<00:01:35.560> give<00:01:35.740> him<00:01:35.829> about

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
mean in life you could give him about

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.969 
mean in life you could give him about
work<00:01:36.219> and<00:01:36.250> I<00:01:36.430> guess<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:37.439> but<00:01:38.439> if<00:01:38.530> you<00:01:38.619> did<00:01:38.829> I'd

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
work and I guess and but if you did I'd

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.469 
work and I guess and but if you did I'd
give<00:01:39.159> them<00:01:39.280> overkill<00:01:39.729> because<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.360> low

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
give them overkill because the low

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.709 
give them overkill because the low
mobility<00:01:40.659> and<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:42.700> sort<00:01:42.969> of<00:01:43.030> what<00:01:43.149> bounces

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 
mobility and it's sort of what bounces

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:44.999 
mobility and it's sort of what bounces
out<00:01:43.840> of<00:01:43.869> it<00:01:44.079> because<00:01:44.200> if<00:01:44.409> you<00:01:44.469> give<00:01:44.590> him<00:01:44.710> a<00:01:44.770> fast

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
out of it because if you give him a fast

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.620 
out of it because if you give him a fast
weapon<00:01:45.430> you<00:01:45.820> never<00:01:46.090> gonna<00:01:46.240> be<00:01:46.299> able<00:01:46.359> to<00:01:46.479> catch

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
weapon you never gonna be able to catch

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.270 
weapon you never gonna be able to catch
them<00:01:46.869> and<00:01:47.649> it<00:01:47.770> become<00:01:47.979> practically

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
them and it become practically

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.980 
them and it become practically
invincible<00:01:48.549> or<00:01:49.090> you<00:01:49.180> could<00:01:49.299> give<00:01:49.390> an<00:01:49.509> lmg<00:01:49.960> oh

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
invincible or you could give an lmg oh

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.740 
invincible or you could give an lmg oh
guess<00:01:50.259> but<00:01:50.530> that's<00:01:50.740> quite<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.009> powerful<00:01:51.250> weapon

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
guess but that's quite a powerful weapon

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.910 
guess but that's quite a powerful weapon
that's<00:01:52.750> why<00:01:52.990> there's<00:01:53.229> two<00:01:53.409> riot<00:01:53.680> shield

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
that's why there's two riot shield

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.779 
that's why there's two riot shield
setups<00:01:54.340> one's<00:01:55.179> got<00:01:55.390> speed<00:01:55.659> girls<00:01:56.079> got<00:01:56.259> Mellie

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
setups one's got speed girls got Mellie

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.249 
setups one's got speed girls got Mellie
mainly<00:01:57.789> Mellie's<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.270> better<00:01:58.479> one<00:01:58.689> but<00:01:59.079> if

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
mainly Mellie's the better one but if

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.499 
mainly Mellie's the better one but if
using<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.679> specialist<00:02:00.219> the<00:02:00.460> killstreaks<00:02:01.240> and

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
using the specialist the killstreaks and

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:02.999 
using the specialist the killstreaks and
the<00:02:01.659> juggernauts<00:02:02.049> gets<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.500> speed<00:02:02.710> from<00:02:02.890> it

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
the juggernauts gets the speed from it

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.340 
the juggernauts gets the speed from it
up<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.250> second<00:02:03.579> before<00:02:03.820> he<00:02:03.969> kills<00:02:04.329> then<00:02:05.259> he

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
up the second before he kills then he

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.749 
up the second before he kills then he
can<00:02:05.439> be<00:02:05.530> really<00:02:05.740> hard<00:02:05.799> to<00:02:05.950> chase<00:02:06.159> down<00:02:06.189> so<00:02:06.670> you

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
can be really hard to chase down so you

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.359 
can be really hard to chase down so you
mean<00:02:06.969> to<00:02:07.000> switch<00:02:07.359> their<00:02:07.539> speed<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:07.899> capture

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
mean to switch their speed to capture

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.770 
mean to switch their speed to capture
the<00:02:09.369> juggernaut<00:02:09.729> isn't<00:02:10.000> really<00:02:10.240> that<00:02:10.390> hard<00:02:10.600> to

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
the juggernaut isn't really that hard to

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.420 
the juggernaut isn't really that hard to
be<00:02:10.899> honest<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.260> take<00:02:11.410> down<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.890> takes<00:02:12.340> about

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
be honest to take down it takes about

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.800 
be honest to take down it takes about
four<00:02:12.700> or<00:02:12.730> five<00:02:12.790> hits<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:13.270> shield<00:02:13.540> take

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
four or five hits of the shield take

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.630 
four or five hits of the shield take
them<00:02:13.930> down<00:02:14.110> if<00:02:14.890> you've<00:02:15.130> good<00:02:15.310> enough<00:02:15.520> when

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
them down if you've good enough when

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.610 
them down if you've good enough when
you're<00:02:15.760> on<00:02:15.850> your<00:02:15.880> take<00:02:16.150> them<00:02:16.270> down<00:02:16.420> if<00:02:16.690> not<00:02:16.750> two

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
you're on your take them down if not two

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.050 
you're on your take them down if not two
of<00:02:17.770> you<00:02:17.890> is<00:02:18.160> more<00:02:18.370> than<00:02:18.520> enough<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.790> take<00:02:18.940> them

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
of you is more than enough to take them

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.309 
of you is more than enough to take them
out<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:19.420> you<00:02:19.480> want<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.780> keep<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:19.930> protected<00:02:20.050> at

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
out so you want to keep you protected at

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.910 
out so you want to keep you protected at
all<00:02:20.349> times<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:21.010> when<00:02:21.970> we<00:02:22.090> play<00:02:22.239> on<00:02:22.330> doom<00:02:22.540> I

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
all times and when we play on doom I

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.110 
all times and when we play on doom I
tightly<00:02:23.920> like<00:02:24.159> you'll<00:02:24.459> probably<00:02:24.700> see<00:02:24.940> in<00:02:25.030> this

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
tightly like you'll probably see in this

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.559 
tightly like you'll probably see in this
game

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
game

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.589 
game
is<00:02:25.870> that<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:27.400> lot<00:02:27.819> of<00:02:27.879> people<00:02:27.969> get<00:02:28.239> up<00:02:28.390> on<00:02:28.510> the

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
is that a lot of people get up on the

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.009 
is that a lot of people get up on the
ledge<00:02:28.780> which<00:02:29.939> it's<00:02:30.939> a<00:02:31.030> tactic<00:02:31.389> I<00:02:31.480> guess<00:02:31.719> and

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
ledge which it's a tactic I guess and

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.750 
ledge which it's a tactic I guess and
it's<00:02:32.620> not<00:02:32.769> actually<00:02:33.040> as<00:02:33.159> good<00:02:33.340> as<00:02:33.459> you<00:02:33.549> think

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
it's not actually as good as you think

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.339 
it's not actually as good as you think
but<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.180> can<00:02:34.389> be<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.569> good<00:02:34.659> idea<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.959> get<00:02:35.200> the

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
but it can be a good idea to get the

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.410 
but it can be a good idea to get the
juggernaut<00:02:35.769> up<00:02:35.859> there<00:02:36.099> and<00:02:36.280> some<00:02:37.120> people<00:02:37.329> try

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
juggernaut up there and some people try

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.789 
juggernaut up there and some people try
to<00:02:37.450> block<00:02:37.719> off<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:37.989> end<00:02:38.139> but<00:02:38.349> then<00:02:38.499> you're<00:02:38.709> not

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
to block off the end but then you're not

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:39.989 
to block off the end but then you're not
really<00:02:38.920> going<00:02:39.129> to<00:02:39.219> get<00:02:39.310> kills<00:02:39.519> from<00:02:39.639> it<00:02:39.819> so

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:39.999 
really going to get kills from it so

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.780 
really going to get kills from it so
it's<00:02:40.180> up<00:02:40.299> to<00:02:40.329> you<00:02:41.250> we've<00:02:42.250> only<00:02:42.400> really<00:02:42.579> played

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
it's up to you we've only really played

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.179 
it's up to you we've only really played
this<00:02:42.909> I'm<00:02:43.090> doomed<00:02:43.299> but<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:44.079> think<00:02:44.889> some<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:45.069> the

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
this I'm doomed but I think some of the

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.860 
this I'm doomed but I think some of the
faceoff<00:02:45.670> maps<00:02:45.909> would<00:02:46.030> be<00:02:46.150> really<00:02:46.359> good<00:02:46.569> for<00:02:46.719> it

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
faceoff maps would be really good for it

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.679 
faceoff maps would be really good for it
tick<00:02:47.139> bites<00:02:47.349> me<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:48.180> no<00:02:49.180> one's<00:02:49.359> to<00:02:49.420> play<00:02:49.540> on<00:02:49.599> a

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:49.689 
tick bites me and no one's to play on a

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:51.030 
tick bites me and no one's to play on a
big<00:02:49.840> map<00:02:50.049> because<00:02:50.230> gonna<00:02:50.409> be<00:02:50.469> hogging<00:02:50.709> across

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
big map because gonna be hogging across

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.890 
big map because gonna be hogging across
the<00:02:51.159> whole<00:02:51.310> level<00:02:51.489> to<00:02:51.700> get<00:02:51.849> all<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.180> time<00:02:52.329> so<00:02:52.629> I

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
the whole level to get all the time so I

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.920 
the whole level to get all the time so I
taste<00:02:53.290> more<00:02:53.469> much<00:02:53.620> in<00:02:53.999> generally<00:02:54.999> that's<00:02:55.689> the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
taste more much in generally that's the

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.080 
taste more much in generally that's the
enjoyment<00:02:56.379> but<00:02:56.499> they<00:02:56.680> some<00:02:57.579> people<00:02:57.609> just<00:02:57.969> take

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
enjoyment but they some people just take

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.420 
enjoyment but they some people just take
it's<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.510> bit<00:02:58.659> of<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.840> Marmite<00:02:59.260> sort<00:02:59.469> of<00:02:59.590> game<00:02:59.739> but

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
it's a bit of a Marmite sort of game but

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.649 
it's a bit of a Marmite sort of game but
we've<00:03:00.579> had<00:03:00.700> people<00:03:00.849> just<00:03:01.180> come<00:03:01.389> in<00:03:01.540> just
