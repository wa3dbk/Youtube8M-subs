00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.600 
have to find a way to figure out how to
break<00:01:46.509> even<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:47.799> not<00:01:47.979> it's<00:01:48.250> never<00:01:48.429> been

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
break even it's not it's never been

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.899 
break even it's not it's never been
about<00:01:48.670> making<00:01:49.420> money<00:01:50.250> how<00:01:51.250> do<00:01:51.310> we<00:01:51.399> break<00:01:51.670> even

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
about making money how do we break even

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.870 
about making money how do we break even
but<00:01:52.630> also<00:01:52.810> you<00:01:53.530> can't<00:01:53.920> do<00:01:54.190> that<00:01:54.369> until<00:01:54.640> you

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
but also you can't do that until you

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.600 
but also you can't do that until you
kind<00:01:55.179> of<00:01:55.209> get<00:01:55.330> a<00:01:55.390> clear<00:01:55.810> idea<00:01:56.080> of<00:01:56.679> the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
kind of get a clear idea of the

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.230 
kind of get a clear idea of the
direction<00:01:57.850> because<00:01:58.209> it's<00:01:58.720> totally<00:01:58.990> unreal

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
direction because it's totally unreal

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.020 
direction because it's totally unreal
serious<00:02:01.240> or<00:02:01.509> completely<00:02:02.080> it's<00:02:02.920> completely

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
serious or completely it's completely

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.730 
serious or completely it's completely
here<00:02:04.030> you<00:02:04.840> know<00:02:04.929> it's<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.200> Bernie<00:02:05.530> Madoff

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
here you know it's the Bernie Madoff

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.229 
phone you know how you think it's all a
pyramid<00:02:08.830> scheme<00:02:09.099> because<00:02:09.310> they<00:02:09.640> can't<00:02:09.880> let<00:02:10.119> it

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
pyramid scheme because they can't let it

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.420 
pyramid scheme because they can't let it
go<00:02:10.420> because<00:02:11.319> if<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:11.739> do<00:02:11.920> then<00:02:11.950> all

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
go because if you do then all

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.430 
go because if you do then all
advertising<00:02:12.910> will<00:02:13.150> disappear<00:02:13.660> right<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.350> you

you're 50 million people can see a point

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.620 
you're 50 million people can see a point
but<00:02:31.010> how<00:02:31.160> do<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.340> monetize<00:02:31.730> that<00:02:31.790> you<00:02:32.540> know

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
but how do you monetize that you know

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.120 
but how do you monetize that you know
how<00:02:32.750> do<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:32.930> get<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.230> back<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.920> people

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
how do you get that back to the people

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.640 
how do you get that back to the people
who<00:02:34.400> made<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.790> moving<00:02:35.120> or<00:02:35.210> is<00:02:35.360> on<00:02:35.690> hold<00:02:36.260> now

who made the moving or is on hold now
well<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.220> reason<00:02:37.400> that's<00:02:37.730> awful<00:02:38.150> we<00:02:38.360> have<00:02:38.620> 50

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
well the reason that's awful we have 50

of the most unbelievable scraps I mean
they're<00:02:42.440> really<00:02:42.470> each<00:02:42.970> one-hour<00:02:43.970> episode<00:02:44.750> is

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
they're really each one-hour episode is

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.640 
they're really each one-hour episode is
bigger<00:02:45.550> than<00:02:46.550> any<00:02:47.180> of<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.600> prequels<00:02:48.080> work<00:02:48.260> I

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
bigger than any of the prequels work I

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.440 
bigger than any of the prequels work I
mean<00:02:48.980> they're<00:02:49.190> just<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.640> kind<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.910> complex

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
mean they're just you kind of complex

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.440 
mean they're just you kind of complex
their<00:02:50.810> darkbird<00:02:51.440> there<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.280> dull<00:02:52.670> girl<00:02:52.700> there

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
their darkbird there a dull girl there

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.770 
their darkbird there a dull girl there
it's<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.960> but<00:02:54.560> right<00:02:54.920> now<00:02:55.780> technologically

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
it's a but right now technologically

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.720 
it's a but right now technologically
just<00:02:56.960> no<00:02:57.140> way<00:02:57.320> we<00:02:57.350> can<00:02:57.650> do<00:02:57.800> them<00:02:58.040> for<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.520> kind

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
just no way we can do them for the kind

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.610 
just no way we can do them for the kind
of<00:02:58.790> five<00:02:59.060> billion<00:02:59.360> ball<00:02:59.630> which<00:03:00.260> would<00:03:00.380> be<00:03:00.500> the

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
of five billion ball which would be the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.390 
of five billion ball which would be the
facts<00:03:00.860> that<00:03:00.980> we<00:03:01.220> can<00:03:01.370> do<00:03:01.840> 595<00:03:02.840> million<00:03:03.830> episode

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
facts that we can do 595 million episode

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.000 
facts that we can do 595 million episode
5<00:03:04.670> million<00:03:05.060> so<00:03:05.390> and<00:03:05.810> that<00:03:06.230> is<00:03:06.530> because<00:03:06.680> there's

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
5 million so and that is because there's

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.220 
5 million so and that is because there's
so<00:03:07.310> much<00:03:07.459> digital<00:03:07.790> animation<00:03:08.390> because<00:03:08.990> we

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
so much digital animation because we

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.050 
so much digital animation because we
have<00:03:09.320> so<00:03:09.470> many<00:03:09.530> digital<00:03:09.920> characters<00:03:10.430> so<00:03:11.030> I

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
have so many digital characters so I

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.810 
have so many digital characters so I
think<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.540> idea<00:03:11.570> is<00:03:11.900> we'll<00:03:12.170> just<00:03:12.380> hold<00:03:12.590> off

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
think the idea is we'll just hold off

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.270 
think the idea is we'll just hold off
you<00:03:13.820> know<00:03:13.970> we'll<00:03:14.480> wait<00:03:14.720> see<00:03:15.620> if<00:03:15.800> any<00:03:15.950> there's

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
you know we'll wait see if any there's

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.890 
you know we'll wait see if any there's
any<00:03:16.459> major<00:03:16.670> breakthroughs<00:03:17.209> minix<00:03:17.570> year<00:03:17.750> or

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
any major breakthroughs minix year or

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.520 
any major breakthroughs minix year or
two<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:20.090> just<00:03:20.240> see<00:03:20.720> what's<00:03:20.930> going<00:03:20.990> to<00:03:21.170> happen

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
two and just see what's going to happen

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.870 
two and just see what's going to happen
and<00:03:21.650> then<00:03:21.770> once<00:03:21.980> we<00:03:22.160> can<00:03:22.340> kind<00:03:22.520> of<00:03:22.640> come<00:03:22.850> up

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
and then once we can kind of come up

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.699 
and then once we can kind of come up
with<00:03:23.150> either<00:03:23.270> a<00:03:23.360> virtual<00:03:23.840> set<00:03:24.080> software<00:03:24.560> that

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
with either a virtual set software that

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.800 
with either a virtual set software that
works<00:03:24.890> really<00:03:25.280> thing<00:03:25.940> that<00:03:26.150> allows<00:03:26.239> us<00:03:26.420> to

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
works really thing that allows us to

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.320 
works really thing that allows us to
trouble

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
trouble

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.230 
trouble
stuff<00:03:29.170> I<00:03:29.680> think<00:03:30.310> you'll<00:03:30.580> come<00:03:30.910> back<00:03:31.030> and

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
stuff I think you'll come back and

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.680 
stuff I think you'll come back and
revisit<00:03:31.360> hmm<00:03:32.200> if<00:03:32.620> we're<00:03:32.860> still<00:03:33.010> alive<00:03:33.690> but

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
revisit hmm if we're still alive but

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.090 
revisit hmm if we're still alive but
what<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:35.200> know<00:03:35.320> what<00:03:35.500> we<00:03:35.620> were<00:03:35.740> saying<00:03:35.890> about
