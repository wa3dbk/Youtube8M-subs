00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.380
 I wanted to communicate that this is mine 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.650
 brand new channel where to put 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.850
 ie gameplay that tutorial 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.980
 unfortunately I received two reports 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.570

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.700
 so for two weeks I will have to stay 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.710
 then I will let you know more 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.109
 in short, on the other channel for 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.949
 make you aware of this 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:40.960
 brand new channel and without getting lost in 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.120
 chat we start immediately with the 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.870
 demonstration, however, the download 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.670
 the tutorial on how to download minecraft 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.890
 1.7 point 8 so first of all 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.069
 we click on the first link in the 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.399
 description that will take us to a link on 

00:00:54.069 --> 00:01:00.579
 dropbox clear on download and the file is of 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.469
 1.1 megabytes so it really will be 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.560
 very little time so let's go to 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.740

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.820
 another let's say another version of the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.009
 kinect launcher which would be spv 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.399

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:25.409

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:28.080

 which in the launch or ok will continue 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.980
 however, it is the game once 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.770

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.570

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.940
 load if it is the first time precisely that 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.950
 charge don't worry if it takes 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.450
 so much so 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.390
