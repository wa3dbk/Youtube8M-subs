00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.530 
exciting now my theory is that these are
usually<00:05:28.400> them<00:05:29.400> that<00:05:29.880> these<00:05:30.060> are<00:05:30.300> usually

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
usually them that these are usually

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.160 
usually them that these are usually
ultra<00:05:31.260> rares<00:05:31.530> or<00:05:32.240> special<00:05:33.240> edition<00:05:33.660> frozen
