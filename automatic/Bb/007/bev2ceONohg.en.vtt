00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 You already made a code or something pee in 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.710
 some game just to make that zoeira 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.320
 monster course not think 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.450
 do this stop making codes 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.400
 in games is certainly one of the best 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.650
 things in games 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.529
 Fuck, it's too crazy, you make a chite. 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.109
 only to blow it all crazy one of the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.960
 most famous and well-known codes is 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.010
 the konami code you know what this is 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.170
 do not let me explain or try 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.160
 explain the konami code a chip that 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.290
 can be used in various konami games 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.100
 and pee is the same for all your 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.200
 games 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.690
 so if you decorate it you can use 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.780
 in any konami game summarizing 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.670

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.540
 co-ordinated nintendo 64 hack where you 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.050
 simply leaves everyone with a 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.870
 giant head yes the caralh head 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.420

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.970
 and it was made plain to zoeira because 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.910
 As you know, the zoeira never dies. 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.340
 I already said this once here in the beginning. 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.650

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.640
 instagram and follow belÃª another code 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.610
 totally smoked is one in which a 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.640
 dog whistles a football game that is 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.460
 the internet game does not supply is only that of 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.500
 super nintendo has this trip is only you 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.869

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.900
 presentation that starts this madness 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.119

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.570

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:06.240
 he barks at the stage that 's why 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.090
 I love the chips in games when 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.190
 We'll see a mutt in the middle of 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.550
 a soccer field 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.550
 there bce but also has the codes well 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:21.330
 bizarre like a man who stays 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.610
 An alien's grave of day and send 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.520
 But what is it ladies and gentlemen? 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.520

 can even play a pregnant man the 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.410
 It's really bizarre that he 's 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:43.920

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.940
 of man getting pregnant it needs to be 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.100
 abducted by cts appearing in the game 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.940
 You can do all this without doing any 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:03.120
 shift the 1 you make that code or case 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.610
 soon got serious with the baby rock hole 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.800
 for bullying would be a shame if he 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.930
 be an alien ready to kill you 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.540
 He encouraged me to talk a little more 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.069

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:22.600

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.699
 [Music] 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.260
 12 is one of the most popular games and 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.870
 Fuck already done in my opinion he 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.690
 has an absurd amount of codes 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.180
 one of the most senses is the famous and 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.460
 team that is active mode in clip ours 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.070
 character leaves flying goes through 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.990
 all the walls that neither satan thinks 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.360
 only gives to discover the dreads more 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.700
 spent on it is today that I think a 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:59.890
 easter egg location celbi floor same in 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:02.110
 two pilot and there in the game rpg in the also 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.210
 It has a bizarre code that leaves all 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:07.360
 players with a giant head looks like 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.970
 melon or acute melon that gave birth to 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.590
 this young man as well as in 007 to go 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.180
 nice you can also leave the 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.310
 players must face the players of 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.260
 basketball with a huge head stand so 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.570
 afraid you do not even know what's 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.300
 making laughs even and with 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:26.530
 sure and smoke a quarter of poison 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.810
 street the mortal poison kombat 3 also has 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.610
 a code that is beautiful 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.680
 If you guys are too lazy to learn 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.780
 things have a perfect code for 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.970
 you in the main menu that game there is a 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.760
 code that enables the secret menu 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.600
 menu with several options, one of these 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.130
 options 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.260
 it allows you to perform any 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.840
 fatality at the push of a button 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.790
 Look how easy you are in the fight. 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.310
 won pressed any button it does 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.830
 fatality is too crazy and also gives to 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.900
