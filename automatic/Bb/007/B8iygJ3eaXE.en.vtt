00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.410
 game 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.890
 the first thing you'll have to do is 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.289
 to do is to link pain to put the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.690

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.130
 x86 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.710
 You'll have to come here in the folder 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.650

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.380

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.780
 It 's easy too, everyone thinks it's 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.479
