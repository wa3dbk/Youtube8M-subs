at<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.570> bride's<00:02:44.840> didn't<00:02:45.380> do<00:02:45.440> anything<00:02:45.620> with

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
at the bride's didn't do anything with

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.060 
at the bride's didn't do anything with
the<00:02:45.830> headlights<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:46.820> it<00:02:46.970> all<00:02:47.060> stock<00:02:50.050> it<00:02:51.070> does

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
the headlights is it all stock it does

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:59.620 
the headlights is it all stock it does
have<00:02:52.310> a<00:02:52.340> BMC<00:02:53.150> air<00:02:53.900> filter<00:02:58.240> and<00:02:59.240> you<00:02:59.420> get<00:02:59.600> a

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
have a BMC air filter and you get a

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:07.220 
have a BMC air filter and you get a
taillight

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:17.580 

makes<00:03:07.890> it<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.040> little<00:03:08.099> easier<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.640> see

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.619 

I<00:03:17.680> didn't<00:03:18.430> put<00:03:18.580> the<00:03:18.730> relays<00:03:19.120> in<00:03:19.360> on<00:03:19.540> the

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
I didn't put the relays in on the

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.710 
I didn't put the relays in on the
taillight<00:03:20.080> so<00:03:20.319> it<00:03:20.410> blinks<00:03:20.680> a<00:03:20.739> little<00:03:20.950> faster

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
taillight so it blinks a little faster

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.059 
taillight so it blinks a little faster
which<00:03:22.720> I<00:03:22.959> think<00:03:23.290> also<00:03:23.500> makes<00:03:23.890> it<00:03:23.980> a<00:03:24.010> little

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
which I think also makes it a little

00:03:24.069 --> 00:04:13.140 
which I think also makes it a little
easier<00:03:24.459> to<00:03:24.580> see<00:03:25.200> and<00:03:26.200> start<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.590> up<00:03:26.680> for<00:03:26.739> you
