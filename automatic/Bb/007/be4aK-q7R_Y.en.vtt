00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:42.829
 button closed the doors too chopped 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.829
 I 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.800
 I will not start with number 11 in 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.430
 numbering sequence and this lipstick is 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:02.560
 so kind in the neighbor very well well 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:06.010
 romantic and lipsticks vult they do not 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.380
 they stay completely matka they do not stay 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.010
 that dry opaque 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.370
 see here it takes a little while to 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:18.910
 dry more than others but 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.869
 makes it much easier to apply this 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:25.479
 the 2 already already a nude same is that other 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:29.740
 first is the most rosadinho this is already a 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:33.310
 multi plus beige cord to 100 in 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.310
 very romantic belenzinho too and so 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.070
 not all of them what I realized is that it is 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.250
 it is not so difficult to apply 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:45.070
 Everyone, then, has the same 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.840
 apply bone that is great that also has 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.690
 a great coverage 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.500
 they all leave no leave 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.950
 stained what I also liked this 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.870
 provoke this is number three and is already a 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.510
 Pink more I arrived nor of all also 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.790
 all the things I loved but so has one 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:11.230
 mattress that I think is the next 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.519
 will see that I liked it and the 18 that is what 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.300
 I liked it more 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:18.070
 there number 2 also that I said I 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.780
 I liked all things to talk to 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:24.760
 It's true in girls, but I have 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:29.890
 They called but it is not mine. 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:32.080
 intention is then this is the number 3 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.950
 see the photo as it is after a 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.190
 time 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.400
 This is the face that she's talking to. 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:43.080
 you the number 4 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.080
 Look what a most beautiful purple 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.490
 He sticks in his mouth but he 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.740
 transfer yes, because it does not 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.400
 fully matt has a high 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:57.590
 durability and has excellent coverage 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.010
 but he does not stay that max and he blamed 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:05.740
 is also not here because she is 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.740
 also a good point in my opinion 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.210
 This one also called my 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.760
 attention is that in the video does not appear but 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.250
 it super that no lipstick looks like that 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.950
 well summer color I think in the photo goes 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.730
 give to see better is the blog also has 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.040
 multiple photos you will see how it 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.680
 It's okay, I got this lipstick and also the 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.380
 discrete earth in the video but it is not 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.850
 It's so hot, it's not that good, I got this. 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.320
 lipstick looking forward to you and he celebrates 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.540
 bit you cause of the part say 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.120
 so side to side 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.850
 The cool thing is that if you apply the 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.980
 lipstick miss you with cotton swab can 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.080
 take a look there is a little more 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.040
 open than the video 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:55.130
 this is already number 6 is a red 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:04:00.320
 well open well tomato so in a near 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:02.900
 button is the seventh is very similar to 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.660
 it does not feel that much difference in 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.300
 lips and also on the packaging I do not see 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.000
 so much difference so they have a certain 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.040
 difference but it is a very subtle difference 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.410
 and I do not think so much difference is seeing 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.200
 How did I tell you guys with the swab? 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.250
 so you can take the radinho with 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.490
 facility 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.360
 then the fetus of the other lipsticks kill that 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:30.290
 there is an easy application're 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:33.230
 but the river I found different is that it 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:37.100
 It is not completely dry mouth 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:41.330
 Because a lot of people like it and lots of it. 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:44.060
 People do not like it, so it was 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.560
 next button me a little more open 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.720
 than the other but it is not 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:56.000
 very different on the side you will see 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:56.000
 that does not have so much difference is 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.180
 easy to apply the first whistle 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.850
 center of the lips to remove the excess 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:09.389
 of the brush product and then I go 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:18.620
 to the sides of the boots 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:18.620
 every side and I hit the same pilot button 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:47.290
 next year is the eighth of the island 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:06:02.780
 wine very well in the face of winter to 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.970
 people all colors and I hope you guys 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.970
 gave a little blog there to see more 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.680

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.950
 tray in the curriculum and to the next 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.950
