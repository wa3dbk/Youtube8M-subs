00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.729
 World Water Day is celebrated on March 22nd 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.300
 that's why I started like the porfirio lobo engineer who is director of the 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.920
 civil engineering professional school and he told me about how engineering 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.410
 civil and its new ones take care of the liquid element 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.809
 Well, we have an obligation to satisfy the basic needs of 

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:22.730
 the population 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.730
 to close drainage water networks with that domicile tanks reservoirs 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.770
 Elevated cisterns oxidation plant are needed throughout the peru so 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.690
 less than 40% of the Peruvian population lacks these services and therefore the 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.739
 civil engineering hygiene and oil and environmental 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.199
 are the careers that are going to provide solutions to this serious problem 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.489
 to the entire dog population nowadays they continue to apply 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.559
 innovative water treatment projects in the vehicle and in various places 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.540
 of the planet 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.080
 fundamentally and work has started on seawater desalination not 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.330
 only for human consumption serve for various industrial enterprises 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.799
 mining companies as mass household 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.369
 volcano and others have begun to desalinate the water to mark ibold villar 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.789
 the fallacy that is a trend 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.569
 who would be mind has to do but already started to chile we have the 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:23.829
 Israeli example that has a great experience about this and knowing that the 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.880
 global warming is going to limit the production of ice in the mountains 

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:29.490
 Peruvian 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.750
 that is a tendency to solve much of this water shortage 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.479
 that will come in the next months the engineer who works on the subject of water 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.479
 is a professional concerned about the ecological balance 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.860
 With its work, it improves the quality of the water we consume and at the same time reduces the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.260
 pollution of our rivers not to industrial development there is no development 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.260
 miner 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.060
 there is no urban development institute that at this moment is not a study of 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.640
 environmental impact 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.600
 and that's why eta has created awareness in the whole community now if we 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.170
 we worry we have to clean up all the rivers that the fish come back to 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.290
 shrimp develop normally in all the rivers of the coast 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.860
 clean up the rivers of the jungle and now it is a global concern is a job 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.039
 absolutely necessary and has present and has a future 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:24.590
 until the earth exists 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.439
 you know 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.629
 Water contributes to the development of the country 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.400
 if it is a social vocation 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.400
 keep in mind that as a professional engineer you can contribute to the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.430
 manure remove 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.740
 until the next eat
