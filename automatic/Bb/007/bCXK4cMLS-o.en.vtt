00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.009
 few days on the other 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.560
 understandably took place coast of 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:28.019
 Belgium and the coalition 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.779
 I did not expect it to be that way 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.310
 extremely gaudy extremely colorful many 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.290
 use the word techno in the 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.510
 connection with the collection for me 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.210
 is in the rainbow fish world 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.300
 collection very irritating metallic 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.380
 very bright colors the heart was for 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.810
 me probably the pee metallic jabari 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.310
 trenchcoat is just a thing going on 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.610
 even my make-up on me, I have quasi 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.870
 came from these inspired 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.160
 you have to remember, of course, is natural 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.440
 no autumn winter but the spring 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.720
 summer 2013 collection for that very reason 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.750
 the colors are not as early especially 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.210
 me yes and otherwise another tip 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.860
 I try of course I live in a 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.310

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.730
 very big ones are all great love 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.780
 in any case, also for the show music 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.780
 Everything for the first two years 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.830

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.890
 also a single link at really that 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:32.010
 my autumn songs compared to the 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:34.030
 very cheerful sparkling cheeky 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.550
 colorful collection because this yes 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.290
 but a bit carry very much 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.510
 nice and can be like a heart for me 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.950
 lungs can be just perfect but show 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.990
 I you the make-up times of for you 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.300
 at the heart of the collection is probably one 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.900
 extremely clinker really hot pink 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.310
 grapefruit and yes in a comprehensive way 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.070
 I now to one determined by 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.530
 He georgia already it is almost 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:01.300
 really like a fist on the eye 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.550
 that's that color and that's very 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.080
 intense though she is also very light 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.630
 of feeling he 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.450
 and somehow ii fits perfectly for me 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.190
 just on this trenchcoat and this one 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.900
 iridescent lux and bit too 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.200
 I got it from essens here 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.050
 the cherry blossom girl 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.459
 a highlight of the brush taken and 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.130
 that 's just one of them when you're downstairs 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.930
 then the liquid comes out and 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.300
 I have that first under the eye and 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.459
 on the whole eyelid out in the 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.180
 crease distributed as I have here 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.799
 pigment by mckinnon, unfortunately I know 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.510
 that is because i put these into single ones 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.750
 stepic you've transferred it evil 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.200
 at least this purple show you 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.180
 but still say my recording and 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.340
 yes, I know that has the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.799
 Collection of these rules about fish 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.209
 remembered history and therefore have 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.219
 I took a lot of colors as much 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.139
 irritate have subsided with 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:01.230
 a globe pigment and that's how it is 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:03.930
 perfect alien the pigment because that 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.019
 changed from rosalia to green and 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.090
 dark blue and is one of my absolute 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.189
 do not bring but out to this has 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.260
 pink I finally by me on 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:15.780
 super nova chosen as a place 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.829
 i have drawn contour performance 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.459
 but of course with 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.799
 neutral driver and the two fit 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.599
 really good together because of it 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.909
 yes a very difficult very metallic 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.400
 I also had him as a highlighter 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.530
 something was taken which was always and not 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.769
 directly metallic also very nice 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.079
 is quiet and although by max gives finish 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.359
 exactly porcelain pink means that 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.069
 clarity part truths mascara - 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.079
 they have been in bayern for a very long time 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.890
 heart lies I have always test 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.600
 wanted 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.800
 while others test by make a 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.140
 factory orders camelot idpro and that was 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.790
 now really excited the brush 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.900
 because somehow exerts not got something 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.730
 I have not had such a longer time now 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.620
 bit grips and companies almost want 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.910
 I say 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.560
 and that is waterproof I had it 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.850
 So you do not try to get it off 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.290
 I do not want my mother there yet 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.850
 solve yes I do not know if it you 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.830
 but I'm wearing mine 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.800
 hair is a bit different today as well 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.690
 similar to the london fashion week though 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.400
 I have not in the fall into what 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.519
 you been reading a article about leaks 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.739
 and drive versions for you there just now 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.200
 also worn on the shirts and that 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.200
 was her interpretation of one 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.790
 Dutt and with a year of idm not 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.500
 It's all arranged and I believe it 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.360
 would now often wear it again 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:34.500
 with this very minimalist the 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.760
 flat pony is one but a bit 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.590
 Restricted you can see all eye make-up 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.900
 unfortunately not always so good if you are more 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.610
 We give you money that I like 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.860
 the ponies on so a bit more open and 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.440
 a little bit of a different year I say 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.320
 now so much less effort 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.430
 you liked the video and we did 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.430
 see you again tomorrow
