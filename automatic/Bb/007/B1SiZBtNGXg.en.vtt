00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.979
 today in 403 and 404 405 models that deeply marked the history of 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:07.999
 Argentine pressure 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:10.879
 408 continues with tradition 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:11.829
 it was declared 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:15.499
 We do not just say that there is nn your car, it does not affect our roots 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:18.009
 that the production image the country was built 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.199
 with those cars a little bit mythical at this height 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.020
 so 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.020
 e 408 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.529
 sabo do as we say in French 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.770
 experience 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.520
 in this type of vehicle 13 like that one started with the right foot if 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.040
 you say called peugeot and it's a medium size 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.050
 here the public physically points 408 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.990
 i to say it in a simple way without using of say technical school 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.840
 it's a car 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.710
 of the people who looked for some other space are 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.060
 with a generous trunk or spaces inside to be able to go four person 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.940
 very comfortable to take a long trip 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.690
 and have a trunk 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.970
 according to that 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.500
 They are customers who are looking for 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.640
 the car has an elegant style 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.730
 more than pretentious or very exhibitionist of the outside shot in that 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.690
 cute but elegant rather refined 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.830
 By the way, they are customers who are looking for a comfort on board 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.080
 the interior of the car 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.460
 do not mark certain status or 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.050
 or pleasure of state within you that has to do with the materials that one 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.330
 choose 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.930
 by the way info of design and colors with him muse for the interior of the car and 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.070
 Then there is a set of equipment in the country that starts to be like 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.580
 as mandatory or one thing have to do with security 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.930
 that the client is cement wants to have 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.190
 efe for example to bs assistance to emergency braking distributed electric 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.840
 of braking all things that know that this one 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.860
 who take care of you 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.360
 issues of audio and connectivity that I heard is like they are not discussed 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.289
 to be able to talk on a cell phone 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.960
 without using his hands and bush accusing him the car speakers 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.490
 we will add these new music devices 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:15.579
 per hundred without without any problem percent and has this meaning we add 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:19.489
 as a plus that all these audio connectivity and navigation stuff 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.659
 yes cps 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.820
 we have it all recovered 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.959
 and unify a screen 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.889
 7 inch retractable and motorized cash color 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.409
 that you can hide all 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.049
 or you can unfold all 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.529
 or choose angles ret all the information of the car in this kind of 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:40.009
 thing all the coexistence with the car is another of this screen 

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:43.289
 and having the navigation on board I think that this is that this combination of 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:46.859
 things also made a difference of 408 between mine equipment 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.189
 15% of sales 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.749
 of production percent and hereafter for is represented by 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:54.749
 this car 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:56.840
 take it out of 15% sales 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.339
 and in addition to increasing 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:00.609
 we did not have a 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.409
 impulsively a representative in this segment then 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.539
 everything we add comfortable in the 8 is additional 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:11.519
 i to the regime let's say taking a full year of activity when we have 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.739
 released all versions of 408 that is still not the case 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:19.610
 has great challenge represents 15% of of our sales 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.129
 this time 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.519
 percent something like a point and a half of the total Argentine market 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.419
 the oar 408 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.379
 a fundamental point 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:34.030
 which means the development of a new model for an automotive plant 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.129
 yes and now what 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.349
 what one who lives it in 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.169
 he feels a lot of pride and much joy with term because 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.119
 a project 

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:47.839
 between people do not know but a proxecto where a new car of that 

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:51.599
 company three years before the day d trotamos throwing 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.519
 percent and involved in the case of 480 and profit design centers 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.929
 from around the world where he founded global success 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:03.089
 It began to be conceived in our design center in France but after 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:06.529
 participated shanghai because it is a car that is marketed in china also it 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:07.829
 produce in china 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:08.830
 Saint Paul 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.400
 from buenos aires tax center that our engineering center emte monkeys between 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.029
 actors have gone from conception 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:17.049
 and then in what is the industrial framework is manufactured 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.170
 solon 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:21.979
 for all latin america brazil as a priority bra and others 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.009
 twenty countries that will also receive it 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:29.020
 percent and which means that one can sustain employment levels or 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.870
 tall 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.960
 all the indirect jobs it generates in suppliers 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.240
 percent the additional volume generated by the dealer network 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:39.840
 which also generates indirect jobs, 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.409
 they are a great added value 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.259
 There are many implications of the 408, for example, a subject that is very much in vogue lately 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.160
 according to the commercial balance 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.230
 the wall that 408 9 brings favorably 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.440
 yes when we when our group say sits with 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:04.050
 to present and give figures today 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.999
 incorporate the data of 408 with a reality 

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:11.949
 especially at the level of exports that will generate thought that we are going to bruce 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:17.759
 hidalgo as well as 22 thousand cars per year and for the local market are eight to nine 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.849
 thousand all the rest is exported generates many currencies for the country 

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:22.839
 the with which 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:27.509
 marta group that is in argentina also p is very relevant in sense 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:29.050
 what forest again 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.110
 we are turning to the second quarter of the year 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.139
 for more inri in the berma novelty still for france 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.410
 yes there will be more news we continue with all achieve 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.750
 which are afp 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:40.550
 a bite 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.860
 detailed that 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.029
 small 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:46.589
 that was eaten was felt with brazilian eyes to present to the third quarter of 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:47.419
 year 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.309
 per cent the 508 os the high-end sedan 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.930
 of sweet in the world that was presented as a prize in the Paris parlor 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.210
 latest 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.490
 percent and also 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.150
 the wolf is marketed in the country so 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.169
 the wounds in the commercial offensive 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.629
 mainly with products of doubtful Argentina will really continue 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:09.319
 one for a good time
