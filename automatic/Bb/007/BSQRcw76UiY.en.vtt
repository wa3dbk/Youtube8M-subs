00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 for a start I will squeeze out tonal 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.540
 cream myself narka then already take it on 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.960
 brush brush will use this 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.090
 here 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.309
 round kabuki but that way which i 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.469
 I'll show you how to cut 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.420
 exactly brushes brought brushes heels and 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.100
 for brushes long fiber recruit 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.170
 foundation we are such light 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.180
 driving in slightly in order to 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.640
 to make the foundation on the brush and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.410
 v-shape is very evenly needed for 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.570
 so that he with further and also 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.240
 evenly fit on your core 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.520
 started population the message died from the center 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.800
 faces 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.079
 make light semi circular motions for 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.290
 to make the foundation and go to bed 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.390
 well and evenly distributed to 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.840
 he filled the strip some irregularities 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:52.140
 some kind of hollow skin 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.160
 wounds pimples and everything else we put cream 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.520
 and how much is needed 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.800
 when almost r is without brush 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.050
 tonal cream apply tonal cream 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.690
 closer to the hair area under the eyes 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.180
 foundation - it is slightly killing 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.640
 so clapping movements get up 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.799
 and zones near the Sinan class do not stretch 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.820
 if you apply a foundation on it 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.159
 everything else 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.060
 again doing such semicircles in and 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.060
 motion 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.040
 now we need to do so 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.230
 this zone she kept well and was 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.290
 more resistant beyond that if there is 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.010
 many times we take a brush and drive in 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:00.110
 good movements we try 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.110
 secure foundation with this area 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.370
 and the foundation will be more persistent 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.860
 in addition it will fill the pores they 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.440
 underline them and here we are 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.600
 the result after applying the tone 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.910
 cream with the help of such a round 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.830
 With a kabuki brush I will repeat 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.170
 Kabuki's pussy and the barrel of fiber 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.750
 This method is suitable for daily 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.270
 use that is maximum hatches 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.100
 as fast as possible 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.020
 applying foundation with the help 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.550
 so in the brush it is more resistant 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.680
 What is the option when you put 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.780
 foundation with fingers I 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.550
 you way with the help of fingers also 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.320
 showed in a previous video about one way or 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.450
 otherwise just expand the description there 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.920
 there will be a lot of useful information and pulse 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.630
 links to other related videos 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.520

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.739
