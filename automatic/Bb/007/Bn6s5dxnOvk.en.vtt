00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
think I'll go with la VM so that's

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.690 
think I'll go with la VM so that's
because<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.379> think<00:00:49.649> I've<00:00:49.980> programmed<00:00:50.280> this

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
because I think I've programmed this

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.420 
because I think I've programmed this
pipeline<00:00:51.000> or<00:00:51.510> minecraft<00:00:52.379> mod<00:00:52.800> better<00:00:53.250> than

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
pipeline or minecraft mod better than

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.180 
pipeline or minecraft mod better than
the<00:00:53.520> other<00:00:53.670> two<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.170> go<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.410> one<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.800> so

so<00:03:33.220> while<00:03:33.400> Catlin<00:03:33.730> fainted<00:03:34.240> and<00:03:34.390> I've<00:03:34.840> gained

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
so while Catlin fainted and I've gained

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.770 
so while Catlin fainted and I've gained
32<00:03:35.320> experience<00:03:35.770> points<00:03:36.040> so<00:03:36.700> that's<00:03:37.210> the<00:03:37.390> basic

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
32 experience points so that's the basic

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.740 
32 experience points so that's the basic
concept<00:03:37.950> again<00:03:38.950> this<00:03:39.340> has<00:03:39.520> been<00:03:39.700> a<00:03:40.060> huge

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
concept again this has been a huge

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.090 
concept again this has been a huge
project<00:03:41.080> for<00:03:41.320> me<00:03:41.440> I've<00:03:41.560> been<00:03:41.680> working<00:03:41.950> on<00:03:42.010> this

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
project for me I've been working on this

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.240 
project for me I've been working on this
for<00:03:42.310> around<00:03:42.640> five<00:03:43.630> to<00:03:43.780> six<00:03:43.930> months<00:03:44.110> so<00:03:44.290> yeah<00:03:45.010> so

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
for around five to six months so yeah so

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.670 
for around five to six months so yeah so
there's<00:03:45.700> quite<00:03:45.880> a<00:03:45.910> lot<00:03:46.060> that's<00:03:46.390> put<00:03:47.260> into<00:03:47.470> this

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
there's quite a lot that's put into this

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.160 
there's quite a lot that's put into this
game<00:03:48.330> again<00:03:49.330> this<00:03:49.480> is<00:03:49.660> just<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:49.900> proof<00:03:50.050> of

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
game again this is just a proof of

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.290 
game again this is just a proof of
concept<00:03:50.290> so<00:03:51.070> it's<00:03:51.310> not<00:03:51.430> a<00:03:51.489> complete<00:03:51.910> game<00:03:52.060> just

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
concept so it's not a complete game just

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.180 
concept so it's not a complete game just
yet<00:03:52.480> okay<00:03:52.660> so<00:03:53.260> let<00:03:53.650> me<00:03:53.709> show<00:03:53.770> you<00:03:53.980> one<00:03:54.160> more

yet okay so let me show you one more

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.699 
yet okay so let me show you one more
thing<00:03:54.420> as<00:03:55.420> you<00:03:55.840> can<00:03:55.870> notice<00:03:56.140> that<00:03:56.350> I<00:03:56.410> can't

thing as you can notice that I can't

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.580 
thing as you can notice that I can't
actually<00:03:56.830> jump<00:03:57.250> and<00:03:57.660> that's<00:03:58.660> done<00:03:59.080> with<00:03:59.380> a

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
actually jump and that's done with a

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.160 
actually jump and that's done with a
jump<00:03:59.890> effect<00:04:00.220> a<00:04:00.459> jump<00:04:01.060> boost<00:04:01.300> effect<00:04:01.600> with<00:04:01.930> an

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
jump effect a jump boost effect with an

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.790 
jump effect a jump boost effect with an
amplifier<00:04:02.709> of<00:04:03.360> 128<00:04:04.410> that<00:04:05.410> prevents<00:04:05.709> you<00:04:05.770> from

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
amplifier of 128 that prevents you from

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.090 
amplifier of 128 that prevents you from
jumping<00:04:06.360> also<00:04:07.360> if<00:04:07.690> I<00:04:07.959> walk<00:04:08.170> around<00:04:08.320> here<00:04:08.560> a

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
jumping also if I walk around here a

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.350 
jumping also if I walk around here a
while<00:04:09.130> pick<00:04:09.489> one<00:04:09.670> away<00:04:09.820> actually<00:04:10.120> appear

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
while pick one away actually appear

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.420 
while pick one away actually appear
that's<00:04:11.350> because<00:04:11.650> it<00:04:11.769> only<00:04:11.830> works<00:04:11.980> when<00:04:12.310> you're

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
that's because it only works when you're

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.550 
that's because it only works when you're
walking<00:04:12.550> around<00:04:12.730> toward<00:04:13.060> us<00:04:13.239> okay<00:04:14.080> so<00:04:14.140> I<00:04:14.290> won't

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
walking around toward us okay so I won't

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.860 
walking around toward us okay so I won't
go<00:04:14.739> into<00:04:15.070> the<00:04:15.970> command<00:04:16.239> blocks<00:04:16.510> in<00:04:16.660> too<00:04:16.750> much

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
go into the command blocks in too much

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.500 
go into the command blocks in too much
detail<00:04:17.049> and<00:04:17.470> that's<00:04:18.100> just<00:04:18.370> because<00:04:18.519> there<00:04:19.390> is

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
detail and that's just because there is

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.599 
detail and that's just because there is
a<00:04:19.540> lot<00:04:19.930> involved<00:04:20.350> so<00:04:21.010> let<00:04:21.160> me<00:04:21.220> just<00:04:21.340> show<00:04:21.519> you

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
a lot involved so let me just show you

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.610 
a lot involved so let me just show you
quickly<00:04:21.640> so<00:04:22.150> in<00:04:22.390> game<00:04:22.930> mode<00:04:23.080> see<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:23.560> I'll

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
quickly so in game mode see and I'll

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.750 
quickly so in game mode see and I'll
just<00:04:23.740> set<00:04:24.370> my<00:04:24.400> score<00:04:24.730> back<00:04:25.000> to<00:04:25.950> zero<00:04:26.950> which

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
just set my score back to zero which

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.460 
just set my score back to zero which
will<00:04:28.320> essentially<00:04:29.320> pause<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.770> game<00:04:30.390> okay<00:04:31.390> so

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
will essentially pause the game okay so

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.659 
will essentially pause the game okay so
this<00:04:32.470> is<00:04:32.650> all<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.890> command<00:04:33.130> blocks<00:04:33.310> involved

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
this is all the command blocks involved

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.930 
this is all the command blocks involved
there<00:04:34.480> is<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.600> lot<00:04:34.870> I<00:04:35.710> went<00:04:36.190> going<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.520> them<00:04:36.730> at

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
there is a lot I went going to them at

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.870 
there is a lot I went going to them at
all<00:04:37.060> actually<00:04:37.590> if<00:04:38.590> you<00:04:39.070> want<00:04:39.280> I<00:04:39.400> can<00:04:39.460> put<00:04:39.730> this

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
50th 50 video milestone it's been a

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.940 
50th 50 video milestone it's been a
pretty<00:04:57.730> wild<00:04:57.940> ride<00:04:58.060> actually<00:04:58.830> it's<00:04:59.830> about

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
pretty wild ride actually it's about

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.280 
pretty wild ride actually it's about
three<00:05:00.400> months<00:05:00.640> now<00:05:00.790> and<00:05:00.820> I've<00:05:01.090> gone<00:05:01.540> to<00:05:02.170> about
