Muskoka Lake
it's<00:02:11.100> an<00:02:11.310> ancient<00:02:11.459> boathouse<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.830> what's

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
it's an ancient boathouse and what's

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.680 
it's an ancient boathouse and what's
still<00:02:13.980> standing<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.730> sure<00:02:14.970> enough<00:02:15.239> there<00:02:15.480> is

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
still standing and sure enough there is

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.860 
still standing and sure enough there is
an<00:02:16.530> old<00:02:16.830> woody<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.190> here

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
an old woody in here

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.540 
an old woody in here
not<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.900> Minette<00:02:19.290> shields<00:02:19.980> or<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.130> ditch<00:02:20.310> burn

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
not a Minette shields or a ditch burn

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.620 
not a Minette shields or a ditch burn
but<00:02:22.519> and<00:02:23.519> you<00:02:23.640> probably<00:02:23.850> can't<00:02:24.209> see<00:02:24.420> too<00:02:24.600> well

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
but and you probably can't see too well

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.270 
but and you probably can't see too well
I'll<00:02:24.930> try<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.290> take<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.440> still<00:02:25.739> photo<00:02:25.980> for<00:02:26.220> the

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
I'll try and take a still photo for the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.400 
I'll try and take a still photo for the
website<00:02:26.459> as<00:02:26.819> well<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.239> think<00:02:27.720> it's<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.200> Duke

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
website as well I think it's a Duke

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.540 
website as well I think it's a Duke
probably<00:02:29.130> Duke<00:02:29.370> playmate<00:02:29.910> 18<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.989> 20<00:02:31.290> foot<00:02:31.680> my

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
probably Duke playmate 18 to 20 foot my

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.509 
probably Duke playmate 18 to 20 foot my
guess<00:02:32.819> is<00:02:32.850> late<00:02:33.569> 50s<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.440> mid<00:02:34.470> 60's<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:37.519> it

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
guess is late 50s to mid 60's and it

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.130 
guess is late 50s to mid 60's and it
seems<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.819> have<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.030> plastic<00:02:39.269> windshield<00:02:39.959> which

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
seems to have a plastic windshield which

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.190 
seems to have a plastic windshield which
kind<00:02:40.410> of<00:02:40.560> dates<00:02:40.769> it<00:02:40.980> at<00:02:41.100> an<00:02:41.280> earlier<00:02:41.610> age

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
kind of dates it at an earlier age

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.600 
kind of dates it at an earlier age
so<00:02:44.030> not<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.060> complete<00:02:45.510> disappointment

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
so not a complete disappointment

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.250 
so not a complete disappointment
apparently<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:48.480> boats<00:02:48.750> been<00:02:48.900> sitting<00:02:49.230> here

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
apparently this boats been sitting here

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.560 
apparently this boats been sitting here
for<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.560> number<00:02:49.799> of<00:02:49.829> years<00:02:50.130> unused<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.910> certainly

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
for a number of years unused I certainly

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.870 
for a number of years unused I certainly
don't<00:02:51.780> see<00:02:51.900> six<00:02:52.380> inches<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.829> bird<00:02:53.040> guano<00:02:53.430> on<00:02:53.730> it

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
don't see six inches of bird guano on it

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.030 
don't see six inches of bird guano on it
so<00:02:54.420> perhaps<00:02:54.660> it's<00:02:54.930> been<00:02:55.110> used<00:02:55.290> more<00:02:55.620> recently

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
so perhaps it's been used more recently

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.780 
so perhaps it's been used more recently
than<00:02:56.280> we<00:02:56.519> would<00:02:57.480> have<00:02:57.870> thought<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.640> tried<00:02:59.640> to

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
than we would have thought I tried to

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.400 
than we would have thought I tried to
get<00:02:59.970> in<00:03:00.090> communication<00:03:00.720> with<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.930> owner<00:03:01.110> of

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
get in communication with the owner of

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.229 
get in communication with the owner of
this<00:03:01.500> boat<00:03:01.769> and<00:03:01.829> haven't<00:03:02.340> had<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.549> response<00:03:02.760> so

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
this boat and haven't had a response so

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.360 
this boat and haven't had a response so
far<00:03:03.269> but<00:03:04.230> it's<00:03:04.350> a<00:03:04.410> shame<00:03:04.650> if<00:03:04.829> this<00:03:04.950> boat<00:03:05.160> has

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
far but it's a shame if this boat has

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.890 
far but it's a shame if this boat has
been<00:03:05.549> sitting<00:03:05.760> here<00:03:05.880> for<00:03:06.060> years<00:03:06.329> and<00:03:06.480> years

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
been sitting here for years and years

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.050 
been sitting here for years and years
it's<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.709> shame<00:03:07.980> before<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.489> not<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.790> go<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:08.970> a

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
it's a shame before it not to go to a

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.770 
it's a shame before it not to go to a
good<00:03:09.269> home<00:03:09.440> work<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.620> get<00:03:10.769> some<00:03:10.980> use<00:03:11.780> anyway

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
good home work to get some use anyway

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.160 
good home work to get some use anyway
