00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
to take into consideration the way

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.649 
to take into consideration the way
products<00:00:23.650> mixed<00:00:23.949> together<00:00:24.390> that's<00:00:25.390> why<00:00:25.539> a<00:00:25.570> lot

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:25.659 
products mixed together that's why a lot

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:27.450 
products mixed together that's why a lot
of<00:00:25.810> companies<00:00:26.289> for<00:00:26.470> example<00:00:26.499> say<00:00:27.009> make<00:00:27.279> sure

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
of companies for example say make sure

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.960 
of companies for example say make sure
you<00:00:27.699> use<00:00:27.730> our<00:00:28.890> shampoo<00:00:29.890> our<00:00:30.220> conditioner<00:00:30.789> hour

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
you use our shampoo our conditioner hour

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.270 
you use our shampoo our conditioner hour
this<00:00:31.239> hour<00:00:31.449> that<00:00:31.599> a<00:00:32.020> big<00:00:32.800> part<00:00:32.829> of<00:00:33.220> that

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
this hour that a big part of that

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.280 
this hour that a big part of that
actually<00:00:33.730> is<00:00:34.120> because<00:00:34.480> these<00:00:34.690> products<00:00:35.140> were

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
actually is because these products were

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.139 
actually is because these products were
designed<00:00:35.739> to<00:00:35.920> work<00:00:36.160> together<00:00:36.399> as<00:00:36.789> a<00:00:36.820> system

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
designed to work together as a system

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.750 
designed to work together as a system
and<00:00:37.660> so<00:00:38.170> if<00:00:38.379> you're<00:00:38.559> mixing<00:00:39.250> products

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
and so if you're mixing products

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.040 
and so if you're mixing products
sometimes<00:00:40.000> they<00:00:40.300> don't<00:00:40.390> work<00:00:40.629> well<00:00:40.809> together

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
sometimes they don't work well together

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.319 
sometimes they don't work well together
so<00:00:41.800> one<00:00:42.370> of<00:00:42.399> the<00:00:42.550> things<00:00:42.609> I<00:00:42.820> really<00:00:42.850> recommend

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
so one of the things I really recommend

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.180 
so one of the things I really recommend
it's<00:00:43.750> something<00:00:44.109> that<00:00:44.230> I've<00:00:44.350> done<00:00:44.590> is<00:00:44.920> to

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
it's something that I've done is to

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:50.679 
example if there's a product that works

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:52.020 
example if there's a product that works
well<00:00:50.949> for<00:00:51.219> you<00:00:51.309> will<00:00:51.489> find<00:00:51.699> out<00:00:51.820> what<00:00:51.940> those

well for you will find out what those
ingredients<00:00:52.420> are<00:00:52.929> and<00:00:53.289> see<00:00:53.559> if<00:00:53.679> you<00:00:53.800> can<00:00:54.070> that

there are certain ingredients that I
purposely<00:01:02.800> try<00:01:03.039> to<00:01:03.100> stay<00:01:03.309> away<00:01:03.489> from<00:01:03.519> for

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
purposely try to stay away from for

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.910 
purposely try to stay away from for
example<00:01:04.330> if<00:01:04.449> I<00:01:04.570> see<00:01:04.750> petroleum<00:01:05.379> in<00:01:05.470> a<00:01:05.530> product

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
example if I see petroleum in a product

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.430 
example if I see petroleum in a product
I<00:01:06.070> really<00:01:06.460> try<00:01:06.610> to<00:01:06.640> avoid<00:01:06.940> it<00:01:07.150> unless<00:01:07.440> overall

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
I really try to avoid it unless overall

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.020 
I really try to avoid it unless overall
I<00:01:08.470> know<00:01:08.680> their<00:01:08.980> products<00:01:09.370> really<00:01:09.640> going<00:01:09.910> to

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
I know their products really going to

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.280 
I know their products really going to
work<00:01:10.150> for<00:01:10.390> me<00:01:10.480> like<00:01:10.630> I've<00:01:10.750> used<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.140> in<00:01:11.200> the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
work for me like I've used it in the

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.840 
work for me like I've used it in the
past<00:01:11.320> or<00:01:11.800> something<00:01:12.190> but<00:01:12.370> for<00:01:12.520> the<00:01:12.580> most<00:01:12.730> part

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
past or something but for the most part

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.880 
past or something but for the most part
I'm<00:01:13.330> very<00:01:13.630> picky<00:01:13.870> with<00:01:14.110> what<00:01:14.350> ingredients<00:01:14.800> are

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
I'm very picky with what ingredients are

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.830 
I'm very picky with what ingredients are
in<00:01:15.010> products<00:01:15.400> but<00:01:15.670> overall<00:01:15.940> you<00:01:16.390> can<00:01:16.570> mix

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
in products but overall you can mix

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.990 
in products but overall you can mix
products<00:01:17.320> but<00:01:17.530> be<00:01:18.040> very<00:01:18.070> careful<00:01:18.550> with<00:01:18.820> how

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
products but be very careful with how

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.550 
products but be very careful with how
you're<00:01:19.180> mixing<00:01:19.540> them<00:01:19.690> also<00:01:20.050> take<00:01:20.440> into

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
you're mixing them also take into

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.350 
you're mixing them also take into
consideration<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.370> fact<00:01:21.490> that<00:01:21.820> if<00:01:22.150> you're

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
consideration the fact that if you're

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.420 
consideration the fact that if you're
taking<00:01:22.660> a<00:01:22.840> medication<00:01:23.050> or<00:01:23.470> something<00:01:23.650> that

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
taking a medication or something that

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.550 
taking a medication or something that
that<00:01:25.180> can<00:01:25.510> have<00:01:25.660> an<00:01:25.750> impact<00:01:25.900> on<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.320> chemistry

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
that can have an impact on the chemistry

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.040 
that can have an impact on the chemistry
of<00:01:26.740> your<00:01:26.980> hair<00:01:27.220> so<00:01:27.460> when<00:01:27.640> you<00:01:27.760> combine<00:01:28.180> let's

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
of your hair so when you combine let's

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.260 
of your hair so when you combine let's
say<00:01:29.230> the<00:01:29.440> medication<00:01:30.070> that<00:01:30.280> might<00:01:30.550> be<00:01:30.760> showing

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
say the medication that might be showing

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.240 
say the medication that might be showing
up<00:01:31.390> in<00:01:31.510> your<00:01:31.630> hair<00:01:31.810> somehow<00:01:32.290> on<00:01:32.620> top<00:01:33.040> of

shampoos and conditioners and creams and
stuff<00:01:35.260> like<00:01:35.470> that<00:01:35.530> you<00:01:36.280> may<00:01:36.460> be<00:01:36.520> dealing<00:01:36.820> with

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
stuff like that you may be dealing with
