00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.410 
narrow corridor it looks like sort of
innocuous<00:02:34.739> action<00:02:35.370> but<00:02:35.760> at<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.060> same<00:02:36.209> time

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
innocuous action but at the same time

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.510 
innocuous action but at the same time
you<00:02:36.810> know<00:02:36.930> he's<00:02:37.500> being<00:02:37.650> constricted<00:02:38.070> there's

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
you know he's being constricted there's

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.260 
you know he's being constricted there's
this<00:02:38.880> interesting<00:02:39.450> sort<00:02:39.989> of<00:02:40.940> strangeness<00:02:41.940> to

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
this interesting sort of strangeness to

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.130 
this interesting sort of strangeness to
the<00:02:42.390> work

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.990 

on<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.290> side<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.860> think<00:02:50.220> things<00:02:50.640> begin<00:02:50.970> to

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
on this side I think things begin to

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.540 
on this side I think things begin to
open<00:02:51.209> up<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.630> lot<00:02:51.810> more<00:02:52.080> in<00:02:52.470> terms<00:02:53.099> of<00:02:53.400> an

open up a lot more in terms of an

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.240 
open up a lot more in terms of an
international<00:02:54.090> or<00:02:54.569> global<00:02:54.709> commentary<00:02:55.709> this

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
middle of the floor by hey gu yang this

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.789 
middle of the floor by hey gu yang this
work<00:04:02.489> that<00:04:02.700> she<00:04:02.850> created<00:04:03.030> in<00:04:03.390> 2008<00:04:04.260> it's<00:04:04.739> a

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
work that she created in 2008 it's a

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.000 
work that she created in 2008 it's a
piece<00:04:05.010> called<00:04:05.370> doubles<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.209> couples<00:04:06.600> and<00:04:07.010> you

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
piece called doubles and couples and you

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.890 
piece called doubles and couples and you
know<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.370> involves<00:04:09.150> ideas<00:04:09.600> around

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
know it involves ideas around

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.440 
know it involves ideas around
domesticity<00:04:10.410> in<00:04:10.890> that<00:04:11.280> she<00:04:11.880> has<00:04:11.970> taken

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
domesticity in that she has taken

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.150 
domesticity in that she has taken
objects<00:04:13.459> from<00:04:14.459> her<00:04:15.420> hometown<00:04:15.930> in<00:04:16.440> Seoul<00:04:16.889> and

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
objects from her hometown in Seoul and

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.360 
objects from her hometown in Seoul and
also<00:04:17.940> from<00:04:18.329> her<00:04:18.660> adopted<00:04:19.380> hometown<00:04:19.709> which<00:04:20.220> is

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
also from her adopted hometown which is

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.659 
also from her adopted hometown which is
Berlin<00:04:20.820> and<00:04:21.380> she's<00:04:22.380> coupling<00:04:22.889> these<00:04:23.070> objects

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
Berlin and she's coupling these objects

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.330 
Berlin and she's coupling these objects
so<00:04:24.450> it's<00:04:24.870> kind<00:04:25.169> of<00:04:25.229> about<00:04:25.680> this<00:04:26.010> sort<00:04:26.190> of

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
so it's kind of about this sort of

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.430 
so it's kind of about this sort of
displacement<00:04:27.120> but<00:04:27.450> at<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.690> same<00:04:27.870> time<00:04:28.110> you

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
displacement but at the same time you

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.200 
displacement but at the same time you
know<00:04:28.560> it's<00:04:28.830> I<00:04:29.190> think<00:04:29.460> it's<00:04:29.700> also<00:04:29.910> a<00:04:30.060> very

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
know it's I think it's also a very

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.740 
know it's I think it's also a very
abstract<00:04:30.740> open<00:04:31.740> piece<00:04:32.100> that<00:04:33.030> clearly<00:04:33.419> plays

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
abstract open piece that clearly plays

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.340 
abstract open piece that clearly plays
with<00:04:34.050> with<00:04:34.620> you<00:04:34.950> know<00:04:35.039> lines<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:35.940> with<00:04:36.350> color

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
with with you know lines and with color

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.330 
with with you know lines and with color
and<00:04:37.770> light<00:04:38.070> very<00:04:38.820> specifically<00:04:39.950> what<00:04:40.950> you<00:04:41.070> see

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
and light very specifically what you see

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.850 
and light very specifically what you see
is<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.110> influence<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.289> importance<00:04:43.680> of

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
is the influence and importance of

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.340 
is the influence and importance of
conceptualism<00:04:44.580> as<00:04:44.940> a<00:04:45.360> strategy<00:04:45.990> for<00:04:46.020> making

conceptualism as a strategy for making

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.010 
conceptualism as a strategy for making
art<00:04:46.770> and<00:04:47.010> it<00:04:47.820> becomes<00:04:48.210> you<00:04:48.450> know<00:04:48.570> sort<00:04:48.810> of<00:04:48.900> an

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
art and it becomes you know sort of an

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.980 
art and it becomes you know sort of an
overarching<00:04:49.760> facet<00:04:50.760> of<00:04:50.880> contemporary<00:04:51.810> art

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
present which is one of the things that

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.260 
present which is one of the things that
we<00:04:58.200> really<00:04:58.620> wanted<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:58.890> stress

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
we really wanted to stress

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.900 
we really wanted to stress
that<00:04:59.480> it<00:04:59.990> wasn't<00:05:00.470> just<00:05:00.710> about<00:05:00.950> trying<00:05:01.370> to<00:05:01.610> come

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
that it wasn't just about trying to come

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.180 
that it wasn't just about trying to come
up<00:05:01.940> with<00:05:02.090> markers<00:05:02.810> that<00:05:03.050> at<00:05:03.680> work<00:05:03.860> in<00:05:04.100> a

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
up with markers that at work in a

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.550 
up with markers that at work in a
chronology<00:05:04.640> or<00:05:05.090> some<00:05:05.360> sort<00:05:05.570> of<00:05:05.690> survey<00:05:06.320> like

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
chronology or some sort of survey like

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.950 
chronology or some sort of survey like
history<00:05:07.100> of<00:05:07.220> contemporary<00:05:07.820> art<00:05:07.940> from<00:05:08.120> 1968

history of contemporary art from 1968

history of contemporary art from 1968
but<00:05:09.590> to<00:05:09.710> see<00:05:09.920> how<00:05:10.160> these<00:05:10.340> things<00:05:10.690> reverberate

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
but to see how these things reverberate
