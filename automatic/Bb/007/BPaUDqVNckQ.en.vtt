00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.089 
happened i guess like it it wasn't a
host<00:00:27.990> migration<00:00:28.199> because<00:00:28.650> i<00:00:28.740> was<00:00:28.920> playing

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
host migration because i was playing

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
only one who got booted of the game for

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000 
only one who got booted of the game for
some<00:00:33.120> reason<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.960> know<00:00:34.050> very<00:00:34.410> disappointing

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
some reason you know very disappointing

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.350 
some reason you know very disappointing
when<00:00:35.280> especially<00:00:35.430> when<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.760> have<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> really

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
when especially when you have a really

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.290 
when especially when you have a really
good<00:00:36.480> start<00:00:36.770> but<00:00:37.770> here<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:39.030> ok

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
good start but here it is and it's ok

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.270 
good start but here it is and it's ok
because<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:40.050> know<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.320> topic<00:00:40.530> i<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:40.890> won't

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
because you know the topic i have won't

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.430 
because you know the topic i have won't
take<00:00:41.520> too<00:00:41.550> long<00:00:41.940> but<00:00:42.540> it's<00:00:42.989> something<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.410> i

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
take too long but it's something that i

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.139 
take too long but it's something that i
think<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:44.809> relevant<00:00:45.809> um<00:00:46.320> across<00:00:47.149> every

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
think is relevant um across every

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
I think we need to establish more of an

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.660 
I think we need to establish more of an
identity<00:01:01.070> you<00:01:02.070> know<00:01:02.100> we<00:01:02.250> are<00:01:02.340> one<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.579> the
