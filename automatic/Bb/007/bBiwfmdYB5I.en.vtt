00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
 hello girls I really hope that 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.380
 you're fine last weekend 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.390
 I had a wedding in the family 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.760
 I took the opportunity to film you the outfit that 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.269
 I wore during the town hall and during 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.280
 the evening 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.769
 so that's the outfit I wore 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.299
 during the town hall and it's an outfit that 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.520
 I find it quite simple going everywhere 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.529
 it is true that it was fast enough 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.289
 it's all to break it was a small 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.939
 half hour I'm wearing pants here 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.019
 palazzo who comes who race finance 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.869
 a collection that I really find 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.279
 very beautiful I think he would celebrate ice cream 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.890
 so he's black with little dots 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.680
 white peas I have a small 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.620
 bag here that comes from home I 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.149
 wear with this outfit a necklace 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.550
 who also comes from home if it's 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.140
 a big pearl necklace and this shirt 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.250
 white this white shirt that comes 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.629
 from insight that I like a lot 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.940
 because it is long enough to 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.500
 the back is rather short selling my 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.190
 sail comes from a small bookstore 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.350
 Islamic and my shoes from zara 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.809
 we move to the second holding so the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.090
 outfit that I wore during the evening 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.120
 it's true it was a small wedding 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.089
 really in a small committee a 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.260
 the family I bring here a necklace 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.720
 that you may have seen at 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.190
 forever21 that I really find very 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.900
 beautiful it's true that the outfit is pretty 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.000
 simple is borredon of the blow with the 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.479
 necklace it still gives an appearance 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.049
 festive 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.930
 my little bag from marc jacobs and 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.840
 I'm wearing a long cardigan made this is the 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.540
 exact name it's a dubai car so has a 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.820
 mix between a cardigan and a raid that 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.080
 comes from madina shop so this 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.470
 cardigan there are different 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.390
 colors 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.590
 I took the color beige and 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.119
 I was so happy because he is 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.950
 arrived the day I went to the countries 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.110
 down and I needed it absolutely 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.820
 since this magnificent magnificent game 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.640
 dress that I wear here that comes from 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.170
 mango and and frankly she's great 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.399
 pretty i did not take off the cardigan 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.110
 to show you the details not at 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.490
 arm level there is lace 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.880
 transparent and especially at the level of 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.100
 the rear 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.440
 she is very low-cut so suddenly 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.899
 I absolutely needed his cardigans for 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.100
 to be able to wear to be able to put this 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.899
 dress anyway outside 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.789
 the quarter of baiia exists in different 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.710
 colors but I find that with black 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.690
 the Belgian was really the color that 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.580
 pass and do my best 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.110
 comes from an Islamic bookstore see 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.880
 it's the square scarves but that I 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.860
 I'm wearing opposite challes 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.599
 here for this outfit frankly I 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.180
 finds that it is rather simple but in 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.069
 same time enough class not too much no 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.959
 more festive since here it was really 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.020
 a small wedding at a wedding 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.460
 family 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.290
 I find that the outfit was just 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.610
 perfect for the occasion here I hope 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.840
