now<00:00:11.880> it's<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.150> PDP<00:00:12.950> map<00:00:13.969> chakras<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.960> let's

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
now it's a PDP map chakras and let's

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.849 
now it's a PDP map chakras and let's
continue<00:00:17.010> learning<00:00:17.660> for<00:00:18.660> gateways<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.590> course

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
continue learning for gateways of course

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.070 
continue learning for gateways of course
it's<00:00:20.039> very<00:00:20.250> strong<00:00:20.789> core<00:00:21.090> strategy<00:00:21.689> but<00:00:21.869> if

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
it's very strong core strategy but if

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.900 
it's very strong core strategy but if
you<00:00:22.230> open<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.710> ready<00:00:22.920> for<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.460> know<00:00:23.640> how

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
you open and ready for it and know how

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.620 
you open and ready for it and know how
you<00:00:23.970> play<00:00:24.300> it's<00:00:25.170> been<00:00:25.410> not<00:00:25.590> easy<00:00:26.449> run<00:00:27.449> this

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
you play it's been not easy run this

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.240 
you play it's been not easy run this
game<00:00:28.519> because<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.760> spent<00:00:31.279> a<00:00:32.279> lot<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:32.850> time<00:00:33.000> and

chrono boost for getting professor or

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.400 
chrono boost for getting professor or
four<00:00:38.640> gateways<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:40.110> only<00:00:40.410> one<00:00:40.590> gas

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
four gateways and you have only one gas

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.060 
four gateways and you have only one gas
Illustrated<00:00:44.149> of<00:00:45.149> course<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:46.039> open<00:00:47.039> your

play<00:00:47.510> very<00:00:48.510> careful<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:51.350> go<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:53.270> attack

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
play very careful you can go to attack

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:04.429 
play very careful you can go to attack
and<00:00:54.800> get<00:00:55.850> advantage<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.870> spent<00:01:03.870> one<00:01:04.199> more

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439

to keep energy for spending on our
gateways<00:01:14.850> upgrade<00:01:23.960> by<00:01:24.960> check<00:01:25.200> out<00:01:25.380> there<00:01:25.590> is

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
gateways upgrade by check out there is

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.410 
gateways upgrade by check out there is
certainly<00:01:26.159> my<00:01:27.080> opinion

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.570 

and<00:01:34.420> it's<00:01:34.660> closed<00:01:34.900> their<00:01:35.230> position<00:01:35.830> he<00:01:36.040> make<00:01:36.250> a

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
and it's closed their position he make a

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.110 
and it's closed their position he make a
little<00:01:36.940> bit<00:01:37.090> later<00:01:38.010> Scout<00:01:39.010> star<00:01:39.760> jump<00:01:40.950> try

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
little bit later Scout star jump try

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.080 
little bit later Scout star jump try
make<00:01:43.120> sure<00:01:43.360> for<00:01:43.630> my<00:01:43.810> workers<00:01:44.290> but<00:01:44.620> I<00:01:44.980> ready<00:01:45.970> for

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
make sure for my workers but I ready for

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:54.450 
make sure for my workers but I ready for
this<00:01:48.000> let<00:01:49.000> me<00:01:49.270> have<00:01:49.540> same<00:01:49.990> start<00:01:50.410> so<00:01:51.340> if<00:01:53.460> you

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
this let me have same start so if you

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.290 
this let me have same start so if you
see<00:01:54.700> same<00:01:55.030> start<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:55.570> need<00:01:55.720> thinking<00:01:57.030> if<00:01:58.030> you

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
see same start you need thinking if you

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.510 
see same start you need thinking if you
need<00:01:58.510> to<00:01:58.690> making<00:01:59.230> four<00:01:59.530> gateways<00:01:59.830> or<00:02:00.160> you

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
need to making four gateways or you

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.900 
need to making four gateways or you
change<00:02:01.180> your<00:02:01.450> strategy<00:02:01.710> because<00:02:02.710> now<00:02:03.490> if<00:02:03.760> you

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
change your strategy because now if you

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.510 
change your strategy because now if you
make<00:02:04.120> forget<00:02:04.600> way<00:02:04.750> and<00:02:04.960> same<00:02:05.500> making<00:02:06.310> few

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
make forget way and same making few

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.660 
make forget way and same making few
opening<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.960> have<00:02:08.170> very<00:02:08.440> great<00:02:08.710> chance<00:02:09.040> how

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
opening you have very great chance how

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.930 
opening you have very great chance how
do<00:02:09.729> you<00:02:10.030> forget<00:02:10.750> if<00:02:11.200> you<00:02:12.040> cannot<00:02:12.520> play<00:02:12.790> too

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
do you forget if you cannot play too

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:21.270 
do you forget if you cannot play too
aggressive<00:02:13.709> just<00:02:14.709> try<00:02:15.340> hold<00:02:15.640> position<00:02:19.950> in<00:02:20.950> the

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
aggressive just try hold position in the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
and make into more gateways be more safe
