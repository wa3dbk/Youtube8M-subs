weak foot and four-star skill moves but
just<00:05:09.350> have<00:05:09.500> a<00:05:09.530> look<00:05:09.680> at<00:05:09.800> the<00:05:09.890> stats<00:05:10.130> guys<00:05:10.370> drink

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
just have a look at the stats guys drink

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.520 
just have a look at the stats guys drink
it<00:05:11.510> in<00:05:11.830> you<00:05:12.830> know<00:05:13.660> look<00:05:14.660> at<00:05:14.810> that<00:05:14.930> acceleration

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
it in you know look at that acceleration

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.750 
it in you know look at that acceleration
agility<00:05:16.720> reactions<00:05:17.720> sprint<00:05:18.380> speed<00:05:18.760> the

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
agility reactions sprint speed the

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.460 
agility reactions sprint speed the
acceleration<00:05:20.330> in<00:05:20.419> the<00:05:20.510> sprint<00:05:20.840> speed<00:05:21.050> I<00:05:21.110> think

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
acceleration in the sprint speed I think

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.590 
acceleration in the sprint speed I think
matter<00:05:21.919> probably<00:05:22.370> a<00:05:22.610> lot<00:05:22.850> more<00:05:22.880> than<00:05:23.120> the

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
matter probably a lot more than the

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.930 
matter probably a lot more than the
overall<00:05:23.720> top<00:05:24.410> speed<00:05:24.830> he<00:05:25.460> doesn't<00:05:25.760> seem<00:05:25.880> to

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
overall top speed he doesn't seem to

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.760 
overall top speed he doesn't seem to
have<00:05:26.030> a<00:05:26.120> top<00:05:26.360> speed<00:05:26.660> but<00:05:26.990> Christ<00:05:27.289> he<00:05:27.470> can<00:05:27.650> move

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
have a top speed but Christ he can move

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.590 
have a top speed but Christ he can move
over<00:05:28.100> the<00:05:28.190> ground<00:05:28.430> very<00:05:28.820> very<00:05:29.120> quickly<00:05:29.389> when

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
over the ground very very quickly when

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.440 
over the ground very very quickly when
he<00:05:29.720> needs<00:05:29.900> to<00:05:30.020> so<00:05:30.919> I<00:05:30.950> think<00:05:31.280> maybe<00:05:31.520> it's<00:05:32.270> not

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
he needs to so I think maybe it's not

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.170 
he needs to so I think maybe it's not
necessarily<00:05:33.110> that<00:05:33.229> 99<00:05:33.830> pace<00:05:34.190> being<00:05:34.580> to<00:05:35.060> do

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
necessarily that 99 pace being to do

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.120 
necessarily that 99 pace being to do
with<00:05:35.330> top<00:05:35.600> speed<00:05:35.930> what<00:05:36.200> more<00:05:36.440> do<00:05:36.590> we<00:05:36.650> do<00:05:36.830> to<00:05:37.039> do

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
with top speed what more do we do to do

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.820 
with top speed what more do we do to do
with<00:05:37.310> sprint<00:05:37.729> speed<00:05:38.060> etc<00:05:38.380> so<00:05:39.380> let's<00:05:39.560> give<00:05:39.680> this
