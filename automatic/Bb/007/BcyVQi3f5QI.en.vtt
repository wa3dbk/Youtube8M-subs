00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:22.730 
as rarely as possible we don't want to

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.770 
as rarely as possible we don't want to
touch<00:06:22.850> the<00:06:23.060> bootloader<00:06:23.330> we<00:06:23.480> don't<00:06:23.600> want<00:06:23.720> to

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
touch the bootloader we don't want to

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.150 
touch the bootloader we don't want to
keep<00:06:23.930> messing<00:06:24.080> with<00:06:24.290> somewhere<00:06:24.710> we're

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 
keep messing with somewhere we're

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.050 
keep messing with somewhere we're
flashing<00:06:25.340> the<00:06:25.490> boot<00:06:25.610> loaders<00:06:25.790> because<00:06:25.940> it

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
flashing the boot loaders because it

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.810 
flashing the boot loaders because it
good<00:06:26.240> could<00:06:27.050> cause<00:06:27.260> some<00:06:27.500> issues<00:06:27.620> so<00:06:28.310> once<00:06:28.670> you

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
good could cause some issues so once you

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.390 
good could cause some issues so once you
flash<00:06:29.090> this<00:06:29.360> once<00:06:29.660> don't<00:06:30.500> flash<00:06:30.920> this<00:06:31.220> thing

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
flash this once don't flash this thing

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.560 
flash this once don't flash this thing
again<00:06:31.610> it's<00:06:31.730> not<00:06:31.820> going<00:06:32.030> to<00:06:32.090> hurt<00:06:32.180> but<00:06:32.420> you

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
again it's not going to hurt but you

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.150 
again it's not going to hurt but you
don't<00:06:32.780> want<00:06:33.020> to<00:06:33.170> be<00:06:33.290> messing<00:06:33.770> around<00:06:33.920> with

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
don't want to be messing around with

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.740 
don't want to be messing around with
flashing<00:06:34.610> this<00:06:34.700> over<00:06:35.030> and<00:06:35.150> over<00:06:35.360> again<00:06:35.450> so

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:35.750 
flashing this over and over again so

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.260 
flashing this over and over again so
once<00:06:36.350> you<00:06:36.440> flash<00:06:36.650> it<00:06:36.860> once<00:06:37.100> that's<00:06:37.730> what<00:06:37.970> we

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
once you flash it once that's what we

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.450 
once you flash it once that's what we
want<00:06:38.540> okay<00:06:38.810> and<00:06:39.620> really<00:06:40.040> the<00:06:40.250> whole<00:06:40.280> reason

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
want okay and really the whole reason

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.880 
want okay and really the whole reason
that<00:06:41.090> we<00:06:41.360> flash<00:06:41.690> this<00:06:42.110> is<00:06:42.290> so<00:06:42.470> that<00:06:42.620> we<00:06:42.740> could

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:42.890 
that we flash this is so that we could

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.840 
that we flash this is so that we could
update<00:06:43.310> our<00:06:43.550> boot<00:06:43.820> loaders<00:06:44.240> and<00:06:45.100> again<00:06:46.100> the

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:46.850 
update our boot loaders and again the

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:50.470 
update our boot loaders and again the
only<00:06:48.280> the<00:06:49.280> only<00:06:49.310> reason<00:06:49.940> you<00:06:50.120> would<00:06:50.270> go

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:50.480 
only the only reason you would go

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.760 
only the only reason you would go
through<00:06:50.720> the<00:06:50.900> steps<00:06:51.200> that<00:06:51.380> I've<00:06:51.500> gone<00:06:51.710> through

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:51.770 
through the steps that I've gone through

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.460

that this helps I think it's pretty cool
that<00:07:11.390> we<00:07:11.600> can<00:07:11.630> still<00:07:11.990> update<00:07:12.770> our<00:07:12.920> captivates

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 
that we can still update our captivates

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.460 
that we can still update our captivates
even<00:07:14.150> to<00:07:14.270> the<00:07:14.390> latest<00:07:14.840> Android<00:07:15.500> version<00:07:15.530> and

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470 
even to the latest Android version and

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.530
