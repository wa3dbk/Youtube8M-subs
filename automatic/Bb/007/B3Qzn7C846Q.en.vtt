00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.309
 everyone then today we get 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.660
 found a small video of 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.030
 presentation of all colonies 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.410
 after their diapause or monsters exit 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.430
 long be it exotic species 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.650
 or endemic 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.460
 so we start right away with my 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.109
 campus ssp macula tus these are 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.720
 Malagasy ants so they come from 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.539
 madagascar so we can see the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.710
 workers walking around the adc so the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.520
 colony is heated by a lamp 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.469
 heating 100 watts the oni of the colony 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.840
 is covered by a black cloth a year for 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.120
 avoid that the light is directly 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.879
 on the convent so we will watch the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:51.180
 colony so you see that I have not hurt 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:52.890
 of convent so here is the queen with her 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.050
 open so we can workers we can 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.469
 observe workers of different 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.690
 sizes of minors and media 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.829
 so maybe some small major 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.280
 but I still do not do too much 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.320
 difference 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.020
 so here is a good part of the current 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.920
 so we can observe low larvae at 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.220
 the lower part of the image and 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.750
 cocoons above still other rooster is 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.920
 sees that dry colony very disturbed 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.750
 by the light so that's why I 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.119
 put a black cloth 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.130
 so here you see different 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.200
 trip sizes you see that the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:31.560
 media are darker at the level of 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:34.290
 thorax that the workers I 'm from 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.630
 to film a small life together 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:42.000
 this is eh bah I do not know if you 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.799
 you remember it from the beginning but she 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.930
 was much less at the start so 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.210
 are well developed they have with all 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.950
 the erp down to resist the little heat 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.000
 all winter and its balloon balloon everything 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.530
 winter so have grown well 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.030
 this is my punic formica 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.040
 and the aria so the queen is 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.540
 unfortunately died so mowing the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.869
 looking for a queen grand-place is waiting 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.850
 this moment 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.710
 so if you have a blood queen 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.600
 house under stricto you can 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.209
 send me a message and I will 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.569
 will respond in prices more solder so 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.569
 here
