to<00:02:43.150> an<00:02:43.270> a<00:02:43.420> chord

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.950 

and<00:02:46.130> we're<00:02:47.090> doing<00:02:47.240> this<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.600> great<00:02:47.930> little

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
and we're doing this a great little

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.750 
and we're doing this a great little
practice<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:48.710> going<00:02:49.280> from<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.550> reverse<00:02:49.880> land

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
practice to going from a reverse land

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:02.720 
practice to going from a reverse land
all<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:53.180> way<00:02:53.390> to<00:02:53.510> a<00:02:53.600> forward<00:02:54.110> slant<00:02:54.350> there

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.430 

so<00:03:03.730> slants<00:03:04.150> are<00:03:04.239> tough<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.569> get<00:03:04.690> into<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.260> just

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
so slants are tough to get into and just

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.000 
so slants are tough to get into and just
play<00:03:05.709> them<00:03:05.830> slow

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
play them slow

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.699 
play them slow
and<00:03:09.010> try<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.060> hear<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.840> know<00:03:11.019> where<00:03:11.409> you're<00:03:11.590> in

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
and try to hear you know where you're in

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.199 
and try to hear you know where you're in
tune<00:03:11.920> where<00:03:12.219> you're<00:03:12.370> not<00:03:12.489> in<00:03:12.549> tune<00:03:15.150> okay<00:03:16.150> so

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
tune where you're not in tune okay so

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.330 
tune where you're not in tune okay so

don't have it written in the tab here

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.290 
don't have it written in the tab here
but<00:04:41.820> if<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.030> take<00:04:42.240> that<00:04:43.850> you're<00:04:44.850> gonna<00:04:44.940> slide

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
but if you take that you're gonna slide

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.450 
but if you take that you're gonna slide
that<00:04:45.540> down<00:04:45.690> to<00:04:45.900> you<00:04:45.990> an<00:04:46.050> e7<00:04:46.680> chord<00:04:46.710> which<00:04:47.160> is<00:04:47.190> on

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
that down to you an e7 chord which is on

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.370 
that down to you an e7 chord which is on
your<00:04:47.580> seventh<00:04:47.910> fret<00:04:48.120> sixth<00:04:48.900> fret<00:04:48.930> 3rd<00:04:49.350> string

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
your seventh fret sixth fret 3rd string

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.640 
your seventh fret sixth fret 3rd string
and<00:04:49.710> 1st<00:04:50.040> string

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.730 

and<00:04:52.770> then<00:04:53.700> do<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.030> forward<00:04:54.360> slant<00:04:54.600> to<00:04:55.380> resolve

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
and then do the forward slant to resolve

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:04.679 
and then do the forward slant to resolve
that<00:04:58.550> that's<00:04:59.550> a<00:04:59.760> nice<00:04:59.970> little<00:05:00.210> lick<00:05:00.480> there

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:04.689 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:07.329 

and<00:05:05.689> it's<00:05:06.080> good<00:05:06.289> practice<00:05:06.499> with<00:05:06.979> reverse

00:05:07.329 --> 00:05:07.339 
and it's good practice with reverse

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:12.449 
and it's good practice with reverse
slants<00:05:07.789> and<00:05:07.909> forward<00:05:08.330> slants

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:12.459 

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:23.150 

okay<00:05:13.459> let's<00:05:14.119> go<00:05:14.209> ahead<00:05:14.269> and<00:05:14.419> move<00:05:14.479> on

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.220
