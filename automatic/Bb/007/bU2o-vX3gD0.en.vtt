00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:08.080
 the combination of citrus and pears for 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:11.190
 this evening in advance 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.190
 I wanted your favorite fruit 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.260
 looking at it 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.440
 I do not miss anything 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.600
 neighbors saw wine to accompany 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.300
 but today it is not wanted because it is 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.300
 diego arias 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.760
 do not 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.660
 the skill cavern swims and she tells me 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.660
 daddy habit 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.680
 the jam can not talk 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.290
 so much that diego has been cleansed not 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.809
 is going to like this jam because vÃ­ctor 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.809
 that always look for something more light good 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.040
 half the sugar of sexually 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.140
 for a jam that is good 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.930
 although I have here was simply 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.000
 channel we appeal and we bring in cubes 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.920
 decoration masters and we appeal in the 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.250
 we cut the audio in cubes very soon 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.310
 sugar for a kilo of penalty instead of 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.710
 use 700 sugar 250 which is what 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.960
 usually like to know 3 100 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.140
 of sugar from the bottom on the other hand 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.800
 let's use the juice of tangerines 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.900
 of the daisies 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.610
 of the river to show the texture how 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.409
 but you will love it we come for 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.159
 here a leaf and let's put the pine 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.369
 remember that it is a kilo already peeled 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:57.179
 disheartened a net kilo that will be 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:00.170
 the 150 and the 200 of total pears that 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.579
 and also show that mandarin juice 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.530
 we tried it with a liter but 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.659
 I would tell you that the boot is with half 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.129
 liter so that all have not moved more 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.599
 fast if it's not going to take you a little bit 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:14.310
 more than a liter of tangerines and 350 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.260
 grams of sugar 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.420
 what else are we going to add to this the 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.069
 tangerine cascaritas remembered from 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.300
 all the tangerines he barely expected 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.190
 came from a 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.450
 so that it fits texture 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.150
 juliana in the cascarita and that also 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.250
 Take a lot of flavor because on the skin 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.640
 is the essential oil of tangerine 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.210
 and it's great then the thrust and 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.580
 I'm going to bring it to the fire 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.970
 when you are going to undo a bit the 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.590
 pear texture goes away 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.550
 suffering with sugar and leaves 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.550
 reporting slow 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.599
 to me I realized when it came we are at 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.599
 two days and it changed my life 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.500
 I still have to keep the rock 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.519
 thank good that I have here then 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:14.400
 half a liter of mandarin juice one kilo 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.010
 of peeled and discouraged pears sounds 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.700
 strong that the cascaritas of the 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.500
 tangerine and 350 grams of sugar 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.819
 this accord of the other time that 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.260
 we had made an orange marmalade 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.739
 up to the idea 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.510
 on tangerine visits in 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.909
 one spends well 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.379
 inside a gauze to help us 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.379
 to modify a little more 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.900
 use the jam a little if you have 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.580
 huggel and you are not going to also put a 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.250
 half a lemon in the jam and it's going to 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.490
 to be superior here what I do is a 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.490
 knot 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.439
 when they exist played until here are the 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.420
 We will put seeds here 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:09.900
 I left it tied to an edge of the pot 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.900
 so as not to lose this pretty 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.890
 so that you do not miss exactly if you 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.720
 we leave here cooking slowly 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.580
 approximately 2 hours of cooking 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.190
 must reduce our greens by making a 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.190
 Little Pear game 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:33.450
 good 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:35.340
 a small changed the schedule today 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.290
 we started earlier, you go to 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.220
 follow in a little while with the completion 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:43.480
 of this spectacular jam that 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:47.560
 after one buys 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.450
 a new degrees 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.970
 very well and the dear I say if bolt and 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.560
 then he will teach us we have to eat and 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:58.650
 that you do not have to eat if you want 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.650
 we need to practice
