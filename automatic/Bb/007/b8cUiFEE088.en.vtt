factor after i purchased it on was that

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.860 
factor after i purchased it on was that
first<00:01:21.460> of<00:01:21.550> all<00:01:21.670> it's<00:01:21.820> half<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.060> cost<00:01:22.390> of<00:01:22.780> the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
first of all it's half the cost of the

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.630 
first of all it's half the cost of the
average<00:01:23.140> you<00:01:23.470> know<00:01:23.590> product<00:01:23.950> out<00:01:24.250> there<00:01:24.430> the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
average you know product out there the

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.240 
average you know product out there the
program<00:01:25.000> out<00:01:25.150> there<00:01:25.180> and<00:01:25.620> it<00:01:26.620> really<00:01:27.070> really

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
program out there and it really really

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.190 
program out there and it really really
over<00:01:27.760> delivers<00:01:28.210> you<00:01:28.390> know<00:01:28.480> it's<00:01:28.630> a<00:01:28.690> 12-week

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
over delivers you know it's a 12-week

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.310 
over delivers you know it's a 12-week
program<00:01:29.410> and<00:01:29.980> it's<00:01:30.760> broken<00:01:31.060> down<00:01:31.240> so<00:01:31.450> simply

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
program and it's broken down so simply

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.440 
program and it's broken down so simply
that<00:01:32.860> in<00:01:33.190> my<00:01:33.340> opinion<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:33.850> beats<00:01:34.120> all<00:01:34.300> the

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
that in my opinion it beats all the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.900 
that in my opinion it beats all the
other<00:01:34.570> programs<00:01:34.780> out<00:01:35.170> there<00:01:35.380> because<00:01:35.910> it's

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
other programs out there because it's

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:38.490 
other programs out there because it's
written<00:01:37.240> in<00:01:37.510> such<00:01:37.780> a<00:01:37.810> way<00:01:37.930> that<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.320> average

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
written in such a way that the average

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.440 
written in such a way that the average
person<00:01:39.100> can<00:01:39.280> do<00:01:39.490> it<00:01:39.640> you<00:01:39.730> can<00:01:39.760> stick<00:01:40.120> to<00:01:40.300> it

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
person can do it you can stick to it

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.050 
person can do it you can stick to it
every<00:01:40.810> single<00:01:40.990> day<00:01:41.580> there's<00:01:42.580> no<00:01:42.730> guesswork
