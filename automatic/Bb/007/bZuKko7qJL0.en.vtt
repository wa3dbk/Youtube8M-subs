for the 2014 Toyota Corolla is it's

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.530 
for the 2014 Toyota Corolla is it's
longer<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:17.130> means<00:02:17.370> more<00:02:17.700> rear<00:02:18.180> seat

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
longer and that means more rear seat

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.590 
longer and that means more rear seat
legroom<00:02:18.900> how<00:02:19.650> about<00:02:19.950> five<00:02:20.250> inches<00:02:20.700> more<00:02:20.970> that

makes it much easier to get a

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.880 
makes it much easier to get a
rear-facing<00:02:23.730> car<00:02:24.300> seat<00:02:24.600> in<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:24.990> out<00:02:27.890> we

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
rear-facing car seat in and out we

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.370 
rear-facing car seat in and out we
mentioned<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.400> for<00:02:29.640> 2014<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.780> Toyota

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
mentioned that for 2014 the Toyota

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.180 
mentioned that for 2014 the Toyota
Corolla<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.950> longer<00:02:32.430> well<00:02:33.150> it's<00:02:33.300> also<00:02:33.630> wider

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
Corolla is longer well it's also wider

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.890 
Corolla is longer well it's also wider
we<00:02:35.190> think<00:02:35.459> that<00:02:35.640> additional<00:02:36.150> width<00:02:36.360> means<00:02:36.750> you

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
we think that additional width means you

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.080 
we think that additional width means you
just<00:02:37.260> might<00:02:37.560> actually<00:02:37.830> be<00:02:38.310> able<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.580> fit<00:02:38.790> three
