00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Good night guys, I'm doing my homework here. 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.299
 It's my first video but had your try. 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.170
 do 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.679
 who does not like the tips video does not 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.340
 but do not belittle nobody is good to receive 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:22.230
 a client called today was to meet and 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.180
 I noticed that he complained, right? 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.560
 previously that the computer does not 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.140
 started 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.820
 when I got there the windows enter the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.989
 login screen passed lobo and was left with 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.489
 the whole black screen only with popping mouse 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:42.899
 appearing in the middle of good work 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:48.989
 find the hotel with agents know 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:50.430
 between jesse task I installed the washing 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.690
 as we have a procedure does 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.620
 You know that I like but do not conflict 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.649
 resolved 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.239
 I was in messe config I disabled the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.670
 but I still have the same problem. 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.680
 so I started looking for control of the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.510
 pests you have installed 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.439
 I joined the one who commands another 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.560
 panel 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.960
 We know about control. 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.710
 I looked for what was there and I found it 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:24.479
 ps by the party 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.549
 several sharks but what I found 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.439
 never because I had never seen anything 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.049
 more I saw infrequently was 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.549
 show installing a baidu browser 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.770
 which is what a plague that is coming 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.650
 here are you going to install some months 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.500
 there it is much less well known than 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:44.040
 the baidu and I noticed when I entered the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.960
 management of the task that was 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:52.290
 such a certain process that had 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.680
 exactly from here 11 and in the description that 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.799
 full name one off the map right nodes 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.049
 I'm not mistaken in packers 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.630
 I think it's a packet charger on 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.520
 What do you think, this is not messi? 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.350
 confirm it can enable or 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.610
 I searched the system for service and did not 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.310
 I found it right and then I started to 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.890
 to look for is to wear 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.950
 will be in the system after all had to the 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.560
 that I did of dedetização I did until the 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.340
 User also did not work 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.190
 but then I looked, I started looking 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.400
 about this key, right? 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.090
 know when to start the system yes another 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.550
 thing 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.880
 When this novel was finished, it goes well. 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.099
 was here the owner of the image was mossi 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.190
 when the initial system ended 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:47.069
 normal, so do you think he plans on 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.500
 this is a prerogative of the 32 that 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:56.100
 comes from the right system that loads some 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:03:06.390
 programs and I joined the new 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:10.230
 windows task and started searching 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.819
 there was not a above was was not in 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.970
 I looked up as I think a lot of people 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:19.079
 what do you do in the click here in control efec 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.850
 I put a so right but I have objections 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.109
 I did not remember the house but in time I 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.750
 I have been stirring 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:30.590
 so I came here with the boss he thought 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:37.430
 from here I marked current uses software 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:37.430
 microsoft sure had 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:48.410
 Microsoft does not microsoft windows 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:51.080
 currentversion with 11 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.180
 certain is that had two keys that key 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.730
 default value is not set and has a 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:00.580
 key here under registration and enrolled 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:04.340
 11 vap I thought and found the problem right? 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:06.799
 erase that certain key that was 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.959
 seeing this problem in loading 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:16.040
 I was the key author on that local machine 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:20.840
 software microsoft windows is now 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:28.460
 open the team has already looked at windows 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:30.470
 currentversion right and I came here right 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.450
 and had the other plate that another value 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.030
 that I did I deleted 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:39.290
 remembering that this 11 if you prove only 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:41.720
 11 found the nero key and such but not 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.669
 I can not believe I do not believe the nero. 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.919
 do it because it hurts you have 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.020
 usability to boot the system 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:52.729
 unlike these programs it is 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:54.620
 expressed in the keys closed and resolved 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.690
 The problem is if the machine system 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.979
 client started normally I am 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.690
 sharing because it was one thing 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:04.400
 boring that I caught solve in a little bit 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:06.110
 Gods time, but many times he 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.520
 can be beaten completely and people 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.830
 You know that we have to leave the 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.570
 format in the last case the issue does not 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.120
 is to format the question is to know which 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.160
 problem and resolve the next time on 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.530
 the shortest possible time because it 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.710
 The life of the technician we charge the same 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.669
 clear value but it 's just one more way 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.060
 easy 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:28.520
 so thank you all better tutu 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.940

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.349
 It has many, many colleagues there does not help 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.229

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:38.210
 group show I do not remember the name 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:41.810
