00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 but how are you carrying the new video 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.740
 before they ask you if 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.600
 I actually went to cut the hair and 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.490
 as I see I do a normal cut to 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.710
 see the most handsome sexiest most sensual 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.799
 but apparently what the girl of the 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.049
 hairdressing and aesthetics understood is 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.910
 let me hair like to point to 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.760
 an important one here is that the hair 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.560
 it grows and well I hope so because I do not 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.269
 I want to be bald now yes to what 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.119
 let's go today we go for a game 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.800
 which is maybe a bit choted for 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.960
 that does not know joke or means very 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.090
 common that is called trump face costs 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.190
 ensures to be the trolliest game that 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.890
 exists and be fire and come for that reason 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.350
 screen on ironing and says you like them 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.960
 the games because I want to play a new 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.210
 You told me that my uncle turned off the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.149
 television by going to the next level that 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.579
 there is this is a deceptive game then 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.829
 the answer is not always going to be the most 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.690
 obvious according to me the television should be 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.690
 of paying so we have this man 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.690
 Dark 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.120
 but let's see we have to choose a 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.400
 red pill 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.120
 memory and that I can poison me to see 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.920
 blue 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.740
 what a bit less obvious but if 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.650
 I do not choose 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.250
 do anything for that surely in the 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.250
 troll game 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:38.620
 looking at key there is here but do not plant 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.520
 efe 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.520
 this door 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.240
 but 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.909
 ok now I think I should connect 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:55.469
 the pipes for what 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:59.479
 can get the gas ok that served us 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:59.479
 there I am as well as I know how it is and how 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:07.490
 to wait like this 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:10.069
 not how it works this is very difficult 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.750
 I understood that posting on my face to 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.310
 put on masks and obviously the one 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.730
 better is going to work is this because it is 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.250
 anti gas 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.250
 the perfect I'm a genius to see 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.070
 m 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.880
 Do not go to the first one to see a bull here 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.909
 and a bullfighter 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.150

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:37.150

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.120
 to see a magician come a magician with a circus 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.430
 who knows how to turn people into 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.140
 different animals and that is going to give 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.140
 click everyone to make something happen 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.550

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.930
