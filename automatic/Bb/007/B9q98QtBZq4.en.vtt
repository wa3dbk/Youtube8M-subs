queen he has two hatches so he can

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.950 
queen he has two hatches so he can
easily<00:05:49.160> reproduce<00:05:49.670> if<00:05:50.060> he<00:05:50.450> kills<00:05:50.690> off<00:05:50.840> all

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
easily reproduce if he kills off all

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.420 
easily reproduce if he kills off all
these<00:05:51.140> legs<00:05:51.380> but<00:05:51.590> he<00:05:51.680> can't<00:05:51.920> be<00:05:52.010> losing<00:05:52.310> for

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
these legs but he can't be losing for

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.270 
these legs but he can't be losing for
drones<00:05:53.080> so<00:05:54.080> far<00:05:54.320> good<00:05:54.470> drunk<00:05:54.770> control<00:05:55.100> there

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
drones so far good drunk control there

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.980 
drones so far good drunk control there
from<00:05:55.460> San<00:05:55.700> yeah<00:05:55.970> loses<00:05:56.420> one<00:05:56.570> more<00:05:56.600> though

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990

from San yeah loses one more though
that's<00:05:57.200> painful<00:05:57.620> every<00:05:58.460> drone<00:05:59.180> is<00:05:59.390> worth<00:05:59.540> a

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
that's painful every drone is worth a

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.880 
that's painful every drone is worth a
lot<00:05:59.840> hell<00:06:00.260> did<00:06:00.410> he<00:06:00.530> held<00:06:00.710> it<00:06:00.830> I<00:06:01.450> think<00:06:02.450> yeah<00:06:03.230> it

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
lot hell did he held it I think yeah it

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.280 
lot hell did he held it I think yeah it
does<00:06:04.190> look<00:06:04.220> like<00:06:04.550> they're<00:06:04.940> with<00:06:05.660> a<00:06:05.690> queen<00:06:06.110> you

does look like they're with a queen you
can<00:06:06.440> definitely<00:06:06.620> target<00:06:07.100> banelings<00:06:07.430> pretty

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
can definitely target banelings pretty

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.550 
can definitely target banelings pretty
quickly<00:06:07.850> should<00:06:08.600> see<00:06:08.750> sense<00:06:08.990> split<00:06:09.290> this<00:06:09.410> all

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
quickly should see sense split this all

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.320 
quickly should see sense split this all
up<00:06:09.680> pretty<00:06:09.860> well<00:06:09.920> is<00:06:10.430> he<00:06:10.580> gonna<00:06:10.670> go<00:06:10.790> smile<00:06:11.090> wow
