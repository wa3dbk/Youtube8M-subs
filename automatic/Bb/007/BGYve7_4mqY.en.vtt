00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.760 

I'm<00:00:32.820> going<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.059> use<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.540> thin<00:00:33.870> thick<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.559> play

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
I'm going to use a thin thick to play

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.380 
I'm going to use a thin thick to play
this<00:00:34.950> because<00:00:35.340> i<00:00:35.520> like<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.879> sound<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
this because i like the sound of the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.710 
this because i like the sound of the

thin pics on acoustic guitars it makes

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.480 
thin pics on acoustic guitars it makes
it<00:00:39.810> a<00:00:39.870> little<00:00:39.930> bit<00:00:40.080> easier<00:00:40.590> especially<00:00:41.160> if

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:41.490 
it a little bit easier especially if

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.640 
it a little bit easier especially if
you're<00:00:41.580> playing<00:00:41.820> note<00:00:42.810> by<00:00:42.960> note<00:00:43.020> like<00:00:43.440> we're

something<00:00:44.940> like<00:00:45.120> this

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.930 

right<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:49.560> thicker<00:00:49.890> pig<00:00:50.220> sounds<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.670> little

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
right with thicker pig sounds a little

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.730 
right with thicker pig sounds a little
bit<00:00:51.030> more<00:00:51.270> stiff<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.320> don't<00:00:52.500> like<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.710> that

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 
bit more stiff and I don't like it that

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.560 
bit more stiff and I don't like it that
much<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:53.970> the<00:00:54.060> one<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.330> I'm<00:00:54.450> going

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
much so this is the one that I'm going

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.860 
much so this is the one that I'm going
to<00:00:54.630> use<00:00:54.690> let's<00:00:55.560> learn<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.860> parts<00:00:59.600> this<00:01:00.600> song

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
to use let's learn the parts this song

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.290 
to use let's learn the parts this song
has<00:01:00.900> only<00:01:01.560> two<00:01:01.890> parts<00:01:02.280> let's<00:01:02.940> work<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
has only two parts let's work on the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:29.060 
has only two parts let's work on the
first<00:01:03.540> bar

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.670 

the<00:01:30.070> first<00:01:30.370> part<00:01:30.640> has<00:01:31.060> four<00:01:31.810> course<00:01:32.110> those

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
the first part has four course those

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.720 
the first part has four course those
course<00:01:33.040> are<00:01:33.310> see<00:01:33.940> a<00:01:35.160> minor

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
course are see a minor

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:45.280 
course are see a minor
e-minor<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:39.950> F<00:01:43.180> usually<00:01:44.180> when<00:01:44.390> we<00:01:44.540> learn<00:01:44.750> how

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
e-minor and F usually when we learn how

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.690 
e-minor and F usually when we learn how
to<00:01:45.350> play<00:01:45.620> the<00:01:45.770> course<00:01:46.040> we<00:01:46.220> memorize<00:01:46.580> the

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
to play the course we memorize the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.700 
to play the course we memorize the
shapes<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.330> it's<00:01:47.780> always<00:01:48.050> a<00:01:48.230> little<00:01:48.410> bit<00:01:48.620> of

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
shapes and it's always a little bit of

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.180 
shapes and it's always a little bit of
travel<00:01:49.160> to<00:01:49.370> figure<00:01:49.790> out<00:01:49.910> how<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.150> shift<00:01:50.720> from

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
travel to figure out how to shift from

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.220 
travel to figure out how to shift from
shape<00:01:52.190> to<00:01:52.400> shape<00:01:52.640> right<00:01:52.910> so<00:01:53.690> let's<00:01:53.900> look<00:01:54.080> at

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.230 
shape to shape right so let's look at

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.260 
shape to shape right so let's look at
that<00:01:54.380> for<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.590> second<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.640> first<00:01:55.910> two<00:01:56.060> chords

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
that for a second the first two chords

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.170 
that for a second the first two chords
that<00:01:56.360> we<00:01:56.420> have<00:01:56.720> our<00:01:56.990> C<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:57.650> a<00:01:57.890> minor<00:01:58.190> those<00:01:59.000> two

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
that we have our C and a minor those two

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.170 
that we have our C and a minor those two
cores<00:01:59.450> have<00:01:59.720> two<00:02:00.350> fingers<00:02:00.710> in<00:02:00.890> common<00:02:01.220> so<00:02:01.790> what

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
cores have two fingers in common so what

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.590 
cores have two fingers in common so what
we<00:02:02.300> can<00:02:02.480> do<00:02:02.690> to<00:02:02.930> switch<00:02:03.650> from<00:02:04.160> C<00:02:04.760> to<00:02:04.790> a<00:02:04.940> minor<00:02:05.330> is

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
we can do to switch from C to a minor is

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.750 
we can do to switch from C to a minor is
just<00:02:05.810> move<00:02:05.960> this<00:02:06.140> finger<00:02:06.530> to<00:02:07.400> the<00:02:07.430> third

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
just move this finger to the third

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.890 
just move this finger to the third
string<00:02:08.000> second<00:02:08.390> fret<00:02:08.540> so<00:02:09.110> we<00:02:09.230> can<00:02:09.410> go<00:02:10.570> for<00:02:11.570> C

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
string second fret so we can go for C

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.370 
string second fret so we can go for C
and<00:02:12.190> then<00:02:13.190> for<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.490> a<00:02:13.670> minor<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.840> hold<00:02:15.200> these

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
and then for the a minor you hold these

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.200 
and then for the a minor you hold these
two<00:02:15.620> fingers<00:02:15.830> all<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.280> same<00:02:16.580> position<00:02:17.030> and

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
two fingers all the same position and

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
two fingers all the same position and
just<00:02:17.360> move<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:17.720> finger

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.390 

then<00:02:20.890> when<00:02:21.220> we<00:02:21.400> go<00:02:21.580> from<00:02:21.849> a<00:02:22.060> minor<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.810> e<00:02:22.840> minor

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
then when we go from a minor to e minor

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.289 
then when we go from a minor to e minor
we<00:02:24.400> can<00:02:24.580> just<00:02:24.790> lift<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.629> index<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:27.489> shift<00:02:27.909> the

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
we can just lift the index and shift the

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.759 
we can just lift the index and shift the
whole<00:02:28.510> thing<00:02:28.840> one<00:02:29.290> fret<00:02:29.650> 11<00:02:30.340> string<00:02:30.610> up<00:02:31.769> so

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
whole thing one fret 11 string up so

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.059 
whole thing one fret 11 string up so
once<00:02:33.010> again<00:02:33.159> this<00:02:33.549> is<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.879> minor<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.950> take<00:02:35.950> this

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
once again this is a minor I take this

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.339 
once again this is a minor I take this
figure<00:02:36.340> out<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:36.730> then<00:02:37.209> move<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.810> one<00:02:38.049> string

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
figure out and then move it one string

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.300 
figure out and then move it one string
over

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
over

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.190 
over
right<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.800> then<00:02:42.800> for<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.340> F<00:02:43.520> major<00:02:44.150> we<00:02:44.989> just

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
right and then for the F major we just

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.570 
right and then for the F major we just
have<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.440> start<00:02:45.860> from<00:02:47.800> scratch<00:02:48.800> because<00:02:49.069> we

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
have to start from scratch because we

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.339 
have to start from scratch because we
don't<00:02:49.790> have<00:02:49.849> any<00:02:50.150> fingers<00:02:50.510> in<00:02:50.690> common<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:51.200> the

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
don't have any fingers in common and the

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.440 
don't have any fingers in common and the
shapes<00:02:51.650> are<00:02:51.800> not<00:02:52.010> similar<00:02:52.280> so<00:02:52.700> you<00:02:53.120> guys<00:02:53.270> have

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
shapes are not similar so you guys have

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.180 
shapes are not similar so you guys have
to<00:02:53.569> stop<00:02:53.780> placing<00:02:54.290> your<00:02:54.530> finger<00:02:54.770> number<00:02:54.980> three

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
to stop placing your finger number three

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.170 
to stop placing your finger number three
finger<00:02:56.060> number<00:02:56.239> to<00:02:56.450> take<00:02:56.930> your<00:02:57.019> number<00:02:57.080> one

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
finger number to take your number one

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.030 
finger number to take your number one
right<00:02:59.180> but<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.810> good<00:02:59.930> news<00:02:59.989> is<00:03:00.440> that<00:03:00.500> one<00:03:00.830> you

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
right but the good news is that one you

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.250 
right but the good news is that one you
go<00:03:01.160> back<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.400> see<00:03:01.819> you<00:03:02.599> can<00:03:02.750> use<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.050> same

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
go back to see you can use the same

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.020 
go back to see you can use the same
shape<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:03.769> just<00:03:04.220> move<00:03:04.430> these<00:03:04.610> two<00:03:04.790> fingers

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
shape and just move these two fingers

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.380 
shape and just move these two fingers
one<00:03:05.420> string<00:03:05.690> over<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:07.370> you<00:03:07.519> can<00:03:07.670> see<00:03:07.880> so<00:03:08.269> this

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
one string over and you can see so this

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.240 
one string over and you can see so this
is<00:03:08.540> f<00:03:09.610> this<00:03:10.610> is<00:03:10.760> C<00:03:11.500> so<00:03:12.500> let's<00:03:12.680> review<00:03:12.769> all<00:03:13.069> that

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
is f this is C so let's review all that

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.539 
is f this is C so let's review all that
this<00:03:13.880> is<00:03:14.060> C<00:03:14.239> I<00:03:14.920> move<00:03:15.920> this<00:03:16.069> finger<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.519> the

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
this is C I move this finger to the

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.370 
this is C I move this finger to the
third<00:03:16.850> string<00:03:17.090> I<00:03:17.470> can<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.650> minor<00:03:19.569> lift<00:03:20.569> my<00:03:20.810> index

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
third string I can a minor lift my index

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.630 
third string I can a minor lift my index
and<00:03:21.620> move<00:03:21.920> it<00:03:22.010> one<00:03:22.220> string<00:03:22.430> over<00:03:22.840> D<00:03:23.840> minor<00:03:24.280> F<00:03:25.280> I

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
and move it one string over D minor F I

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.020 
and move it one string over D minor F I
start<00:03:26.060> from<00:03:26.180> scratch<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:28.459> then<00:03:28.640> when<00:03:28.790> i<00:03:28.819> go

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
start from scratch and then when i go

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.670 
start from scratch and then when i go
back<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.239> see<00:03:29.569> I<00:03:29.780> just<00:03:30.170> move<00:03:30.349> these<00:03:30.500> two

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
back to see I just move these two

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.630 
back to see I just move these two
fingers<00:03:30.860> one<00:03:31.489> string<00:03:31.730> up<00:03:33.430> let's<00:03:34.430> talk<00:03:34.580> a

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
fingers one string up let's talk a

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.820 
fingers one string up let's talk a
little<00:03:34.760> bit<00:03:35.150> about<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:35.480> right<00:03:35.690> hand<00:03:35.959> we<00:03:36.620> just

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
little bit about the right hand we just

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.170 
little bit about the right hand we just
went<00:03:36.980> through<00:03:37.069> the<00:03:37.250> course<00:03:37.519> but<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:38.000> right

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
went through the course but the right

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.420 
went through the course but the right
hand<00:03:38.480> is<00:03:38.810> playing<00:03:39.260> this<00:03:39.440> pattern<00:03:39.890> where<00:03:40.250> we

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
hand is playing this pattern where we

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.060 
hand is playing this pattern where we
play<00:03:40.720> three<00:03:41.720> or<00:03:41.840> 4th<00:03:42.110> strings<00:03:42.700> one<00:03:43.700> by<00:03:43.849> one<00:03:45.070> and

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
play three or 4th strings one by one and

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.470 
play three or 4th strings one by one and
we're<00:03:46.280> going<00:03:46.430> to<00:03:46.489> play<00:03:46.670> them<00:03:46.850> all<00:03:46.970> in<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.299> same

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
we're going to play them all in the same

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.569 
we're going to play them all in the same
direction<00:03:47.660> so<00:03:48.650> make<00:03:48.859> sure<00:03:48.890> that<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.250> can<00:03:49.400> play

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
direction so make sure that you can play

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.490 
direction so make sure that you can play
all<00:03:49.820> that<00:03:50.060> in<00:03:50.299> just<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.380> same<00:03:51.410> motion<00:03:53.500> like

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
all that in just the same motion like

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.539 
all that in just the same motion like
that<00:03:54.700> versus<00:03:56.890> because<00:03:57.890> I<00:03:57.980> will<00:03:58.100> make<00:03:58.250> it<00:03:58.280> more

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
that versus because I will make it more

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.180 
that versus because I will make it more
difficult<00:03:58.700> for<00:03:59.000> you<00:03:59.209> so<00:03:59.959> what<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:00.650> do<00:04:00.769> is<00:04:00.920> that<00:04:01.040> I

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
difficult for you so what I do is that I

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.090 
difficult for you so what I do is that I
try<00:04:01.489> to<00:04:01.750> support<00:04:02.750> my<00:04:02.930> palm<00:04:03.230> on<00:04:03.530> top<00:04:03.590> of<00:04:03.950> the

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
try to support my palm on top of the

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.940 
try to support my palm on top of the
bridge<00:04:04.310> when<00:04:04.760> I<00:04:04.790> play<00:04:05.090> those<00:04:05.359> four<00:04:05.569> notes<00:04:05.950> that

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
bridge when I play those four notes that

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.470 
bridge when I play those four notes that
makes<00:04:07.190> it<00:04:07.310> easier<00:04:07.519> because<00:04:07.819> I<00:04:08.030> have<00:04:08.239> some

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
makes it easier because I have some

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.039 
makes it easier because I have some
pivot<00:04:09.400> some<00:04:10.400> area<00:04:11.120> that<00:04:11.299> I<00:04:11.359> can<00:04:11.510> support<00:04:11.840> my

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
pivot some area that I can support my

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.259 
pivot some area that I can support my
hand<00:04:12.290> to<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:13.040> it's<00:04:13.220> easier<00:04:13.639> for<00:04:13.670> me<00:04:13.940> to<00:04:13.970> reach

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
hand to and it's easier for me to reach

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.069 
hand to and it's easier for me to reach
all<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:14.690> all<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:14.989> strings<00:04:15.380> one<00:04:15.560> by<00:04:15.709> one

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.979 

then<00:04:18.709> when<00:04:19.069> I<00:04:19.099> play<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.519> strum<00:04:19.849> I<00:04:20.060> can<00:04:20.509> lift<00:04:20.750> my

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
then when I play the strum I can lift my

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.559 
then when I play the strum I can lift my
bum<00:04:21.259> from<00:04:22.069> the<00:04:22.159> bridge<00:04:22.430> and<00:04:22.669> yes<00:04:22.970> strum<00:04:23.539> all

00:04:23.559 --> 00:04:23.569 
bum from the bridge and yes strum all

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:27.959 
bum from the bridge and yes strum all
the<00:04:23.840> strings<00:04:24.430> very<00:04:25.430> very<00:04:25.580> softly<00:04:25.970> like<00:04:26.270> this

00:04:27.959 --> 00:04:27.969 
the strings very very softly like this

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:30.969 
the strings very very softly like this
so<00:04:28.969> I'm<00:04:29.180> practicing<00:04:29.810> two<00:04:30.139> kinds<00:04:30.439> of<00:04:30.530> position

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
so I'm practicing two kinds of position

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.450 
so I'm practicing two kinds of position
one<00:04:31.639> with<00:04:32.180> my<00:04:32.360> palm<00:04:32.599> on<00:04:32.810> top<00:04:32.840> of<00:04:33.139> the<00:04:33.229> bridge

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.300 

and<00:04:35.789> one<00:04:36.120> with<00:04:36.479> my<00:04:36.630> bomb<00:04:37.009> there<00:04:38.009> is<00:04:38.130> not

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
and one with my bomb there is not

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.809 
and one with my bomb there is not
touching<00:04:38.639> the<00:04:38.699> bridge<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:41.130> you<00:04:41.340> do<00:04:41.460> that<00:04:41.639> for

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:41.819 
touching the bridge and you do that for

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:43.309 
touching the bridge and you do that for
all<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.030> different<00:04:42.509> course<00:04:42.750> Stein<00:04:43.050> on<00:04:43.199> the

we play pretty much the same button on

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.180 
we play pretty much the same button on
the<00:05:37.270> right<00:05:37.449> hand<00:05:37.720> but<00:05:38.530> we're<00:05:38.680> going<00:05:38.860> to<00:05:38.919> change

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
the right hand but we're going to change

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.040 
the right hand but we're going to change
the<00:05:39.340> course<00:05:39.610> on<00:05:39.759> the<00:05:39.850> left<00:05:40.060> hand<00:05:40.270> we're<00:05:40.900> going

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
the course on the left hand we're going

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:48.750 
the course on the left hand we're going
to<00:05:41.139> go<00:05:41.320> to<00:05:41.350> g<00:05:43.860> d<00:05:44.860> minor

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:56.519 

f<00:05:51.960> back<00:05:52.960> to<00:05:53.110> G

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:56.529 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:59.159 

and<00:05:56.949> as<00:05:57.849> you<00:05:58.029> can<00:05:58.179> see<00:05:58.209> these<00:05:58.659> three<00:05:58.929> cores

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
and as you can see these three cores

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.889 
and as you can see these three cores
don't<00:05:59.409> really<00:05:59.679> have<00:05:59.919> notes<00:06:00.279> in<00:06:00.459> common<00:06:00.849> so<00:06:01.509> you

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:01.899 
don't really have notes in common so you

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:03.149 
don't really have notes in common so you
pretty<00:06:02.079> much<00:06:02.199> are<00:06:02.409> going<00:06:02.589> to<00:06:02.649> have<00:06:02.799> to<00:06:02.979> start

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159 
pretty much are going to have to start

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:09.719 
pretty much are going to have to start
each<00:06:03.459> shape<00:06:03.819> from<00:06:04.089> scratch<00:06:04.479> G<00:06:08.459> going<00:06:09.459> to<00:06:09.609> D

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
each shape from scratch G going to D

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.990 
each shape from scratch G going to D
minor

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.290 

then<00:06:13.600> from<00:06:14.500> D<00:06:14.680> minor<00:06:14.890> to<00:06:15.220> F<00:06:15.250> actually<00:06:16.030> we<00:06:16.120> have

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
then from D minor to F actually we have

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.140 
then from D minor to F actually we have
one<00:06:16.570> finger<00:06:16.930> in<00:06:17.050> common<00:06:17.380> you<00:06:17.560> can<00:06:17.740> hold<00:06:18.640> your
