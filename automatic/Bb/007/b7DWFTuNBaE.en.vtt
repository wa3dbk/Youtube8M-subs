think the posters that have been
released<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.479> little<00:01:39.630> bit<00:01:39.810> Hollywood<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.439> think

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
released a little bit Hollywood I think

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.050 
released a little bit Hollywood I think
I<00:01:40.979> don't<00:01:41.159> know<00:01:41.220> if<00:01:41.400> it's<00:01:41.549> from<00:01:41.729> if<00:01:41.939> it's

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
I don't know if it's from if it's

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.819 
I don't know if it's from if it's
adapted<00:01:42.479> from<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.720> play<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.110> think<00:01:43.350> maybe<00:01:43.649> it

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
adapted from a play I think maybe it

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.800 
adapted from a play I think maybe it
should<00:01:43.979> be<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> bit<00:01:44.369> kind<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.060> know<00:01:45.090> true<00:01:45.570> to

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
should be a bit kind of you know true to

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.200 
should be a bit kind of you know true to
its<00:01:45.930> original<00:01:46.020> source<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.009> stick<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.909> that

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
its original source and stick to that

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.920 
its original source and stick to that
kind<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.770> style<00:01:50.420> rather<00:01:51.420> than<00:01:51.570> getting<00:01:51.750> all

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
kind of style rather than getting all

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.450 
kind of style rather than getting all
Hollywood<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.530> suppose<00:01:53.070> that's<00:01:53.130> not<00:01:53.280> really

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
Hollywood I suppose that's not really

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.190 
Hollywood I suppose that's not really
down<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.790> company<00:01:54.390> itself<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.899> down<00:01:55.049> to

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
down to the company itself is down to

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.520 
down to the company itself is down to
the<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.530> know<00:01:55.770> design<00:01:56.659> agency<00:01:57.659> that's<00:01:57.810> done

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the you know design agency that's done

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.499 
the you know design agency that's done
the<00:01:58.649> actual<00:01:58.890> design<00:01:59.159> for<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.460> film<00:01:59.670> but

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
the actual design for the film but

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.940 
the actual design for the film but
either<00:02:00.630> way<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.869> decided<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.530> make<00:02:01.649> like<00:02:01.829> this

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
either way I decided to make like this

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.109 
either way I decided to make like this
so<00:02:02.189> when<00:02:02.310> it's<00:02:02.399> going<00:02:02.490> for<00:02:02.579> color<00:02:02.729> paper

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
so when it's going for color paper

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.789 
so when it's going for color paper
texture<00:02:03.689> effect<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.259> then<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.530> thought<00:02:04.740> you

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
texture effect and then I thought you

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.700 
texture effect and then I thought you
know<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.979> won't<00:02:05.130> make<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.369> red<00:02:06.530> I'm<00:02:07.530> not

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
know I won't make it red I'm not

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.660 
know I won't make it red I'm not
actually<00:02:07.979> watching<00:02:08.069> at<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.310> moment<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.580> I'm

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
actually watching at the moment so I'm

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.639 
actually watching at the moment so I'm
not<00:02:08.729> sure<00:02:08.789> if<00:02:08.910> it's<00:02:09.000> red<00:02:09.179> now<00:02:09.289> or<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.530> will<00:02:10.590> be

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
not sure if it's red now or it will be

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.280 
not sure if it's red now or it will be
later<00:02:10.860> I'm<00:02:11.190> not<00:02:11.340> sure<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.599> gray<00:02:12.840> now<00:02:13.050> then

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
later I'm not sure it is gray now then

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.850 
later I'm not sure it is gray now then
that's<00:02:13.410> what

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
that's what

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.620 
that's what
the<00:02:13.950> color<00:02:14.160> i<00:02:14.220> went<00:02:14.430> for<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.670> end<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.390> kind

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
the color i went for in the end and kind

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.510 
the color i went for in the end and kind
of<00:02:15.720> well<00:02:15.840> if<00:02:15.960> went<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.740> kind<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.070> went<00:02:17.310> 'add

worst<00:02:18.770> pronunciation<00:02:19.770> of<00:02:19.800> anything<00:02:20.100> ever<00:02:20.220> I

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
worst pronunciation of anything ever I

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.220 
worst pronunciation of anything ever I
am<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:22.070> went<00:02:23.070> for<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.670> cpa<00:02:24.360> kind<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.750> tone<00:02:24.990> which

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
am I went for a cpa kind of tone which

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.780 
am I went for a cpa kind of tone which
thought<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.560> what<00:02:25.800> nice<00:02:25.950> during<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.370> end<00:02:26.490> it's

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
thought of what nice during the end it's

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.140 
thought of what nice during the end it's
actually<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.060> gold<00:02:27.330> blue<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.760> kind<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.880> split

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
actually a gold blue and kind of a split

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.390 
actually a gold blue and kind of a split
toning<00:02:30.450> yeah<00:02:31.080> it's<00:02:31.500> not<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.800> noticeable<00:02:31.950> why

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
toning yeah it's not that noticeable why

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.500 
toning yeah it's not that noticeable why
didn't<00:02:32.580> want<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:32.850> me<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.120> don't<00:02:33.270> want<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:33.450> to

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
didn't want it to me I don't want it to

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.840 
didn't want it to me I don't want it to
be<00:02:33.570> like<00:02:33.720> overly<00:02:34.170> blue<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.650> gold<00:02:34.830> just<00:02:35.580> enough

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
be like overly blue and gold just enough

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.900 
be like overly blue and gold just enough
to<00:02:35.880> be<00:02:36.660> quite<00:02:36.900> subtle<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.890> effective<00:02:38.280> and

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
to be quite subtle and effective and

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.580 
to be quite subtle and effective and
that's<00:02:39.390> what<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.540> go<00:02:39.660> for<00:02:39.780> at<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.900> end<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.380> I'll

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
that's what I go for at the end and I'll

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.370 
that's what I go for at the end and I'll
make<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:41.030> texture<00:02:42.030> in<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.180> background<00:02:42.510> like

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
make the texture in the background like

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.760 
make the texture in the background like
a<00:02:43.470> tapestry<00:02:43.830> or<00:02:44.100> like<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.550> woven<00:02:45.330> paper<00:02:45.770> which

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
a tapestry or like a woven paper which

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.050 
a tapestry or like a woven paper which
looks<00:02:46.980> quite<00:02:47.100> nice<00:02:47.250> as<00:02:47.459> well<00:02:47.580> so<00:02:47.820> as<00:02:47.910> I<00:02:48.000> said

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
looks quite nice as well so as I said

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.490 
looks quite nice as well so as I said
I'll<00:02:48.270> stuck<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.630> original<00:02:48.660> kind<00:02:49.410> of

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
I'll stuck to the original kind of

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.710 
I'll stuck to the original kind of
design<00:02:49.940> I'm<00:02:50.940> pretty<00:02:51.150> proud<00:02:51.270> with<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.570> way<00:02:51.660> it

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
design I'm pretty proud with the way it

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.030 
design I'm pretty proud with the way it
came<00:02:51.780> out<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.140> think<00:02:52.410> it<00:02:52.500> looks<00:02:52.530> good<00:02:52.800> it<00:02:52.860> looks

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
came out I think it looks good it looks

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.070 
came out I think it looks good it looks
effective<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.910> this<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.660> first<00:02:54.690> times

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
effective and this is the first times

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.440 
effective and this is the first times
