 and became popular on the Internet originated 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.390
 my weight 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.640

 year issue continues to the present 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.340
 time 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.280
 anime adaptation premiere 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.170
 occurred on October 7, 2000 4 years and 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.880
 lasted through December 23 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.240
 it follows from this that the first season 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.030
 consists of 12 series 2 by the way, too, and 3 of 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.200
 13 there are also two alas basis 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.520
 The plot is as it is not trivial 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.980
 overcoming your psychological 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.490
 problems the main character and in this they 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.550
 help 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.170
 you probably thought little girls are not 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.970
 magic cube rozen maiden 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.650
 but still nyashny girls here 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.390
 still present as rozen 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.280
 maiden shout yourself zion elements on 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.870
 mystics and popular lolita 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.670
 rozen maiden this project means and 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.010
 puppeteer master rose to us goal 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.810
 creating the perfect doll what is and 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.100
 affairs and affairs there is no ideal 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.959
 exists only in his head 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.120
 creator he has no final 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.770
 forms however he made 7 dolls 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.170
 which reflects the different views 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.510
 humanity about the ideal woman with 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.850
 magic help he gave them souls and gave life 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.650
 in other words he gave them self-awareness 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.420
 why are we doing all this to 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.430
 dolls fought among themselves a certain 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.350
 experiment if one doll kills 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.090
 another one takes away all her positive 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.920
 traits thereby bringing yourself closer to 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.480
 perfection is also interesting that in 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.730
 given they are actively used terms 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.920
 and the names of the German language I do not know 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.950
 what comes first to you personally 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.660
 I have something not very good but actually 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.150
 should be added a bit of mysticism 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.550
 vampires and so on and mystical garbage 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.800
 abound here besides that 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.120
 a doll and they walk and talk they 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.070
 also owns various magical 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.790
 abilities of each doll they 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.410
 are unique 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.030
 It can also be assumed that one of 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.920
 plot sends in this anime this 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.050
 religion all google is of itself 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.120
 adherents 1 faith each one 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.010
 have my own problems about gods for not 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.900
 in this religion is a puppeteer mind 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.970
 main character jun schoolboy 2 class 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.069
 high school has become to the sea almost 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.900
 not leaving home he is having fun 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.849
 shopping a variety of mystical 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.799
 things through the internet he has a sister 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.330
 nori who tries to take care of him 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.340
 Well, the answer only gets rude 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.290
 of ignoring and here once it gets to him 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.510
 in the hands of 1 of 5 simka dolls simka 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.889
 turned out to be a difficult doll ostrich gave 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.320
 slap him for touching 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.389
 forced a woman to give 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.160
 oath of loyalty making it thereby 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.020
 his servant, that's it and 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.889
 the quiet life of the main thing is over 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.760
 hero guys embroider this awesome

 roses maiden all links in description 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.990
 Now for the short seasonally main 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.370
 the plot line of the first season is 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.300
 ridding the main character of the syndrome 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.830
 hikikomori 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.050
 also we are gradually introduced to the main 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.180
 heroes and the role of the main villain plays 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.950
 students in season 2 most 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.750
 the plot goes to the disclosure of the characters 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.610
 dolls guys are extremely difficult not 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.590
 to spoil but in general I will say that where is he 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.780
 plays in the second season auxiliary 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.700
 role rather than the main character also in 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.800
 the second season there will be new dolls 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.720
 after the second season came two-part 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.850
 you are a series about hostility 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.100
 dolls but seven years after the release 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.440
 the series released the third season of rozen maiden 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.390
 which went just this year but if 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.340
 more specifically left from July to September 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.110
 musical arrangement in one of my 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.460
 favorite styles so I put him 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.960
 boldly 70 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.030
 you ask me why seven out of ten 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.920
 Yes, because I wanted so much 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.900
 evaluate graphics is not the best 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.910
 but on not rejects from himself can be said 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.160
 she's kind of gothic I don't know how 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.540
 call it well in general nice looking in 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.400

 the opposite of the main character but i'm not 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:51.640
 I will say that I did not like them, I even 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.250
 I will say it is above average for me but 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.720
 here plays the fact of the difference of characters 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.370
 and I repeat that all 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.930
