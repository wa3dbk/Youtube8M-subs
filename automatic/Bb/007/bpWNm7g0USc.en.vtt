transmissions<00:00:06.519> still<00:00:06.759> a<00:00:06.790> little<00:00:07.090> bit<00:00:07.359> clunky

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:07.750 
transmissions still a little bit clunky

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.750 
transmissions still a little bit clunky
that's<00:00:08.530> pretty<00:00:08.710> normal<00:00:08.920> an<00:00:09.190> engine<00:00:09.430> break-in

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:09.760 
that's pretty normal an engine break-in

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.980 
that's pretty normal an engine break-in
you<00:00:09.879> got<00:00:10.000> to<00:00:10.120> shift<00:00:10.299> through<00:00:10.450> the<00:00:10.480> gears<00:00:10.570> a<00:00:10.809> lot

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
you got to shift through the gears a lot

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.799 
you got to shift through the gears a lot
so<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:12.280> don't<00:00:12.759> know<00:00:13.030> what<00:00:13.179> kind<00:00:13.330> of<00:00:13.389> belief<00:00:13.630> you

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:13.809 
so I don't know what kind of belief you

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.539 
so I don't know what kind of belief you
have<00:00:13.870> I<00:00:14.019> believe<00:00:14.380> in<00:00:14.920> the<00:00:15.070> engine<00:00:15.250> break<00:00:15.400> and

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549 
have I believe in the engine break and

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.970 
have I believe in the engine break and
there's<00:00:15.670> a<00:00:15.730> lot<00:00:15.849> of<00:00:15.940> schools<00:00:16.299> of<00:00:16.390> thought<00:00:16.980> some

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
there's a lot of schools of thought some

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.140 
there's a lot of schools of thought some
people<00:00:18.220> tell<00:00:18.400> you<00:00:18.550> that<00:00:18.700> you<00:00:18.820> want<00:00:18.970> to<00:00:19.029> break

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
people tell you that you want to break

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.939 
people tell you that you want to break
it<00:00:19.300> in<00:00:19.419> hard<00:00:19.720> you<00:00:20.050> know<00:00:20.170> run<00:00:20.380> it<00:00:20.410> on<00:00:20.590> the<00:00:20.710> dyno

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
it in hard you know run it on the dyno

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.740 
it in hard you know run it on the dyno
just<00:00:21.400> Rev<00:00:21.640> that<00:00:22.029> to<00:00:22.210> the<00:00:22.300> moon<00:00:22.480> and

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
just Rev that to the moon and

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.029 
just Rev that to the moon and
then<00:00:22.779> you<00:00:22.960> know<00:00:23.080> what<00:00:23.260> I<00:00:23.289> don't<00:00:23.590> you<00:00:23.769> know<00:00:23.859> pull

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
then you know what I don't you know pull

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.339 
then you know what I don't you know pull
back<00:00:24.220> down<00:00:24.460> to<00:00:24.609> idle<00:00:24.939> and<00:00:25.180> repeat<00:00:26.140> the<00:00:26.199> process

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
back down to idle and repeat the process

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.609 
back down to idle and repeat the process
several<00:00:26.710> times<00:00:26.800> and<00:00:27.189> that<00:00:27.250> sets<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:28.500> sets<00:00:29.500> the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
several times and that sets the sets the

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.080 
several times and that sets the sets the
Rings<00:00:29.830> well<00:00:30.099> here's<00:00:30.279> the<00:00:30.400> truth<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:30.880> Rings

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
Rings well here's the truth the Rings

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.820 
Rings well here's the truth the Rings
are<00:00:31.269> gonna<00:00:31.359> pretty<00:00:31.630> well<00:00:31.840> set<00:00:32.080> in<00:00:32.260> in<00:00:32.739> the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830 
are gonna pretty well set in in the

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.500 
are gonna pretty well set in in the
first<00:00:32.980> 10<00:00:33.340> 20<00:00:33.699> miles<00:00:33.879> however<00:00:34.360> they're<00:00:34.480> going

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
first 10 20 miles however they're going

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.649 
first 10 20 miles however they're going
to<00:00:34.690> set<00:00:34.870> so<00:00:35.580> that's<00:00:36.580> the<00:00:36.820> most<00:00:37.000> crucial<00:00:37.449> part

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:37.659 
to set so that's the most crucial part

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:39.119 
to set so that's the most crucial part
of<00:00:37.780> break-in<00:00:38.199> you<00:00:38.320> want<00:00:38.470> to<00:00:38.589> you<00:00:38.739> know<00:00:38.860> vary

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
of break-in you want to you know vary

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.219 
of break-in you want to you know vary
your<00:00:39.280> speed<00:00:39.640> you<00:00:40.269> want<00:00:40.330> a<00:00:40.420> very<00:00:40.629> engine<00:00:41.049> load

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.229 
your speed you want a very engine load

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:43.020 
your speed you want a very engine load
so<00:00:41.379> I<00:00:41.500> got<00:00:41.650> a<00:00:41.680> white<00:00:41.890> throttle<00:00:42.339> heavy<00:00:42.580> throttle

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
so I got a white throttle heavy throttle

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.850 
so I got a white throttle heavy throttle
medium<00:00:43.390> throttle<00:00:43.750> accelerating<00:00:44.470> shifting

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
medium throttle accelerating shifting

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.619 
medium throttle accelerating shifting
through<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.100> gears<00:00:45.309> slow<00:00:45.670> back<00:00:45.909> down<00:00:45.940> engine

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
through the gears slow back down engine

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.570 
through the gears slow back down engine
braking<00:00:46.870> no<00:00:47.199> engine<00:00:47.559> braking<00:00:47.769> pull<00:00:48.190> back<00:00:48.369> down

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.580 
braking no engine braking pull back down

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.700 
braking no engine braking pull back down

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
to this idle accel right through you

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.079 
to this idle accel right through you
know<00:00:50.830> the<00:00:51.250> only<00:00:51.369> way<00:00:51.519> for<00:00:51.640> me<00:00:51.729> to<00:00:51.760> do<00:00:51.909> that

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
know the only way for me to do that

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:54.180 
know the only way for me to do that
really<00:00:52.239> easily<00:00:52.510> stop<00:00:53.170> and<00:00:53.379> go<00:00:53.470> traffic<00:00:53.530> city

really easily stop and go traffic city

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.460 
really easily stop and go traffic city
stop<00:00:54.610> lights<00:00:54.909> turns<00:00:55.299> but<00:00:55.989> I'm<00:00:56.080> doing<00:00:56.290> it<00:00:56.379> out

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
stop lights turns but I'm doing it out

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.619 
stop lights turns but I'm doing it out

idle<00:01:06.580> because<00:01:06.670> then<00:01:06.939> the<00:01:07.060> engine<00:01:07.299> will<00:01:07.420> run

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
idle because then the engine will run

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
engine - it's amazing actually the

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.980 
engine - it's amazing actually the
transmissions<00:01:25.300> already<00:01:25.600> feeling<00:01:25.810> better

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
transmissions already feeling better

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.960 
transmissions already feeling better
Emma<00:01:26.229> we<00:01:26.320> got<00:01:26.440> 14<00:01:26.770> miles<00:01:26.979> on<00:01:27.220> it<00:01:27.250> so<00:01:27.430> I'll<00:01:27.820> tell

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
Emma we got 14 miles on it so I'll tell

you

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
you

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.420 
you
transmissions<00:01:29.140> though<00:01:29.259> they<00:01:29.440> work<00:01:30.100> best<00:01:30.310> when

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
transmissions though they work best when

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.830 
transmissions though they work best when
you<00:01:30.520> do<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:30.640> lot<00:01:30.880> of<00:01:31.090> shifting<00:01:31.420> up<00:01:31.570> and<00:01:31.720> down

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
you do a lot of shifting up and down

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.719 
you do a lot of shifting up and down
through<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.110> gears<00:01:32.229> you<00:01:32.590> know<00:01:38.640> here's<00:01:39.640> the

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
through the gears you know here's the

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.240 
through the gears you know here's the
great<00:01:39.909> thing<00:01:39.940> I'm<00:01:40.330> at<00:01:40.509> 2,000<00:01:41.409> rpm<00:01:42.149> in<00:01:43.149> fourth

2,000 rpm and still have usable I'm in

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.710 
2,000 rpm and still have usable I'm in
fifth<00:01:55.289> yeah<00:01:56.320> fifth<00:01:56.979> gear<00:01:57.190> 1800<00:01:58.090> rpm<00:01:58.450> it<00:01:58.570> looks

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
fifth yeah fifth gear 1800 rpm it looks

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.230 
fifth yeah fifth gear 1800 rpm it looks
like<00:01:58.869> and<00:01:59.110> it's<00:01:59.470> still<00:01:59.710> pulled<00:01:59.979> like<00:02:00.310> it<00:02:00.490> this

like and it's still pulled like it this
thing<00:02:01.420> just<00:02:01.450> makes<00:02:01.780> a<00:02:01.960> ton<00:02:02.229> of<00:02:02.259> torque<00:02:02.649> it

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
chugs along happily it in the RPM you

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.840 
chugs along happily it in the RPM you
want

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
want

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:45.740

look<00:02:46.750> through<00:02:46.990> this<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.290> always<00:02:47.410> a<00:02:47.530> blind

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
look through this is always a blind

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.330 
look through this is always a blind
corner<00:02:48.010> nasty<00:02:48.700> section<00:02:49.090> of<00:02:49.180> roadway<00:02:49.330> here

corner nasty section of roadway here

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.410 
corner nasty section of roadway here
yeah<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.460> road<00:02:51.610> isn't<00:02:51.850> that<00:02:51.970> great<00:02:52.180> threw

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
yeah the road isn't that great threw

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.880 
yeah the road isn't that great threw
away<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:53.080> lake<00:02:53.230> but<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:53.440> gives<00:02:53.590> me<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.710> lot<00:02:53.830> of

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.350 
vehicle speed because again you're not
just<00:02:59.950> breaking<00:03:00.160> in<00:03:00.460> the<00:03:00.640> Pistons<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.300> the

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
just breaking in the Pistons and the

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.080 
just breaking in the Pistons and the
valves<00:03:01.750> and<00:03:01.990> the<00:03:02.020> Rings<00:03:02.770> okay<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:03.850> got<00:03:03.970> to

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
valves and the Rings okay you got to

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.790 
valves and the Rings okay you got to
seat<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:04.330> valves<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:05.260> got<00:03:05.380> to<00:03:05.470> break<00:03:05.590> into

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
seat the valves you got to break into

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.370 
seat the valves you got to break into
piston<00:03:06.250> rings<00:03:06.960> the<00:03:07.960> and<00:03:08.080> make<00:03:08.200> sure<00:03:08.290> the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
piston rings the and make sure the

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.410 
piston rings the and make sure the
bearings<00:03:08.770> get<00:03:08.980> plenty<00:03:09.700> of<00:03:09.760> oil<00:03:09.820> flow<00:03:10.180> and

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
bearings get plenty of oil flow and

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.480 
bearings get plenty of oil flow and
they're<00:03:10.570> being<00:03:10.800> serviced<00:03:11.800> correctly<00:03:11.830> and

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
they're being serviced correctly and

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.070 
they're being serviced correctly and
then<00:03:12.580> they<00:03:12.730> wear<00:03:12.970> in<00:03:13.180> a<00:03:13.330> certain<00:03:13.600> way<00:03:13.720> so<00:03:13.750> you

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
then they wear in a certain way so you

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.390 
then they wear in a certain way so you
got<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.380> get<00:03:14.470> all<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.860> work<00:03:15.010> out<00:03:15.160> right

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
got to get all that to work out right

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.860 
got to get all that to work out right
but<00:03:15.940> you're<00:03:16.120> also<00:03:16.240> breaking<00:03:16.600> in<00:03:16.780> the

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
but you're also breaking in the

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.120 
but you're also breaking in the
transmission<00:03:17.440> right<00:03:17.710> there's<00:03:18.040> a

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
transmission right there's a

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.530 
transmission right there's a
transmission<00:03:18.520> inside<00:03:18.910> that<00:03:19.060> engine<00:03:19.210> casing

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
transmission inside that engine casing

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.150 
transmission inside that engine casing
and<00:03:19.870> you<00:03:20.200> got<00:03:20.320> to<00:03:20.410> make<00:03:20.500> sure<00:03:20.590> that<00:03:20.740> the<00:03:20.830> gears

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
and you got to make sure that the gears

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.280 
and you got to make sure that the gears
all<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:22.120> different<00:03:22.390> gears<00:03:22.570> first<00:03:22.900> second

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
all the different gears first second

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.900 
all the different gears first second
third<00:03:23.380> fourth<00:03:23.440> fifth<00:03:23.740> and<00:03:24.040> sixth<00:03:24.370> all<00:03:24.520> of<00:03:24.790> them

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
third fourth fifth and sixth all of them

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.730 
third fourth fifth and sixth all of them
are<00:03:24.970> getting<00:03:25.150> broken<00:03:25.390> in<00:03:25.630> worn<00:03:26.410> through

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
are getting broken in worn through

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.710 
are getting broken in worn through
evenly<00:03:27.100> etc<00:03:27.700> so<00:03:27.850> you're<00:03:28.030> making<00:03:28.330> sure<00:03:28.510> that

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
evenly etc so you're making sure that

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.180 
evenly etc so you're making sure that
there's<00:03:29.050> a<00:03:29.110> lot<00:03:29.290> of<00:03:29.320> stuff<00:03:29.530> going<00:03:29.710> on<00:03:29.890> you<00:03:29.950> got

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
there's a lot of stuff going on you got

there's a lot of stuff going on you got
to<00:03:30.250> get<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.430> shift<00:03:30.670> Forks<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.210> drum<00:03:31.480> worn

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
to get the shift Forks and the drum worn

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.150 
to get the shift Forks and the drum worn
in<00:03:32.050> so<00:03:32.170> you've<00:03:32.290> got<00:03:32.380> to<00:03:32.470> shift<00:03:32.620> gears<00:03:32.920> a<00:03:32.980> lot

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
in so you've got to shift gears a lot

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.610 
in so you've got to shift gears a lot
you<00:03:33.280> gotta<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:34.540> know<00:03:34.570> do<00:03:34.810> engine<00:03:35.140> braking<00:03:35.380> and

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
you gotta you know do engine braking and

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.860 
you gotta you know do engine braking and
accelerating<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:36.730> maintaining<00:03:37.270> speed<00:03:37.390> and

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
accelerating and maintaining speed and

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.150 
accelerating and maintaining speed and
cruising<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.440> there's<00:03:38.590> a<00:03:38.650> lot<00:03:38.770> of<00:03:38.800> things<00:03:39.040> you

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
cruising and there's a lot of things you

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.360 
cruising and there's a lot of things you
have<00:03:39.280> to<00:03:39.340> do<00:03:39.580> that

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
have to do that

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.620 
have to do that
braking<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.490> engine<00:03:42.730> correctly<00:03:43.180> but<00:03:43.360> it's

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
braking the engine correctly but it's

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.660 
braking the engine correctly but it's
really<00:03:43.810> important<00:03:44.230> to<00:03:44.290> do<00:03:44.410> and<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:45.310> thing<00:03:45.490> is

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
really important to do and the thing is

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.000 
really important to do and the thing is
on<00:03:45.850> a<00:03:45.910> bike<00:03:46.060> like<00:03:46.120> this<00:03:46.360> is<00:03:46.960> fantastic<00:03:47.590> there's

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
on a bike like this is fantastic there's

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.430 
on a bike like this is fantastic there's
no<00:03:48.220> speed<00:03:48.670> no<00:03:49.330> type<00:03:49.630> of<00:03:49.660> writing<00:03:49.990> that's<00:03:50.260> not

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
no speed no type of writing that's not

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.370 
no speed no type of writing that's not
fun<00:03:50.800> on<00:03:50.980> this<00:03:51.130> thing
