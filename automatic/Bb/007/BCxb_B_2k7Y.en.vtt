00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.589
 but I always think this is a mirror 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:11.809
 house see him rafael dalton digão 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.809
 my friend 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.320
 Hey, handsome beauty with you. 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.380
 representing the Brazilian interest to 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.200
 You're the second medium-sized football tournament. 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.060
 In this tutorial, I'll teach you how to 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.980
 make your player the one on the flap 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.410
 in that nothing that player who does not 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.619
 fits in your tactic render in degree 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.780
 maximum focus of his focus on the main 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.600
 that 's what they are 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.800
 then this method is using the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.829
 scouts and tactics here then let's go 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.260
 Let's stop scrolling this video, come on. 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.820
 The first one you have, I came here in 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.770
 your tactics when you want to arm the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.280
 team to start the game 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.000
 you put the goalkeeper puts goes in favor 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.370
 of team 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.739
 the slaughter aquino gaza is the right effect 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.690
 first of all I'll be leaving the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:06.869
 link of this tactic here ó 424 no ipca 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.330
 download that she is ready to 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.539
 this middle class then talk like this 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.600
 doctor why errors should yield to 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.700
 Fucking there, great, if you put your 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.540
 right defense you come here in profile 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.400
 he goes on report 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.259
 and here you click on the position it goes 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.229
 playing for example that the right company 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.750
 is the main one for example if you look 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.380
 that it is the role of ward or better the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.340
 role is wing and the task is to defend 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.340
 so you come back here in the tactics 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.990
 put it as wing and defend 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.990
 then you do that the whole team 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.040
 I think the whole team, for example, each 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.549
 a mix is ​​put here goes in profile 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.210
 his 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:58.829
 the report explains that in the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:02.310
 limited to defend to use to limit the 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:06.049
 I will defend accelerate video and go and 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.049
 complete base team so let's go 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:34.670
 to Dad will not touch my canoe beyond 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:48.700
 to stay in the couple's house in the neighborhood 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:53.230
 leblon did not cut the ball rolled the car 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.230
 was not there 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:11.000
 there do not put the logo on the profile of the 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.680
 player and he is like the 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.659
 but when you come here 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.500
 you see it is not tip-to-tip 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:21.190
 launches 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.500
 because that there is a defense is a 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.780
 wrong translation because he is 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:34.430
 translated into Portuguese from portugal then 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:38.239
 in case a spearhead would be a player 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.239
 target player in case he or she 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.160
 target player to attack this business. 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.579
 I'll leave a site at your discretion 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:49.190
 for you to see the translation better for 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:52.160
 you see from a goalkeeper's report 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:04:00.379
 that is one thing and here in the tactic is another 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:04:02.299
 beauty hygiene at my spearhead 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:07.010
 fixed in the case of a fixed boom 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:09.829
 same guy, that 's what I fucking had 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.199
 there everything is already configured 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:16.340
 the owner of the team, and with this 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:17.780
 training since I got on with chores 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.349
 season two I got between 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.720
 the top three in the premier league and 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:29.990
 third season got the title gives 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:31.520
 premier league as you speak and that's it 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.889
 That you did not understand better, I think. 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.960
 that you'd better go to the 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.160
 hotel leaving the registration you look 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.170
 on one side and place and see 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.230

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.570

 I'll explain how it is 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.350
 here you will see where it is inscribed by 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.330
 you go there because the player is 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.460

 number 10 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.420
 then you put number 3 number 3 and 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:30.120
 number 10 the player there in the report goes 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.220
 be advanced backward there you come look 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.440
 who is going forward is defensive 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.810
