00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello I want you again 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.240
 a favorite of the month revolving gave 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.480
 so far only one thing was the one at that time 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.010
 mur drain and that's just because 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.690
 that I always do not really care 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.670
 I have everything so colorful 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.430
 always mixed by use and now 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.260
 nothing for a long period of time 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.630
 except now my basic products 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.000
 in any case, to have a thing to come 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.869
 I have a new favorite for this one 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.949
 month or 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.430
 last month and that is the p2 express 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.850
 paypal this is this lousy sponge 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.879
 here in there, there are also from 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.030
 view in north your more expensive variant of the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.500
 I think cost 695 and I think of 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.219
 Porsche was or how hot there are 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.260
 also such a part 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.090
 In any case, the p2 has those, so to speak 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.030
 Imitation in a cheaper 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.899
 Variant first not so cheap it costs 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.230
 I think I'm not quite 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.300
 sure i believe three euro 95 2 2 or 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.000
 3 euros for 90 so either costs 34 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.469
 euro so pretty expensive for 50 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.520
 You have to say milliliters and me 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.710
 have to say I was pretty, too 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.610
 skeptical 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.700
 and well, but I really wanted him 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.140
 give it a try and I have to say it 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.640
 I did not even find him for the first time 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.040
 that's how awesome I 've been trying 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.200
 glittering paint and have to say 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.390
 that this sponge somehow too 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.950
 Soft I think that should be firmer 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.420
 but now I have it longer 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.890
 my sister uses it too 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.110
 used and we actually find it 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.570
 Both are pretty awesome because it's easy 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.950
 Rucki zucki get the nail polish 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.689
 I have just nail polish tab again 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.759
 painted so to speak that's how it goes 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.220
 fast so if you have to go somewhere 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.540
 and quasi flaked nails have the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.890
 then would have to paint quickly from then 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.689
 is it just perfect you are in three 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.430
 Seconds done it's much faster 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.229
 as with a handkerchief or with a handkerchief 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.479
 waterbed of the good just that one too 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.040
 you avoid this garbage makes you 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.930
 does not consume so many cotton pads or 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.000
 Handkerchiefs on the paint and varnish 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.520
 even glitter paints go faster with it 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.009
 as of now with a normal handkerchief 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.689
 or cotton packs with Renken 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.130
 nail polish remover that's why I have to 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.930
 that really convinces me 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.780
 already very much as I said the only drawback 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.399
 or what p2 is my opinion here 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.979
 could improve that is this 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.910
 sponge would have to be stronger that we 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.590
 Just better 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.730
 Of course, now the thing is 50 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.510
 milliliters are not much and 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.640
 At some point, the swarm 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.650
 probably also dirty but me 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.280
 I read that you swam this 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.730
 can quasi take out and then could 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.990
 you wash it in theory and 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.730
 take it with you or in new 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.780
 take a nail polish remover and that will 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.880
 I then try again when the 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.350
 here no longer works anyway 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.820
 I think the product is really good and 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.290
 my sisters pretty much the same 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.060
 Excited and she wants herself too 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.980
 In any case, that's how it is 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.680
 my darlings of the last months 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.210
 because that's how nail polish changes 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.620
 happy fun because it just retreat 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.090
 that annoys me that usually annoys that 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.110
 but paint off the exfoliated 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.830
 Nails do not look that good either 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.350
 beautiful 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.360
 and yes with this remover it works 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.650
 just super fast though 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.330
 Of course it is also very expensive 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.980
 as I said if you really still 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.300
 So I can use it 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.190
 definitely try it out if it is 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.660
 it works that somehow 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.530
 dodges or I do not know how that works 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.720
 Let's see 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.660
 respectively in new lacquer drinks and 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.660
 then it will be yes from the price yes 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:16.720
 we'll see yes anyway, is 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.980
 skin goose bump oh yes I have from 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.930
 some elections video belongs to them 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.280
 do not like to use something like that because it is 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.750
 so that one finger the whole is pure 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.280
 and probably it is 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.140
 not so healthy for the skin if 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.930
 nail polish remover height forest rankommt 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.400
 but first of dismiss is free and 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.620
 Second, what I got the fingernails 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.810
 generally or not fingernails but the 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.730
 wash my hands from under the nail polish 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.010
 generally always paint with 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.360
 Water and soap logically for you 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.920
 should also not paint the nails 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.390
 after you have painted the but off 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.950
 First wash so that no residues 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.840
 more of the nail polish remover are on it 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.070
 and that's why it's actually me 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.900
 do not think that's the skin 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.209
 somehow more effective than now 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.700
 a conventional removers the 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.989
 you pack with cotton or 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.310
 handkerchief on it smear i hold it 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.260
 getting away a bit and then doing 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.400
 So, in short, if you really need it 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.800
 I say when I had one now 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.459
 It takes a long time to get there 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.780
 do so 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.860
 one down if you have several 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.930
 then you have to have layers 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.340
 a little more often , stop it 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.739
 was on the nail polish on beck heat 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.600
 Of course, it takes a bit longer 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.160
 but for others it's real 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.870
 super fast and I think very much 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.640
 cool 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.140
 and yes I do not know like that from now 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.549
 Organic and such are not yet 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.570
 tested because they really stay with me 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.400
 too expensive for 7 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.870
 so remove a trace of this 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.100
 I had with the boat and the belly 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.990
 constantly sold out so I had 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.460
 really lucky the last time I was in 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.470
 dm was that I got that because 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.450
 Whenever I was there, he did not care 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.030
 clever so relatively popular too 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.170
 and yes, if that interests you 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.000
 then just have a look if ye 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.800
 finds and I can only do you 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.290
 Guess the good times to try it out 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.300
 stop 34 euro but yes to test me 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.840
 I think it's actually a cool one 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.790
 idea 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.500
 and as I said, that's me too 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.870
 Positive is true that you just can not 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.060
 more such a trash such a high miller 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.070
 has such a high wait pad and 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.340
 Handkerchief consumption at ligacup 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.020
 paint yes that was actually everything 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.440
 what I say to you about this good piece 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:08.560
 At any rate , that's my opinion 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.060
 my second month would be darling and 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.440
 You're welcome to write me if you like 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.000
 also had experiences with it like 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.230
 you find that and if we also do this 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.790
 others because of these others 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.830
 dare knows if there is a difference 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.960
 or if they are the same 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.650
 dell or if i then higher price too 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.360
 still worth it that was it and yours 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.640
 opinion would interest me very much 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.640
 and yes, see you soon
