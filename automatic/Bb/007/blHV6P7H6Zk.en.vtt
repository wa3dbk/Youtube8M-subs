00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.280
 Every time we buy an animal we finance a business of exploitation and suffering. 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.640
 The Vetxarxa de Torelló clinic has found a formula that benefits all: 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.120
 animals, clientele and company. 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.040
 There they offer all the products and services that dogs, cats and other small animals need, 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.440
 while looking for the best home. 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.400
 Many abandoned animals came to us, many people thought the dog was 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.200
 and then they could not take over the litter, and from there we started 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.560
 with the idea of ​​giving these animals sterilized, vaccinated, with the chip, 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.160
 negatives of leishmania, virus negatives. 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.880
 For some time now, we have an agreement with the Town Hall of Torelló, 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.600
 that all the animals found in Torelló, we take care of the collection, 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.240
 Keeping them up to date with vaccines, having them in quarantine and then obviously 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.800
 to give them for adoption. 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.200
 Nowadays we carry almost 800 in 5 years and we are very happy the truth because it is working very well. 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.240
 The sale of animals in stores is prohibited in places like Canada or California. 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.040
 The centers are reconverted, thus contributing to solving the serious problem of abandonment. 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.040
 This gives them benefits from the economic and image point of view. 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.240
 At the time you make an adoption, this customer is very loyal to your company, 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.920
 In the end this is a company, and you are selling and tracking these people, and doing the visits. 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.080
 You saw that people are adopting you, that you can track, that you see them grow, 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.880
 that you see them run, sterilize them, vaccinate them, everything, you see that they are healthy, well cared for, 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.840
 and this is very much appreciated, because then when they come here they are happy. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.560
 It's very fun to find names, because typically, people tell Kira the dog, 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.240
 But maybe there are twenty thousand dogs called Kira. 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.640
 We try to find a name that has to do with the day, 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.160
 It helps us to remember the individuality of that animal. 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:13.200
 For example, yesterday, they found a kitten near 3 weeks or so 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.880
 Because he already has dentures, and yesterday he was Sant Narcis, because we put Narcís. 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.200
 We try to find the best person that will be in charge, for example an old animal, 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.040
 we will look for an elderly person with a rather quiet rhythm of life, 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.640
 And a young animal that needs to run, which needs a lot of life, we will seek 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.120
 a family with dwarfs, people who go to the mountain. 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.840
 The animalist association Libera! It has an extensive campaign that includes support 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.080
 In stores that want to consider this option more ethical and beneficial 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.280
 as an alternative to your business. 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:57.400
 There could be more agreements between clinics, shops, protectors, to give 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.880
 a faster start, so that the animals do not have to spend too long on the protectors. 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.440
 It is the only ethical way of dealing with animals. 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.480
 Women love, power for two months that may have been on the street have not been, 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.520
 have gone hungry, you women have a plate and warmth and love and life, I do not know ... 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.280
 I believe that an adopted animal is much more grateful than an animal you buy. 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.720
