00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
so this is basically a caramel scent and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.399 
so this is basically a caramel scent and
going<00:02:01.979> back<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> little<00:02:02.369> bit<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.670> start<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:03.060> with

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
going back a little bit to start it with

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.350 
going back a little bit to start it with
creamy<00:02:04.409> caramel<00:02:04.729> didn't<00:02:05.729> do<00:02:05.820> too<00:02:06.000> well<00:02:06.030> so

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
creamy caramel didn't do too well so

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.510 
creamy caramel didn't do too well so
they<00:02:06.450> ended<00:02:06.659> up<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.990> guess<00:02:07.710> canceling<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.250> one

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
they ended up I guess canceling that one

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.460 
they ended up I guess canceling that one
they<00:02:08.879> had<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.209> waffle<00:02:09.420> our<00:02:09.629> form<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.200> then

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
they had it in waffle our form and then

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.990 
they had it in waffle our form and then
they<00:02:10.560> canceled<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.069> eventually

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
they canceled it eventually

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.750 
they canceled it eventually
then<00:02:13.180> so<00:02:13.900> that's<00:02:14.620> what<00:02:14.800> it<00:02:14.830> was<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.250> was<00:02:15.370> creamy

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
then so that's what it was it was creamy

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.140 
then so that's what it was it was creamy
caramel<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.450> then<00:02:16.710> a<00:02:17.710> few<00:02:18.040> years<00:02:18.100> later<00:02:18.340> they

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
caramel and then a few years later they

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.300 
caramel and then a few years later they
make<00:02:19.330> a<00:02:19.360> cent<00:02:19.690> called<00:02:19.960> salty<00:02:20.830> caramel<00:02:20.980> it's

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
make a cent called salty caramel it's

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.250 
make a cent called salty caramel it's
pretty<00:02:21.460> much<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.640> same<00:02:21.850> thing<00:02:21.910> just<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:23.050> little

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
pretty much the same thing just a little

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.290 
pretty much the same thing just a little
bit<00:02:23.350> saltier<00:02:23.710> and<00:02:23.740> that<00:02:23.950> was<00:02:24.160> released<00:02:25.030> last

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
bit saltier and that was released last

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.590 
bit saltier and that was released last
year<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:26.890> have<00:02:27.100> salty<00:02:27.970> caramel<00:02:28.120> which<00:02:28.450> is

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
year so you have salty caramel which is

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.440 
year so you have salty caramel which is
just<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.900> hit<00:02:29.110> all<00:02:29.380> across<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:29.950> board<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:31.420> that

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
just to hit all across the board so that

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.920 
just to hit all across the board so that
one<00:02:31.720> stays<00:02:32.020> in<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.530> spring<00:02:32.830> summer<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.930> lasts

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
one stays in the spring summer and lasts

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.630 
one stays in the spring summer and lasts
all<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.350> way<00:02:35.470> until<00:02:35.709> fall<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.430> then<00:02:36.520> they

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
all the way until fall and then they

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.570 
all the way until fall and then they
cancel<00:02:37.300> it<00:02:37.420> out<00:02:37.650> discontinued<00:02:38.650> it<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.130> this

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
cancel it out discontinued it and this

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.320 
cancel it out discontinued it and this
year<00:02:39.820> it<00:02:40.000> returned<00:02:40.390> as<00:02:40.810> no<00:02:41.590> no<00:02:41.740> in<00:02:41.980> summer<00:02:42.970> of

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
year it returned as no no in summer of

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.540 
year it returned as no no in summer of
the<00:02:43.870> summer<00:02:44.110> this<00:02:44.320> year<00:02:44.380> it<00:02:44.770> actually<00:02:45.220> came

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
about to be honest but frankly didn't

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.910 
about to be honest but frankly didn't
get<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.250> Apple<00:03:03.580> but<00:03:03.730> they<00:03:03.970> had<00:03:04.180> apples<00:03:04.540> in<00:03:04.660> it

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
the Sun had apples in it and I'm like

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.460 
the Sun had apples in it and I'm like
okay<00:03:07.360> whatever<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:08.320> it<00:03:08.470> came<00:03:08.620> back<00:03:09.030> slightly

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
okay whatever so it came back slightly

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.760 
okay whatever so it came back slightly
altered<00:03:11.470> but<00:03:11.739> not<00:03:12.459> quite<00:03:12.850> the<00:03:13.060> same<00:03:13.239> and<00:03:13.770> then

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
altered but not quite the same and then

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.520 
altered but not quite the same and then
for<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.520> fall<00:03:15.790> of<00:03:16.209> this<00:03:16.690> year<00:03:16.750> it<00:03:17.080> comes<00:03:17.290> back

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
for the fall of this year it comes back

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.800 
for the fall of this year it comes back
as<00:03:17.850> salted<00:03:18.959> caramel<00:03:19.959> and<00:03:20.670> personally<00:03:21.670> it<00:03:22.030> was

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
as salted caramel and personally it was

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.520 
as salted caramel and personally it was
a<00:03:23.140> lot<00:03:23.410> weaker<00:03:23.670> so<00:03:24.670> they<00:03:24.820> just<00:03:25.330> completely<00:03:25.989> can

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
a lot weaker so they just completely can

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.370 
a lot weaker so they just completely can
the<00:03:26.799> intensity<00:03:27.250> of<00:03:27.459> it<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:28.720> now<00:03:28.900> we're<00:03:29.170> into

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
the intensity of it so now we're into

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.840 
the intensity of it so now we're into
winter<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.730> it's<00:03:31.450> back<00:03:31.720> as<00:03:31.959> toffee<00:03:32.620> crunch<00:03:32.980> so

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
winter and it's back as toffee crunch so

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.400 
winter and it's back as toffee crunch so
it's<00:03:34.000> like<00:03:34.120> this<00:03:34.330> king<00:03:34.600> descent<00:03:35.019> has<00:03:35.200> been

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
it's like this king descent has been

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.979 
it's like this king descent has been
through<00:03:35.739> a<00:03:36.010> hundred<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:36.850> twenty<00:03:37.239> transitions

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
through a hundred and twenty transitions

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.020 
through a hundred and twenty transitions
poor<00:03:38.320> thing<00:03:38.560> just<00:03:38.590> like<00:03:39.010> cannot<00:03:39.640> stay<00:03:39.910> the

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
poor thing just like cannot stay the

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.830 
poor thing just like cannot stay the
same<00:03:40.209> so<00:03:40.650> toffee<00:03:41.650> crunch<00:03:41.829> is<00:03:42.040> basically<00:03:42.840> salty

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
same so toffee crunch is basically salty

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.890 
same so toffee crunch is basically salty
caramel<00:03:43.989> and<00:03:46.019> summer<00:03:47.019> boardwalk<00:03:47.440> without<00:03:47.920> the

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
caramel and summer boardwalk without the

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.740 
caramel and summer boardwalk without the

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
glazed or the Apple candied apple I

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.940 
glazed or the Apple candied apple I
don't<00:03:52.930> know<00:03:53.019> I<00:03:53.049> don't<00:03:53.140> remember<00:03:53.230> off<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.799> top

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
don't know I don't remember off the top

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.680 
don't know I don't remember off the top
of<00:03:54.070> my<00:03:54.190> head<00:03:54.250> but<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:55.120> doesn't<00:03:55.360> have<00:03:55.450> any<00:03:55.630> of

of my head but it doesn't have any of

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.940

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
sweet caramel sent that I think people

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.250

something<00:04:09.730> that<00:04:10.420> I<00:04:10.450> have<00:04:10.930> to<00:04:11.140> have<00:04:11.290> although<00:04:11.500> I

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
something that I have to have although I

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.069 
something that I have to have although I
did<00:04:11.890> get<00:04:12.010> a<00:04:12.070> ton<00:04:12.280> of<00:04:12.310> summer<00:04:12.549> boardwalk<00:04:12.970> but<00:04:13.780> I

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
did get a ton of summer boardwalk but I

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.650 
did get a ton of summer boardwalk but I
think<00:04:14.709> if<00:04:15.040> you've<00:04:15.220> tried<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:16.060> salty<00:04:16.479> caramel

think if you've tried the salty caramel

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.130 
think if you've tried the salty caramel
and<00:04:17.260> even<00:04:17.979> salted<00:04:18.430> caramel<00:04:19.030> summer<00:04:19.750> boardwalk

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
and even salted caramel summer boardwalk

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.409 
and even salted caramel summer boardwalk
