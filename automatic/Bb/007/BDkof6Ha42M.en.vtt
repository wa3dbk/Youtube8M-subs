it all up there as a finished product in
one<00:01:29.759> piece<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:31.189> unnecessarily<00:01:32.189> wasteful<00:01:34.729> so

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
one piece is unnecessarily wasteful so

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.170 
one piece is unnecessarily wasteful so
that's<00:01:37.619> his<00:01:37.890> sales<00:01:38.159> pitch<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.729> get<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:38.970> whole

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
that's his sales pitch to get this whole

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.569 
that's his sales pitch to get this whole
thing<00:01:39.390> going<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.079> got<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.770> say<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:40.979> mean<00:01:41.189> it

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
thing going and I got to say I mean it

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.190 
thing going and I got to say I mean it
can't<00:01:41.880> hurt<00:01:42.000> anything<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.540> only<00:01:42.780> good<00:01:42.960> at

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
can't hurt anything it's only good at

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.690 
can't hurt anything it's only good at
this<00:01:43.409> point<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.860> be<00:01:43.979> able<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.189> build<00:01:44.399> more

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
this point to be able to build more

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.999 
this point to be able to build more
things<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.210> space<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.200> be<00:01:46.320> able<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.560> do<00:01:46.770> so

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
things in space and to be able to do so

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.850 
things in space and to be able to do so
at<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.310> level<00:01:47.610> now<00:01:48.420> I'd<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.530> see<00:01:49.680> them

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
at this level now I'd like to see them

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.550 
at this level now I'd like to see them
pull<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.490> off<00:01:50.869> because<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.229> would<00:01:52.380> really

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
pull this off because that would really

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.560 
pull this off because that would really
be<00:01:52.680> another<00:01:53.040> step<00:01:53.340> closer<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:54.000> being<00:01:54.180> able<00:01:54.329> to

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
be another step closer to being able to

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.330 
be another step closer to being able to
send<00:01:54.780> these<00:01:54.930> things<00:01:55.200> up<00:01:55.380> there<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.829> build

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
send these things up there and build

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.590 
send these things up there and build
something<00:01:57.110> that<00:01:58.110> could<00:01:58.439> sustain<00:01:58.649> life<00:01:59.250> or<00:02:00.149> at

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
something that could sustain life or at

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.219 
something that could sustain life or at
least<00:02:01.070> be<00:02:02.070> able<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.520> make<00:02:03.060> smaller<00:02:03.689> products

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
least be able to make smaller products

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.809 
least be able to make smaller products
that<00:02:04.860> could<00:02:05.450> be<00:02:06.450> pieced<00:02:06.840> together<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:08.250> put<00:02:08.489> one

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
that could be pieced together to put one
