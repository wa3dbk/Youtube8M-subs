00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
this was a really really good box and

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.349 
this was a really really good box and
I'm<00:00:25.650> gonna<00:00:25.800> go<00:00:26.010> ahead<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.250> insert<00:00:26.730> clips<00:00:27.090> of

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
I'm gonna go ahead and insert clips of

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.849 
I'm gonna go ahead and insert clips of
like<00:00:27.510> close-ups<00:00:28.019> on<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.289> product<00:00:28.650> just

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
like close-ups on the product just

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.040 
like close-ups on the product just
because<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.189> know<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:30.000> my<00:00:30.179> focusing<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.810> kind

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
because I know that my focusing is kind

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.840 
because I know that my focusing is kind
of<00:00:31.170> funny<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.410> have<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.830> manually<00:00:32.189> focus<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.820> and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
of funny I have to manually focus it and

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.950 
of funny I have to manually focus it and
there's<00:00:33.660> no<00:00:33.870> viewfinder<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.960> that's

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
there's no viewfinder on this so that's

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.720 
there's no viewfinder on this so that's
why<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.200> focusing<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> little<00:00:38.219> bit<00:00:38.309> off<00:00:38.460> so

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
why the focusing is a little bit off so

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.160 
why the focusing is a little bit off so
anyways<00:00:39.120> i'll<00:00:39.360> go<00:00:39.480> ahead<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:39.809> insert

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170
