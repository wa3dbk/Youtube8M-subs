00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.110 

so<00:00:45.109> to<00:00:45.170> start<00:00:45.589> off<00:00:45.829> you're<00:00:46.399> gonna<00:00:46.609> take<00:00:46.940> your

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
so to start off you're gonna take your

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.060 
so to start off you're gonna take your
piece<00:00:47.359> of<00:00:47.390> felt<00:00:47.809> and<00:00:48.079> you're<00:00:48.440> gonna<00:00:48.620> cut<00:00:48.949> it

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
piece of felt and you're gonna cut it

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.639 
piece of felt and you're gonna cut it
into<00:00:49.309> a<00:00:50.030> leaf<00:00:50.659> shape<00:00:51.019> like<00:00:51.379> this<00:00:52.300> the

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
into a leaf shape like this the

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.910 
into a leaf shape like this the
approximate<00:00:55.149> measures<00:00:56.649> measurements<00:00:57.649> for

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
approximate measures measurements for

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.750 
approximate measures measurements for
this<00:00:58.190> is<00:00:59.140> about<00:01:00.140> five<00:01:00.769> and<00:01:00.799> a<00:01:01.070> half<00:01:01.100> inches

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
this is about five and a half inches

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.480 
this is about five and a half inches
long<00:01:01.809> and<00:01:04.990> almost<00:01:05.990> three<00:01:06.350> inches<00:01:06.740> across<00:01:07.070> so

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
long and almost three inches across so

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.999 
long and almost three inches across so
anything<00:01:08.330> close<00:01:08.689> to<00:01:08.720> that<00:01:09.020> is<00:01:09.470> going<00:01:09.619> to<00:01:09.799> be

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
anything close to that is going to be

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.950 
anything close to that is going to be
what<00:01:10.640> you're<00:01:10.789> going<00:01:10.909> to<00:01:10.970> need<00:01:11.179> and<00:01:11.479> it's<00:01:11.780> just

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
taking one of the small smaller petals

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.729 
taking one of the small smaller petals
and<00:02:36.530> folding<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.680> in<00:02:37.950> half<00:02:37.980> like<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:39.590> so<00:02:40.590> this

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
and folding it in half like that so this

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.570 
and folding it in half like that so this
is<00:02:40.950> going<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.190> be<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.580> start<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:44.130> headband

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
is going to be the start of the headband

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:51.680 
is going to be the start of the headband
like<00:02:44.850> this<00:02:45.380> so<00:02:46.380> what<00:02:46.560> you're<00:02:46.680> gonna<00:02:46.830> do<00:02:50.690> is

your petal placed in half you're going
to<00:03:06.030> place<00:03:06.269> it<00:03:06.299> down<00:03:06.510> into<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.260> glue<00:03:09.080> next

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
to place it down into the glue next

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.280 
to place it down into the glue next
you're<00:03:10.500> going<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.709> get<00:03:10.980> one<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.400> the

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
you're going to get one of the

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.130 
you're going to get one of the
medium-sized<00:03:13.290> petals<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.930> again<00:03:15.930> you're

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
medium-sized petals and again you're

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.610 
medium-sized petals and again you're
gonna<00:03:16.290> put<00:03:16.590> some<00:03:16.799> glue<00:03:17.989> strip<00:03:18.989> of<00:03:19.170> glue<00:03:19.319> like

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
gonna put some glue strip of glue like

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.229 
gonna put some glue strip of glue like
this<00:03:19.650> but<00:03:20.220> you're<00:03:20.340> also<00:03:20.489> going<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.850> come<00:03:21.090> up

this but you're also going to come up
into<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.930> first<00:03:22.230> petal<00:03:22.650> because<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:23.130> want

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
into the first petal because you want

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.970 
into the first petal because you want
them<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.549> kind<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:23.850> overlap<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:24.930> then<00:03:25.530> fill<00:03:25.829> it

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
this one directly almost on top of the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.180 
this one directly almost on top of the
other<00:03:34.799> petal<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:36.690> then<00:03:37.019> again<00:03:37.500> push<00:03:37.829> it<00:03:37.980> down

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
other petal and then again push it down

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.050 
other petal and then again push it down
into<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.880> glue<00:03:40.310> I'm<00:03:41.310> gonna<00:03:41.489> take<00:03:41.700> one<00:03:41.850> of<00:03:41.880> the

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
into the glue I'm gonna take one of the

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.199 
into the glue I'm gonna take one of the
larger<00:03:42.480> petals<00:03:42.870> now<00:03:43.489> since<00:03:44.489> we're<00:03:44.670> getting<00:03:44.970> to

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
larger petals now since we're getting to

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.270 
larger petals now since we're getting to
the<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:46.590> widest<00:03:47.010> part<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.609> leaf<00:03:49.010> so<00:03:50.010> again

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
the the widest part of the leaf so again

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.740 
the the widest part of the leaf so again
I'm<00:03:50.400> going<00:03:50.579> to<00:03:50.640> just<00:03:50.880> put<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.090> strip<00:03:51.390> of<00:03:51.570> glue

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
I'm going to just put a strip of glue

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.280 
I'm going to just put a strip of glue
down<00:03:52.040> kind<00:03:53.040> of<00:03:53.130> overlap<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:53.850> a<00:03:53.910> little<00:03:54.290> like

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290

go to the medium-sized petal we're going

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:45.379 
go to the medium-sized petal we're going
to<00:04:32.320> glue<00:04:32.470> that<00:04:32.560> down<00:04:33.040> here
