players<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.270> at<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> end<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.960> beta<00:00:46.200> phase<00:00:46.469> two

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
players so at the end of beta phase two

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.090 
players so at the end of beta phase two
i<00:00:47.480> was<00:00:48.480> probably<00:00:49.020> around<00:00:49.170> one<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.860> top

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
i was probably around one of the top

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.610 
i was probably around one of the top
1000<00:00:50.969> players<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:51.930> want<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.140> place<00:00:52.590> a

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
1000 players so if you want to place a

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.350 
1000 players so if you want to place a
bet<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.219> map<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.640> probably<00:00:54.120> want<00:00:54.329> to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
bet on this map you probably want to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.770 
bet on this map you probably want to
place<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:54.930> thur<00:00:55.350> gasm<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.940> anyway<00:00:57.329> just

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
place it on thur gasm so anyway just

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.990 
place it on thur gasm so anyway just
back<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.020> our<00:00:58.260> basic<00:00:58.649> strategy<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.699> call<00:00:59.969> it

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
back to our basic strategy we call it

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.849 
back to our basic strategy we call it
the<00:01:00.090> mega<00:01:00.420> marine<00:01:00.809> rush<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> reason<00:01:01.739> we

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
the mega marine rush and the reason we

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.009 
the mega marine rush and the reason we
are<00:01:02.010> rushing<00:01:02.430> on<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.670> map<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.030> because<00:01:03.690> we

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
are rushing on this map is because we

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.170 
are rushing on this map is because we
have<00:01:04.049> rocks<00:01:04.470> right<00:01:04.739> here<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.670> ramp<00:01:05.939> right

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
have rocks right here and a ramp right

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.149 
have rocks right here and a ramp right
here<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.750> leaves<00:01:06.900> two<00:01:07.020> entrances<00:01:07.890> into

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
here so that leaves two entrances into

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.490 
here so that leaves two entrances into
our<00:01:08.430> base<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.330> taking<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.020> map<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
our base so taking on this map is a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.350 
our base so taking on this map is a
little<00:01:10.979> risky<00:01:11.100> since<00:01:11.549> there<00:01:11.760> are<00:01:11.850> two<00:01:12.060> ways<00:01:12.090> to

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
little risky since there are two ways to

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.859 
little risky since there are two ways to
enter<00:01:12.840> someone's<00:01:13.229> base<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.390> build

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
enter someone's base so the the build

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.480 
enter someone's base so the the build
order<00:01:16.229> for<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.470> mega<00:01:16.680> marine<00:01:17.040> rush<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.430> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
order for the mega marine rush is a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.410 
order for the mega marine rush is a
supply<00:01:18.060> depot<00:01:18.619> to<00:01:19.619> rex's<00:01:20.220> an<00:01:20.790> orbital<00:01:21.210> command

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
supply depot to rex's an orbital command

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.050 
supply depot to rex's an orbital command
center<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.990> supply<00:01:22.650> depot<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.340> then<00:01:23.520> two<00:01:23.820> more

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
center a supply depot and then two more

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.800 
center a supply depot and then two more
r<00:01:24.119> axes<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.490> then<00:01:26.490> when<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.299> key<00:01:27.509> things<00:01:27.750> to

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
r axes and then when the key things to

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.109 
r axes and then when the key things to
remember<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.380> also<00:01:28.979> don't<00:01:29.340> build<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.640> tech<00:01:29.880> lab

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
remember is also don't build a tech lab

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.780 
remember is also don't build a tech lab
don't<00:01:31.049> build<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.380> reactor<00:01:31.920> because<00:01:32.369> they<00:01:32.640> will

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
don't build a reactor because they will

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.149 
don't build a reactor because they will
slow<00:01:33.060> your<00:01:33.290> production<00:01:34.290> time<00:01:34.530> of<00:01:34.770> Marines

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
slow your production time of Marines

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.340 
slow your production time of Marines
down<00:01:35.520> especially<00:01:36.329> don't<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.170> want<00:01:37.290> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
down especially don't if you want to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.170 
down especially don't if you want to
build<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> tech<00:01:38.070> nap<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.460> guess<00:01:38.640> that's<00:01:38.790> fine<00:01:39.030> but

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
build a tech nap I guess that's fine but

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.179 
build a tech nap I guess that's fine but
don't<00:01:39.240> build<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.659> reactor<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.290> reason<00:01:41.159> for

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
don't build a reactor and the reason for

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.990 
don't build a reactor and the reason for
that<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:42.030> reactor<00:01:42.780> has<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.259> as<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.130> 50-second

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
that is a reactor has the as a 50-second

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.090 
that is a reactor has the as a 50-second
build<00:01:45.180> time<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> new<00:01:45.990> barracks<00:01:46.380> has<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> 60

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
build time and the new barracks has a 60

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.130 
build time and the new barracks has a 60
second<00:01:47.460> view<00:01:47.579> time<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.420> that's<00:01:48.600> almost<00:01:49.020> three

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
second view time so that's almost three

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.050

Marines<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.829> could<00:01:49.979> be<00:01:50.100> building<00:01:50.490> if<00:01:50.670> you

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
Marines you could be building if you

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.999 
Marines you could be building if you
make<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.299> reactor<00:01:51.899> which<00:01:52.439> will<00:01:52.649> slow<00:01:52.770> your

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
make a reactor which will slow your

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.910 
make a reactor which will slow your
marine<00:01:53.340> production<00:01:53.850> countdown<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.229> let's<00:01:55.770> go

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
marine production countdown so let's go

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.030 
marine production countdown so let's go
see<00:01:56.100> what<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.280> was<00:01:56.430> urgh<00:01:56.610> players<00:01:56.880> up<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:58.040> looks

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
see what I was urgh players up to looks

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.819 
see what I was urgh players up to looks
like<00:01:59.250> he's<00:01:59.399> doing<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.670> typical<00:02:00.060> Zerg<00:02:00.270> build<00:02:00.829> 14

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
like he's doing a typical Zerg build 14

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.700 
like he's doing a typical Zerg build 14
drone<00:02:02.549> count<00:02:02.909> into<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> hatchery

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
fast-expanding and then a spawning pool

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.529 
fast-expanding and then a spawning pool
so<00:02:06.810> nothing<00:02:07.619> too<00:02:07.860> unusual<00:02:07.890> going<00:02:08.550> on<00:02:08.640> here<00:02:09.060> but

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
so nothing too unusual going on here but

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.160 
so nothing too unusual going on here but
it<00:02:09.660> looks<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:09.899> he<00:02:10.200> decided<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.860> grab<00:02:11.220> our<00:02:11.580> gas

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
it looks like he decided to grab our gas

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.170 
it looks like he decided to grab our gas
it's<00:02:13.260> not<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.470> not<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.950> big<00:02:14.190> deal<00:02:14.430> because<00:02:14.819> he

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
it's not a not a big deal because he

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.910 
it's not a not a big deal because he
doesn't<00:02:15.360> know<00:02:15.510> we<00:02:15.720> don't<00:02:15.900> need<00:02:16.080> this<00:02:16.230> gas<00:02:16.530> for

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
doesn't know we don't need this gas for

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.699 
doesn't know we don't need this gas for
make<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.220> marine<00:02:17.670> rush<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:19.140> we<00:02:19.290> still<00:02:19.470> have<00:02:19.530> the

go<00:02:35.160> back<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.340> our<00:02:35.520> build<00:02:36.000> order<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.510> looks<00:02:36.690> like

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
go back to our build order it looks like

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.600 
go back to our build order it looks like
we<00:02:36.930> have<00:02:37.050> two<00:02:37.350> Marines<00:02:37.890> going<00:02:38.069> out<00:02:38.310> already

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
we have two Marines going out already

we have two Marines going out already
and<00:02:38.850> one<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.360> things<00:02:39.390> about<00:02:39.750> your<00:02:40.019> first

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
and one of the things about your first

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.990 
and one of the things about your first
two<00:02:40.470> Marines<00:02:40.769> is<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.100> always<00:02:41.370> want<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.819> go<00:02:41.970> Oh

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000

so you got to think like a zerg player

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.059 
so you got to think like a zerg player
you<00:02:45.959> got<00:02:45.989> to<00:02:46.170> understand<00:02:46.680> where<00:02:46.890> they<00:02:46.980> were

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.450 
so if anything went wrong like he got
his<00:05:09.060> manliness<00:05:09.450> up<00:05:09.810> too<00:05:10.020> fast<00:05:10.050> you<00:05:11.040> can<00:05:11.190> just

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
his manliness up too fast you can just

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.580 
his manliness up too fast you can just
fortify<00:05:12.240> all<00:05:12.480> your<00:05:12.600> troops<00:05:12.870> and<00:05:13.080> your<00:05:13.170> natural

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
fortify all your troops and your natural

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.670 
fortify all your troops and your natural
expansion<00:05:13.800> would<00:05:14.130> be<00:05:14.340> saved<00:05:15.140> it<00:05:16.140> doesn't<00:05:16.650> look

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
expansion would be saved it doesn't look

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.170 
expansion would be saved it doesn't look
he<00:05:17.010> looks<00:05:17.160> like<00:05:17.220> he<00:05:17.400> gots<00:05:17.580> mainland<00:05:17.940> coming

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
he looks like he gots mainland coming

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.750 
he looks like he gots mainland coming
out<00:05:18.300> but<00:05:18.530> it<00:05:19.530> doesn't<00:05:19.680> look<00:05:19.920> like<00:05:20.040> it<00:05:20.340> was<00:05:20.460> fast

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
out but it doesn't look like it was fast

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.580 
out but it doesn't look like it was fast
enough<00:05:21.090> so<00:05:21.120> I<00:05:21.630> don't<00:05:22.020> think<00:05:22.200> there's<00:05:22.350> anything

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
enough so I don't think there's anything

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.260 
enough so I don't think there's anything
he<00:05:22.830> can<00:05:22.860> do<00:05:23.070> at<00:05:23.190> this<00:05:23.310> point<00:05:23.400> and<00:05:23.790> it<00:05:23.880> looks

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
he can do at this point and it looks

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.880 
he can do at this point and it looks
like<00:05:24.450> he's<00:05:24.630> just<00:05:24.810> gotta<00:05:25.050> I<00:05:25.110> gotta<00:05:25.440> give<00:05:25.740> up

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
like he's just gotta I gotta give up

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.650

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
right now I mean he might be able to

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.940 
right now I mean he might be able to
make<00:05:27.840> some<00:05:27.960> more<00:05:28.020> banelings<00:05:28.380> up<00:05:28.530> here<00:05:28.740> but
