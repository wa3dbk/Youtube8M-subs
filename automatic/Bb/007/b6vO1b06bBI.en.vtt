what's up everybody this is Ingram I'm
one<00:00:18.939> of<00:00:19.029> the<00:00:19.090> Minecrafters<00:00:19.810> and<00:00:19.990> just<00:00:20.650> going

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
one of the Minecrafters and just going

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.210 
one of the Minecrafters and just going
to<00:00:20.920> do<00:00:20.980> a<00:00:21.010> quick<00:00:21.720> video<00:00:22.720> today<00:00:22.960> showing<00:00:23.919> you

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
to do a quick video today showing you

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.620 
to do a quick video today showing you
some<00:00:24.759> of<00:00:24.790> the<00:00:24.910> projects<00:00:25.330> that<00:00:25.450> we've<00:00:25.570> been

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
some of the projects that we've been

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.409 
some of the projects that we've been
working<00:00:25.689> on<00:00:26.640> specifically<00:00:27.640> I<00:00:27.880> wanted<00:00:28.180> to<00:00:28.270> show

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
working on specifically I wanted to show

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.240 
working on specifically I wanted to show
people<00:00:28.450> where<00:00:29.200> we<00:00:29.259> pimped<00:00:29.650> it<00:00:29.680> out<00:00:29.800> since<00:00:30.039> last

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
people where we pimped it out since last

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.040 
people where we pimped it out since last
time<00:00:30.460> you've<00:00:30.579> probably<00:00:30.759> seen<00:00:30.970> it<00:00:31.029> and<00:00:31.300> this

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
time you've probably seen it and this

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.080 
time you've probably seen it and this
thing<00:00:32.230> is<00:00:32.290> rocking<00:00:32.890> it<00:00:33.010> out<00:00:33.100> now<00:00:33.340> with<00:00:33.610> four

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
thing is rocking it out now with four

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.729 
thing is rocking it out now with four
cores<00:00:34.390> that<00:00:34.510> are<00:00:34.630> each<00:00:34.840> producing<00:00:35.350> roughly

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
cores that are each producing roughly

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.920 
cores that are each producing roughly
seventeen<00:00:36.399> hundred<00:00:36.730> BuildCraft<00:00:37.420> millijoules

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
seventeen hundred BuildCraft millijoules

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.770 
seventeen hundred BuildCraft millijoules
pirtek<00:00:38.649> each<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:41.730> there<00:00:42.730> you<00:00:43.329> can<00:00:43.450> kind<00:00:43.600> of<00:00:43.719> see

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
pirtek each in there you can kind of see

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.669 
pirtek each in there you can kind of see
it<00:00:44.020> and<00:00:44.200> there<00:00:44.920> is<00:00:44.950> the<00:00:45.100> automatic<00:00:46.410> hv<00:00:47.410> solar

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
it and there is the automatic hv solar

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:49.500 
it and there is the automatic hv solar
array<00:00:48.010> factory<00:00:48.579> but<00:00:48.910> we<00:00:49.030> won't<00:00:49.179> go<00:00:49.269> into<00:00:49.329> that

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
array factory but we won't go into that

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.680 
array factory but we won't go into that
it's<00:00:50.109> just<00:00:50.410> yet<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:51.730> what<00:00:51.969> I<00:00:51.999> did<00:00:52.239> is<00:00:52.359> I<00:00:52.480> hooked

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
it's just yet but what I did is I hooked

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.369 
it's just yet but what I did is I hooked
that<00:00:52.809> power<00:00:53.109> core<00:00:53.379> up<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:53.859> a<00:00:54.839> little<00:00:55.839> something

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
that power core up to a little something

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.259 
that power core up to a little something
in<00:00:56.589> the<00:00:56.800> nether<00:00:57.070> and<00:00:57.550> I<00:00:57.820> want<00:00:57.999> to<00:00:58.089> show<00:00:58.210> you

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
in the nether and I want to show you

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.419 
in the nether and I want to show you
guys<00:00:58.359> why<00:00:58.839> that<00:00:59.109> thing<00:00:59.379> is<00:00:59.530> so<00:00:59.679> powerful<00:00:59.920> and

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429 
guys why that thing is so powerful and

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.680 
guys why that thing is so powerful and
why<00:01:01.149> it's<00:01:01.539> worth<00:01:01.749> the<00:01:02.019> investment<00:01:02.050> so

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
why it's worth the investment so

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.180 
why it's worth the investment so
hopefully<00:01:04.690> I<00:01:04.720> can<00:01:04.839> find<00:01:05.260> it<00:01:05.470> I<00:01:05.680> got<00:01:06.070> the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
hopefully I can find it I got the

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.360 
hopefully I can find it I got the
Harbinger<00:01:06.640> here<00:01:06.880> to<00:01:06.970> defend<00:01:07.150> me<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.890> my<00:01:09.100> jet

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
Harbinger here to defend me and my jet

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.270 
Harbinger here to defend me and my jet
pack<00:01:09.400> on<00:01:09.820> which<00:01:10.030> is<00:01:10.620> typically<00:01:11.620> hazardous<00:01:12.130> to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
pack on which is typically hazardous to

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.040 
pack on which is typically hazardous to
the<00:01:12.370> health<00:01:12.580> especially<00:01:13.420> when<00:01:13.750> you're<00:01:13.870> in<00:01:13.960> the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
the health especially when you're in the

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.610 
the health especially when you're in the
nether<00:01:15.060> certainly<00:01:16.060> doesn't<00:01:16.240> have<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:16.620> armor

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
nether certainly doesn't have the armor

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:26.090 
nether certainly doesn't have the armor
that<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:20.250> quantum<00:01:21.250> as<00:01:21.880> let's<00:01:22.600> see<00:01:23.460> so

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
that the quantum as let's see so

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.380 
that the quantum as let's see so
somewhere<00:01:27.100> in<00:01:27.159> here<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:29.140> I<00:01:29.200> don't<00:01:29.409> die<00:01:29.619> and<00:01:29.950> I

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
somewhere in here so I don't die and I

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.999 
somewhere in here so I don't die and I
hit<00:01:31.390> a<00:01:31.420> little<00:01:31.689> surprise<00:01:32.289> and<00:01:32.710> none<00:01:32.860> of<00:01:32.890> the

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
hit a little surprise and none of the

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.410 
hit a little surprise and none of the
other<00:01:33.130> Minecrafters<00:01:33.880> actually<00:01:34.240> know<00:01:34.390> about

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
other Minecrafters actually know about

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.350 
other Minecrafters actually know about
this<00:01:34.780> yet

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.470 

I<00:01:38.360> think<00:01:38.900> it's<00:01:39.050> over<00:01:39.260> here<00:01:40.960> but<00:01:42.100> part<00:01:43.100> of<00:01:43.160> our

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
I think it's over here but part of our

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.440 
I think it's over here but part of our
hv<00:01:44.480> there<00:01:45.050> it<00:01:45.140> is<00:01:45.230> oh<00:01:45.850> I'm<00:01:46.850> getting<00:01:47.120> attacked

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
hv there it is oh I'm getting attacked

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.440 
hv there it is oh I'm getting attacked
by<00:01:47.630> gas<00:01:48.130> this<00:01:49.130> is<00:01:49.280> bad<00:01:50.320> just<00:01:51.320> hide<00:01:51.560> in<00:01:51.740> here<00:01:52.450> so

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
by gas this is bad just hide in here so

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.190 
by gas this is bad just hide in here so
this<00:01:53.660> is<00:01:53.900> the<00:01:54.380> reason<00:01:54.740> why<00:01:55.690> that<00:01:56.690> remote<00:01:57.020> power

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
this is the reason why that remote power

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.430 
this is the reason why that remote power
core<00:01:57.560> is<00:01:57.800> so<00:01:58.190> awesome<00:01:58.720> because<00:01:59.720> this<00:02:00.020> thing<00:02:00.260> is

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
core is so awesome because this thing is

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.040 
core is so awesome because this thing is
a<00:02:00.530> quarry<00:02:01.280> BuildCraft<00:02:01.940> quarry<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.390> it's

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
a quarry BuildCraft quarry and it's

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.200 
a quarry BuildCraft quarry and it's
automatically<00:02:03.620> being<00:02:03.890> powered<00:02:04.370> in<00:02:04.550> the

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
automatically being powered in the

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.270 
automatically being powered in the
nether<00:02:05.450> by<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.380> thing<00:02:06.680> that's<00:02:06.860> in<00:02:06.980> the<00:02:07.070> over

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
nether by the thing that's in the over

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.910 
nether by the thing that's in the over
the<00:02:07.340> world<00:02:07.520> hang<00:02:08.420> on<00:02:09.190> hold<00:02:10.190> tight<00:02:10.550> folks<00:02:11.920> we

the world hang on hold tight folks we

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.760 
the world hang on hold tight folks we
are<00:02:13.300> there<00:02:14.300> under<00:02:14.660> attack<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.440> I<00:02:15.560> did<00:02:15.740> not

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
are there under attack and I did not

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.350 
are there under attack and I did not
bring<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.340> one<00:02:16.520> thing<00:02:16.730> that<00:02:16.760> can<00:02:17.030> kill<00:02:17.209> that

gassed<00:03:27.050> pretty<00:03:27.590> much<00:03:27.800> tore<00:03:28.489> up<00:03:29.050> power<00:03:30.050> supply

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
gassed pretty much tore up power supply

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.970 
gassed pretty much tore up power supply
but<00:03:30.970> there<00:03:31.970> you<00:03:32.090> go<00:03:32.500> if<00:03:33.500> you're<00:03:33.680> going<00:03:33.769> to<00:03:33.830> do

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
but there you go if you're going to do

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.850 
but there you go if you're going to do
this<00:03:34.070> in<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.310> future<00:03:34.459> I<00:03:34.640> would<00:03:34.820> recommend

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
this in the future I would recommend

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.979 
this in the future I would recommend
walling<00:03:36.860> it<00:03:36.980> off<00:03:37.130> this<00:03:37.670> break<00:03:38.630> in<00:03:38.810> the<00:03:38.959> chain

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
walling it off this break in the chain

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.890 
walling it off this break in the chain
here<00:03:39.530> isn't<00:03:39.769> going<00:03:39.980> to<00:03:40.040> make<00:03:40.130> a<00:03:40.190> difference<00:03:40.370> um

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
here isn't going to make a difference um

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.710 
here isn't going to make a difference um
it<00:03:41.900> just<00:03:42.140> needs<00:03:42.320> to<00:03:42.350> be<00:03:42.440> repowered<00:03:43.060> so<00:03:44.060> mining

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
it just needs to be repowered so mining

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.430 
it just needs to be repowered so mining
and<00:03:44.870> another<00:03:45.110> is<00:03:45.319> dangerous<00:03:45.950> but<00:03:46.750> it<00:03:47.750> doesn't

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
and another is dangerous but it doesn't

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.809 
and another is dangerous but it doesn't
destroy<00:03:48.980> your<00:03:49.190> world

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
destroy your world

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.420 
destroy your world
and<00:03:49.909> the<00:03:50.499> reason<00:03:51.499> that<00:03:51.680> I<00:03:51.799> did<00:03:52.040> this<00:03:52.189> actually

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
and the reason that I did this actually

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.160 
and the reason that I did this actually
the<00:03:52.790> reason<00:03:52.939> the<00:03:53.299> whole<00:03:53.450> reason<00:03:53.629> I<00:03:53.840> set<00:03:54.049> this

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
the reason the whole reason I set this

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.580 
the reason the whole reason I set this
up<00:03:54.379> is<00:03:54.560> because<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:56.079> my<00:03:57.079> goodness<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:59.780> hv

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
up is because the my goodness the hv

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.020 
up is because the my goodness the hv
array<00:04:01.219> facility<00:04:02.680> needs<00:04:03.680> a<00:04:03.980> ton<00:04:04.549> of<00:04:04.579> redstone

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
array facility needs a ton of redstone

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.009 
array facility needs a ton of redstone
and<00:04:05.469> nether<00:04:06.469> redstone<00:04:07.389> actually<00:04:08.389> compresses

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
and nether redstone actually compresses

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.479 
and nether redstone actually compresses
or<00:04:09.670> it<00:04:10.670> macerate<00:04:11.680> one<00:04:12.680> leather<00:04:12.950> red<00:04:13.189> stone

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
or it macerate one leather red stone

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.110 
or it macerate one leather red stone
gives<00:04:13.879> you<00:04:14.000> 24<00:04:14.689> another<00:04:15.310> one<00:04:16.310> nether<00:04:16.549> redstone

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
gives you 24 another one nether redstone

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.210 
gives you 24 another one nether redstone
gives<00:04:17.989> you<00:04:18.139> 24<00:04:18.739> redstone<00:04:19.870> so<00:04:20.870> a<00:04:21.259> stack<00:04:21.859> of<00:04:21.889> that

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
gives you 24 redstone so a stack of that

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.879 
gives you 24 redstone so a stack of that
can<00:04:22.669> keep<00:04:22.820> the<00:04:23.180> hv<00:04:23.840> facility<00:04:24.470> going<00:04:24.650> for

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
can keep the hv facility going for

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.070 
can keep the hv facility going for
decent<00:04:25.669> amount<00:04:25.880> of<00:04:25.940> time<00:04:26.150> so<00:04:26.419> that's<00:04:26.900> why<00:04:27.050> we

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
decent amount of time so that's why we

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.629 
decent amount of time so that's why we
have<00:04:27.320> this<00:04:27.530> i<00:04:27.740> went<00:04:27.979> right<00:04:28.160> up<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.460> top

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
have this i went right up to the top

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:32.710 
have this i went right up to the top
layer<00:04:29.110> i<00:04:30.190> think<00:04:31.190> it<00:04:31.340> maxes<00:04:31.729> out<00:04:31.849> around<00:04:32.120> 120

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
layer i think it maxes out around 120

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.180 
layer i think it maxes out around 120
something<00:04:32.960> like<00:04:33.050> that<00:04:33.259> so<00:04:33.500> I<00:04:33.530> just<00:04:33.740> went<00:04:33.949> all

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
something like that so I just went all

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.760 
something like that so I just went all
the<00:04:34.430> way<00:04:34.460> up<00:04:34.699> and<00:04:34.849> dug<00:04:35.570> three<00:04:36.169> corners<00:04:36.590> down

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
the way up and dug three corners down

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.100 
the way up and dug three corners down
about<00:04:37.130> five<00:04:37.370> blocks<00:04:37.580> but<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.360> landmarks

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
about five blocks but the landmarks

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.170 
about five blocks but the landmarks
worked<00:04:39.349> or<00:04:39.500> anything<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:40.220> I<00:04:40.610> just<00:04:40.759> put<00:04:40.970> one

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
worked or anything and I just put one

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.689 
worked or anything and I just put one
there<00:04:41.210> one<00:04:41.660> there<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:42.199> one<00:04:42.289> here<00:04:42.830> then<00:04:43.490> you

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
there one there and one here then you

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.249 
there one there and one here then you
trigger<00:04:44.000> that<00:04:44.210> one<00:04:44.449> then<00:04:44.630> it'll<00:04:44.810> build<00:04:45.139> a

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
trigger that one then it'll build a

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.379 
trigger that one then it'll build a
giant<00:04:45.500> square<00:04:45.800> you<00:04:46.400> plop<00:04:46.669> your<00:04:46.820> quarry<00:04:47.150> right

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
giant square you plop your quarry right

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.279 
giant square you plop your quarry right
here<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:48.560> then<00:04:49.330> set<00:04:50.330> up<00:04:50.360> the<00:04:50.479> phased

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
here and then set up the phased

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:54.490 
here and then set up the phased
conductive<00:04:51.860> pipe<00:04:52.070> to<00:04:52.750> draw<00:04:53.750> power<00:04:53.990> from<00:04:54.169> the

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
conductive pipe to draw power from the

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.920 
conductive pipe to draw power from the
power<00:04:54.530> core<00:04:54.979> that<00:04:55.070> we<00:04:55.190> just<00:04:55.310> looked<00:04:55.460> at<00:04:55.750> in<00:04:56.750> the

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
power core that we just looked at in the

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.110 
power core that we just looked at in the
overworld<00:04:57.289> which<00:04:57.650> is<00:04:57.830> held<00:04:58.460> in<00:04:58.669> place<00:04:58.699> by<00:04:58.909> a

overworld which is held in place by a
dimensional<00:04:59.720> anchor<00:04:59.990> to<00:05:00.169> make<00:05:00.320> sure<00:05:00.440> that<00:05:00.620> it

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
dimensional anchor to make sure that it

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.570 
dimensional anchor to make sure that it
stays<00:05:00.740> loaded<00:05:01.250> the<00:05:01.550> BuildCraft<00:05:02.740> quarry<00:05:03.740> is<00:05:04.009> it

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
stays loaded the BuildCraft quarry is it

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.460 
stays loaded the BuildCraft quarry is it
is<00:05:04.729> a<00:05:04.789> chunk<00:05:05.150> loader<00:05:05.360> by<00:05:05.570> itself<00:05:05.870> so<00:05:06.199> it'll

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
is a chunk loader by itself so it'll

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.779 
is a chunk loader by itself so it'll
keep<00:05:06.620> this<00:05:06.800> thing<00:05:06.979> running<00:05:07.190> even<00:05:07.490> when<00:05:07.669> I'm

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
keep this thing running even when I'm

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:09.909 
keep this thing running even when I'm
not<00:05:07.820> in<00:05:08.030> another<00:05:08.270> and<00:05:08.570> I<00:05:08.810> plan<00:05:09.050> SMP<00:05:09.650> or

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
not in another and I plan SMP or

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.899 
not in another and I plan SMP or
although<00:05:10.490> my<00:05:10.610> crafters<00:05:11.030> do<00:05:11.180> so<00:05:12.110> SMP<00:05:13.009> keeps<00:05:13.699> the

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:13.909 
although my crafters do so SMP keeps the

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:15.700 
although my crafters do so SMP keeps the
nether<00:05:14.120> loaded<00:05:14.479> all<00:05:14.570> the<00:05:14.599> time<00:05:14.870> so<00:05:15.139> basically

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
nether loaded all the time so basically

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.710 
nether loaded all the time so basically
this<00:05:15.770> is<00:05:15.860> a<00:05:15.949> great<00:05:16.190> way<00:05:16.310> to<00:05:16.370> do<00:05:16.580> some<00:05:16.820> mining<00:05:17.360> so

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
this is a great way to do some mining so

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.850 
this is a great way to do some mining so
hopefully<00:05:18.020> that<00:05:18.169> gives<00:05:18.289> you<00:05:18.380> a<00:05:18.470> little<00:05:18.590> bit<00:05:18.740> of

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
hopefully that gives you a little bit of

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.490 
hopefully that gives you a little bit of
a<00:05:18.949> sneak<00:05:19.190> preview<00:05:19.690> to<00:05:20.690> a<00:05:20.720> couple<00:05:20.990> of<00:05:21.080> projects

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
a sneak preview to a couple of projects

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.870 
a sneak preview to a couple of projects
we<00:05:21.620> walk<00:05:21.800> by<00:05:21.949> a<00:05:21.979> couple<00:05:22.310> of<00:05:22.370> projects<00:05:22.759> and

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
we walk by a couple of projects and

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.939 
we walk by a couple of projects and
we're<00:05:22.970> working<00:05:23.210> on<00:05:23.300> and<00:05:23.509> also<00:05:24.289> hopefully<00:05:24.620> this

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:24.949 
we're working on and also hopefully this

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.580 
we're working on and also hopefully this
helps<00:05:25.159> you<00:05:25.250> see<00:05:25.490> why<00:05:25.699> the<00:05:26.479> remote<00:05:27.020> parkour<00:05:27.500> is

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
helps you see why the remote parkour is

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.620 
helps you see why the remote parkour is
an<00:05:27.710> awesome<00:05:28.039> investment<00:05:28.340> one<00:05:29.090> last<00:05:29.270> thing<00:05:29.479> I

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
an awesome investment one last thing I

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.870 
an awesome investment one last thing I
realized<00:05:30.020> I<00:05:30.320> came<00:05:30.710> back<00:05:30.830> and<00:05:30.889> repaired<00:05:31.669> the

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
realized I came back and repaired the

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.450 
realized I came back and repaired the
damage<00:05:32.570> from<00:05:32.599> the<00:05:32.780> ghast<00:05:33.080> attack<00:05:33.500> I<00:05:33.770> realized

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
damage from the ghast attack I realized

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.980 
damage from the ghast attack I realized
that<00:05:34.580> I<00:05:34.610> didn't<00:05:34.880> explain<00:05:35.150> exactly<00:05:35.570> what<00:05:35.870> is

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
that I didn't explain exactly what is

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.159 
that I didn't explain exactly what is

this<00:05:53.360> diamond<00:05:53.840> thing<00:05:54.020> you're<00:05:54.169> going<00:05:54.289> to<00:05:54.380> if

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
this diamond thing you're going to if

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:55.570 
this diamond thing you're going to if
you're<00:05:54.710> going<00:05:54.800> to<00:05:54.860> do<00:05:55.009> this<00:05:55.130> in<00:05:55.190> the<00:05:55.400> nether

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
you're going to do this in the nether

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.399 
you're going to do this in the nether
you're<00:05:56.210> going<00:05:56.330> to<00:05:56.389> have<00:05:56.509> a<00:05:56.539> ton<00:05:56.810> of<00:05:56.840> netherrack

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:57.409 
you're going to have a ton of netherrack

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:00.010 
you're going to have a ton of netherrack
and<00:05:57.710> so<00:05:58.010> i<00:05:58.039> just<00:05:58.310> have<00:05:58.550> the<00:05:58.820> diamond<00:05:59.690> filter

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
and so i just have the diamond filter

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.620 
and so i just have the diamond filter
sending<00:06:00.469> all<00:06:00.710> netherrack<00:06:01.580> into<00:06:02.029> a<00:06:02.060> void<00:06:02.389> pipe

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
sending all netherrack into a void pipe

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.370 
sending all netherrack into a void pipe
and<00:06:02.900> then<00:06:03.020> anything

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
and then anything

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.020 
and then anything
else<00:06:03.500> will<00:06:03.710> get<00:06:03.800> split<00:06:04.100> between<00:06:04.250> these<00:06:04.610> the

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
else will get split between these the

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
else will get split between these the
reason<00:06:05.270> there's<00:06:05.420> two<00:06:05.600> is<00:06:05.750> because<00:06:05.900> we

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
reason there's two is because we

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.680 
reason there's two is because we
currently<00:06:06.380> have<00:06:06.880> I<00:06:08.110> think<00:06:09.110> it's<00:06:09.260> 5<00:06:09.850> 64<00:06:10.850> x<00:06:11.060> 64

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
currently have I think it's 5 64 x 64

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.900 
currently have I think it's 5 64 x 64
queries<00:06:12.170> that<00:06:12.350> are<00:06:12.860> running<00:06:13.310> at<00:06:13.640> the<00:06:13.760> same

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
queries that are running at the same

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.110 
queries that are running at the same
time<00:06:14.180> and<00:06:14.450> so<00:06:15.310> by<00:06:16.310> having<00:06:16.430> two<00:06:16.700> of<00:06:16.820> these<00:06:16.910> we

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 
time and so by having two of these we

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.820 
time and so by having two of these we
just<00:06:17.270> make<00:06:17.450> sure<00:06:17.630> that<00:06:18.140> things<00:06:18.410> don't<00:06:18.530> get

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
just make sure that things don't get

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.500 
just make sure that things don't get
backed<00:06:19.070> up<00:06:19.250> but<00:06:19.490> not<00:06:19.550> really<00:06:19.730> necessary<00:06:20.300> it's

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
backed up but not really necessary it's

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.750 
backed up but not really necessary it's
just<00:06:20.690> you<00:06:21.200> know<00:06:21.230> you<00:06:21.500> don't<00:06:21.680> want<00:06:21.860> stuff<00:06:22.730> to

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
just you know you don't want stuff to

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.930 
just you know you don't want stuff to
jam<00:06:23.150> when<00:06:23.360> you're<00:06:23.480> running<00:06:23.630> that<00:06:23.840> big<00:06:24.080> so<00:06:24.940> now

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
jam when you're running that big so now

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.820 
jam when you're running that big so now
this<00:06:26.330> things<00:06:26.600> off<00:06:26.840> right<00:06:27.020> now<00:06:27.200> but<00:06:27.230> I<00:06:27.440> repaired

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830 
this things off right now but I repaired

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.290 
this things off right now but I repaired
the<00:06:27.890> piping<00:06:28.340> so<00:06:28.520> if<00:06:28.700> we<00:06:28.820> go<00:06:28.970> ahead<00:06:29.030> and<00:06:29.150> we

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
the piping so if we go ahead and we

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.810 
the piping so if we go ahead and we
change<00:06:29.720> this<00:06:30.080> we're<00:06:30.920> going<00:06:31.010> to<00:06:31.070> connect<00:06:31.490> it<00:06:31.640> to

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
change this we're going to connect it to

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.920 
change this we're going to connect it to
our<00:06:33.190> send<00:06:34.190> and<00:06:34.340> receive<00:06:34.610> on<00:06:34.940> frequency<00:06:35.480> 100

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
our send and receive on frequency 100

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.770 
our send and receive on frequency 100
will<00:06:36.140> make<00:06:36.260> it<00:06:36.380> public<00:06:36.880> that's<00:06:37.880> our<00:06:38.150> remote

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
will make it public that's our remote

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.720 
will make it public that's our remote
core<00:06:39.050> frequency<00:06:39.860> and<00:06:40.040> you<00:06:40.130> can<00:06:40.250> see<00:06:40.400> the<00:06:40.520> power

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:40.730 
core frequency and you can see the power

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.370 
core frequency and you can see the power
is<00:06:40.820> already<00:06:41.030> flowing<00:06:41.240> through<00:06:41.540> and<00:06:41.750> this

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
is already flowing through and this

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.200 
is already flowing through and this
thing's<00:06:42.620> already<00:06:42.800> warm<00:06:43.130> back<00:06:43.400> to<00:06:43.580> life<00:06:43.760> so

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
thing's already warm back to life so

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.960 
thing's already warm back to life so
there<00:06:44.420> you<00:06:44.450> go<00:06:44.570> guests<00:06:45.230> gasp<00:06:46.130> attack<00:06:46.550> repaired

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970 
there you go guests gasp attack repaired

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.320 
there you go guests gasp attack repaired
and<00:06:47.270> we<00:06:48.220> should<00:06:49.220> be<00:06:49.400> able<00:06:49.490> to<00:06:49.670> see<00:06:49.850> there's<00:06:50.180> all
