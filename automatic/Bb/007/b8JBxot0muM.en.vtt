00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.060
 the argon that had it 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.880
 hello today I will be the little one why why because 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.759
 let's make a recipe with coconut if I 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.259
 I know you made me your bad guys but it's 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.300
 that today I am super excited to 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.550
 share with you this recipe that is 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.770
 super easy to make and that will sweeten 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.690
 all your desserts and your days of a 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.940
 much healthier way 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.190
 we will make a whipped cream of coconut if 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.650
 you have children you know they go crazy 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.260
 for the whipped cream or if you're a child 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.750
 even if it's from the heart maybe to what 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.240
 I mean, I want to do it 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.100
 in a healthier way and without 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.350
 lactose so that they are the ones that 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.930
 they also report on the part of this only 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.990
 they need three cream ingredients 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.470
 coconut a sweetener like sugar in 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:54.530
 powder and vanilla essence we 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.870
 creating your cream stay not then 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.910
 a good tip is to put the pool that they are going to 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.580
 use in the freezer for about 10 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.290
 minutes 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.390
 ah 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.580
 now let's pour all the coconut cream 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.560
 here if you can not find cream 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.390
 coconut can use coconut milk but 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.310
 they have to make sure that this is not 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.200
 light and have to leave it in the 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.900
 refrigerator overnight for 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.630
 separate the coconut water from the cream and 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.520
 I usually use the latter ok and now 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.140
 we add the sweetener this can be 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.550
 normal powdered sugar or even fear 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.870
 finally I love giving him a 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.870
 rich touch with vanilla essence 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.509
 the next thing is to beat your mixture to 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.159
 very fast speed of 3 to 6 minutes 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.159
 until they see it grow 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:59.480
 You can put it in hot chocolate 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:02.020
 expresas or blueberries on top of cakes or 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.020
 country 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.270
 or you can also eat it so it's 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.270
 delicious 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.610
