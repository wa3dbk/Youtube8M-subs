00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.679
 and everyone I hope you have 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.179
 well we're here today for a 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.340
 little video about gta 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.840
 it changes a little bit of everything I 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.609
 could do before on call of duty good 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.900
 I do multi gaming but you there that 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.430
 change a little bit and it feels good 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.960
 it makes me feel good to change 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.340
 game and we find ourselves 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.779
 today to evoke a few 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.429
 special vehicles that we can have 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.300
 when we have in his garage for example 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.910
 in gta 5 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.469
 a solo mode that can be in mode 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.450
 online but I think most of it 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.710
 must pay them so in mode according lsa 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.690
 for free so I'll go to them 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.190
 replicas laugh you talk about it a little 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.650
 little do you talk about where they come from 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.880
 at level 2 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.760
 notice the car they were 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.070
 inspired and I wanted to show pointed 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:58.110
 tell you all have the usual pc of gta 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:01:00.030
 5 go it's gone there and the jr I'm 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.180
 back and a girlfriend frankly to 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.700
 the identical of the nissan gt-r so a 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.770
 car is well well sporty than 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.150
 I think everyone who plays online 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.470
 do not know what it's like 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.310
 two cars with the clever stadiums that 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.080
 are free 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.460
 I believe a very good teen who are 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.990
 free and that's like a car 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.970
 sporty who is very powerful at the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.850
 base so a free cars that 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.460
 is frankly basin not having without 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.050
 disburse money only in line and then 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.190
 here in history we can see it 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.750
 also and it's a very car 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.610
 powerful is really nice to 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:37.320
 tuner we can do things really 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:39.180
 great note now we have 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.610
 the habit you have so it's this little 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.410
 buggy so beach buggy in reality 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.729
 finally if it's a little buggy like that 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.070
 can help me on the sand in our 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.780
 field frankly who are really 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.160
 friendly in the teeth in the 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.020
 backgrounds that are not on the road in 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
 everything that is everything and makes his buoy 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.330
 which is very fast 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.400
 I did not think it would be so 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.680
 quick than that but this buggy really 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.509
 super fast and it's very nice too 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:08.130
 killed his seven can make things very 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:10.679
 pretty particular which ahari so pulled 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.410
 of the memri so in real life 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.670
 so we find harry still at the 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.010
 end so I do not know it's done on purpose 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.790
 but I think for myself this little kit kat 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.860
 that makes me think of 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.579
 a passenger car when we go to see 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.469
 in the parks in the camps to do 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:29.079
 a safari here finally safari ben me that 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:32.980
 reminds me of his cover with the 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:34.299
 that with all with the hood with the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.659
 car itself she makes me think of 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.099
 that's so I think it's inspired from there 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.670
 and she's great in the desert or 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.670
 anywhere 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.790
 so now we have the vans price is 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.280
 a lot served for smoke on the water 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.829
 the property that franklyn can buy 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.079
 so I think it's 1.5 to 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.909
 her breasts a pickup truck that foams 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.470
 etc and beautiful graphics 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.470
 so I found that she looked like 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.540
 a lot to an old 4 4 finally 4 4 in 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.750
 an old truck rather the dodge 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.090
 ram van Beirendonck who were 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.010
 the 70s I believe if I'm from elsewhere 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.260
 I remember finally a year always 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.970
 a high rise to 5 cars 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.010
 so it looks like the form level 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.370
 I think it's taken from a more model 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.689
 recent 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.459
 but in any case at the form level 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:22.569
 we find in front of a 4 4 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:29.379
 it's still nice at the level of his 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:30.370
 graphics we now come to the 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.159
 roosevelt 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.859
 so it's an old car so 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.299
 presidential where I think without me 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.140
 to deceive that to be the one that 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.480
 roosevelt to 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.400
 since it is she bears her name 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.040
 so it's a car that makes me 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.380
 think of all that is old states 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.840
 united where there were still the 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.420
 horses the roads in 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.700
 andal that was written car knew a 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.260
 little western like 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.480
 in games like red dead redemption 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.510
 where we have downtown with these cars 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.440
 there so the first cars a little to 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.910
 case where was built as soon as they are 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.890
 really true of the mouth she is 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:12.280
 really nice and so it's original of 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:15.160
 having put him in the game at the level of 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.410
 special vehicle so albania alpha so 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.600
 which for me looks very nice shot and 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.419
 so to a class desk mother and so 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.130
 which is quite recent at the end of this 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.139
 year or last year where for me it 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.790
 would be a mercedes so it's a 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.290
 luxury car that is very nice 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.300
 still to drive and that is very 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.600
 fast so a sports car and 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.930
 luxury as here are the mercedes class c 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.930
 especially 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.900
 so with this car 2 kg stay on 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.760
 comes to the heart of the matter with the 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.490
 sports cars that are really 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.310
 mighty luxury for me the gester l 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.570
 together over a loading says you know 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.320
 that there is a lot of Asia that often 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.510
 universe chérèque 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.340
 it's something else 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.720
 - by 100 pushed me and the audi a8 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.030
 especially at the form level 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.650
 after maybe not at the front level 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.780
 but frankly it makes me think of 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.340
 the audi a8 and she is very very very 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.360
 powerful and frankly it's less safe 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.289
 than 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.860
 but like that they are free 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.780
 a story mode 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.189
 the special vehicles it's really 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.139
 cool because to drive her 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:20.919
 frankly be efficient and it's a 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.919
 super nice car 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.730
 we're coming now 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.790
 again a beautiful beautiful beautiful 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:33.460
 Luxury and sporty car taking off 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.810
 well so there tourism 1st like on 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.150
 every time I was 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.550
 turismo that's it was taken from a 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.070
 little ferrari so these increases in 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.650
 the occurrence and the ferrari that was 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.930
 copied so we car that is 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.930
 frankly very very nice school team 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.420
 with super fast movement 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.350
 so frankly nice to ride with me 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:06:02.710
 you advise us to try 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:06:05.110
 frankly what tomorrow we have the 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.530
 hunt them so this 4-4-2 city that was 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:11.050
 so inspired the 4 4 bentley or xp nine 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.000
 so bentley I did not know the pond 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.850
 wanted to discover that at the same time you 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.950
 are a mark certainly English I 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.170
 think I'm not on a game not tell of 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.330
 stupid in any case the 4 4 ​​he is the 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.650
 woman's mouth he's nice to 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.010
 tuner he's nice too 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:29.830
 and then pass a special vehicle that 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:32.380
 follows adam we can do a little cross 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.790
 successfully a 4 4 2 more city dweller when 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:40.110
 even 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:43.080
 and a little luxury here is the famous 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.300
 massacre at or aston martin vanquish 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.740
 like you want twenty-eight young people 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.860
 haven in realities in the real 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.180
 life of course so this car his wife 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.700
 it's obvious that it's an aston 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.690
 martin really has the casters 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.010
 characteristics and she is really 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.690
 still super rebel 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.030
 it looks a bit like James' car 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.420
 so bond to tunnel is really nice 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.070
 as well 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.810
 and she is very very fast and 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.200
 frankly it's really a very very 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.200
 good car
