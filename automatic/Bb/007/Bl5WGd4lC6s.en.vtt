philosophy<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.490> fifa<00:01:35.850> where<00:01:36.030> i<00:01:36.060> was

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
philosophy on fifa where i was

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.929 
philosophy on fifa where i was
essentially<00:01:36.750> get<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.350> two<00:01:37.619> goal<00:01:37.799> lead<00:01:37.939> like

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.330 
essentially get a two goal lead like
essentially<00:01:39.570> just<00:01:39.869> work<00:01:40.380> for<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.770> sweat<00:01:41.220> it

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
essentially just work for it sweat it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.480 
essentially just work for it sweat it
out<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.939> two<00:01:42.180> goal<00:01:42.390> lead<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:43.040> then<00:01:44.040> from

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
out get that two goal lead and then from

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.859 
out get that two goal lead and then from
that<00:01:44.520> point<00:01:44.700> forward<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.509> go<00:01:45.659> ahead<00:01:45.750> and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
that point forward you can go ahead and

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.389 
that point forward you can go ahead and
try<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.170> score<00:01:46.380> some<00:01:46.439> nice<00:01:46.710> goals<00:01:46.979> i<00:01:47.100> think<00:01:47.340> i

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
the line and cross it in no questions

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.660 
the line and cross it in no questions
asked<00:03:12.630> that<00:03:12.900> was<00:03:13.050> his<00:03:13.230> only<00:03:13.500> game<00:03:14.040> plan<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:14.400> i

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
asked that was his only game plan so i

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.430 
asked that was his only game plan so i
knew<00:03:14.880> that<00:03:14.910> i<00:03:15.090> was<00:03:15.270> probably<00:03:15.420> have<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.960> get<00:03:16.380> a

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
knew that i was probably have to get a

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.810 
knew that i was probably have to get a
little<00:03:16.560> bit<00:03:16.740> cross<00:03:16.920> happy<00:03:17.160> his<00:03:17.310> defense<00:03:17.700> was

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
little bit cross happy his defense was

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.090 
little bit cross happy his defense was
pretty<00:03:18.330> solid<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.960> be<00:03:19.080> fair<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.470> him<00:03:19.590> but<00:03:19.860> um

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
pretty solid to be fair to him but um

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.460 
pretty solid to be fair to him but um
his<00:03:20.670> attack<00:03:21.060> was<00:03:21.330> just<00:03:21.570> probably<00:03:21.840> one<00:03:22.320> of<00:03:22.350> the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
his attack was just probably one of the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.810 
his attack was just probably one of the
most<00:03:22.530> predictable<00:03:22.800> things<00:03:23.220> I've<00:03:23.370> ever<00:03:23.400> seen

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
most predictable things I've ever seen

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.220 
most predictable things I've ever seen
and<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.330> be<00:03:24.450> fair<00:03:24.690> he<00:03:24.900> was<00:03:24.990> a<00:03:25.020> pretty

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
and to be fair he was a pretty

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.840 
and to be fair he was a pretty
predictable<00:03:25.500> defender<00:03:26.130> as<00:03:26.280> well<00:03:26.490> he<00:03:26.700> thought

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
predictable defender as well he thought

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.490 
predictable defender as well he thought
every<00:03:27.240> time<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:27.630> was<00:03:27.780> gonna<00:03:27.870> turn<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.350> try

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
every time that I was gonna turn to try

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.710 
every time that I was gonna turn to try
to<00:03:28.560> get<00:03:28.710> a<00:03:28.740> fenestra<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.430> be<00:03:29.550> fair<00:03:29.850> i<00:03:30.030> turned<00:03:30.570> to

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
to get a fenestra to be fair i turned to

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.180 
to get a fenestra to be fair i turned to
try<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:30.930> get<00:03:31.110> a<00:03:31.140> finesse<00:03:31.440> shot<00:03:31.470> quite<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:31.980> few

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
try to get a finesse shot quite a few

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.640 
try to get a finesse shot quite a few
times<00:03:32.430> managed<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:33.090> take<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.600> lead<00:03:34.020> right<00:03:34.380> here

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
times managed to take a lead right here

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.320 
times managed to take a lead right here
and<00:03:34.800> I<00:03:34.830> thought<00:03:35.010> alright<00:03:35.250> finally<00:03:35.940> this<00:03:36.120> one's
