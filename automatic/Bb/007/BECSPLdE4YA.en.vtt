00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
one has been my favorite just because it

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.140 
one has been my favorite just because it
blends<00:04:48.350> in<00:04:48.470> really<00:04:48.680> well<00:04:48.979> into<00:04:49.400> my<00:04:49.430> hair<00:04:49.910> and

blends in really well into my hair and

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.850 
blends in really well into my hair and
it<00:04:50.240> doesn't<00:04:50.270> leave<00:04:50.660> a<00:04:50.690> nasty<00:04:51.020> gross<00:04:51.470> feeling

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860

really<00:04:58.400> nice<00:04:58.610> and<00:04:58.850> does<00:04:58.970> a<00:04:59.000> great<00:04:59.360> job<00:04:59.479> and

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
last month when I was grocery shopping I

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.190 
last month when I was grocery shopping I
was<00:05:07.130> looking<00:05:07.460> for<00:05:07.760> a<00:05:07.790> new<00:05:08.180> type<00:05:08.450> of<00:05:08.480> applesauce

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
was looking for a new type of applesauce

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.620 
was looking for a new type of applesauce
to<00:05:09.410> try<00:05:09.590> and<00:05:09.830> I<00:05:09.920> came<00:05:10.160> across<00:05:10.400> these<00:05:10.940> they're

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
to try and I came across these they're

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.510 
to try and I came across these they're
gogo<00:05:12.080> squeeZ<00:05:12.440> pouches<00:05:12.920> and<00:05:12.950> I've<00:05:13.220> seen<00:05:13.370> these

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
gogo squeeZ pouches and I've seen these

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.010 
gogo squeeZ pouches and I've seen these
before<00:05:13.940> and<00:05:13.970> I<00:05:14.150> always<00:05:14.240> think<00:05:14.600> wow<00:05:14.810> they're

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
before and I always think wow they're

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.630 
before and I always think wow they're
kind<00:05:15.320> of<00:05:15.410> expensive<00:05:15.980> and<00:05:16.160> they're<00:05:16.250> really

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.630 
kind of expensive and they're really
probably<00:05:17.240> not<00:05:17.960> worth<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.560> money<00:05:18.770> but<00:05:19.430> these
