if<00:00:07.490> you<00:00:07.610> found<00:00:07.760> that<00:00:07.940> your<00:00:08.060> programming<00:00:08.570> has

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:08.690 
if you found that your programming has

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.810 
if you found that your programming has
failed<00:00:08.990> on<00:00:09.230> the<00:00:09.380> valve<00:00:09.620> you<00:00:09.980> can<00:00:10.310> also<00:00:10.490> try

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
failed on the valve you can also try

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.670 
failed on the valve you can also try
doing<00:00:11.059> it<00:00:11.270> with<00:00:11.510> the<00:00:11.750> manual<00:00:12.200> mode<00:00:12.380> on<00:00:12.590> the

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:12.680 
doing it with the manual mode on the

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.620 
doing it with the manual mode on the
back<00:00:12.860> of<00:00:13.130> the<00:00:13.460> controller<00:00:14.000> or<00:00:14.240> bottom

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
back of the controller or bottom

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:23.440 
back of the controller or bottom
depending<00:00:14.780> on<00:00:15.050> how<00:00:15.170> they<00:00:15.320> mounted<00:00:15.769> the<00:00:16.670> valves

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.450 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.900 

and<00:00:24.110> there's<00:00:24.320> a<00:00:24.380> switch<00:00:24.620> on<00:00:24.770> back<00:00:25.040> on<00:00:25.400> one

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
and there's a switch on back on one

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.630 
and there's a switch on back on one
which<00:00:26.240> is<00:00:26.390> usually<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:26.900> program<00:00:27.619> office<00:00:28.490> in

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
which is usually the program office in

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.859 
which is usually the program office in
the<00:00:28.730> middle<00:00:29.000> and<00:00:29.180> this<00:00:29.240> is<00:00:29.360> where<00:00:29.510> you<00:00:29.600> want<00:00:29.750> to

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
the middle and this is where you want to

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.500 
the middle and this is where you want to
switch<00:00:30.140> when<00:00:30.950> you<00:00:30.980> do<00:00:31.220> the<00:00:31.400> manual<00:00:32.090> mode<00:00:32.239> with

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:32.510 
switch when you do the manual mode with

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.580 
switch when you do the manual mode with
the<00:00:32.830> knob<00:00:33.830> on<00:00:34.070> top<00:00:34.100> and<00:00:34.760> then<00:00:35.510> there's<00:00:35.750> on<00:00:36.050> 2

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
the knob on top and then there's on 2

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.440 
the knob on top and then there's on 2
which<00:00:36.890> is<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:37.130> manual<00:00:37.460> mode<00:00:37.640> where<00:00:38.120> it<00:00:38.239> should

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
which is the manual mode where it should

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.590 
which is the manual mode where it should
turn<00:00:38.630> it<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:39.080> opposite<00:00:39.470> direction<00:00:40.180> if<00:00:41.180> I<00:00:41.300> flip

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
turn it the opposite direction if I flip

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.790 
turn it the opposite direction if I flip
that<00:00:41.750> down<00:00:41.809> you<00:00:42.110> can<00:00:42.170> see<00:00:42.320> the<00:00:42.350> valve<00:00:42.620> is

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
that down you can see the valve is

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.000 
that down you can see the valve is
actually<00:00:43.100> turning<00:00:43.309> now<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:45.350> so<00:00:45.470> on<00:00:45.620> -<00:00:45.830> usually

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
actually turning now and so on - usually

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.760 
actually turning now and so on - usually
is<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:46.699> manual<00:00:47.059> override<00:00:47.330> load<00:00:47.780> it'll<00:00:48.590> just

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
is the manual override load it'll just

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.080 
is the manual override load it'll just
turn<00:00:48.980> the<00:00:49.160> switch<00:00:49.190> in<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.790> opposite

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
turn the switch in the opposite

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.520 
turn the switch in the opposite
direction<00:00:50.210> that<00:00:50.510> I<00:00:50.600> set<00:00:50.870> so<00:00:51.140> if<00:00:51.199> it<00:00:51.320> breaks

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
direction that I set so if it breaks

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.460 
direction that I set so if it breaks
down<00:00:51.739> on<00:00:52.220> this<00:00:53.090> side<00:00:53.150> you<00:00:53.750> put<00:00:53.960> that<00:00:54.110> switch

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
down on this side you put that switch

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.600 
down on this side you put that switch
should<00:00:54.769> reverse<00:00:55.220> it

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
should reverse it

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.040 
should reverse it
sometimes<00:00:56.150> you'll<00:00:56.330> flip<00:00:56.449> these<00:00:56.629> switches<00:00:56.960> on

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
sometimes you'll flip these switches on

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.049 
sometimes you'll flip these switches on
accident<00:00:57.589> and<00:00:57.769> you<00:00:58.400> definitely<00:00:58.670> wanna<00:00:58.970> go

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
accident and you definitely wanna go

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.219 
accident and you definitely wanna go
back<00:00:59.210> in<00:00:59.360> your<00:00:59.420> backyard<00:00:59.600> and<00:00:59.870> turn<00:01:00.080> it<00:01:00.199> back

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
back in your backyard and turn it back

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.759 
back in your backyard and turn it back
to<00:01:00.379> auto<00:01:00.710> one<00:01:01.129> on<00:01:01.460> one<00:01:02.360> and<00:01:03.350> I'll<00:01:03.470> turn<00:01:03.650> the

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
to auto one on one and I'll turn the

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.390 
to auto one on one and I'll turn the
switch<00:01:03.979> back<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:05.239> valve<00:01:05.420> back<00:01:05.690> on<00:01:05.900> me<00:01:06.310> so<00:01:07.310> if

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
switch back the valve back on me so if

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.800 
switch back the valve back on me so if
you<00:01:07.460> find<00:01:07.610> this<00:01:07.820> is<00:01:07.970> not<00:01:08.150> working<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:08.720> the

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
you find this is not working and the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.500 
you find this is not working and the
motors<00:01:09.170> definitely<00:01:09.770> dead<00:01:10.040> or<00:01:10.760> the<00:01:11.090> gears<00:01:11.330> are

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
motors definitely dead or the gears are

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.430 
motors definitely dead or the gears are
not<00:01:11.659> aligned<00:01:12.110> properly<00:01:12.320> go<00:01:12.740> ahead<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.010> do<00:01:13.100> the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
not aligned properly go ahead and do the

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.289 
not aligned properly go ahead and do the
trick<00:01:15.440> with<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.650> nut<00:01:15.830> on<00:01:15.979> top<00:01:16.010> and<00:01:16.610> that

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
trick with the nut on top and that

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:18.550 
trick with the nut on top and that
should<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:17.900> should<00:01:17.990> be<00:01:18.140> able<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.320> turn<00:01:18.440> the

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
should you should be able to turn the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.789 
should you should be able to turn the
valve<00:01:18.740> that<00:01:18.950> way<00:01:19.190> until<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:19.610> get<00:01:19.790> it<00:01:19.880> fixed

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 
valve that way until you get it fixed

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.960 
valve that way until you get it fixed
you<00:01:21.799> want<00:01:21.979> to<00:01:22.040> make<00:01:22.159> them<00:01:22.280> system<00:01:22.670> is<00:01:22.790> off

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
you want to make them system is off

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.480 
you want to make them system is off
before<00:01:23.510> you<00:01:23.770> play<00:01:24.770> with<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.010> switches<00:01:25.340> in<00:01:25.430> the

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
before you play with the switches in the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.109 
before you play with the switches in the
back<00:01:25.670> of<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:25.970> thing

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
back of the thing

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.149 
back of the thing
we're<00:01:28.990> going<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.229> turn<00:01:29.380> everything<00:01:29.500> off<00:01:29.799> first

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
we're going to turn everything off first

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.770 
we're going to turn everything off first
then<00:01:30.430> you<00:01:30.520> can<00:01:30.670> actually<00:01:30.820> move<00:01:31.180> the<00:01:31.240> switches

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
then you can actually move the switches

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.609 
then you can actually move the switches
and<00:01:32.369> do<00:01:33.369> the<00:01:33.520> manual<00:01:33.850> override<00:01:34.090> also<00:01:34.689> with<00:01:35.560> the

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
and do the manual override also with the

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:42.569 
and do the manual override also with the
system<00:01:35.920> off

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.700 

if<00:01:43.180> your<00:01:43.420> jandi<00:01:44.350> actuator<00:01:45.009> valve<00:01:46.109> fails<00:01:47.109> you

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
if your jandi actuator valve fails you

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.060 
if your jandi actuator valve fails you
can<00:01:47.829> do<00:01:47.950> is<00:01:48.100> connection<00:01:48.880> loosen<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.270> nut<00:01:49.479> a

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
can do is connection loosen the nut a

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.789 
can do is connection loosen the nut a
little<00:01:51.070> bit<00:01:51.250> and<00:01:51.490> press<00:01:51.820> down<00:01:52.149> really<00:01:52.420> hard

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
little bit and press down really hard

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.679 
little bit and press down really hard
and<00:01:53.799> then<00:01:53.979> he<00:01:54.009> activates<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.850> motor<00:01:55.000> you<00:01:55.479> can

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
and then he activates the motor you can

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.109 
and then he activates the motor you can
actually<00:01:55.810> turn<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.259> handle<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:58.030> the

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
actually turn the handle in the

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:07.740 
actually turn the handle in the
direction<00:01:58.390> now<00:01:59.069> deactivating<00:02:00.069> it<00:02:00.159> that<00:02:00.340> way

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
if the manual override command we

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.390 
if the manual override command we
overwrite<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.570> value

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
overwrite the value

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.209 
overwrite the value
three<00:02:12.400> turns<00:02:13.209> or<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:13.719> you<00:02:14.620> want<00:02:14.799> to<00:02:14.859> push<00:02:15.010> down

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:15.219 
three turns or so you want to push down

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:17.129 
three turns or so you want to push down

there's<00:02:38.810> no<00:02:38.930> manual<00:02:39.110> override<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.040> if<00:02:40.130> you<00:02:40.250> go

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
there's no manual override so if you go

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.000 
there's no manual override so if you go

push down nothing happens so it's the
