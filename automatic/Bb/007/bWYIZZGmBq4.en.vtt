00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.579 

what<00:00:06.330> is<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.480> moment<00:00:06.629> for<00:00:06.839> you<00:00:07.049> that<00:00:07.290> that's

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
what is the moment for you that that's

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.009 
what is the moment for you that that's
when<00:00:08.069> you're<00:00:08.189> working<00:00:08.429> on<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.550> song<00:00:08.900> that's<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
when you're working on a song that's the

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.110 
when you're working on a song that's the
moment<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:10.349> you<00:00:10.440> know<00:00:11.219> now<00:00:11.429> now<00:00:11.790> we<00:00:11.849> can

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
moment that you know now now we can

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.270 
moment that you know now now we can
share<00:00:12.389> what<00:00:12.660> we've<00:00:12.809> done<00:00:13.070> it's<00:00:14.070> quite

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
share what we've done it's quite

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.620 
share what we've done it's quite
unspoken<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:15.000> think<00:00:15.179> it's<00:00:15.299> just<00:00:15.480> like<00:00:15.570> a

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
unspoken I think it's just like a

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.750 
unspoken I think it's just like a
feeling<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.890> kind<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.160> get<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.550> point

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
feeling you kind of get to that point

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.550 
feeling you kind of get to that point
with<00:00:18.359> anything<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:18.840> guess<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.289> know<00:00:19.410> it's

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
with anything I guess and you know it's

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.210 
with anything I guess and you know it's
kind<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:19.949> feels<00:00:20.250> finished<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:21.000> it's

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
kind of this feels finished and it's

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.650 
kind of this feels finished and it's
it's<00:00:23.220> definitely<00:00:23.580> very<00:00:23.670> satisfying<00:00:24.180> place<00:00:24.449> to

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
it's definitely very satisfying place to

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.480 
it's definitely very satisfying place to
reach<00:00:24.810> but<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.140> think<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:25.470> have<00:00:25.800> taken<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.340> long

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
reach but I think we have taken a long

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.800 
reach but I think we have taken a long
time<00:00:26.519> with<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.910> few<00:00:27.090> songs<00:00:27.269> they've<00:00:27.510> had<00:00:27.660> lots

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
time with a few songs they've had lots

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.050 
time with a few songs they've had lots
of<00:00:27.900> different<00:00:28.019> versions<00:00:28.400> we<00:00:29.400> kind<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.880> do<00:00:30.029> a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
of different versions we kind of do a

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.910 
of different versions we kind of do a
lot<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.269> talking<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:30.990> we'll<00:00:31.320> we'll<00:00:31.650> play

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
lot of talking so we'll we'll play

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.709 
lot of talking so we'll we'll play
through<00:00:32.160> one<00:00:32.340> version<00:00:32.759> maybe<00:00:33.510> you're

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
through one version maybe you're

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.810 
through one version maybe you're
recording<00:00:34.110> even<00:00:34.469> just<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:34.829> an<00:00:34.920> iPhone<00:00:35.309> just<00:00:35.640> to

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
recording even just on an iPhone just to

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.880 
recording even just on an iPhone just to
get<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.510> rim<00:00:36.780> recording<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.440> then<00:00:37.530> we<00:00:37.649> listen

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
get a rim recording and then we listen

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.410 
get a rim recording and then we listen
back<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.309> sort<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.640> talk<00:00:38.850> about<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.120> and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
back to it and sort of talk about it and

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.970 
back to it and sort of talk about it and
think<00:00:39.540> oh<00:00:39.719> if<00:00:39.870> we<00:00:40.020> get<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.290> way<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.649> way<00:00:40.800> and

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
think oh if we get this way that way and

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.650 
think oh if we get this way that way and
then<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.610> gradually<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:42.180> comes<00:00:42.390> through<00:00:42.480> it

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
then it gradually just comes through it

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.130 
then it gradually just comes through it
a<00:00:42.690> natural<00:00:43.140> feeling<00:00:43.350> where<00:00:43.950> it's<00:00:44.219> um<00:00:45.140> it's

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
a natural feeling where it's um it's

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.770 
a natural feeling where it's um it's
ready<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.340> then<00:00:47.550> that's<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.239> only<00:00:48.570> time

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
ready and and then that's the only time

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.450 
ready and and then that's the only time
we<00:00:48.870> start<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.230> would<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.559> able<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.980> share<00:00:50.280> it

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
we start to would be able to share it

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.729 
we start to would be able to share it
where<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> things<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.840> approach

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
where the things that you approach

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.170 
where the things that you approach
differently<00:00:53.250> maybe<00:00:53.399> as<00:00:53.610> opposed<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.969> your

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
differently maybe as opposed to your

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:05.719 
differently maybe as opposed to your
previous<00:00:54.809> one<00:00:56.750> changes<00:00:57.750> I<00:01:00.379> think<00:01:01.379> me<00:01:03.949> I<00:01:04.949> don't

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
previous one changes I think me I don't

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.230 
previous one changes I think me I don't
know<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.330> there<00:01:06.479> wasn't<00:01:06.750> much<00:01:06.900> like

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
know that there wasn't much like

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.940 
know that there wasn't much like
discussion<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.330> suppose<00:01:09.659> about<00:01:10.530> what<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.860> were

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
discussion I suppose about what we were

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.270 
discussion I suppose about what we were
trying<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.220> get<00:01:11.400> get<00:01:11.880> across<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.740> knew<00:01:14.220> I

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
trying to get get across and I knew I

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.380 
trying to get get across and I knew I
felt<00:01:14.580> more<00:01:14.790> confident<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:16.170> any<00:01:16.350> new<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:17.390> think

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
felt more confident and any new I think

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.140 
felt more confident and any new I think
we've<00:01:18.630> just<00:01:18.840> grown<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.470> we've<00:01:19.740> become<00:01:20.150> we've

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
we've just grown and we've become we've

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.249 
we've just grown and we've become we've
become<00:01:21.360> better<00:01:21.720> at<00:01:21.930> playing<00:01:22.140> our<00:01:22.229> instruments

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
become better at playing our instruments

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.969 
become better at playing our instruments
and<00:01:22.950> Jamie<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.820> becoming<00:01:24.240> better<00:01:24.330> producer<00:01:25.020> so

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
and Jamie is becoming better producer so

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.740 
and Jamie is becoming better producer so
technically<00:01:26.549> there<00:01:26.759> are<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.939> lot<00:01:27.119> more<00:01:27.150> sounds

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
technically there are a lot more sounds

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.219 
technically there are a lot more sounds
open<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.350> us<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.970> lot<00:01:30.119> more<00:01:30.150> things<00:01:31.079> we

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
open to us and and a lot more things we

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.690 
open to us and and a lot more things we
could<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.860> think<00:01:31.920> what<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:32.400> had<00:01:32.579> to

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
could do and I think what we had to

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.120 
could do and I think what we had to
learn<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:34.079> keep<00:01:34.259> keep<00:01:35.009> it

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
learn to do is to keep keep it

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.060 
learn to do is to keep keep it
restrained<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.420> think<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.680> know<00:01:37.829> we

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
restrained and I think that you know we

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.560 
restrained and I think that you know we
could<00:01:38.280> have<00:01:38.310> just<00:01:38.549> put<00:01:38.790> everything<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.329> and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
could have just put everything in and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.260 
could have just put everything in and
played<00:01:40.290> these<00:01:40.829> more<00:01:41.340> complex<00:01:41.729> things<00:01:41.970> we<00:01:42.119> can

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
played these more complex things we can

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.880 
played these more complex things we can
do<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> think<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:43.350> was<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.530> lesson<00:01:43.710> in

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
do but I think it was a lesson in

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.740 
do but I think it was a lesson in
restraint<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.850> I'm<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.329> kind<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.570> I

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
restraint and and I'm just kind of I

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.190 
restraint and and I'm just kind of I
really<00:01:45.930> enjoyed<00:01:47.030> you<00:01:48.030> know<00:01:48.149> holding<00:01:48.810> back<00:01:49.020> in

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
really enjoyed you know holding back in

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.170 
really enjoyed you know holding back in
a<00:01:49.259> way<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.799> we<00:01:49.950> know<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.640> hit<00:01:50.970> like

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
a way like it we know and hit like

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.520 
a way like it we know and hit like
hearing<00:01:51.570> things<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.960> being<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.290> what<00:01:52.439> does

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
hearing things and being that what does

the actual album there's so much emotion
and<00:05:26.120> when<00:05:26.330> I<00:05:26.360> was<00:05:26.539> doing<00:05:26.750> he<00:05:26.900> was<00:05:26.960> recording<00:05:27.620> it

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.339 
and when I was doing he was recording it
it's<00:05:27.979> um<00:05:28.220> it<00:05:29.120> was<00:05:29.240> definitely<00:05:29.270> you<00:05:30.050> know<00:05:30.169> I

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
it's um it was definitely you know I

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:32.890 
it's um it was definitely you know I
felt<00:05:30.710> very<00:05:30.950> moved<00:05:31.520> and<00:05:31.910> I<00:05:31.970> yeah<00:05:32.539> I<00:05:32.570> thought<00:05:32.750> it

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
felt very moved and I yeah I thought it

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.740 
felt very moved and I yeah I thought it
was<00:05:33.200> great<00:05:33.320> what<00:05:33.770> is<00:05:33.800> it<00:05:33.950> about<00:05:34.330> what<00:05:35.330> did<00:05:35.479> what

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
was great what is it about what did what

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.680 
was great what is it about what did what
it's<00:05:35.870> about<00:05:35.960> is<00:05:36.320> what<00:05:36.800> is<00:05:36.919> it<00:05:37.010> about<00:05:37.389> well<00:05:38.389> I

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
it's about is what is it about well I

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.810 
it's about is what is it about well I
think<00:05:39.349> the<00:05:39.650> thing<00:05:39.830> is<00:05:39.860> that<00:05:39.979> we<00:05:40.250> always<00:05:40.430> say<00:05:40.669> is

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
think the thing is that we always say is

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.820 
think the thing is that we always say is
that<00:05:41.030> we<00:05:41.150> just<00:05:41.180> don't<00:05:41.539> like<00:05:41.599> to<00:05:41.810> explain<00:05:42.200> the

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
that we just don't like to explain the

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.370 
that we just don't like to explain the
songs<00:05:43.070> but<00:05:43.370> I<00:05:43.430> think<00:05:43.639> that's<00:05:43.789> more<00:05:43.880> of<00:05:44.030> like<00:05:44.120> a

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
songs but I think that's more of like a

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.050 
songs but I think that's more of like a
it's<00:05:45.380> like<00:05:45.440> a<00:05:45.530> gift<00:05:45.830> if<00:05:46.130> you<00:05:46.190> want<00:05:46.340> no<00:05:46.580> I'd

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
it's like a gift if you want no I'd

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.240 
it's like a gift if you want no I'd
rather<00:05:47.210> not<00:05:47.510> explain<00:05:47.870> it<00:05:47.960> because<00:05:48.229> then<00:05:48.590> when

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
rather not explain it because then when
