00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.900
 first you put desktop that you 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.760
 best fits your plastic and 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.439
 Although it takes the material twice that 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.230
 you have two parts then also 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.540
 are equal and then we show with 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.869
 the tailor chalk or whatever you like 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:33.090
 once wanted to use outside and outside 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.370
 Although we think of nina addition so 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.410
 centimeters me because we have it later 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.480
 have to go around and then just 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.460
 once out still around and up here because 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.770
 just make a mark that we 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.270
 because here in straight draw because 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.760
 we're more of a strapless top make only 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.130
 the outlines are now recorded and 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.230
 if you have such a loop around it 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.360
 wanted to make that you can bind it 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.850
 then you have to do something more up here 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.820
 almost give it to you later 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.439
 can work around the thread of the loop 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.020
 single can if you decide 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.520
 have what we want to do then just 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.509
 with a scissors along the outside 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.220
 Cut out the parts 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.740
 cut out now and I have 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.690
 now here on a long side with 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.180
 Need everything pinned that we have here 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.030
 can take along and pay attention 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.100
 we insist that we are down and up 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.750
 leave the two ends to the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.180
 There was almost a return later 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.850
 to be able to 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:36.180
 and then no we just right here 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.430
 along and I use this 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.770
 that's a zigzag and straight 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.299
 you in one but if your sewing machine 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.549
 who does not have then invites you outside 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.799
 along with zig zag and then again 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.040
 a straight after, nice and straight 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.360
 So see her here 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.659
 zigzag and then back here 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.729
 once a straight line 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.460
 that 's the result today 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.799
 in this rather likely at the beginning and on 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.409
 Do not forget to end that supply 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.729
 it can not work afterwards 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.770
 and he does exactly the same to her 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.810
 other long-term if 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.439
 Both sides are nice 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.080
 then we choose the hem below and that 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:19.709
 I do that so that always 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.609
 twice, so once and then 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.710
 again then it looks like it 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.930
 beautiful outside it looks like so 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.730
 before not all strengthen the good 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.640
 is also good that helps us too 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.990
 before ironing and then I take 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.210
 that's with a gossip I'm along 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.890
 you have to do it under renate 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.710
 finally decide what up here 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.780
 wanted to make a possibility is the 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.560
 Following the loop I go to too 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.330
 will do 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.340
 but there are several, of course 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.800
 possibilities you could of course 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.860
 carrier it take from the same cloth 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.790
 or for example so elastic one 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.260
 a few jesse and with the sequins 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.620
 band you can of course here too 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.700
 go up along so as a tip that pulls 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.740
 then a bit too 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.020
 together and that keeps it nice 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.190
 well maybe you have your own 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.660
 good ideas 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.340
 I would be glad if you the 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.870
 maybe write in the comments 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.710
 can then I could also times 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.420
 try out 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.270
 but we are definitely doing that now 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.800
 Variation with the loop as you see 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.470
 I have the following addition 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.180
 put that back on the 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.540
 front side can see 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.680
 visit the hose goes that me 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.240
 here then half of the fabric 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.890
 make a little nick 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.410
 through the then later the loop 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.140
 is drawn so I measured here 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:46.920
 that it is a total of 35 centimeters long 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:49.440
 and at 17 5 I'm doing one here 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.500
 small circle draws the cutting edge 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.730
 I get out and then capture something that 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.620
 it looks a little nicer 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.610
 I'll show you that afterwards everything is ready 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.900
 is the hole looks like now with me 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.520
 and I decided to 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.080
 not to take outside because that with 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.710
 my black thread just not good 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.960
 would fit and with you you have to 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.190
 that look pretty much the same now 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.200
 I 'm just for the size 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.430
 decided as you can see how two 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.670
 finger about 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.460
 and I think bastian thread through that 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:23.160
 should keep whole 

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:25.320
 and now we're stuck in like before 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.370
 hose back out once around 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.980
 as was done here and then 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.230
 Let's see you again soon 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.450
 put that family out and that 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.530
 on both sides 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.490
 and not with one again 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.550
 I gossip 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.380
 here along beautiful outside also here 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.080
 about it which of course is also good 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.030
 stops and who disturbs the mouth here 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.690
 She can also just go along here 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.009
 to take 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.449
 Just be careful if I have the 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.069
 First of all , what else 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:58.259
 of course not the hose afterwards 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:05:00.720
 you can see more through her that mine 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:02.310
 wendel for the loop and if you 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.460
 want to know how I did that 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.050
 So I have the one piece fabric 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.110
 taken if black twice 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.009
 Big was like that and just got it 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.139
 Sewn together in the half 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.169
 worked together and here once 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:18.659
 and long net off and on the ends have 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.729
 I just served home plugged and 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:23.159
 have it too once sewn black 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.289
 panis you can not see it and that 

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:26.759
 So, now, my walls are where I am 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.099
 now right next to another 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.169
 then secure people and then him 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.830
 through the hole in fabric by two times 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.539
 around it 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.060
 because then you are out again and already 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:38.280
 I can handle the loop so that's it 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.190
 the end result is a sweet pot with 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.610
 Grind here like the age I do 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:47.219
 have already done and I hope you 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.990
 have had a lot of fun watching and 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:51.030
 I hope you succeed as well 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.590
 if now I 'm doing right now 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.590
 try it on then I'm looking forward to it
