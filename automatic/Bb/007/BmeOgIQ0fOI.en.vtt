the<00:00:30.539> first<00:00:30.779> one<00:00:30.869> week<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.109> here's<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.470> USB<00:00:31.890> 3.0

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
the first one week I here's the USB 3.0

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.490 
the first one week I here's the USB 3.0
hub<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> portable<00:00:33.899> hub<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.380> can

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
hub so this is a portable hub so you can

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.840 
hub so this is a portable hub so you can
take<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:34.770> around<00:00:35.070> with<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.340> maybe<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.700> got

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
take this around with you maybe you got

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.200 
take this around with you maybe you got
a<00:00:35.880> laptop<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.989> got<00:00:37.170> various<00:00:37.950> USB<00:00:38.730> devices

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
a laptop and you got various USB devices

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.299 
a laptop and you got various USB devices
this<00:00:39.989> would<00:00:40.200> become<00:00:40.260> very<00:00:40.620> useful<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.129> for

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
this would become very useful so for

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.490 
this would become very useful so for
example<00:00:41.370> myself<00:00:42.090> I've<00:00:42.329> got<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.719> macbook<00:00:43.140> pro

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
example myself I've got a macbook pro

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.380 
example myself I've got a macbook pro
we've<00:00:43.710> limited<00:00:43.920> amount<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.430> space<00:00:44.489> when<00:00:45.270> it

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
we've limited amount of space when it

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.840 
we've limited amount of space when it
comes<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.629> USB<00:00:45.899> ports<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.890> this<00:00:47.610> would<00:00:47.730> become

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
comes to USB ports so this would become

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.180 
comes to USB ports so this would become
very<00:00:48.210> useful<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:49.410> stickler<00:00:49.890> collects

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
very useful and a stickler collects

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.220 
very useful and a stickler collects
about<00:00:50.430> ace<00:00:50.610> USB<00:00:51.059> 3.0<00:00:51.539> which<00:00:51.750> means<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.110> can

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
about ace USB 3.0 which means you can

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.160 
about ace USB 3.0 which means you can
transfer<00:00:52.710> data<00:00:52.949> very<00:00:53.850> quickly<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.750> here<00:00:55.079> we

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
transfer data very quickly so here we

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.080 
transfer data very quickly so here we
are<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.500> you've<00:00:55.649> got<00:00:55.680> your<00:00:55.800> blue<00:00:56.090> plastic

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
are so you've got your blue plastic

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.020 
are so you've got your blue plastic
there<00:00:57.449> indicator<00:00:58.020> least<00:00:58.289> USB<00:00:58.800> 3.0<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.910> you've

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
there indicator least USB 3.0 so you've

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.549 
there indicator least USB 3.0 so you've
got<00:01:00.120> three<00:01:00.329> ports<00:01:00.660> there<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.079> you've<00:01:01.440> got<00:01:01.500> one

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
got three ports there and you've got one

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.560 
got three ports there and you've got one
extra<00:01:02.039> port<00:01:02.340> there<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.090> four<00:01:03.329> port

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
extra port there so this is a four port

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.310 
extra port there so this is a four port
portable<00:01:04.170> USB<00:01:04.309> 3.0<00:01:05.309> hub<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.180> again<00:01:06.659> that's<00:01:07.080> all

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
portable USB 3.0 hub so again that's all

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.399 
portable USB 3.0 hub so again that's all
the<00:01:07.439> devices<00:01:07.770> nicely<00:01:08.460> presented<00:01:09.409> again

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the devices nicely presented again

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.200 
the devices nicely presented again
there's<00:01:10.619> nothing<00:01:10.920> much<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.310> just<00:01:11.640> want<00:01:12.090> to

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
there's nothing much to it just want to

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.580 
there's nothing much to it just want to
show<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.900> that's<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> first<00:01:13.320> one

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
show you that so that's the first one

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.640 
show you that so that's the first one
and<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:15.090> second<00:01:15.450> one<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.840> most<00:01:16.229> important

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
and the second one is the most important

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.190 
and the second one is the most important
one<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.830> me<00:01:16.979> because<00:01:17.310> anyone<00:01:17.790> who<00:01:17.970> knows<00:01:18.119> ah<00:01:18.479> is

one to me because anyone who knows ah is

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.840 
one to me because anyone who knows ah is
watch<00:01:19.560> previous<00:01:19.890> videos<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.520> did<00:01:20.729> before

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
watch previous videos that I did before

I<00:01:21.060> did<00:01:21.299> some<00:01:21.680> SSD<00:01:22.680> swap<00:01:22.979> on<00:01:23.130> my<00:01:23.220> macbook<00:01:23.400> pro

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
I did some SSD swap on my macbook pro

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.399 
I did some SSD swap on my macbook pro
this<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> sort<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.900> stuff<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.320> do

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
this is the sort of stuff you can do

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.390 
this is the sort of stuff you can do
with<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.890> can<00:01:25.979> be<00:01:26.130> hard<00:01:26.340> drive

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
with that so you can be hard drive

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.609 
with that so you can be hard drive
cloning<00:01:27.030> you<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.600> do<00:01:27.720> hot<00:01:27.900> swaps<00:01:28.200> if<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.439> work

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
cloning you can do hot swaps if you work

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.859 
cloning you can do hot swaps if you work
with<00:01:28.770> servers<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.369> it's<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.119> Turing<00:01:30.390> two<00:01:30.509> faces

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
with servers and it's a Turing two faces

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.950 
with servers and it's a Turing two faces
well<00:01:31.110> that's<00:01:31.380> SATA<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.700> USB<00:01:33.090> 3.0

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
well that's SATA so this is USB 3.0
