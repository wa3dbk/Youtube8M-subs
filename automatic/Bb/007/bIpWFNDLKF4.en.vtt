00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.010
 cooking with some 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.469
 hi guys fish welcome once 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.360
 more to cooking with the day we're going to do 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.939
 some chocolate baskets and then 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.830
 let's start with the recipe what we're going to 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.720
 need for the chocolate houses 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.310
 to make chocolate here I have a 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.650
 chocolate room 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.130
 we will need later 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.210
 these eggs are from number 3 that are 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:37.380
 super tiny like that and we're going to need 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:39.750
 waxed paper and well 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.910
 let's grab our chocolate let's go 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.160
 to have a pan of water and we 're going 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.010
 to put Maria 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.060
 until we begin to run short of our 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:55.940
 chocolate then let's mix 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.940
 so that our chocolate melts 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.990
 Well, as you can see , here is my 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.150
 chocolate I am the retirement 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.940
 I paid the hat with the 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.250
 pure heat of the water I will leave it and 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.980
 Well, we are going remember that they have to 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.140
 be clear we are going to grab 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:18.990
 our waxed paper 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:22.320
 let's put it and let's grab 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.520
 a small teaspoon does not have to 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.460
 be fine like this and we're going to put in 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.120
 our waxed paper 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.590
 in the chocolate circle 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:42.080
 with the same spoon they help each other 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:44.590
 and we make four equal circuits 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.030
 well in this case I'm going to do 4 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.730
 because I'm going to do 4k appointments if 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.360
 you want to do more remember that 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.360
 your decision 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.340
 then we have our four 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.789
 little circles let's grab our balloon 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.959
 and we 're going to dip it in chocolate what 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.959
 let's cover a little 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:27.760
 remember that you do not have to stay 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.760
 perfect we squeezed them out so you 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:36.909
 drop an excess of chocolate and 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.909
 we put it on top of our little circle 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.930
 and so we continue with our others 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.239
 balloons 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.590
 remember that chocolate does not have to 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.519
 be very hot and we can not be 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.519
 burst our balloon 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.580
 so 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.610
 good and as you can see they are already 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.920
 here in this balloons with our 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.680
 chocolate did not put a little 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.230
 refrigerator after I made them and 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.510
 If you have a perfect half left as here, 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.650
 matter from another style in our 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.480
 little houses and well then let's take the 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.970
 our air casitas can you do 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.520
 One ojito our balloons after then not 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.730
 They can tell us but I'm going to make a 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:39.440
 twine to get rid of air and so 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.440
 let's do with elbows 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.000
 total 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:04.000
 and as you can see, the balloon is going down 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:10.260
 and marking our baskets 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.260
 and since they are like this, we take them off 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.290
 they take off fast and patients and many 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.290
 good appointments 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.540
 and our role 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.820
 and that's how our little houses are 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.310
 nothing else there is to strain 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.650
 good and we are going to live in our 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.240
 streets and you're with tapioca you tapped it 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.280
 we did it in a previous video if not 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.590
 They know how to make the tapioca here I'm going 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.720
 to leave the link so they have like and 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.490
 are going to learn how to make it so strong 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.760
 and we are going to fill it with your little heads 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.760
 tapioca 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:14.430
 if you want, you can fill in your 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:17.430
 ice cream baskets what they like the most 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.090
 and now it's filling in with the 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.880
 tapioca that prepare 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.450
 so very 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.680
 and well we are already all the tapioca 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:31.660
 you can decorate it with what more 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.660

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:38.220

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:42.740
 You also pass or I have sweet quince 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:44.270

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:51.580
 decorate with what they like most and put 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.580

00:05:52.380 --> 00:06:01.060

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:04.440
 and put a sliced remains 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:07.530

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.260
 good and nothing else is left to ride 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.240
 our little houses remember that they 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.220
 you can fill your house with what more 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.470
 you like it and in this case we made tapioca 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.110
