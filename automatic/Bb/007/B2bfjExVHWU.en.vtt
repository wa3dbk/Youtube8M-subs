00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello everyone I'm the clone controls and in 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.660
 this video I come with a little trauma 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.059
 I had when playing for the first time 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.330
 ocarina of time but when one is a child 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.599
 many things happen now I laugh at that 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.660
 adventure I hope you like little finger up 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.939
 and do not make fun, that's why I said it was a 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.720
 child now I start to tell you my 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.880
 eye story that is not creepy pasta and I 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.730
 I have silenced this story or nightmare 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.070
 until today I was at least 10 years old 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.989
 3 years elapsed since 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.510
 launch of the legend of zelda 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.840
 ocarina of time game that started my love 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.660
 for the saga but that game was my first 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.550
 I scare someone too I do not remember who 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.480
 He wanted me to lend him my first game 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.910
 of the nintendo 64 mario kart in exchange me 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.780
 would give that game the legend of zelda 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.239
 ocarina of time if I'm not mistaken was a 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.520
 Friday as always playing extensive 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.980
 hours if not bad memory I played until 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.070
 late at night I came to a place a 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.570
 cemetery I assumed that there would be no more 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.880
 what ghosts 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.110
 that would be the type of game like mario 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.810
 bros 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.930
 I was wrong a cemetery full of 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.150
 tombstones and until the last one that partly 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.010
 of the mission was to desecrate the before 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.979
 that opened up scared me 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.780
 bright eyes of the protagonist link the 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.600
 which indicated to prepare for any 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.670
 thing when between the first thing I saw as 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.369
 part of the scenario were the bones 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.710
 After the damp dark room I 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.650
 It seemed interesting and in a certain way 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.619
 my fear increased the pgm background 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.930
 music did not help me in any way 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.570
 of room I heard for the first time 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.640
 that only regret the regret that a 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.250
 shigeru miyamoto found it excellent 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.890
 put it upside down morre muerto in Spanish 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.750
 of course I will never forget the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.000
 feeling that happened to me in the body at 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.520
 hear it a cold heat going through me 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.039
 back my hands coldly sweaty 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.410
 hold the gray color control as much as 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.780
 strong that I could seize value and with lync 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.970
 I observed my environment fog 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.220
 later on things with green fluids and 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.330
 green clouds coming out of it and in the background 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.520
 of the room 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.800
 in front of the door to the next 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.840
 room but I had to look for the 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.760
 origin of said lament to the side 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.860
 left of the room was the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.320
 first humanoid silhouette in brown 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.960
 I approached and from that figure came 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.240
 I'm sorry I'm not treacherous as 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.220
 to attack from the back I'm going to get 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.700
 in front and kill him as he must beat 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.950
 error a howl a howl gave the re 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.440
 dead to paralyze the protagonist 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.420
 I was scared clear it's like I could squeeze 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.460
 all the buttons that I had within my reach 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.240
 in the control to free me from the 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:50.730
 paralysis I was telling myself fast 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.730
 I do not know how fast I can do that thing 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.740
 I could not save mendel re dead came to 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.870
 antagonist and he was made doing as 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.080
 that if you suck blood odor face with 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.890
 rays I only have two hearts left 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.920
 four I do as he killed him 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.660
 I can not to my surprise they were three 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.780
 memories those who had in that 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.970
 room I followed with fear and a 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.360
 mental struggle of what to do and I decided to 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.120
 use the easy way error through 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.730
 those ponds with green fluid the 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.950
 protagonist complained that thing was some 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.530
 type of poison life was more than that of 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.110
 a heart of four what I most 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.300
 worried I thought my teeth went from 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.170
 room waiting for there to be no more 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:41.319
 of those things exactly in nothing I did 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.680
 what I had to do and then go back 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.769
 I have to return pitifully to that 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.629
 age I did not know any English is 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.060
 suppose there's a song that 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:55.569
 he earned in that place he could paralyze 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.730
 but I did not know that I went through again 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.989
 the room and I only had one 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.060
 fourth of heart 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.579
 I went out and the first thing I did was to put 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.040
 pause and sigh save what 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:09.120
 quiet that now I felt bill now 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.580
 turn it off I went to bed to sleep 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.400
 at this point anyone will say that only 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:17.970
 tell what happened to you in the game and 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.669
 there are worse things at that point I go the ones that 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.530
 they know me they will know that when I play game 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.710
 with my heart, like I was 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.830
 the protagonist when I play well 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.860
 I started my nightmare with myself 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.320
 the high adrenaline could not sleep only 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.900
 I could think about the game I wanted to continue 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.479
 but because of that reality I thought that 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.669
 there could be worse things what he did 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.010
 that I should be calm, I suppose 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.960
 it was three in the morning I saw the dark 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.150
 ceiling of my room and suddenly the 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.300
 treacherous bladder let out the urge to go 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.130
 to the bathroom I got up drowsy maybe to 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.229
 put me in the middle of the hallway 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.389
 division of the rooms those who have 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.720
 been in my house they will know where I speak 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.850
 I saw a green haze on my left 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.850
 turn to see and I saw a humanoid shadow and 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.820
 from it came the green haze I squeezed 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.370
 the teeth wield my hands my body 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.550
 he tensed he wanted to scream I thought about 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.250
 please not through my two ears 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.990
 and that lament I opened my eyes and my 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.540
 I wanted to scream was stronger 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.120
 obviously I did not want to go to the bathroom anymore 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.460
 hard pains with the stretched body I gave myself 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.100
 I turned around and went back to my bed I sat 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.630
 still listening to that lament I grabbed my 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.730
 pillow with which as a child 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.100
 I used to sleep I put in 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.530
 fetal position I lay in my bed and 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.500
 I said this there is no memory that I started 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:44.070
 to cry and as time went by I 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:46.200
 I fell asleep the next clear day that 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.330
 I played it but I regretted playing it 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.310
 so late at night so I do not 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.530
 I went back to play anything during the night 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.960
 later on I lost the fear of 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.150
 play at night that yes even at my age 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.640
 I would not dare to play something that gives 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.310
 really scared during the night more with 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.360
 the graphics of now that they think of me 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.360
 little nightmare
