didn't like the gasoline hydraulic ones
so<00:00:21.769> built<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:22.890> one<00:00:23.100> with<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> auger<00:00:25.039> more<00:00:26.039> of

way<00:00:38.520> too<00:00:38.550> much<00:00:38.760> talk<00:00:39.320> from<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.469> motor<00:00:41.480> so<00:00:42.480> had

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
way too much talk from the motor so had

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.639 
way too much talk from the motor so had
to<00:00:43.440> go<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> standard<00:00:45.110> Kevlar<00:00:46.110> reinforced
