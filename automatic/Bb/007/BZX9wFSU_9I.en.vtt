00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.310 
were really fun to run around with on
modern<00:01:29.400> warfare<00:01:29.610> 2<00:01:30.479> albeit<00:01:31.049> they<00:01:31.079> were<00:01:31.229> a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
modern warfare 2 albeit they were a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.870 
modern warfare 2 albeit they were a
little<00:01:31.560> bit<00:01:31.770> overpowered<00:01:32.369> but<00:01:32.670> they<00:01:32.790> were

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
little bit overpowered but they were

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.969 
little bit overpowered but they were
secondary<00:01:33.270> weapons<00:01:33.659> as<00:01:33.750> well<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.200> they<00:01:34.680> kept

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
secondary weapons as well if they kept

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.039 
secondary weapons as well if they kept
shotguns<00:01:35.460> at<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.670> same<00:01:35.880> kind<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.240> level<00:01:36.600> but

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
shotguns at the same kind of level but

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.359 
shotguns at the same kind of level but
made<00:01:37.200> them<00:01:37.380> primary<00:01:37.680> weapons<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.070> think<00:01:38.280> that

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
made them primary weapons I think that

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.620 
made them primary weapons I think that
would<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:38.549> been<00:01:38.670> absolutely<00:01:38.850> fine<00:01:39.390> but

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
would have been absolutely fine but

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.330 
would have been absolutely fine but
they've<00:01:39.750> taken<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.170> way<00:01:40.770> too<00:01:40.829> far<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.310> other

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
they've taken it way too far the other

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.730 
they've taken it way too far the other
way<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.909> I'm<00:01:42.240> surprised<00:01:42.810> gen<00:01:43.079> ed<00:01:43.320> actually

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
way and I'm surprised gen ed actually

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.859 
way and I'm surprised gen ed actually
missed<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.100> guy<00:01:44.399> there<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.909> found<00:01:45.750> quite

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
obviously turned around when he saw him

the sticking to the cover and you're
sneaking<00:01:58.140> up<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:59.219> was<00:01:59.340> crazy<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.909> was<00:02:00.210> and

help nerfed shotguns hard which is a
shame<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.930> spas-12<00:02:24.230> is<00:02:24.709> probably<00:02:25.160> still<00:02:25.430> the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
shame the spas-12 is probably still the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.699 
shame the spas-12 is probably still the
best<00:02:25.819> out<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.000> all<00:02:26.239> of<00:02:26.300> them<00:02:26.420> but<00:02:27.110> it's<00:02:27.230> nothing

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
best out of all of them but it's nothing

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.699 
best out of all of them but it's nothing
compared<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.879> modern<00:02:29.390> warfare<00:02:29.569> two<00:02:30.170> spas

12<00:02:32.349> anyway<00:02:33.349> let's<00:02:33.620> let's<00:02:33.980> talk<00:02:34.160> about<00:02:34.280> maps<00:02:34.730> on

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
12 anyway let's let's talk about maps on

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.220 
12 anyway let's let's talk about maps on
modern<00:02:35.720> warfare<00:02:35.900> 3<00:02:36.160> i'm<00:02:37.160> finding<00:02:37.849> that<00:02:37.880> if<00:02:38.360> i'm

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
modern warfare 3 i'm finding that if i'm

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.050 
modern warfare 3 i'm finding that if i'm
honest<00:02:39.650> I<00:02:39.890> think<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.310> maps<00:02:40.489> on<00:02:40.730> modern

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
honest I think the maps on modern

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.270 
honest I think the maps on modern
warfare<00:02:41.209> 3<00:02:41.420> are<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.840> worst<00:02:42.200> of<00:02:42.500> any<00:02:42.799> call<00:02:43.160> of

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
warfare 3 are the worst of any call of

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.550 
warfare 3 are the worst of any call of
duty<00:02:43.640> yet<00:02:43.879> I<00:02:44.120> find<00:02:44.780> that<00:02:44.989> they're<00:02:45.170> just<00:02:45.200> they

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
duty yet I find that they're just they

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.580 
duty yet I find that they're just they
just<00:02:45.590> flat<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.280> boring<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.910> spawns

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
just flat and boring and the spawns

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.620 
just flat and boring and the spawns
really<00:02:48.590> sometimes<00:02:48.890> quite<00:02:49.400> ridiculous<00:02:49.760> I'm

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
really sometimes quite ridiculous I'm

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.390 
really sometimes quite ridiculous I'm
not<00:02:50.989> sure<00:02:51.140> if<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.349> noticed<00:02:51.560> but<00:02:51.829> sometimes

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
not sure if you noticed but sometimes

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.250 
not sure if you noticed but sometimes
you<00:02:52.489> get<00:02:52.579> people<00:02:52.760> spawning<00:02:53.209> a<00:02:53.569> few<00:02:53.810> steps<00:02:54.019> away

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
you get people spawning a few steps away

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.729 
you get people spawning a few steps away
and<00:02:54.849> yeah<00:02:55.849> I<00:02:55.880> guess<00:02:56.180> this<00:02:56.450> stops<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:57.620> know

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
and yeah I guess this stops you know

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.100 
and yeah I guess this stops you know
ridiculous<00:02:58.130> spawn<00:02:58.730> trapping<00:02:59.060> but<00:02:59.510> you<00:02:59.989> know

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
ridiculous spawn trapping but you know

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.990 
ridiculous spawn trapping but you know
when<00:03:00.260> that's<00:03:00.440> not<00:03:00.530> happening<00:03:01.220> it's<00:03:01.459> just<00:03:01.849> a

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
when that's not happening it's just a

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.759 
when that's not happening it's just a
bit<00:03:02.239> frustrating<00:03:03.200> when<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.410> get<00:03:03.560> them

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
bit frustrating when you get them

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.979 
bit frustrating when you get them
spawning<00:03:04.489> hectically<00:03:05.060> all<00:03:05.299> over<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.750> place

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
spawning hectically all over the place

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.670 
spawning hectically all over the place
now<00:03:06.680> my<00:03:07.160> favorite<00:03:07.510> maps<00:03:08.510> on<00:03:08.750> this<00:03:08.930> game<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.470> the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
now my favorite maps on this game of the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.580 
now my favorite maps on this game of the
ones<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.040> are<00:03:10.310> probably<00:03:11.120> like<00:03:11.660> Arcadian<00:03:12.380> I

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
ones that are probably like Arcadian I

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.089 
ones that are probably like Arcadian I
like<00:03:13.160> mission<00:03:13.790> see<00:03:14.360> towns<00:03:14.630> quite<00:03:15.110> good<00:03:15.410> though

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
like mission see towns quite good though

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.620 
like mission see towns quite good though
might<00:03:16.370> actually<00:03:16.519> like<00:03:16.849> this<00:03:17.000> map<00:03:17.209> dome<00:03:17.450> it's

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
might actually like this map dome it's

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.780 
might actually like this map dome it's
nice<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:17.959> small<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:19.130> I<00:03:19.220> think<00:03:19.280> there's<00:03:19.579> one

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
nice and small and I think there's one

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.300 
nice and small and I think there's one
more<00:03:20.000> what<00:03:20.510> it's<00:03:20.630> oh<00:03:20.780> yeah<00:03:20.959> outpost<00:03:21.470> of<00:03:21.739> the

bigger maps that's one I like a lot the

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.069 
bigger maps that's one I like a lot the
maps<00:03:24.859> that<00:03:25.069> really<00:03:25.639> irritate<00:03:26.120> me<00:03:26.359> are<00:03:26.690> the

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
maps that really irritate me are the

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.770 
maps that really irritate me are the
maps<00:03:27.370> interchange<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:28.700> what<00:03:29.359> is<00:03:29.480> the<00:03:29.660> other

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
maps really was just a load of wreckage

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.690 
maps really was just a load of wreckage
on<00:03:35.720> them<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:35.959> it<00:03:36.079> makes<00:03:36.109> the<00:03:36.560> map<00:03:36.859> quite<00:03:37.220> there

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
on them and it makes the map quite there

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.430 
on them and it makes the map quite there
they're<00:03:37.940> quite<00:03:38.120> flat<00:03:38.450> maps<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:39.019> they're<00:03:39.200> just
