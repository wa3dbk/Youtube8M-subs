to it here we are installing the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.389 
to it here we are installing the
variator<00:00:43.170> obviously<00:00:43.710> we<00:00:43.920> had<00:00:44.010> already<00:00:44.190> taken

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
variator obviously we had already taken

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.220 
variator obviously we had already taken
out<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> ruckus<00:00:45.059> variator<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.809> put<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
out the ruckus variator we put in the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.560 
out the ruckus variator we put in the
screw<00:00:46.440> ninja<00:00:46.879> coated<00:00:47.879> variator<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.420> got

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
screw ninja coated variator it's got

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.540 
screw ninja coated variator it's got
this<00:00:48.719> really<00:00:48.930> cool<00:00:49.200> slick<00:00:49.530> coating<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.039> it

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
this really cool slick coating on it it

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.010 
this really cool slick coating on it it
comes<00:00:50.820> with<00:00:50.910> extra<00:00:51.329> roller<00:00:51.539> weights<00:00:51.780> in

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
heavier set of roller weights which is

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.979 
heavier set of roller weights which is
going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.270> give<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> little<00:01:00.600> slower

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
going to give you a little slower

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.420 
going to give you a little slower
takeoff<00:01:01.320> speed<00:01:01.469> but<00:01:02.070> it's<00:01:02.160> gonna<00:01:02.250> give<00:01:02.370> you

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
takeoff speed but it's gonna give you

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.529 
takeoff speed but it's gonna give you
more<00:01:02.609> acceleration<00:01:03.059> at<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> higher<00:01:03.300> maximum

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
more acceleration at a higher maximum

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.140 
more acceleration at a higher maximum
speed<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.309> those<00:01:05.309> are<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> ones<00:01:05.549> i<00:01:05.790> prefer

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
speed and those are the ones i prefer

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.330 
speed and those are the ones i prefer
some<00:01:06.960> people<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.290> might<00:01:07.680> want<00:01:07.860> more<00:01:07.979> take<00:01:08.189> off

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
some people I might want more take off

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.800 
some people I might want more take off
right<00:01:09.030> now<00:01:09.150> we're<00:01:09.299> looking<00:01:09.360> at<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> little

spacers these little spacers that we can

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.429 
spacers these little spacers that we can
add<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.450> variator<00:01:12.780> right<00:01:13.080> here<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
add to the variator right here that you

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.789 
add to the variator right here that you
see<00:01:13.470> them<00:01:13.880> depending<00:01:14.880> on<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.540> thickness<00:01:16.380> of
