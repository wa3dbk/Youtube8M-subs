00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.289
 it was actually the netizens they do not speak many engineering solutions 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.289
 vertiginous role only in the role of the client to tell me solutions 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.749
 The West is afraid to speak the requirements and asked the local authority to 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:28.710
 capital letters that were easy to maneuver in traffic the fourth paper 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.600
 our of January design engineers as such a solution of crimes 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.390
 W 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.100
 check out

 O 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.250
 not yet 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.430
 if you depend on the technician 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.890
 lily allen 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.340
 the ex-diary always good you know what it is if you are a difficulty 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.810
 no fan 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.500
 in December the amount of debt that exists to realize 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.880
 there is an ethical conflict that the style of that year should have warned because 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.690
 is that you should not ingest and produce 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.520
 We have several aspects that we have here, the first one to 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.350
 availability of technology for us can materialize this once the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.650
 people have verified pontifical integration 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.090
 if we wanted to put all the contents recipe 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.200
 ceni would become a a collection of technology and this is not the car has 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.460
 a line 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.549
 the car has 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.939
 nick cannon proposed that he may country will introduce guinea- chose the 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.120
 more appropriate technologies because he proposed 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.840
 in reality our work begins to catch even before 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.799
 Dona Maria appeared in the player's kick claiming that she sponsors the tricolor 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.810
 the ball never took position this commission will have practically to goal 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.040
 which we have a logic and physical style and we have to put everything 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.040
 counted result as well as bar 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.340
 electrical and electronic equipment in all parts of the car and the 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:25.639
 population as well 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:28.009
 second floor of the apartment would be 

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:30.739
 is now going to bid on experimentation 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.089
 to see how components are tested 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:38.139
 the internavip internal logistics meter in less than 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:43.199
 built a car totally test the car virtually it gets to the car 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:44.610
 currently 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.870
 is because the transactions will be the same with a virtual room as on par of 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.270
 simulation of gartner that was close to the maximum possible in the world 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.560
 what works, it is with these solutions that 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.560
 possible manufacture of cigarette 

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:32.509
 this equipment here 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:35.069
 sr 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.179
 when they are on the roads and people 

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:38.869
 can be used 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:43.009
 on a specific road and agent that applies these equipment here 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.989
 the knowledge in which acquired equipment to follow 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.579
 we can 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.579
 it's easy to do 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.019
 the local customer 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.519
 see the route 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.719
 the village 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:09.630
 the place 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.370
 check out 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.489
 O 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.489
 not yet 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:24.990
 modeling work 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.229
 in the sequence of 100 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.580
 How did you start? We like to make a very personal movie, man. 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.490
 modern 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.900
 because each one has a modern and different way
