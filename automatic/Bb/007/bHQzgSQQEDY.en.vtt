00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.110

 Carlos says this girl who has 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.880
 deranged to make us a party 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.880
 we will have to sign it 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.810
 that is to say that for me is 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.210
 shortlisted a companion in all 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.130
 the senses no longer just the time that I have 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.140
 could share with her in the 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.390
 Spanish selection as part of the body 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.220
 technical but also as more player 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.530
 as a player was a companion a 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.440
 Friend the person who has helped me the most 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.920
 in salamanca in the two months that been 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.050
 has been been isa and what I have is 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.550
 first, very much, love for being like 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.560
 because it's really special to me 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.730
 but a lot of respect a lot of respect for your 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.810
 trajectory I think it's one of the 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.130
 most important flowers that has given 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.130
 know this Spanish 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.310
 walk you're going to retire 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.319
 and you will remember me super passes of 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.870
 counterattack with your gadget or arm there 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.959
 that not too much a buddy threw them 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.050
 roma and you come one after the other or from 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:33.060
 you that nothing that retires but this is 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.849
 the start of another new stage 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.349
 I swear that now you have planned to be 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.349
 coach or something like that true 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.370
 that he has always known to be really 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.530
 accepting his role within the team never 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.140
 has been initially of those that had 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.730
 to be of those who in some way 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.400
 endure the championship and has always 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.640
 finished really being and there is also 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.530
 something that is difficult to assess 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.860
 you read and you have not lived with her in those 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.050
 championships that's that way of being 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.239
 that the difficult moments that 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.930
 there is always in each championship always 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:17.359
 has had the right word the moment 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.609
 in some way to break that tension 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.320
 and with an advantage that then also 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:25.479
 when I went out on the track to the minutes that 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.479
 each selected one he always gave 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.990
 and he has taught me a lot of things 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.840
 I believe that 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.060
 all these young women who are coming 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.040
 they will remember their fouls in attack and 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.750
 of her trapdoors a player who 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.750
 Having her as an enemy, you never want her 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.810
 his titles are backed by everything he has 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.710
 won here he has won everything now as 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.910
 coach has done a perfect job 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:56.220
 on the plot that played perfect 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.810
 and I'm just going to tell you an anecdote that 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.270
 has happened to her because she has suffered 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.390
 as a player and I've had her as 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.640
 player really hated her when 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.550
 played against me because of the floppy disk that 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.800
 It cost me several techniques a great 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.750
 actress outstanding atrocious but when 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.880
 in front was with me I loved her called 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.340
 by another player that you want 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.630
 you love her and well I wanted to say it because 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.630
 It is just as I tell it 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:30.189
 from the beginning it has been like a 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:32.319
 sister my first year away from home I had 

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:35.319
 the luck of having it and especially so 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:37.360
 in the hardest moments of during the 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.219
 four years of salamanca the feared and so 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.469
 that the last year was of brightness for 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:44.409
 she and good we have passed many things 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:46.629
 together and especially since I have learned the 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:49.289
 character to never give up and do 

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:49.289
 always strong 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:06:00.589
