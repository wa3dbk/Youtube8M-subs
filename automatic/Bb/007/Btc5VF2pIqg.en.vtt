helicopters<00:03:24.600> up<00:03:24.960> at<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.110> same<00:03:25.290> time<00:03:25.440> so<00:03:26.220> yeah

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
decided that it would be a good idea to

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.610 
decided that it would be a good idea to
castrate<00:03:34.860> themselves<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:37.730> kind<00:03:38.730> of<00:03:38.850> my<00:03:38.940> guys

this<00:03:40.620> is<00:03:40.830> a<00:03:40.860> probably<00:03:41.250> really<00:03:41.760> weak<00:03:41.940> story<00:03:42.300> I'm

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
this is a probably really weak story I'm

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.570 
this is a probably really weak story I'm
probably<00:03:43.080> missing<00:03:43.350> some<00:03:43.710> really<00:03:44.160> important

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
probably missing some really important

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.090 
probably missing some really important
points<00:03:44.910> in<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.300> story<00:03:45.540> betta<00:03:45.900> yeah<00:03:46.710> now<00:03:47.040> you

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
points in the story betta yeah now you

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.520

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
know uh-huh so I always thought there

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.170 
know uh-huh so I always thought there
was<00:03:52.590> some<00:03:52.860> weird<00:03:54.650> smeared<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.830> know<00:03:56.180> stories

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
because these two choppers and that was

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.909
