 dargaud find themselves for a new 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.560
 video a video on the extinction mode 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.260
 from call of duty ghost so today 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.510
 we will speak one of all the objects that 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.830
 are running under the ground in the mode 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.860
 extinction of everything that can be found 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.500
 so we will start by showing you a 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.630
 little any money that we 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.290
 can find pretty much so yes we can 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.350
 find money 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.290
 digging while digging is not 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.630
 big sums it can go from 50 to 250 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.030
 and for the lucky ones it can go 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:49.030
 up to 500 dollars under the basement 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.980
 so you can win $ 500 in 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.420
 digging ball 6 most often it's 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.010
 fifty or the $ 100 that falls so 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.840
 for those who do not know too much 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.080
 far from extinction actually explains you 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.970
 have boxes where bins I 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.830
 believe that's how to dig on 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.280
 on death which will allow you to 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.170
 find different objects so too 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.790
 you can also find at each point 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.689
 of passage knowing that there are two points 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:20.229
 of passing on on this mode of extinction 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.609
 on a corner of contact at each point of 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.939
 passage the helicopter drops you a box 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:26.350
 from $ 3,000 as you will have seen so 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.509
 now we will go to ammunition and 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.359
 explosive so yes you can find 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.390
 ammunition so looking for you 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:36.789
 can find either a single charger this 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.250
 that does not serve much 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:42.370
 either all ammunition 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.070
 all your weapons in full or so 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.680
 you can also find some 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.860
 explosive bullets bullets 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.720
 incendiaries piercing and paralyzing 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.729
 all this under the ground you can 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.500
 find the five former key 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.140
 death of the bouncing beti 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.670
 so here are recent ones right away at 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.320
 hypno knife so what is the 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.250
 hypnos knife and digging you go 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.990
 see you're going to find a little 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.330
 knife to dance it's called the 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.550
 hypno knife what is this knife for? 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.770
 it's simple you'll see so 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.400
 in fact with this knife you run on 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.280
 an alien and you will be able to actually 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.540
 we will say a little capture an alien and 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.150
 basically he's going to follow you everywhere and 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.350
 help you kill the other aliens so 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.730
 me what I advise you for this 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.480
 knife and no it's not to capture the 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.200
 little monsters 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.660
 these two be captured the scorpions be 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.209
 to capture the red monsters that are 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.100
 from the third from the 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.410
 second waypoint 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.000
 knowing that also rhino what we 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.540
 calls rhinos and big ones big ones 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.910
 to the aliens we can not capture them 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.560
 with this knife it makes them no 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.239
 effort so here's his 1 pass have it all 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.470
 immediately to the attractive rocket near this 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.060
 that I call the attractive rocket 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.209
 that's what looks like an insertion 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.980
 tactical on mw3 but who in mode 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:05.590
 attracts extinction attracts the aliens so 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.610
 it will be enough just to place your 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.070
 rocket your rocket to the ground and attract 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.870
 to all the aliens including the 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.480
 scorpions jumping from roof to roof they 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.590
 will come next to the rocket and they 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.190
 will not basically want you to see him 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.930
 and it also attracts bumps so for 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.829
 the moment I recap we can find 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:31.299
 a rocket a money hypno knife 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:33.700
 ammunition and explosives style 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.530
 savvy text betty clement so there you 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.890
 see that I throw the rocket on the ground 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:41.140
 they all stand before the 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.700
 rocket that does not have one 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.180
 it's like black ops monkeys 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:51.209
 France 2 if you prefer to do that 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.209
 attracts all enemies without exception 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.720
 so now let's move on to 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.910
 laser marker what is the marker 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.550
 laser in fact so it's kind of 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.790
 father of binoculars the twins for there 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.030
 see 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.550
 except with his binoculars there you can 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.680
 you can mark a point on the map 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.510
 is basically this point it's a 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.190
 ground bombing you have three 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.900
 bullets you always have three bullets 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.080
 in the markers you could see 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.060
 only one marker is there 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.980
 see bouthillier you're aiming the ground and 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.050
 what do you do to put a 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.140
 marker and I believe that there is a chopper 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.180
 who's going to let go of a bombing but 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.320
 so you have too beautiful 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.320
 it's practical enough to defend 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:42.240
 fish immediately to the trophy system 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.450
 so you say a trophy system 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.340
 okay but what's the point in this mode 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.320
 of extinction knowing that a system 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.360
 trophy in multiplayer it only serves 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.880
 to return all equipment and a half 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.500
 flash grenades style I would like you 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.210
 say the aliens bullet a pomegranate spot nor 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.620
 of flash grenades and so makes it the goal 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.820
 of this too powerful system made of 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:08.640
 return the acid that actually projects 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.520
 scorpions if you prefer so we 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.560
 will see that there in the video actually this 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.419
 system really benefits it disintegrates 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.760
 projectiles and scorpions 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:20.220
 which allows you anyway 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.169
 protect pretty well because when he 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.580
 there is the cee'd on the ground it inflicts you 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.040
 a lot of damage and tasty lentils 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.290
 so good this trophy system if you in 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.440
 find yourself near dany 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:35.060
 you put next to it and you have more of the 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.060
 all about scorpions 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.860
 let's move on finally to the last point so you 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.900
 can also also by searching 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.569
 parterre find weapons accessories 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:49.009
 from glasses style to these objects as 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:52.069
 you'll see some adjustments too 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.780
 on the shot as a gunshot or even 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:56.090
 quick shot you can place them on 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.319
 on you in principle so what is that 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.590
 I call the main weapons 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:02.150
 it's not guns even though it's 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.439
 what you have from the beginning these are 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.599
 all that is 47 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:07.729
 short the weapons you buy so 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:10.400
 you can their team and all that 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:12.379
 is quick shot sight take mouth 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.360
 so that's all that's good 

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:17.900
 like never before seen the silent on 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:21.199
 this memo we can have lunati flange 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:23.539
 thermal glasses glasses at these 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:24.979
 objects shooting rapid fire burst these 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:26.740
 five there it's on these five elements 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:29.090
 for sure we can have them 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.889
 so here I hope you'll have but 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.449
 this little video do not hesitate to 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:34.069
 put a little blue thumbs yes because 

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:36.759
 that now is the most blue me 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:36.759
 I want to say ciao bye
