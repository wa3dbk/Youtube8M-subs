correct Rulon is it better for burning
fat<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.030> losing<00:01:39.689> inches<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.619> absolutely<00:01:41.189> is

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
fat and losing inches it absolutely is

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.670 
fat and losing inches it absolutely is
so<00:01:41.850> because<00:01:42.659> we<00:01:42.810> only<00:01:42.899> have<00:01:43.020> three<00:01:43.140> main<00:01:43.409> types

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
so because we only have three main types

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.350 
so because we only have three main types
of<00:01:43.890> tea<00:01:44.009> they<00:01:44.130> all<00:01:44.220> come<00:01:44.399> from<00:01:44.549> one<00:01:44.610> tea<00:01:45.149> leaf

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
of tea they all come from one tea leaf

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.630 
of tea they all come from one tea leaf
and<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:46.229> one<00:01:46.409> tea<00:01:46.649> leaf<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.009> fermented<00:01:47.490> in

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
and that one tea leaf is fermented in

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.090 
and that one tea leaf is fermented in
different<00:01:47.909> ways<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.869> have<00:01:49.380> black<00:01:49.950> tea

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
different ways so you have black tea

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.469 
different ways so you have black tea
which<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.490> fully<00:01:50.759> from<00:01:50.970> an<00:01:51.119> end<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.390> have

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
which is fully from an end you have

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.660 
which is fully from an end you have
green<00:01:51.689> tea<00:01:51.720> which<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.049> non<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> minute<00:01:52.950> who

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
green tea which is non for a minute who

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.670 
green tea which is non for a minute who
long<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> semi<00:01:54.600> fermented<00:01:55.079> tea<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.560> that

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
long is a semi fermented tea and that

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.530 
long is a semi fermented tea and that
fermentation<00:01:56.070> process<00:01:56.820> brings<00:01:57.060> out<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> couple

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
fermentation process brings out a couple

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.539 
fermentation process brings out a couple
different<00:01:57.780> compounds<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.530> help<00:01:58.829> raise<00:01:59.310> your
