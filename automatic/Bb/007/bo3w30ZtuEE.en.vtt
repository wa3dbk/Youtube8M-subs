clear the board and it's gonna have

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.880 
clear the board and it's gonna have
initiating<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.219> new<00:00:53.489> wave<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.180> enemies<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.899> just

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
initiating a new wave of enemies so just

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.740 
initiating a new wave of enemies so just
try<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.129> survive<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.969> here's<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.300> nuke<00:00:57.449> over

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
try to survive and here's the nuke over

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.810 
try to survive and here's the nuke over
here<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> right<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:59.219> once<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.489> do<00:00:59.609> this

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
here to the right and once you do this

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.080 
here to the right and once you do this
what<00:01:00.510> we're<00:01:00.629> hoping<00:01:00.780> for<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:02.039> wave<00:01:02.280> with

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
what we're hoping for is the wave with

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.299 
what we're hoping for is the wave with
the<00:01:03.629> blue<00:01:03.840> crosses<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.619> are<00:01:04.769> gonna<00:01:04.920> appear

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the blue crosses that are gonna appear

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.520 
the blue crosses that are gonna appear
and<00:01:05.640> let's<00:01:06.479> see<00:01:06.659> if<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:06.840> get<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.170> we're<00:01:07.380> not

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
and let's see if we get it we're not

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.530 
and let's see if we get it we're not
gonna<00:01:07.710> get<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.070> here<00:01:08.340> if<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.820> don't<00:01:08.970> get<00:01:09.270> this

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
gonna get it here if you don't get this

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.109 
gonna get it here if you don't get this
wave<00:01:10.229> I'm<00:01:10.439> looking<00:01:10.799> for<00:01:11.070> within<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.909> first

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
wave I'm looking for within the first

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.179 
wave I'm looking for within the first
couple<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:13.140> may<00:01:13.290> want<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.740> restart

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
couple you may want to just restart

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.499 
couple you may want to just restart
because<00:01:14.400> it's<00:01:14.520> random<00:01:14.700> which<00:01:15.060> wave<00:01:15.299> you're

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
because it's random which wave you're

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.560 
because it's random which wave you're
gonna<00:01:15.659> get<00:01:16.880> so<00:01:17.880> we're<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.060> gonna<00:01:18.270> go<00:01:18.479> ahead

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
and clear another board here and wait

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.730 
and clear another board here and wait
for<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.460> nuke<00:01:20.869> now<00:01:21.869> I'm<00:01:21.960> down<00:01:22.110> if<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.409> haven't

visuals<00:01:33.840> are<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.560> much<00:01:34.770> better<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.850> 1080p<00:01:36.479> 60

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
visuals are so much better the 1080p 60

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.530 
visuals are so much better the 1080p 60
frames<00:01:37.500> per<00:01:37.619> second<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.430> there's<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.119> platinum

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
frames per second and there's a platinum

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.179 
frames per second and there's a platinum

alive<00:02:23.200> because<00:02:23.709> this<00:02:23.890> mode<00:02:24.159> is<00:02:24.370> really<00:02:24.400> really

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
alive because this mode is really really

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.750 
alive because this mode is really really
hard<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.750> tough<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:26.230> survive<00:02:26.769> seven<00:02:27.430> minutes

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
hard and tough to survive seven minutes

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.860 
hard and tough to survive seven minutes
then<00:02:27.939> without<00:02:28.209> dying

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
then without dying

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.800 
then without dying
it<00:02:29.709> gets<00:02:29.920> very<00:02:29.980> hectic<00:02:30.549> in<00:02:31.299> seven<00:02:31.659> minutes

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
it gets very hectic in seven minutes

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.750 
it gets very hectic in seven minutes
feels<00:02:32.230> like<00:02:32.500> an<00:02:32.650> eternity<00:02:32.709> in<00:02:33.370> this<00:02:33.519> mode<00:02:35.760> we

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
feels like an eternity in this mode we

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.949 
feels like an eternity in this mode we
should<00:02:37.000> be<00:02:37.180> left<00:02:37.510> with<00:02:37.629> just<00:02:37.780> one<00:02:38.170> guy<00:02:38.799> I<00:02:38.829> think

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
should be left with just one guy I think

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.830 
should be left with just one guy I think
got<00:02:40.959> one<00:02:41.200> down<00:02:41.439> there<00:02:42.569> that<00:02:43.569> looks<00:02:43.780> like

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
got one down there that looks like

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.360 
got one down there that looks like
there's<00:02:44.079> another<00:02:44.319> guy<00:02:44.590> on<00:02:44.739> top<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:45.069> the<00:02:45.129> screen

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
there's another guy on top of the screen

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.770 
there's another guy on top of the screen
so<00:02:45.549> let's<00:02:45.669> go<00:02:45.819> ahead<00:02:45.939> and<00:02:46.030> take<00:02:46.150> this<00:02:46.329> guy<00:02:46.569> out

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
so let's go ahead and take this guy out

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.399 
so let's go ahead and take this guy out
now<00:02:47.680> there's<00:02:47.859> just<00:02:47.919> the<00:02:48.099> single<00:02:48.370> guy<00:02:48.669> left

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:49.409 
now there's just the single guy left

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.750 
now there's just the single guy left
again<00:02:50.409> you<00:02:50.560> remember<00:02:50.769> you<00:02:51.010> can't<00:02:51.250> die<00:02:51.459> at<00:02:51.639> all

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
again you remember you can't die at all

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.849 
again you remember you can't die at all
but<00:02:52.389> you<00:02:52.540> can<00:02:52.750> just<00:02:52.900> use<00:02:53.139> your<00:02:53.169> boost<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.739> get

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
but you can just use your boost to get

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.379 
but you can just use your boost to get
around<00:02:54.099> the<00:02:54.220> map<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.459> it's<00:02:54.879> real<00:02:55.000> easy<00:02:55.030> at

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:55.389 
around the map and it's real easy at

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.539 
around the map and it's real easy at
this<00:02:55.480> point<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:55.989> avoid<00:02:56.439> it<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:56.799> I'm<00:02:57.129> gonna<00:02:57.340> skip

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
this point to avoid it so I'm gonna skip

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.309 
this point to avoid it so I'm gonna skip
forward<00:02:57.879> here<00:02:58.000> because<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.269> gets<00:02:58.419> absolutely

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
forward here because it gets absolutely

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.959 
forward here because it gets absolutely
boring<00:02:59.829> and<00:02:59.980> you'll<00:03:00.069> get<00:03:00.189> dizzy<00:03:00.430> if<00:03:00.639> you<00:03:00.760> watch
