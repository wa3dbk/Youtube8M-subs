00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.339 
they actually hear that tempo as being a
rhythm<00:02:50.129> every<00:02:50.760> two<00:02:50.939> minutes<00:02:51.239> them<00:02:51.390> can<00:02:52.260> the

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
rhythm every two minutes them can the

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.559 
rhythm every two minutes them can the
cicadas<00:02:52.920> do<00:02:53.430> they<00:02:53.579> feel<00:02:53.879> this<00:02:54.060> whole<00:02:54.209> thing<00:02:54.480> at

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
cicadas do they feel this whole thing at

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.479 
cicadas do they feel this whole thing at
the<00:02:54.599> rhythm<00:02:54.989> every<00:02:55.319> 17<00:02:55.829> years<00:02:56.129> the<00:02:56.310> noise

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
the rhythm every 17 years the noise

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:11.160 
the rhythm every 17 years the noise
