move it over to the side we can leave it

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.120 
move it over to the side we can leave it
right<00:01:30.460> there<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.900> really<00:01:32.080> not<00:01:32.320> in<00:01:32.500> our<00:01:32.650> way

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
right there it's really not in our way

right there it's really not in our way
now<00:01:33.400> we<00:01:33.460> can<00:01:33.729> lift<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.030> caliper<00:01:34.479> off<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:36.490> is

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
now we can lift the caliper off this is

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.820 
now we can lift the caliper off this is
our<00:01:36.880> speed<00:01:37.240> sensor<00:01:37.780> this<00:01:37.990> is<00:01:38.170> what<00:01:38.380> tells<00:01:38.650> the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
our speed sensor this is what tells the

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
bit of a bear and we'll be back in a

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.280 
bit of a bear and we'll be back in a
minute<00:02:39.670> because<00:02:39.940> these<00:02:40.030> bolts<00:02:40.360> are<00:02:40.420> very<00:02:40.780> very

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
minute because these bolts are very very

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.500 
minute because these bolts are very very
very<00:02:41.620> long<00:02:41.980> they<00:02:42.190> take<00:02:42.340> a<00:02:42.400> long<00:02:42.700> time<00:02:43.299> to

going to use our rubber mallet we're
going<00:03:29.049> to<00:03:29.109> tap<00:03:29.379> on<00:03:29.680> this<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:30.579> check<00:03:30.819> the<00:03:30.939> drive

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
going to tap on this to check the drive

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.640 
going to tap on this to check the drive
shafts<00:03:31.510> of<00:03:31.659> lines<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.140> see<00:03:32.319> if<00:03:32.409> those<00:03:32.590> are

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
answers my question we grab a flashlight

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:55.910 
answers my question we grab a flashlight
that<00:03:46.170> has<00:03:47.170> not<00:03:47.349> been<00:03:47.560> done

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.030 

you

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.959 

I<00:04:00.099> asked<00:04:00.969> Chris<00:04:01.349> why'd<00:04:02.349> these<00:04:02.799> splines<00:04:03.310> dry

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:03.969 
I asked Chris why'd these splines dry

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:06.209 
I asked Chris why'd these splines dry
out<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.569> of<00:04:04.959> course<00:04:05.170> he<00:04:05.319> had<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.650> answer<00:04:06.040> and

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:06.219 
out and of course he had the answer and

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:10.050 
out and of course he had the answer and
it<00:04:06.670> is<00:04:06.879> lubrication<00:04:07.810> Chris<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:09.370> spline<00:04:09.760> Lube

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
it is lubrication Chris the spline Lube

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.750 
it is lubrication Chris the spline Lube
works<00:04:10.719> its<00:04:10.930> way<00:04:11.079> up<00:04:11.109> the<00:04:11.409> shaft<00:04:11.650> leaving<00:04:12.640> this

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
works its way up the shaft leaving this

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.249 
works its way up the shaft leaving this
end<00:04:13.030> dry<00:04:13.590> so<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.890> even<00:04:15.310> every<00:04:16.139> time<00:04:17.139> you

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:17.259 
end dry so the even every time you

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:19.080 
end dry so the even every time you
changing<00:04:17.650> your<00:04:17.799> tire<00:04:18.070> every<00:04:18.489> eight<00:04:18.609> thousand

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
changing your tire every eight thousand
