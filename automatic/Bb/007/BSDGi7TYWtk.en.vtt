00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
mean it wasn't it was predictable he

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.520

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.820 
visually stunning than a solid film
overall<00:03:30.489> um<00:03:30.970> kind<00:03:31.450> of<00:03:31.480> like<00:03:31.570> Tron<00:03:31.870> Legacy<00:03:32.049> but

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
overall um kind of like Tron Legacy but

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.210 
overall um kind of like Tron Legacy but
I<00:03:33.190> I<00:03:33.790> do<00:03:34.000> really<00:03:34.540> still<00:03:35.380> think<00:03:35.680> he's<00:03:35.920> got<00:03:36.190> it

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
I I do really still think he's got it

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.800 
I I do really still think he's got it
and<00:03:36.640> he's<00:03:36.880> so<00:03:37.090> talented

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
and he's so talented

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.600 
and he's so talented
especially<00:03:38.530> with<00:03:38.650> characters<00:03:39.100> which<00:03:39.310> is<00:03:39.459> what

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
especially with characters which is what

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.220 
especially with characters which is what
Star<00:03:39.880> Wars<00:03:40.090> is<00:03:40.269> such<00:03:40.450> an<00:03:40.570> amazing<00:03:40.750> universe

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
Star Wars is such an amazing universe

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.410 
Star Wars is such an amazing universe
because<00:03:41.890> of<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:42.130> one<00:03:42.730> of<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:42.910> many<00:03:43.060> reasons

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
because of that one of the many reasons

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.360 
because of that one of the many reasons
so<00:03:43.630> at<00:03:44.260> first<00:03:44.500> I<00:03:44.650> was<00:03:44.769> a<00:03:44.799> little<00:03:44.860> worried<00:03:45.220> but

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
so at first I was a little worried but

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.460 
so at first I was a little worried but
Kazan's<00:03:45.910> done<00:03:46.090> it<00:03:46.239> I<00:03:46.360> mean<00:03:46.600> he<00:03:46.720> has<00:03:46.870> he<00:03:47.260> has

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
Kazan's done it I mean he has he has

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.740

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.300 
created he's part of this universe one
of<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:49.930> best<00:03:50.140> of<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.680> franchise<00:03:51.070> in<00:03:51.220> my

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
of the best of the franchise in my

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.640 
of the best of the franchise in my
opinion<00:03:51.640> so<00:03:51.910> I<00:03:52.120> definitely<00:03:52.959> am<00:03:53.140> not<00:03:53.320> too

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
opinion so I definitely am not too

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.610 
opinion so I definitely am not too
worried<00:03:54.370> about<00:03:54.610> it<00:03:54.880> and<00:03:55.390> JJ<00:03:56.049> I<00:03:56.079> really<00:03:56.500> like

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
worried about it and JJ I really like

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.250 
worried about it and JJ I really like
what<00:03:56.799> you<00:03:56.890> said<00:03:57.100> about<00:03:57.750> say<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:58.870> again<00:03:58.989> phrase

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
what you said about say it again phrase

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.080 
what you said about say it again phrase
it<00:03:59.380> perfectly<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.829> new<00:03:59.980> world<00:04:00.310> sensibilities

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090

it perfectly the new world sensibilities
I<00:04:01.900> really<00:04:02.260> like<00:04:02.440> that<00:04:02.590> because<00:04:02.650> I<00:04:02.950> do<00:04:03.280> think

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
I really like that because I do think

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.030 
I really like that because I do think
that's<00:04:03.790> what<00:04:04.060> JJ<00:04:04.450> does<00:04:04.720> with<00:04:05.170> you<00:04:05.620> know<00:04:05.739> Star

Trek and now moving over to Star Wars I

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.490 
Trek and now moving over to Star Wars I
do<00:04:08.530> think<00:04:08.920> that<00:04:08.980> he<00:04:09.670> really<00:04:10.360> does<00:04:10.600> make<00:04:11.019> us<00:04:11.260> you

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
do think that he really does make us you

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.380 
do think that he really does make us you
know<00:04:11.590> feel<00:04:11.860> like<00:04:11.890> this<00:04:12.340> universe<00:04:12.790> is<00:04:13.030> the<00:04:13.269> one

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
know feel like this universe is the one

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.539 
know feel like this universe is the one
that<00:04:13.540> we<00:04:13.660> grew<00:04:13.840> up<00:04:13.870> with<00:04:14.140> but<00:04:14.650> he<00:04:14.769> also<00:04:15.010> brings

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
that we grew up with but he also brings

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.759

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
it to this generation and I think that

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.560 
it to this generation and I think that

now<00:04:22.960> when<00:04:23.200> I<00:04:23.229> when<00:04:23.530> I<00:04:23.560> watch<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.919> movie<00:04:24.099> for

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
now when I when I watch the movie for

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.040 
now when I when I watch the movie for
the<00:04:24.220> first<00:04:24.280> time<00:04:24.550> how<00:04:24.910> much<00:04:25.240> of<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:25.750> movie<00:04:25.960> are

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
the first time how much of the movie are

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.280 
the first time how much of the movie are
we<00:04:26.110> gonna<00:04:26.260> see<00:04:26.530> with

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
we gonna see with

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.990 
we gonna see with
based<00:04:27.410> on<00:04:27.530> what<00:04:27.950> Arendt<00:04:28.220> had<00:04:28.370> already<00:04:28.610> done

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
based on what Arendt had already done

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.400 
based on what Arendt had already done
because<00:04:29.330> obviously<00:04:29.660> they<00:04:29.900> can't<00:04:30.080> be<00:04:30.140> starting

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
because obviously they can't be starting

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.660 
because obviously they can't be starting
some<00:04:30.590> scratch<00:04:30.830> they're<00:04:31.190> already<00:04:31.490> in

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
some scratch they're already in

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.570 
some scratch they're already in
pre-production<00:04:31.940> it's<00:04:32.900> too<00:04:33.080> late<00:04:33.290> and<00:04:34.130> a<00:04:34.370> lot

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
pre-production it's too late and a lot

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.830 
pre-production it's too late and a lot
of<00:04:34.670> what<00:04:34.850> he<00:04:35.030> had<00:04:35.120> written<00:04:35.300> was<00:04:35.540> probably

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
of what he had written was probably

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.750 
of what he had written was probably
