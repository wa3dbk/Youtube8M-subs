00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.310
 Iran had been a sensational with Pal or Walked today 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.219
 The theme of classic cars is true because you leave in Rambazamba 

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:08.359
 much better than then but still more than they all together at the border 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.930

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.890
 the most beautiful of yesterday 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.890
 and who drives slowly also gets more of the crew 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.470
 the oldest vehicle in the field 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.710
 a Rolls Royce Silver Ghost from 1914 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.560
 reaches the goal 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.180

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.559
 even better were Sabrina contact 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:27.979
 On it should be a defense against seeing the right place and such cars 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:33.159
 So we are going to become formal questions for myself already 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.609
 After that we should be together soon 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.919
 the weather is more important that the author relieves himself 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:43.839
 beautiful and rich, there are many but who has the most beautiful 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.839
 but it's not just about 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.609
 High gloss polished classics also have to drive 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.609

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.489
 the scenery of the castle is really great when we visit these beautiful places 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.569
 and the team is a symbiosis that is so rare 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.449
 Koslow 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:28.249

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:56.779
 The car triumphed from the first moment 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:59.329
 we believe that the girl is already today 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.769
 when we had to decide there was complete consistency of the car 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.469
 so elegant for us there was no doubt 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.979
