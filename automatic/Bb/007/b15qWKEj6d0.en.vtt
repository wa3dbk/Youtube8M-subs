00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.990
 try after the preparation where you 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.819
 want to be with your team or do you know that 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.219
 actually only if you have a real test case 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.709
 undergoes a Sunday afternoon 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.270
 After it is always clear that that 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.279
 such a first competition is always learning 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.160
 new again 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:23.090
 yes and one side you can only then draw conclusions 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.610
 I feel that we are there 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.550
 be ready for that i think the latter 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.490
 practice match here last week though 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.559
 has proven but yes it is always again 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.059
 what extra tension it is about the points 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.690
 what that tom 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.309
 was not the case until now 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.010
 so you will see yes it went last 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.780
 season out at zwolle it went wrong 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.800
 it often in the final phase the 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.120
 competition miss against this kind 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.559
 opponents 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.239
 do you now feel that your team has this one 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.889
 they may take it that you post 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.519
 to have put in that context 

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:56.479
 mira one side you always have 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.789
 opponents that you have one year from 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.370
 wind and other years it loses 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.709
 new season does not start at zero 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.940
 is the first match and 

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:06.740
 last we always have the first 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.479
 contest won so we also try 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.710
 again from yes that gives confidence 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.479
 you get that statistic or not that 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.539
 gives confidence and how we how we use the 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.979
 represent how fit we are and what we do 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:21.680
 have done in preparation 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.549
 you will receive another confirmation 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.520
 Sunday at that it is a quarter past seven or 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.310
 let something even feel fine 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.109
 and we are positive we have them 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.880
 not always but also the last weeks 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.170
 again he has an opinion about how 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.850
 your defense should look like 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.590
 has mathijssen again sunday 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.299
 demonstrated that he was just as crazy 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.960
 is important for this team 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.450
 well that not only Sunday and but 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.240
 even in the and the months in it 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.770
 and last season but yes I will come to you 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.570
 every time back on the same and 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.039
 maybe it's our time again 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.440
 Clearly because we might have another one 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.590
 time to set 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.510
 if we take a look at our selection and 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.330
 of course there are some young ones 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.480
 Guys swim like cabbage malone 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.330
 from the lucas brook of parts to those 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.220
 a little further away than the other five 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.640
 defenders so we have some 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.680
 mat one of those five won't play and 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.180
 that can be different there can still be sun 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.010
 be different again as next week or 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.360
 afterwards 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.940
 and what I'm not going to do is every time 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.080
 but again explain why the one 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.060
 not playing 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.920
 no, those are choices based on 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:35.050
 various reasons fitness speed 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.610
 quality 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.820
 tactical compared to one 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.560
 opponent wall is in the outside lamp 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.240
 It's always pretty normal 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.340
 we will rotate a little more than 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.170
 than last season I already have 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.560
 indicated 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.800
 so yes it is and and and we aim 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.990
 us often on the one who does not play 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.090
 while the team is playing what is in my 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.070
 choose the best 11 for that match and 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.360
 what it is a week later and with whom 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.980
 is 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.810
 We see then last season was one 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.550
 of the problems on the gap between base 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.959
 and playing on the couch was fairly large 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.290
 has that now become less than you 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.330
 says I'm going to donate well I think so 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.980
 think a number of guys are those who 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.680
 sit closer to it or maybe 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.020
 even have the right to play 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.800
 well then it is easier for that too 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.930
 a trainer 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.510
 and again you don't need a mess path 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.220
 make a mess of it because half has it 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.440
 firmness always needed but we are 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.380
 of course been busy with each other and 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.380
 largely with with many of these 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.739
 players so the steadiness is already there 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.050
 you can also focus more often on it 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.610
 an opponent set you up and and 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.510
 set for an opponent that that 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.150
 I don't often call that that 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.099
 fear is no, but more return 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.159
 get out of your ideas and and that choice 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:54.110
 currently with these players is bigger 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:57.260
 then that last pity everyone beats one 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.819
 I don't appeal Sunday after Bernal 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.220
 trained that I had the help on them 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.269
 but assume that that's no problem 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.870
 is 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:08.780
 so then you come up with something beautiful is the 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.420
 moon do joey sleegers is not yet 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.370
 100% fit for everyone's leftovers 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.750
 for how you b in recent years that 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.220
 Your good performance here comes with 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.600
 a second and third place purely such 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:24.229
 ranking striking though signs yes you 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:27.199
 Always want more and then you will read 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:29.690
 that you then again cover in the what the 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.970
 in the future 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.889
 everyone who knows me knows me for that 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.229
 the highest goes and all highest 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.470
 a first place only sometimes there are too 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:41.240
 sometimes moments for clarity 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.010
 to create that other more 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.900
 have options than we but that 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.880
 does not mean that when our us 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.010
 satisfy with a second of or 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.020
 and celebrates in fifth place no we go 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.310
 for the very highest 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.949
 there are seven boys in the 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.250
 preselection that that gives enough 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:00.380
 that is in that respect too 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.539
 level and then it's up to us 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.160
 to show that we actually do 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:06.160
 count and that's what we go for
