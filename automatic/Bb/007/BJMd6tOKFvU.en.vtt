00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.050
 reset it perfect then 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.180

 Someone or yourself leads to 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.600
 experience for your life. 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.160

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.860

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.630
 size of the problem this can give 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.240
 Someone with 120 has

 case of that card 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.539
 vanderson joas you paid something was in 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.250
 warranty was vanderson and 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.920

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.740
 mail or by repair 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.599
 daniel codelco carvalho thinks of these 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.160

 everything else 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.050
 and take a goal I do not know if they are generic anymore 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.030
 in the expo - form an invoice then 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.610
 theoretically they have to be exchanged 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.230
 even certain parts note that the appliance 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.510

 that did not count an item that the 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.359
