one and the missile really doesn't aim
fire<00:03:38.410> pretty<00:03:39.410> cheap<00:03:39.739> but<00:03:40.069> I<00:03:41.030> would<00:03:41.329> never

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
fire pretty cheap but I would never

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.750 
fire pretty cheap but I would never
really<00:03:41.870> on<00:03:41.989> fire<00:03:42.349> anyway<00:03:42.739> looks<00:03:43.160> pretty<00:03:43.609> cool

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
really on fire anyway looks pretty cool

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.780 
really on fire anyway looks pretty cool
with<00:03:43.879> the<00:03:44.000> missile<00:03:44.329> just<00:03:44.540> in<00:03:44.840> there<00:03:45.079> and<00:03:45.790> a

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
with the missile just in there and a

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:55.259 
with the missile just in there and a
little<00:03:47.389> white<00:03:47.660> gun<00:03:51.819> so<00:03:52.819> yeah<00:03:53.560> pretty<00:03:54.560> basic

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
little white gun so yeah pretty basic

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.270 
little white gun so yeah pretty basic
absolutely<00:03:56.269> no<00:03:56.569> off<00:03:56.870> leg<00:03:57.139> articulation<00:03:57.949> the

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
absolutely no off leg articulation the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.189 
absolutely no off leg articulation the
only<00:03:58.519> reason<00:03:58.699> why<00:03:58.940> this<00:03:59.000> is<00:03:59.419> actually<00:03:59.810> one<00:04:00.169> of

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:00.199 
only reason why this is actually one of

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.949 
only reason why this is actually one of
my<00:04:00.290> favorite<00:04:00.379> characters<00:04:01.099> is<00:04:01.370> I<00:04:01.579> never<00:04:02.389> had

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
my favorite characters is I never had

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.050 
my favorite characters is I never had
him<00:04:03.379> when<00:04:03.919> he<00:04:03.980> first<00:04:04.190> came<00:04:04.280> I<00:04:04.519> I<00:04:04.549> didn't<00:04:04.940> really

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
him when he first came I I didn't really

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.050 
him when he first came I I didn't really
have<00:04:05.180> a<00:04:05.919> version<00:04:06.919> of<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:07.370> character<00:04:07.579> in<00:04:07.849> till

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
have a version of the character in till

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.780 
have a version of the character in till
generation<00:04:08.629> to<00:04:10.269> when<00:04:11.269> that<00:04:11.479> came<00:04:11.690> out<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:13.310> I'm

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
generation to when that came out and I'm

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.310 
generation to when that came out and I'm
just<00:04:14.269> the<00:04:14.479> idea<00:04:14.659> of<00:04:15.049> the<00:04:16.090> torso<00:04:17.090> folding<00:04:17.840> on<00:04:18.019> to

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
just the idea of the torso folding on to

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.229 
just the idea of the torso folding on to
the<00:04:18.470> chest<00:04:18.709> was<00:04:18.949> such<00:04:19.159> a<00:04:19.190> cool<00:04:19.489> idea<00:04:19.549> to<00:04:19.970> me

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
the chest was such a cool idea to me

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.810 
the chest was such a cool idea to me
that<00:04:20.709> always<00:04:21.709> wanted<00:04:22.490> this<00:04:22.639> one<00:04:24.039> when

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
that always wanted this one when

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.760 
that always wanted this one when
I<00:04:25.880> didn't<00:04:26.810> get<00:04:27.020> my<00:04:27.170> first<00:04:27.380> one<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.740> a

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
I didn't get my first one to a

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.020 
I didn't get my first one to a
generation<00:04:28.100> to<00:04:28.430> then<00:04:29.200> this<00:04:30.200> one<00:04:30.580> was<00:04:31.580> reissued

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
generation to then this one was reissued

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.690 
generation to then this one was reissued
in<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.360> United<00:04:32.690> States<00:04:33.130> so<00:04:34.130> it's<00:04:34.280> always<00:04:34.520> been

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
in the United States so it's always been

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.670 
in the United States so it's always been
one<00:04:34.910> of<00:04:34.940> my<00:04:35.030> favorite<00:04:35.780> designs<00:04:36.110> for<00:04:36.440> a

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
one of my favorite designs for a

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.060 
one of my favorite designs for a
generation<00:04:37.280> one<00:04:37.550> figure<00:04:38.410> he<00:04:39.410> does<00:04:39.590> have<00:04:39.860> a

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
generation one figure he does have a

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.040 
generation one figure he does have a
little<00:04:40.430> bit<00:04:40.640> more<00:04:40.970> positive<00:04:41.900> light

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
little bit more positive light

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.230 
little bit more positive light
articulation<00:04:42.920> as<00:04:43.010> if<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.760> want<00:04:43.940> to<00:04:44.030> call<00:04:44.180> that

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
articulation as if you want to call that

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.980 
articulation as if you want to call that
elbow<00:04:45.190> articulation<00:04:46.190> you<00:04:47.120> know<00:04:47.360> there's<00:04:47.750> not

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
elbow articulation you know there's not

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.690 
elbow articulation you know there's not
really<00:04:48.230> much<00:04:48.530> of<00:04:48.590> a<00:04:49.900> arm<00:04:51.010> that<00:04:52.010> really<00:04:52.460> touches

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
really much of a arm that really touches

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.250 
really much of a arm that really touches
to<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.570> elbow<00:04:53.930> but<00:04:54.770> then<00:04:54.920> this<00:04:55.100> part<00:04:55.340> can<00:04:56.260> turn

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
to the elbow but then this part can turn

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.140 
to the elbow but then this part can turn
around<00:04:57.410> and<00:04:57.770> if<00:04:58.400> you<00:04:58.490> really<00:04:58.760> want<00:04:59.030> to<00:04:59.090> get
