 hello everyone is julien for the trick 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.000
 of the week number 4 is today 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.910
 I will show you how to change the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.109
 wallpaper imposed by a theme so there 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.320
 as you can see I have the theme 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.060
 insein color 2 which is installed and therefore 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.240
 with this theme we have a wallpaper 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.500
 multicolored who puts himself alone 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.029
 and ben I do not like this wallpaper and 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.199
 when you have photos and we 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.690
 want to put our wallpapers 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.210
 personal ben the change is made 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.399
 not just because the bottom 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.190
 multicolored screen is imposed by the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.469
 theme so to change it needs everything 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.079
 just go in ifile which is a 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.000
 paid application of cydia and who you 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.160
 allows to explore all the files of 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.559
 your iphone so we will go in 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.750
 the root that is going so you click 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.910
 on the little house you do 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.070
 previous so var and life is there 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.890
 so you go down you while 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.780
 bottom you will see here stage you 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.180
 open this stage you go in the theme 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.590
 these themes point numbers with 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.420
 letters it changes depending on your 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.360
 apparatus 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.220
 so I tell you m then we open 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.009
 the theme where there is the wallpaper so 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.990
 in fine two colored and we're going all 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:24.840
 simply delete the file 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.409
 wallpaper by sliding up delete the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.049
 wallpaper 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.720
 @ 2 x is for the wallpapers in 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.079
 do retina if you have an ipod touch 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.210
 4g or iphone 4 4s you are going to have 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.009
 wyclef hours to your x's basics 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.729
 should be deleted 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.860
 since it is a retina wallpaper 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.090
 so you delete the two files or 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.100
 fears 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.670
 after you just have to do a little 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.170
 string for the change to take place 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.250

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.810
 finished here as you can see the 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.090
 wallpaper has changed and that's my 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.140
 wallpaper be analyzed against 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.840
 can see as soon as the theme there was a 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.429
 small widget whose room removed from 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.159
 baget gets when I was locked 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:09.019
 frozen view yeah that's it we see a 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.230
 hundredth of his common sense either to be a 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.790
 little bug related to the theme but with the 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.590
 other classic themes so without 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.250
 widgets it works perfectly 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.900
