00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.350
 Susanne Hofmann 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.029
 I am very happy that we are one 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.890
 talk a bit about your strategy 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.869
 can and about what was important in 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.189
 last year completely 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.539
 basically asked why did they 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.990
 participated in the simulation game 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.849
 stock market 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.949
 On the one hand it is like that in ours 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.649
 Sparkasse it is since this year or 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.969
 2012 duty 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.800
 but I would not have it if not now 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.070
 Duty I would have been to everyone 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.420
 I have to say that because I'm in front of 34 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.280
 years at school ever 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.110
 had participated and that has a lot 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.360
 fun and that's why I have to 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.370
 in any case my colleagues in the boat 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.320
 brought one must look directly times 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.180
 what they have played everything they have 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.320
 nokia, for example, salt lattice and 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.730
 Thyssen Krupp acted 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.980
 Why have just come to this 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.629
 securities chosen for the most part 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.309
 again nokia force that was simply out 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.409
 because of the degree of the new 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.400
 windows phone editor and then 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.680
 thinks it can be good 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.479
 Also, she was so nokia fresh 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.890
 was market leader and therefore easy 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.450
 to rebuild a market share 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.890
 wanted to 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.049
 and yes we never wanted to default 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.299
 kv like apple or something that everyone has 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.759
 We ask you to decide this +43 values 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.450
 their addresses never resell 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.650
 simply because he is getting used to it 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.939
 Thyssen and Salzgitter by 1 expert 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.439
 We were solid today 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.700
 just potential still looked 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.180
 because they were twice as high 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.280
 his 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.869
 such a game round the ten weeks 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.610
 how did you experience this game? 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.020
 they are very interesting for us 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.220
 between lower it quickly like that 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.659
 actually is going on because we want 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.420
 not right from the beginning on place 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.710
 one exactly and how are they ? 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.240
 I inform you that it is relative 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.220
 difficult good and fast 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.590
 Information on the individual values ​​too 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.930
 So mainly for 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.460
 internet onvista and about colleagues 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.250
 at my own in the market area have the 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.880
 supports us and that we too 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.009
 still the question where 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.310
 you will receive total support 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.270
 certainly not just in your team or 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.610
 she must say so clearly 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.840
 Kreisstädter and the soundhead with me 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.280
 In the market area friend says she has 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.050
 but it supports us a lot for that 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.080
 Of course a woman y su third team 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.849
 possible come back to you declared 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.000
 when did they realize that it was then 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.489
 lead wide space in the front field 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.830
 could be enough that was as on 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.120
 At the beginning we always looked daily 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.510
 in the square we stand how it looks 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.209
 out 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.470
 At the beginning it was like that at some point 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.940
 times place three Sparkasse Pfaffenhofen 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.130
 We were already looking forward to something 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.209
 because it is still a third place but 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.640
 further open 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.709
 his last days are sometime 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.400
 times place one Germany then equal 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.420
 always called yes what to do now 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.849
 and it's actually sometime 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.500
 Clark and we showered by 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.030
 were increasingly realized has the 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.040
 Messages are coming that we are after 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.060
 stuttgart and that we can the two 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.130
 spend days 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.470
 what do you take for yourself and 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.010
 personally from this game plan game 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.829
 stock exchange of the year 2012 with general so 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.209
 not something new, not really because we 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.200
 have a lot in the training 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.519
 learn the topic 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.950
 but what you take with you in any case 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.180
 I think that's possible 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.010
 Often when you look at the topic 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.739
 busy that no matter how much money 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.420
 more uses that one no longer 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.250
 should need because it can from the one 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.709
 that can be on the other moment 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.750
 abruptly available conclusion 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.459
 ask how do you have this game 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.350
 recommended and above all things the question 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.450
 is like the apprentice participant at 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.750

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.620
 that makes the di frler in the 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.920
 marketing department 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.840
 we have to join forces in groups 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.290
 then report the names to the fastest 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.220

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.989
