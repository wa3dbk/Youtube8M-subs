 minutes 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.429
 a game that I like very much from 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.480
 see and even more to play 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.640

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.980
 interesting proposals we are going to see them 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.180
 together the players impersonate gods 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.369
 peasants at the emperor's court 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.390
 Japanese who wants to grow the

 five possible to place hexes on 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.890
 give the fields non-irrigated fields 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.840
 they can't grow bamboo 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.789
 move the farmer and then do 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.530
 grow the bamboo move the panda and 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.750
 then eat bamboo and put it in the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.120

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.040
 points for the three green eye tiles 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.049
 missions must be irrigated 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.670
 The peasant, however, assign points 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.070
 victory has managed to grow the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.610

 yellow from 4 points 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.810
 three of a kind to me by six points or as two 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.759
 rosa milano 5 points aim of the game is 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.530
 Complete the seven missions if you are 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.270
 games in four for example to have 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.009
 also the two bonus points if you are the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.329
 first the victory points of 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.909
 all players that has the most points 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.320
 victory wins as I told you the game is 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.240
 very simple it did 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.560
 and also the graphics starting from 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.240
 instructions represented as a 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.670
 fumettino went hero belle a 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.600
 see the miniatures on the table then 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.340
 they give that extra touch 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.110
 to the setting which in my opinion is 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.430
 really very well made it gives its own 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.650
 the impression of growing bamboo and 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.180
 he had a panda that is annoying at least 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.220
 that you do not have a certain cream mission 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.080
 I haven't told you about the nut the dub is 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.970
 simply a twist to the game 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.160
 throwing it you represent six 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.810
 types of weather events that 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.060
 they can afford to grow more 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.250
 quickly eat more bamboo or 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.230
 have bonus cards in short 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.120
 small advantages for each player 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.610
 everyone will have at least one because all 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.910
 casts not given at the beginning of the round that 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.220
 tell you the game is nice not to those who know 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.110
 that intrinsic difficulty but can make 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.790
 bring all players closer even who it is 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.239
 novice to the world of games from 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.800
 table 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.050
 the fact is really of the missions of 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.570
 pilot comfortably until the end of the 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.239
 game and if you can play well there 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.590
 your weapons managed to make more use of 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.390
 missions already completed perhaps by 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.560
 somebody else 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.180
 you can win the game without it 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.900
 necessarily arrive first 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.769
 seven missions 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.769
 to the next
