00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.610
 new friends today I'm going to make a new 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.610
 recipe 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.400
 you do not have to do it, you can 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.680
 use buying what happens is that I 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.539
 I prefer to make it home and it has also been 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.149
 the taste that I want as I'm going to do 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:35.739
 a pineapple pudding I added the broth 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:38.970
 Pineapple own and thus go candy 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:42.180
 to see then what are you going to see pineapple 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.920
 well I will do a cutting 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.489
 caramelized the molds and then I'll 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.960
 put pineapple slices in the background 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.809
 Pegadita for the gardener after 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.570
 put some biscuits on top and I've 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.490
 prepared what I'm going to do with with egg 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.550
 cream and sugar 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:05.720
 well beaten everything then we put that 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.610
 split the biscuits and then the oven 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.110
 I do not know how long it will be because 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.550
 I had to give good height I'm going to do it 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.520
 It is almost almost to the top for what 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.350
 audience material for these days 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.900
 that will last two short days of them 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.020
 Well, this is what you have to go 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.450
 doing now right away when I finish 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.729
 eros make caramel caramelize the 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.040
 molds and apart from that I show you the 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.930
 rest 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.159
 Well, the candy I've already taken 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.939
 colour 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:41.030
 see what little color I like that 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.920
 burn and I with these candies more 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.049
 black that is this is a candy 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.959
 toasted but that you can even 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.939
 transparent I do not like candy 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:53.599
 burned because the burned candy 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.689
 brings a bitter taste then now 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:59.329
 thanks is going to be wet books two molds 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:02.929
 and I insist if what is done well if not 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:06.079
 it does is use candy bought 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:09.049
 that also serves you perfectly for 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:12.140
 do it to me is that I like the most 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:14.020
 homemade candy but I recognize that 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.870
 many people 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.770
 it costs him to do it then the doctor of 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.260
 billing or you put candy purchased 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.670
 or you do it like me without more 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.670
 now let's take this left over here 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.350
 and in this way we wet perfectly 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.350
 the two edges 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.740
 he puts it like this to keep droplets that 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.990
 fall 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.370
 fall to the house and do not mess me, you have to 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.840
 be very careful when handling the 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.440
 candy 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.099
 I never tire of repeating that this burns 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.900
 an outrageous thing or if you drop a 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.900
 candy droplet in hand 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.130
 you have the ampule secured but the 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.260
 second set 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.180
 this is a very serious burn the 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.690
 candy burn so you 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.270
 I recommend you take great care to the 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.110
 hour of 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:13.680
 to use good already cut the other 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.360
 pineapple slices in half and now what 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.510
 only that I limit myself to doing is 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.740
 place them here on top of the candy that 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.740
 I was little stuck 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.660
 so well placed because this is then 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.020
 then it 's what you're going to see when you 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.880
 let's turn around so look to see 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.300
 if you see it I think that they are appreciated 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.920
 or well placed so that later when 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.220
 let's turn over our mobile this 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.540
 beautiful 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.540
 good other 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.379
 you do not know 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.880
 here we put it is 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.710
 and even better 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.700
 you have to put him 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.700
 and biscuits 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.850
 these are too good 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.160
 and so 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.450
 exactly 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.020
 the same 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:27.290
 that I've been a bizcochito here 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.850
 that I did not want to leave and you take it clear 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.870
 sponge cake that you start that you do not 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.500
 let's eat 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:39.120
 with what we eat in this good house and 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.230
 now on this I will throw the mixture of 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.600
 milk and eggs that I would have done now 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:47.020
 same 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.020
 that's why all of Spain 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.840
 why 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.240
 give him leave a jiffy that prepares 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.069
 everything for 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.729
 to make the market to add here to 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:05:01.490
 good enough I have here already to beat 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:04.370
 the 10 new ones now I will add 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.340
 -it is spoonful of sugar to see 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.789
 if they did not hit a goal each camera 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.300
 we will try not ten spoonfuls 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:16.539
 sugar tureens 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:22.979
 is one tablespoon per egg is true if 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:22.979
 we use 612 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:34.830
 9 and 10 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:38.930
 and now we have to empty well duckling 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.930
 until you have to go 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:53.830
 I was already beaten 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:57.240
 we only have to put ourselves in the molds and 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.240
 let's distribute it 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.689
 The bad thing about this is that the 28 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.729
 they climb up and how good you are 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:07.300
 that take over then we're going to 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.300
 make base 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.910
 so everything has its good side 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:15.010
 and its bad side is rather I'm going to 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.900
 push them down so that they 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.240
 soak to see if papaÃ­tos come 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.420
 because they stay more in the background with the 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.530
 same one spoon 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:27.660
 and I'll try to get them wet as much as possible 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:31.560
 once I have done this I put it to 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:36.260
 oven and you know the jacuzzi and there it goes 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:38.920
 to be so I calculate 40 45 minutes 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:42.910
 in other ways you already know the trick of 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:46.370
 needle is punctured and when we see that it is 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:48.290
 clean then change we have it good 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.320
 this is all that the oven does 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:55.190
 I have with the game of red at 175 degrees 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:57.460
 and I do not put it in the water bath I put it like 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.460
 which one
