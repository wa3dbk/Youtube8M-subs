this time we're going to show you the

original version of the totally know it
you<00:01:47.520> know<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.909> just<00:01:47.939> pop<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.659> out

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
and don't really grab the case so it's

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.139 
and don't really grab the case so it's
taking<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.780> little<00:01:54.899> bit<00:01:55.049> of<00:01:55.140> getting<00:01:55.710> used<00:01:55.829> to

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
because each time you want to put it in

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.179 
because each time you want to put it in
the<00:02:00.390> stand<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:01.290> actually<00:02:01.590> take<00:02:01.770> your<00:02:01.950> thumbs

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.190 
and you unclip them before it comes out
and<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.520> goes<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.840> stand

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
and so it goes in the the to stand

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.130 
and so it goes in the the to stand
positions<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.039> all<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.209> way<00:02:09.300> down<00:02:09.509> for<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
positions and all the way down for the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.520 
positions and all the way down for the
typing

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
typing

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.600 
typing
angle<00:02:11.740> so<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:14.709> know<00:02:14.800> one<00:02:15.010> thing<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.459> I

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
angle so you know one thing that I

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.640 
angle so you know one thing that I
definitely<00:02:16.060> heard<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.690> lot<00:02:16.840> in<00:02:17.050> the<00:02:17.080> comments

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
definitely heard a lot in the comments

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.059 
definitely heard a lot in the comments
were<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.870> other<00:02:19.990> one<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.440> typing

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
were the the other one the the typing

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.690 
were the the other one the the typing
angle<00:02:21.190> seemed<00:02:21.580> really<00:02:22.230> really<00:02:23.230> bouncy<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.010> um

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
angle seemed really really bouncy and um

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.030 
angle seemed really really bouncy and um
you<00:02:25.360> know<00:02:25.510> that<00:02:25.840> does<00:02:26.500> seem<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.709> be<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.920> case

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
you know that does seem to be the case

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.770 
you know that does seem to be the case
if<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.459> if<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:27.819> press<00:02:28.060> up<00:02:28.209> here<00:02:28.480> but<00:02:28.690> if

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
if you if you press up here but if

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.640 
if you if you press up here but if
you're<00:02:29.020> in<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.280> in<00:02:30.610> the<00:02:30.670> typing<00:02:31.180> mode<00:02:31.560> let<00:02:32.560> me

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
you're in the in the typing mode let me

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:43.710 
you're in the in the typing mode let me
type<00:02:32.830> something<00:02:33.010> real<00:02:33.250> quick

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.380 

okay<00:02:44.530> so<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:45.190> didn't<00:02:45.640> bounce<00:02:45.730> too<00:02:45.970> much<00:02:46.150> as<00:02:46.300> i

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
okay so it didn't bounce too much as i

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.290 
okay so it didn't bounce too much as i
was<00:02:46.540> typing<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.550> so<00:02:48.550> far<00:02:48.760> that's<00:02:48.940> that's

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
was typing and so far that's that's

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.860 
was typing and so far that's that's
worked<00:02:49.540> pretty<00:02:49.800> pretty<00:02:50.800> well<00:02:51.040> and<00:02:51.330> i<00:02:52.330> haven't

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
worked pretty pretty well and i haven't

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.390 
worked pretty pretty well and i haven't
had<00:02:52.960> a<00:02:53.020> problem<00:02:53.320> with<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:53.620> even<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:54.280> other

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
had a problem with that even the other

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.670 
had a problem with that even the other
one<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:55.210> know<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.390> press<00:02:55.930> down<00:02:56.140> hard<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:56.560> I

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
one I you know I press down hard and I

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.930 
one I you know I press down hard and I
guess<00:02:56.890> some<00:02:57.700> people<00:02:58.170> took<00:02:59.170> notice<00:02:59.230> of<00:02:59.680> my

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
guess some people took notice of my

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.640 
guess some people took notice of my
pushing<00:03:00.940> real<00:03:01.090> hard<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.510> causing<00:03:02.290> problems

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
pushing real hard and causing problems

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.520 
pushing real hard and causing problems
with<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.860> typing<00:03:03.190> angle<00:03:03.310> but<00:03:03.810> it's<00:03:04.810> it's<00:03:05.260> it's

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
with the typing angle but it's it's it's

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.320 
with the typing angle but it's it's it's
worked<00:03:05.770> pretty<00:03:05.800> well<00:03:06.100> for<00:03:06.160> me<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:09.270> one<00:03:10.270> thing

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
worked pretty well for me the one thing

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.540 
worked pretty well for me the one thing
this<00:03:10.660> this<00:03:10.960> is<00:03:11.140> definitely<00:03:11.590> smart<00:03:11.830> enabled<00:03:12.310> so

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
this this is definitely smart enabled so

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.420 
this this is definitely smart enabled so
as<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:13.630> open<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:14.440> close<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.650> it<00:03:14.950> works<00:03:15.130> every

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
as you open and close it it works every

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.270 
as you open and close it it works every
time<00:03:15.460> and<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:16.840> haven't<00:03:17.230> had<00:03:17.709> a<00:03:17.770> problem<00:03:18.040> with

time and I haven't had a problem with

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.400 
time and I haven't had a problem with

everything<00:03:45.490> I<00:03:45.700> bought<00:03:45.910> another<00:03:46.270> case<00:03:46.600> that<00:03:46.870> I

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
everything I bought another case that I

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.479 
everything I bought another case that I
saw<00:03:47.980> that<00:03:48.160> had<00:03:49.080> had<00:03:50.080> for<00:03:50.410> viewing<00:03:50.980> angles<00:03:51.280> and

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
saw that had had for viewing angles and

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.180 
saw that had had for viewing angles and
I<00:03:51.690> thought<00:03:52.690> well<00:03:52.959> you<00:03:53.650> know<00:03:53.709> I<00:03:53.800> like<00:03:54.010> the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
I thought well you know I like the

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.979 
I thought well you know I like the
original<00:03:54.850> to<00:03:54.970> employer<00:03:55.209> that<00:03:55.420> mobile<00:03:55.720> vision

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
original to employer that mobile vision

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.979 
original to employer that mobile vision
did<00:03:56.340> but<00:03:57.340> you<00:03:58.209> know<00:03:58.239> I<00:03:58.330> think<00:03:58.420> it<00:03:58.720> would<00:03:58.840> be

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
did but you know I think it would be

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.650 
did but you know I think it would be
nice<00:03:59.140> if<00:03:59.170> I<00:03:59.440> had<00:03:59.640> for<00:04:00.640> viewing<00:04:01.030> angle<00:04:01.300> so<00:04:01.420> so<00:04:01.630> I

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
nice if I had for viewing angle so so I

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.590 
nice if I had for viewing angle so so I
got<00:04:01.870> this<00:04:02.580> it<00:04:03.580> could<00:04:03.730> make<00:04:03.880> some<00:04:04.030> big<00:04:04.300> blue

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
got this it could make some big blue

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.259 
got this it could make some big blue
wrecks<00:04:04.900> or<00:04:05.050> something<00:04:05.290> like<00:04:05.380> that<00:04:06.209> you<00:04:07.209> know

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
wrecks or something like that you know

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.990 
wrecks or something like that you know
the<00:04:07.420> first<00:04:07.600> thing<00:04:07.750> I<00:04:07.930> noticed<00:04:08.290> is<00:04:08.580> it<00:04:09.580> has<00:04:09.790> the

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
the first thing I noticed is it has the

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.630 
the first thing I noticed is it has the
same<00:04:10.290> essentially<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.350> same<00:04:11.530> back<00:04:11.860> except

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
same essentially the same back except

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.150 
same essentially the same back except
for<00:04:12.910> the<00:04:13.570> doobly<00:04:13.900> no<00:04:13.959> leather<00:04:14.230> quality<00:04:14.739> is<00:04:14.890> as

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
for the doobly no leather quality is as

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.659 
for the doobly no leather quality is as
much<00:04:15.519> nicer<00:04:15.910> this<00:04:16.090> is<00:04:16.470> much<00:04:17.470> more<00:04:17.500> like<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:18.130> ee

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
much nicer this is much more like the ee

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.909 
much nicer this is much more like the ee
no<00:04:18.729> one<00:04:19.229> feels<00:04:20.229> leaving<00:04:20.530> a<00:04:20.560> little<00:04:20.709> more

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
no one feels leaving a little more

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.340 
no one feels leaving a little more
plastic<00:04:21.310> in<00:04:21.430> that<00:04:22.380> but<00:04:23.380> it<00:04:23.530> also<00:04:23.680> has<00:04:23.979> this

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
plastic in that but it also has this

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.570 
plastic in that but it also has this
second<00:04:26.350> notch<00:04:26.590> in<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:26.950> front<00:04:27.220> of<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.370> case

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
second notch in the front of the case

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.300 
second notch in the front of the case
and<00:04:27.610> I<00:04:28.030> kind<00:04:28.240> of<00:04:28.300> like<00:04:28.450> having<00:04:28.690> a<00:04:28.930> very<00:04:29.410> smooth

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
and I kind of like having a very smooth

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.800 
and I kind of like having a very smooth
case<00:04:30.640> cover<00:04:30.910> but<00:04:31.150> it<00:04:31.240> does<00:04:31.419> give<00:04:31.630> you<00:04:31.780> a

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
case cover but it does give you a

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.620 
case cover but it does give you a
different<00:04:32.320> angle<00:04:32.770> so<00:04:33.010> let<00:04:33.910> me<00:04:34.060> show<00:04:34.240> you<00:04:34.300> how

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
different angle so let me show you how

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.790 
different angle so let me show you how
this<00:04:35.169> case<00:04:36.180> compares<00:04:37.229> to<00:04:38.229> the<00:04:38.350> tube<00:04:38.500> leaned<00:04:38.680> on

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
this case compares to the tube leaned on

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.409 
this case compares to the tube leaned on
it<00:04:38.860> maybe<00:04:39.310> that<00:04:39.400> can<00:04:39.610> help<00:04:39.669> you<00:04:39.910> out<00:04:39.970> since<00:04:40.270> I

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
it maybe that can help you out since I

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.620 
it maybe that can help you out since I
bought<00:04:40.570> two<00:04:41.040> slides<00:04:42.040> in<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.310> same<00:04:42.550> this<00:04:43.390> one

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
bought two slides in the same this one

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.630 
bought two slides in the same this one
is<00:04:43.840> not<00:04:44.050> smart<00:04:44.440> enabled<00:04:44.890> so<00:04:45.010> one<00:04:45.370> thing<00:04:45.490> I'll

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
is not smart enabled so one thing I'll

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.700 
is not smart enabled so one thing I'll
just<00:04:45.729> show<00:04:45.880> you<00:04:45.910> that<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.270> hooks<00:04:46.510> on<00:04:46.780> this<00:04:47.530> one

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
just show you that the hooks on this one

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.890 
just show you that the hooks on this one
are<00:04:47.860> much<00:04:48.070> more<00:04:48.340> like<00:04:48.580> the<00:04:48.850> original<00:04:49.150> to<00:04:49.660> bueno

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
are much more like the original to bueno

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.350 
are much more like the original to bueno
you<00:04:50.590> can<00:04:50.710> see<00:04:50.919> that<00:04:50.950> the<00:04:51.250> angles<00:04:51.700> on<00:04:51.940> how<00:04:52.210> much

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
you can see that the angles on how much

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.820 
you can see that the angles on how much
they're<00:04:52.599> different<00:04:53.020> and<00:04:53.140> this<00:04:53.349> one<00:04:53.530> really

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
they're different and this one really

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.190 
they're different and this one really
grabs<00:04:54.160> in<00:04:54.370> so<00:04:55.000> one<00:04:55.450> of<00:04:55.479> the<00:04:55.599> things<00:04:55.660> I<00:04:55.930> notice

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
grabs in so one of the things I notice

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.090 
grabs in so one of the things I notice
right<00:04:56.289> away<00:04:56.349> is<00:04:56.560> if

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
right away is if

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.180 
right away is if
you<00:04:57.790> can<00:04:57.940> actually<00:04:58.120> let<00:04:59.050> your<00:04:59.230> iPad<00:04:59.620> slip<00:05:00.010> out

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
you can actually let your iPad slip out

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.360 
you can actually let your iPad slip out
the<00:05:00.220> top<00:05:00.550> so<00:05:00.760> I<00:05:00.820> didn't<00:05:01.270> like<00:05:01.360> that<00:05:01.390> as<00:05:01.690> much

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
the top so I didn't like that as much

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.640 
the top so I didn't like that as much
when<00:05:03.370> we<00:05:03.460> put<00:05:03.640> it<00:05:03.730> back<00:05:03.850> in<00:05:04.030> here<00:05:04.240> but<00:05:04.990> and<00:05:05.530> then

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
when we put it back in here but and then

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.380 
when we put it back in here but and then
the<00:05:05.740> bottom<00:05:05.920> is<00:05:06.130> the<00:05:06.250> same<00:05:06.460> it<00:05:06.640> has<00:05:06.880> the<00:05:07.180> same

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
the bottom is the same it has the same

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.000 
the bottom is the same it has the same
you<00:05:07.540> know<00:05:07.570> you<00:05:07.840> can<00:05:08.020> come<00:05:08.950> in<00:05:09.100> and<00:05:09.220> out<00:05:09.370> of<00:05:09.580> that

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
you know you can come in and out of that

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.410 
you know you can come in and out of that
if<00:05:12.010> that's<00:05:12.430> what<00:05:12.580> you<00:05:12.700> like<00:05:12.820> me<00:05:13.030> maybe<00:05:13.210> that's

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
if that's what you like me maybe that's

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.260 
if that's what you like me maybe that's
better<00:05:13.660> for<00:05:13.930> you<00:05:14.020> but<00:05:14.670> I'm<00:05:15.670> thinking<00:05:16.060> I<00:05:16.150> kind

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
better for you but I'm thinking I kind

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.550 
better for you but I'm thinking I kind
of<00:05:16.360> like<00:05:16.570> the<00:05:16.720> gripping<00:05:17.080> at<00:05:17.170> the<00:05:17.230> bottom<00:05:17.530> so

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
of like the gripping at the bottom so

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.010 
of like the gripping at the bottom so
it's<00:05:17.770> not<00:05:17.890> always<00:05:18.420> slipping<00:05:19.420> at<00:05:19.570> so<00:05:21.870> so<00:05:22.870> the

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
it's not always slipping at so so the

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.780 
it's not always slipping at so so the
viewing<00:05:23.290> angles<00:05:23.620> and<00:05:23.830> I<00:05:23.920> thought<00:05:24.130> you<00:05:24.730> know

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
viewing angles and I thought you know

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.550 
viewing angles and I thought you know
the<00:05:24.940> main<00:05:25.120> reason<00:05:25.510> I<00:05:25.600> bought<00:05:25.750> this<00:05:25.810> case<00:05:26.320> is

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
the main reason I bought this case is

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.560 
the main reason I bought this case is
for<00:05:26.980> because<00:05:27.310> it<00:05:27.460> has<00:05:27.580> four<00:05:27.880> slots<00:05:28.240> and<00:05:28.480> I

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
for because it has four slots and I

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.540 
for because it has four slots and I
thought<00:05:28.750> that<00:05:28.900> would<00:05:28.990> be<00:05:29.080> nice<00:05:29.350> but<00:05:29.680> what<00:05:30.430> I've

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
thought that would be nice but what I've

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.840 
thought that would be nice but what I've
noticed<00:05:30.730> is<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.650> the<00:05:32.650> slots<00:05:32.980> don't<00:05:33.520> hold<00:05:33.730> the

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
noticed is the the slots don't hold the

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.380 
noticed is the the slots don't hold the
bottom<00:05:34.120> one<00:05:34.270> barely<00:05:34.660> holds<00:05:35.080> it<00:05:35.140> all<00:05:35.260> and<00:05:36.390> now

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
bottom one barely holds it all and now

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.240 
bottom one barely holds it all and now
you<00:05:37.450> keep<00:05:37.930> putting<00:05:38.140> it<00:05:38.320> in<00:05:38.410> at<00:05:38.650> any<00:05:38.800> prep<00:05:39.070> any

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
you keep putting it in at any prep any

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.490 
you keep putting it in at any prep any
cap<00:05:39.550> at<00:05:39.760> all<00:05:39.940> and<00:05:40.180> then<00:05:40.870> the<00:05:41.880> second<00:05:42.880> one<00:05:42.910> is

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
cap at all and then the second one is

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.020 
cap at all and then the second one is
very<00:05:44.500> similar<00:05:44.950> it's<00:05:45.280> hard<00:05:45.490> to<00:05:45.640> keep<00:05:45.760> them<00:05:45.910> in

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
very similar it's hard to keep them in

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.320 
very similar it's hard to keep them in
there<00:05:46.180> so<00:05:46.590> maybe<00:05:47.590> that's<00:05:47.920> why<00:05:48.190> a<00:05:48.550> mobile

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
there so maybe that's why a mobile

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.660 
there so maybe that's why a mobile
vision<00:05:49.630> didn't<00:05:49.930> do<00:05:50.170> four<00:05:50.710> slots<00:05:51.070> is<00:05:51.340> because

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:51.670 
vision didn't do four slots is because

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.310 
vision didn't do four slots is because
they<00:05:51.820> think<00:05:51.880> the<00:05:52.210> bottom<00:05:52.510> one<00:05:52.630> slide<00:05:52.930> out<00:05:53.110> too

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
they think the bottom one slide out too

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.550 
they think the bottom one slide out too
much<00:05:53.470> but<00:05:54.390> and<00:05:55.390> then<00:05:55.900> this<00:05:55.990> one's<00:05:56.230> all<00:05:56.380> the<00:05:56.470> way

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
much but and then this one's all the way

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.700 
much but and then this one's all the way
back<00:05:56.710> here<00:05:57.120> it<00:05:58.120> also<00:05:58.450> has<00:05:58.840> that<00:05:59.170> extra<00:05:59.650> crease

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
back here it also has that extra crease

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.320 
back here it also has that extra crease
lets<00:06:02.710> you<00:06:02.950> do<00:06:03.220> one<00:06:03.520> more<00:06:03.700> viewing<00:06:04.090> you<00:06:04.210> know<00:06:04.300> I

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
lets you do one more viewing you know I

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.290 
lets you do one more viewing you know I

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
think it's like like this and that's

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.870 
think it's like like this and that's
nice<00:06:10.570> but<00:06:10.750> that<00:06:10.930> what<00:06:11.080> that<00:06:11.140> one<00:06:11.320> seems<00:06:11.880> ex

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
that one seems extra bounty that's kind

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.610 
that one seems extra bounty that's kind
of<00:06:17.200> nice<00:06:17.320> I<00:06:17.680> die<00:06:18.870> it<00:06:19.870> looks<00:06:20.080> about<00:06:20.290> the<00:06:20.440> same

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
of nice I die it looks about the same

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.270 
of nice I die it looks about the same
angle<00:06:21.250> as<00:06:21.400> is<00:06:22.230> the<00:06:23.230> other<00:06:23.380> the<00:06:23.740> mobile<00:06:24.040> vision

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
angle as is the other the mobile vision

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.410 
angle as is the other the mobile vision
tight<00:06:24.490> of<00:06:24.700> it<00:06:24.850> the<00:06:25.150> type<00:06:25.390> and<00:06:25.600> angle<00:06:25.930> so<00:06:27.330> yeah<00:06:28.330> I

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:28.420 
tight of it the type and angle so yeah I

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.970 
tight of it the type and angle so yeah I
don't<00:06:28.510> know<00:06:28.660> it's<00:06:29.050> it's<00:06:29.530> kind<00:06:29.770> of<00:06:29.800> you<00:06:29.950> know

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420 
there's enough there's enough angles

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.840 
there's enough there's enough angles
already<00:06:31.750> I'm<00:06:32.440> not<00:06:32.710> sure<00:06:32.950> if<00:06:33.040> I<00:06:33.130> want<00:06:33.670> this

extra crease in there that it it just

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.100 
extra crease in there that it it just
doesn't<00:06:36.010> look<00:06:36.190> as<00:06:36.340> cling<00:06:36.580> to<00:06:36.700> me<00:06:36.820> but<00:06:37.120> I<00:06:37.360> don't

high-quality<00:06:51.820> leather<00:06:52.290> I'm<00:06:53.290> not<00:06:53.500> sure<00:06:53.560> I

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740 
high-quality leather I'm not sure I

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.350 
high-quality leather I'm not sure I
might<00:06:54.010> send<00:06:54.280> the<00:06:54.340> other<00:06:54.550> one<00:06:54.670> back<00:06:54.850> I<00:06:55.120> might

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 
might send the other one back I might

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.500 
might send the other one back I might
keep<00:06:55.510> both<00:06:56.700> try<00:06:57.700> it<00:06:57.760> out<00:06:57.880> for<00:06:58.030> a<00:06:58.090> little<00:06:58.210> while

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:58.510 
keep both try it out for a little while

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.490 
keep both try it out for a little while
longer<00:06:59.070> they're<00:07:00.070> inexpensive<00:07:00.460> enough<00:07:01.500> but

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
longer they're inexpensive enough but

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.370 
longer they're inexpensive enough but
this<00:07:02.710> this<00:07:03.190> looks<00:07:03.520> like<00:07:03.870> the<00:07:04.870> quality<00:07:05.350> of

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.380 
this this looks like the quality of

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.130 
this this looks like the quality of
leather<00:07:05.530> looks<00:07:06.010> like<00:07:06.220> a<00:07:06.510> like<00:07:07.510> apples<00:07:07.930> case

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:08.140 
leather looks like a like apples case

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.780 
leather looks like a like apples case
that<00:07:08.470> the<00:07:08.740> smart<00:07:09.040> couple

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:09.790 
that the smart couple

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.890 
that the smart couple
cover<00:07:10.060> leather<00:07:10.300> case<00:07:10.630> so<00:07:11.530> I<00:07:11.920> really<00:07:12.670> like<00:07:12.900> what

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:13.900 
cover leather case so I really like what

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.110 
cover leather case so I really like what
they've<00:07:14.050> done<00:07:14.230> here<00:07:14.760> so<00:07:15.760> I'm<00:07:15.850> going<00:07:15.970> to<00:07:16.000> give

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.300 
they've done here so I'm going to give

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:18.310 
this case a five star I'll give this a

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.390 
this case a five star I'll give this a
three<00:07:19.150> or<00:07:19.240> four<00:07:19.540> it's<00:07:20.200> a<00:07:20.260> little<00:07:20.530> feels<00:07:21.280> a

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 
three or four it's a little feels a

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.140 
three or four it's a little feels a
little<00:07:21.550> cheaper<00:07:21.940> so<00:07:22.210> anyway<00:07:23.670> that's<00:07:24.670> all<00:07:24.940> and

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:25.150 
little cheaper so anyway that's all and

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.840 
little cheaper so anyway that's all and
thanks<00:07:25.690> for<00:07:25.810> watching
