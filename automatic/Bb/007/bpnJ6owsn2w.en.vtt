so<00:00:14.160> it's<00:00:14.639> out<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.759> warranty<00:00:15.059> but<00:00:16.020> instead<00:00:16.350> of

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
so it's out of warranty but instead of

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.720 
so it's out of warranty but instead of
just<00:00:16.500> throwing<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.949> away<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.220> actually<00:00:17.490> like

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
just throwing it away I actually like

this<00:00:17.880> case<00:00:18.210> quite<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> bit<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.350> has<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.500> lot<00:00:19.710> of

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
this case quite a bit it has a lot of

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.950 
this case quite a bit it has a lot of
good<00:00:19.920> connections<00:00:20.279> on<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.820> you<00:00:21.720> can<00:00:21.840> see

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
good connections on it you can see

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.960 
good connections on it you can see
firewire<00:00:22.699> eSATA<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.970> USB<00:00:25.699> so<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.730> don't<00:00:26.849> want

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
drive is going bad so I'm just going to

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.089 
drive is going bad so I'm just going to
take<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.449> hard<00:00:30.599> drive<00:00:30.869> out<00:00:31.019> let's<00:00:31.619> see<00:00:31.800> how<00:00:32.040> to

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
take the hard drive out let's see how to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.810 
take the hard drive out let's see how to
take<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> part<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.149> Western<00:00:33.329> Digital<00:00:33.690> my<00:00:34.530> book

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
take a part of Western Digital my book

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.880 
take a part of Western Digital my book
if<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.910> look<00:00:36.030> around<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.360> case<00:00:36.770> you<00:00:37.770> know

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
if you look around the case you know

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.500 
if you look around the case you know
it's<00:00:38.129> pretty<00:00:38.879> much<00:00:39.000> sealed<00:00:39.540> all<00:00:39.840> around<00:00:41.510> you

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
it's pretty much sealed all around you

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.260 
it's pretty much sealed all around you
know<00:00:42.600> there's<00:00:42.780> no<00:00:42.870> really<00:00:43.110> way<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> just<00:00:44.399> take

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
know there's no really way to just take

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.549 
know there's no really way to just take
it<00:00:45.360> apart<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.250> I'm<00:00:47.250> guessing<00:00:48.289> I'll<00:00:49.289> have<00:00:49.410> to

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
it apart so I'm guessing I'll have to

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.279 
it apart so I'm guessing I'll have to
pop<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:50.010> out<00:00:50.280> somehow<00:00:51.090> because<00:00:52.020> see<00:00:52.140> there's

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
pop this out somehow because see there's

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:00.200 
pop this out somehow because see there's
a<00:00:52.320> little<00:00:53.059> Ridge<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:56.780> see<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:59.059> so<00:01:00.059> I'm

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
a little Ridge on this see that so I'm

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.410 
a little Ridge on this see that so I'm
going<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.510> attempt<00:01:01.820> take<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> second<00:01:03.210> part

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
going to attempt take the second part

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.910 
going to attempt take the second part
without<00:01:03.710> put<00:01:04.710> me<00:01:04.799> destroying<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:06.710> down<00:01:07.710> here

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
without put me destroying it down here

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.420 
without put me destroying it down here
towards<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.340> bottom<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.909> case<00:01:09.770> and<00:01:10.770> there

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
towards the bottom of the case and there

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.170 
towards the bottom of the case and there
it<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.700> there<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.450> goes<00:01:13.549> there<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.790> kind<00:01:15.150> of

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
it is there it goes there I just kind of

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.280 
it is there it goes there I just kind of
popped<00:01:15.509> out<00:01:16.100> needed<00:01:17.100> some<00:01:17.280> force<00:01:18.200> alright<00:01:19.200> so

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
popped out needed some force alright so

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.830 
popped out needed some force alright so
you<00:01:19.350> can<00:01:19.470> see<00:01:19.590> how<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.740> clip<00:01:20.700> right<00:01:20.880> here<00:01:21.030> how

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
you can see how that clip right here how

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.620 
you can see how that clip right here how
it's<00:01:22.020> clipped<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.500> there<00:01:23.330> hopefully<00:01:24.330> it's

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
it's clipped in there hopefully it's

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
it's clipped in there hopefully it's
like<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.960> around<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.320> other<00:01:26.280> side<00:01:26.700> as<00:01:26.850> well

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
like that around the other side as well

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.859 
like that around the other side as well
if<00:01:28.650> that's<00:01:28.979> how<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.280> across<00:01:29.659> this<00:01:30.659> other

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
if that's how it is across this other

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.670 
if that's how it is across this other
side<00:01:31.170> here<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.439> well<00:01:31.939> got<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> clip<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.390> there<00:01:33.680> so

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
side here as well got a clip in there so

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.200 
side here as well got a clip in there so
I'm<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:34.890> going<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.810> yank<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.900> apart<00:01:38.210> okay

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
I'm just going to yank that apart okay

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.859 
I'm just going to yank that apart okay
so<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.390> got<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.600> sides<00:01:40.079> off<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.750> to

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
so I got the sides off I just have to

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.870 
so I got the sides off I just have to
figure<00:01:43.079> out<00:01:43.320> how<00:01:43.470> I'm<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.829> pull<00:01:44.759> this

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
figure out how I'm going to pull this

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.999 
figure out how I'm going to pull this
out<00:01:45.500> there<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.619> go

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
out there we go

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.410 
out there we go
it's<00:01:47.520> kind<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.880> timid<00:01:48.119> side<00:01:48.810> way<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.079> think<00:01:49.500> I

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
it's kind of timid side way to think I

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.590 
it's kind of timid side way to think I
should<00:01:51.420> work

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
should work

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.930 
should work
all<00:01:53.170> right<00:01:53.320> they're<00:01:53.500> after<00:01:53.740> some<00:01:54.159> just<00:01:54.700> kind

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
all right they're after some just kind

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.700 
all right they're after some just kind
of<00:01:55.000> pull<00:01:55.659> it<00:01:55.690> on<00:01:55.870> it<00:01:55.990> working<00:01:56.260> it<00:01:56.470> a<00:01:56.500> bit<00:01:56.680> I

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
of pull it on it working it a bit I

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.710 
of pull it on it working it a bit I
finally<00:01:57.100> got<00:01:57.220> this<00:01:57.460> off<00:02:00.420> there<00:02:01.420> it<00:02:01.630> is<00:02:01.890> okay

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
finally got this off there it is okay

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.520 
finally got this off there it is okay
all<00:02:04.720> right<00:02:06.420> though<00:02:07.420> there's<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:08.130> outer<00:02:09.130> shell

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
all right though there's the outer shell

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:18.000 
all right though there's the outer shell
now<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.590> can<00:02:11.800> see<00:02:11.950> how<00:02:12.130> it<00:02:12.280> clips<00:02:12.750> on<00:02:17.010> whoops

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
now you can see how it clips on whoops

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.510 
now you can see how it clips on whoops
clear<00:02:18.580> around<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:19.030> top<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.830> on<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.160> bottom

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
clear around the top and on the bottom

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.449 
clear around the top and on the bottom
here<00:02:21.550> two<00:02:22.410> or<00:02:23.410> so<00:02:23.560> this<00:02:23.650> kind<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:23.950> just<00:02:24.070> pops

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
here two or so this kind of just pops

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.410 
here two or so this kind of just pops
out<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:25.000> kind<00:02:25.300> of<00:02:25.360> clips<00:02:26.200> in<00:02:26.410> down<00:02:26.680> here<00:02:27.420> just

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
out it kind of clips in down here just

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.780 
out it kind of clips in down here just
pop<00:02:28.600> it<00:02:28.780> out<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.980> now<00:02:33.160> I'll<00:02:33.310> have<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.550> remove

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
pop it out and now I'll have to remove

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.550 
pop it out and now I'll have to remove
some<00:02:34.090> screws<00:02:34.330> so<00:02:34.630> I<00:02:34.690> can<00:02:34.840> get<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.110> hard<00:02:35.320> drive

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
some screws so I can get the hard drive

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.930 
some screws so I can get the hard drive
out<00:02:37.530> okay<00:02:38.530> so<00:02:38.620> we<00:02:38.830> removed<00:02:39.160> these<00:02:39.550> screws<00:02:39.910> here

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
out okay so we removed these screws here

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.949 
out okay so we removed these screws here
and<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.450> screws<00:02:40.750> in<00:02:40.930> here<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.410> then<00:02:41.709> this

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
and the screws in here and then this

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.130 
and the screws in here and then this
slides<00:02:43.959> off<00:02:44.730> this<00:02:45.730> is<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.150> control<00:02:46.390> for<00:02:46.930> our

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
slides off this is the control for our

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.949 
slides off this is the control for our
ports<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.060> have<00:02:49.239> these<00:02:49.420> two<00:02:49.480> screws<00:02:49.930> here

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
ports that I have these two screws here

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.960 
ports that I have these two screws here
to<00:02:50.260> remove<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:50.709> I<00:02:50.769> can<00:02:50.920> get<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.489> hard<00:02:51.700> drive

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
to remove so I can get the hard drive

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:00.240 
to remove so I can get the hard drive
out<00:02:53.010> okay<00:02:55.500> just<00:02:56.500> comes<00:02:57.040> right<00:02:57.190> off<00:02:58.980> not<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.100> see

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
out okay just comes right off not to see

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.509 
out okay just comes right off not to see
here<00:03:00.640> that<00:03:00.850> on<00:03:01.510> this<00:03:02.010> part<00:03:03.010> here<00:03:03.160> that<00:03:03.190> we<00:03:03.340> took

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
here that on this part here that we took

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.240 
here that on this part here that we took
off<00:03:04.110> that's<00:03:05.110> actually<00:03:05.470> where<00:03:05.590> your<00:03:05.709> hard

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
off that's actually where your hard

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.310 
off that's actually where your hard
drive<00:03:06.519> is<00:03:06.930> plugging<00:03:07.930> into<00:03:08.079> the<00:03:08.440> SATA<00:03:08.850> or<00:03:09.850> SATA

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
drive is plugging into the SATA or SATA

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.560 
drive is plugging into the SATA or SATA
ports<00:03:11.549> kind<00:03:12.549> of<00:03:12.610> plugs<00:03:12.850> in<00:03:13.060> like<00:03:13.750> this<00:03:13.959> here<00:03:15.570> by

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
ports kind of plugs in like this here by

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.699 
ports kind of plugs in like this here by
the<00:03:16.630> way<00:03:16.780> when<00:03:16.959> you're<00:03:17.049> taking<00:03:17.380> off<00:03:17.470> this

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
the way when you're taking off this

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.560 
the way when you're taking off this
metal<00:03:18.010> part<00:03:18.160> make<00:03:18.370> sure<00:03:18.519> you<00:03:18.549> instead<00:03:19.360> of<00:03:19.420> just

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
metal part make sure you instead of just

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.069 
metal part make sure you instead of just
sliding<00:03:20.019> straight<00:03:20.230> over<00:03:20.650> slide<00:03:21.250> up<00:03:21.519> first

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
sliding straight over slide up first

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.280 
sliding straight over slide up first
because<00:03:23.079> that's<00:03:23.440> what<00:03:23.680> this<00:03:24.280> engages<00:03:25.140> in<00:03:26.140> our

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
because that's what this engages in our

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.610 
because that's what this engages in our
ports<00:03:26.709> here<00:03:26.860> and<00:03:27.070> then<00:03:27.190> slide<00:03:27.640> it<00:03:27.790> over

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
ports here and then slide it over

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.610 
ports here and then slide it over
actually<00:03:29.620> found<00:03:30.130> another<00:03:30.400> hard<00:03:30.670> drive<00:03:31.620> it

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
actually found another hard drive it

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.880 
actually found another hard drive it
does<00:03:32.769> have<00:03:32.920> near<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.130> capacity<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:34.620> this<00:03:35.620> hard

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
does have near the capacity of this hard

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.220 
does have near the capacity of this hard
drive<00:03:36.100> but<00:03:36.760> it<00:03:36.910> does<00:03:37.120> work<00:03:37.360> so<00:03:37.390> for<00:03:38.079> now<00:03:38.200> I

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
drive but it does work so for now I

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.100 
drive but it does work so for now I
guess<00:03:38.470> we'll<00:03:38.970> install<00:03:39.970> this<00:03:40.209> hard<00:03:40.450> drive<00:03:40.660> here

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
guess we'll install this hard drive here

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.870 
guess we'll install this hard drive here
so<00:03:41.920> here's<00:03:42.070> our<00:03:42.160> hard<00:03:42.370> drive<00:03:42.610> that<00:03:42.760> we're

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
so here's our hard drive that we're

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.590 
so here's our hard drive that we're
going<00:03:43.030> to<00:03:43.200> install<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:45.370> I'll<00:03:46.030> simply<00:03:46.420> just

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
going to install and I'll simply just

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.120 
going to install and I'll simply just
you<00:03:47.019> know<00:03:47.110> repeat<00:03:47.470> these<00:03:47.890> steps<00:03:48.600> also<00:03:49.600> go<00:03:49.780> on

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
you know repeat these steps also go on

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.740 
you know repeat these steps also go on
certain<00:03:51.130> direction<00:03:51.400> we<00:03:52.299> will<00:03:52.360> make<00:03:52.540> sure<00:03:52.660> this

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
certain direction we will make sure this

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.220 
certain direction we will make sure this
cutout<00:03:53.110> here<00:03:53.410> leaves<00:03:54.040> your<00:03:54.220> porch<00:03:54.489> exposed<00:03:55.230> so

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
cutout here leaves your porch exposed so

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.190 
cutout here leaves your porch exposed so
we<00:03:56.380> can<00:03:56.530> put<00:03:57.010> this<00:03:57.130> on<00:03:57.280> there<00:03:57.900> all<00:03:58.900> right<00:03:59.019> so<00:03:59.079> we

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
we can put this on there all right so we

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.020 
we can put this on there all right so we
got<00:03:59.320> those<00:03:59.530> four<00:03:59.980> screws<00:04:00.130> installed<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:00.970> now

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
got those four screws installed and now

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.659 
got those four screws installed and now
we'll<00:04:01.150> put<00:04:01.359> on<00:04:01.480> this<00:04:02.070> plate<00:04:03.070> here<00:04:03.340> with<00:04:03.519> our

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
we'll put on this plate here with our

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:06.540 
we'll put on this plate here with our
ports<00:04:04.120> on<00:04:04.329> it<00:04:04.359> again

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
ports on it again

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.820 
ports on it again
just<00:04:07.550> go<00:04:07.760> on<00:04:07.940> here

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.500 

it'll<00:04:12.830> just<00:04:13.040> slide<00:04:13.730> in<00:04:13.910> there<00:04:14.060> just<00:04:14.209> make<00:04:14.360> sure

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
it'll just slide in there just make sure

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.780 
it'll just slide in there just make sure
you<00:04:15.019> have<00:04:15.110> a<00:04:15.170> good<00:04:15.319> connection<00:04:15.579> of<00:04:16.579> course

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
you have a good connection of course

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.189 
you have a good connection of course
before<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.150> replace<00:04:17.449> those<00:04:17.630> screws<00:04:17.959> make

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
before you replace those screws make

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.270 
before you replace those screws make
sure<00:04:18.410> these<00:04:18.560> are<00:04:19.220> under<00:04:19.609> these<00:04:19.790> tabs<00:04:20.299> here<00:04:21.280> all

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
right there we go now put those screws

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.740 
right there we go now put those screws
in<00:04:26.449> there

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
in there

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.719

all right that's done got our screws all

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.939 
all right that's done got our screws all
installed<00:04:30.310> now<00:04:31.310> comes<00:04:31.699> the<00:04:31.910> part<00:04:32.120> where<00:04:32.419> we

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
installed now comes the part where we

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.890 
installed now comes the part where we
the<00:04:33.949> fear<00:04:34.220> how<00:04:34.310> to<00:04:34.370> put<00:04:34.610> this<00:04:34.699> back<00:04:34.940> in<00:04:35.150> so<00:04:35.780> this

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
the fear how to put this back in so this

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.030 
the fear how to put this back in so this
is<00:04:36.050> pretty<00:04:36.229> simple<00:04:36.470> you'll<00:04:36.680> just<00:04:36.800> want<00:04:37.010> to

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
is pretty simple you'll just want to

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.930 
is pretty simple you'll just want to
make<00:04:37.220> sure<00:04:37.250> you<00:04:37.520> match<00:04:37.850> up<00:04:37.880> your<00:04:39.280> ports<00:04:40.280> here

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
make sure you match up your ports here

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.460 
make sure you match up your ports here
with<00:04:41.750> your<00:04:41.900> ports<00:04:42.200> here<00:04:44.169> shouldn't<00:04:45.169> be<00:04:45.290> too

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
with your ports here shouldn't be too

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.700 
with your ports here shouldn't be too
difficult<00:04:45.500> you<00:04:46.720> can<00:04:47.720> see<00:04:47.900> in<00:04:48.020> here<00:04:48.320> how<00:04:48.530> this

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
difficult you can see in here how this

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.969 
difficult you can see in here how this
drive<00:04:49.540> sits<00:04:50.540> and<00:04:50.690> others<00:04:50.930> these<00:04:51.710> like

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
drive sits and others these like

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:57.760 
drive sits and others these like
rubberized<00:04:52.490> sort<00:04:52.910> of<00:04:53.000> wrists<00:04:56.500> all<00:04:57.500> right<00:04:57.650> see

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
rubberized sort of wrists all right see

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.250 
rubberized sort of wrists all right see
how<00:04:57.830> that<00:04:58.010> slides<00:04:58.370> in<00:04:58.580> there<00:04:59.620> nice<00:05:00.620> tight

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
how that slides in there nice tight

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.909 
how that slides in there nice tight
fitting<00:05:04.360> same<00:05:05.360> for<00:05:05.539> this<00:05:05.660> side<00:05:05.770> so<00:05:06.770> you'll

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
fitting same for this side so you'll

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.100 
fitting same for this side so you'll
kind<00:05:07.100> of<00:05:07.160> angle<00:05:07.610> your<00:05:07.789> drive<00:05:08.120> here<00:05:08.479> and<00:05:08.960> then

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
kind of angle your drive here and then

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.040 
kind of angle your drive here and then
the<00:05:09.229> other<00:05:09.380> side<00:05:09.650> can<00:05:09.889> rest<00:05:10.990> we're<00:05:11.990> here

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
the other side can rest we're here

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.350 
the other side can rest we're here
alright<00:05:15.050> there<00:05:15.710> we<00:05:15.740> go<00:05:15.950> look<00:05:16.700> on<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:16.910> back<00:05:17.120> you

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
alright there we go look on the back you

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.990 
alright there we go look on the back you
see<00:05:17.570> it's<00:05:17.690> correct<00:05:18.050> all<00:05:19.010> of<00:05:19.310> our<00:05:19.460> ports<00:05:19.820> are

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
see it's correct all of our ports are

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.469 
see it's correct all of our ports are
exposed<00:05:20.450> correctly<00:05:22.150> then<00:05:23.150> we<00:05:23.180> have<00:05:23.389> this

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
exposed correctly then we have this

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.659 
exposed correctly then we have this
little<00:05:23.690> plastic<00:05:24.080> piece<00:05:24.320> to<00:05:24.800> put<00:05:24.950> on<00:05:25.099> which<00:05:25.340> I

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
little plastic piece to put on which I

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.930 
little plastic piece to put on which I
believe<00:05:26.360> actually<00:05:26.660> carries<00:05:27.050> the<00:05:27.260> light<00:05:27.940> to

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
believe actually carries the light to

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.010 
believe actually carries the light to
this<00:05:29.060> front<00:05:29.389> panel<00:05:29.750> here<00:05:29.930> so<00:05:30.400> we<00:05:31.400> can<00:05:31.550> see<00:05:32.020> when

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
this front panel here so we can see when

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.219 
this front panel here so we can see when
there's<00:05:33.169> activity<00:05:33.740> going<00:05:33.979> on<00:05:34.099> if<00:05:34.820> you<00:05:34.940> look

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
there's activity going on if you look

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.190 
there's activity going on if you look
down<00:05:36.229> in<00:05:36.440> here<00:05:36.520> you<00:05:37.520> see<00:05:37.789> those<00:05:38.060> lights<00:05:38.840> in

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
down in here you see those lights in

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.219 
down in here you see those lights in
there<00:05:40.060> so<00:05:41.060> there's<00:05:41.240> a<00:05:41.300> slot<00:05:41.660> here<00:05:41.720> on<00:05:42.139> the

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
there so there's a slot here on the

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:46.060 
there so there's a slot here on the
front<00:05:43.240> where<00:05:44.240> this<00:05:44.389> connects<00:05:44.830> see<00:05:45.830> how<00:05:45.889> that's

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
front where this connects see how that's

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.219 
front where this connects see how that's
kind<00:05:46.190> of<00:05:46.280> like<00:05:46.400> a<00:05:46.430> comb<00:05:46.789> kind<00:05:47.720> of<00:05:47.780> match<00:05:47.960> those

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
kind of like a comb kind of match those

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:50.700 
kind of like a comb kind of match those
up

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.920 

on<00:05:51.250> the<00:05:51.460> inside<00:05:51.850> I<00:05:51.910> know<00:05:52.180> you<00:05:52.240> can't<00:05:52.509> see<00:05:52.720> that

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
on the inside I know you can't see that

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.120 
on the inside I know you can't see that
but<00:05:53.169> I<00:05:53.520> can<00:05:54.520> see<00:05:54.669> it<00:05:54.759> from<00:05:54.850> this<00:05:55.000> angle

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.409 

don't<00:06:00.130> know<00:06:00.310> if<00:06:00.460> I<00:06:00.520> can<00:06:00.669> show<00:06:00.880> that<00:06:00.910> very<00:06:01.270> well

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
don't know if I can show that very well

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:05.070 
don't know if I can show that very well
on<00:06:01.570> camera<00:06:02.729> but<00:06:03.729> those<00:06:03.940> combs<00:06:04.360> are<00:06:04.720> sitting

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
on camera but those combs are sitting

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.180 
on camera but those combs are sitting
right<00:06:05.289> on<00:06:05.680> top<00:06:05.830> of<00:06:06.550> those<00:06:07.120> lights<00:06:08.009> pushed<00:06:09.009> into

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
right on top of those lights pushed into

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.310 
right on top of those lights pushed into
that<00:06:09.310> rubber<00:06:09.669> mounting<00:06:10.330> area<00:06:10.630> just<00:06:10.840> a<00:06:10.960> little

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
that rubber mounting area just a little

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.969 
that rubber mounting area just a little
bit<00:06:12.600> so<00:06:13.600> I<00:06:13.630> should<00:06:13.840> carry<00:06:14.080> the<00:06:14.229> light<00:06:14.470> so<00:06:14.919> we

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979 
bit so I should carry the light so we

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:18.330 
bit so I should carry the light so we
can<00:06:15.100> see<00:06:15.220> the<00:06:15.340> activity<00:06:16.500> okay<00:06:17.500> so<00:06:17.560> that<00:06:17.949> is<00:06:17.979> it

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
can see the activity okay so that is it

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.159 
can see the activity okay so that is it
for<00:06:19.919> the<00:06:20.919> inner<00:06:21.100> workings<00:06:21.550> now<00:06:21.880> comes<00:06:22.180> this

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
for the inner workings now comes this

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.430 
for the inner workings now comes this
outer<00:06:23.440> shell<00:06:24.270> I'll<00:06:25.270> go<00:06:25.509> by<00:06:25.630> the<00:06:25.690> logos<00:06:26.169> on<00:06:26.320> the

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
outer shell I'll go by the logos on the

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.670 
outer shell I'll go by the logos on the
shell<00:06:26.710> that<00:06:26.889> this<00:06:27.009> is<00:06:27.160> the<00:06:27.310> bottom<00:06:27.870> and<00:06:28.870> I'll

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
shell that this is the bottom and I'll

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.100 
shell that this is the bottom and I'll
start<00:06:30.400> by<00:06:30.550> sliding<00:06:30.910> it<00:06:31.120> on<00:06:33.810> just<00:06:34.810> give<00:06:34.960> it<00:06:35.050> a

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
start by sliding it on just give it a

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.320 
start by sliding it on just give it a
real<00:06:35.259> good<00:06:35.289> push<00:06:35.729> should<00:06:36.729> pop<00:06:37.000> right<00:06:37.150> into

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
real good push should pop right into

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.190 
see if our new drive works I'm going to

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:54.610 
see if our new drive works I'm going to
plug<00:06:48.580> it<00:06:48.699> back<00:06:48.729> in<00:06:48.970> with<00:06:49.090> eSATA

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.830 

first<00:06:55.340> I'll<00:06:55.550> turn<00:06:55.820> on<00:06:55.850> the<00:06:56.000> computer<00:06:56.750> and<00:06:58.840> we

00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 
first I'll turn on the computer and we

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.040 
first I'll turn on the computer and we
can<00:06:59.960> see<00:07:00.080> the<00:07:00.199> drive<00:07:00.470> is<00:07:00.729> appearing<00:07:01.729> to<00:07:01.820> work

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.050 
can see the drive is appearing to work

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.210 
can see the drive is appearing to work
so<00:07:03.050> I<00:07:03.080> have<00:07:03.199> to<00:07:03.290> let<00:07:03.410> it<00:07:03.470> boot<00:07:03.680> all<00:07:03.830> the<00:07:03.979> way<00:07:04.100> up

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:04.220 
so I have to let it boot all the way up

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.700 
so I have to let it boot all the way up
to<00:07:04.610> see<00:07:05.060> if<00:07:05.150> the<00:07:05.360> drivers<00:07:05.780> recognize<00:07:06.290> make

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.930 
properly right here we can see our drive
is<00:07:12.919> showing<00:07:13.280> up<00:07:13.660> local<00:07:14.660> disk<00:07:14.900> F<00:07:15.760> it<00:07:16.760> already

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:33.470 
happen to have a my book that you know

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.350 
happen to have a my book that you know
stops<00:07:33.830> performing<00:07:34.490> as<00:07:34.580> it<00:07:34.699> should<00:07:34.940> you<00:07:35.150> know

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 
stops performing as it should you know

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.900

don't<00:07:35.630> throw<00:07:35.870> away<00:07:35.990> the<00:07:36.919> my<00:07:37.070> book<00:07:37.310> the<00:07:37.639> case

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:37.910 
don't throw away the my book the case

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.090 
don't throw away the my book the case
because<00:07:38.270> these<00:07:38.389> cases<00:07:38.660> are<00:07:38.960> usually<00:07:39.830> really

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:40.100 
because these cases are usually really

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.800 
because these cases are usually really
nice<00:07:40.370> especially<00:07:40.699> if<00:07:40.940> you<00:07:41.060> have<00:07:41.240> the<00:07:41.389> eSATA

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:41.810 
nice especially if you have the eSATA

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:45.760 
nice especially if you have the eSATA
firewire<00:07:42.800> and<00:07:43.070> the<00:07:43.580> USB<00:07:44.419> ports<00:07:44.750> on<00:07:44.960> them<00:07:45.680> the

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:45.770 
firewire and the USB ports on them the

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.920 
firewire and the USB ports on them the
case<00:07:45.949> alone<00:07:46.280> is<00:07:46.460> worth<00:07:46.610> money<00:07:46.880> so<00:07:47.150> instead<00:07:47.840> of

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:47.930 
case alone is worth money so instead of

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.570 
case alone is worth money so instead of
throwing<00:07:48.080> away<00:07:48.169> the<00:07:48.410> entire<00:07:48.680> external<00:07:49.340> drive

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:49.580 
throwing away the entire external drive
