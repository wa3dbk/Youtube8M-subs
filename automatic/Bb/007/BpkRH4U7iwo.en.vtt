it's<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.750> know<00:01:15.840> compound<00:01:16.350> eyes<00:01:16.530> 92<00:01:17.490> accuracy

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
it's you know compound eyes 92 accuracy

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.380 
it's you know compound eyes 92 accuracy
so<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:19.100> you<00:01:20.100> know<00:01:20.220> i<00:01:20.250> mean<00:01:20.549> i'm<00:01:20.939> probably<00:01:21.180> not
