 it simply focuses on choosing the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.769
 character and overcome a series of 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.800
 fight until you get the animation 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:58.289
 end in the game modes are added a 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.149
 couple of things the classic battle online 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.460
 continues inside the game with the 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.430
 possibility of creating tournaments and also 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.500
 highlights the survival mode in which 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.530
 we must face one by one the whole 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.650
 squad of players available 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.330

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.909
 chain combos and run youtube is 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.220
 a visual delight with the cell technique 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.780
 shading we have the possibility to feel 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.210
 that we have control of our 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.220
 favorite characters the scenarios 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.590
 they have little interaction with the fighting 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.750
 but they are all very attractive 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.380
 especially for followers 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.110
 animation 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.390
 the sound fulfills although sometimes it is 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.830
 too repetitive the part of 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.200
 animation is very good but 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.539
 unfortunately we can not hear the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.280
 original dubbing in Japanese which 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.350
 we would have loved 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.650
 Naruto and ultimate ninja storm 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.650

 ninja world fights the frenzy 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.980
 the stories told make it worth 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:05.090
 worth the acquisition 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.090
