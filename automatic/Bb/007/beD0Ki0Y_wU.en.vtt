counts as a number three in our set of
videos<00:00:06.240> on<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.290> quantum<00:00:07.710> stuff<00:00:07.980> by<00:00:08.790> particle

videos on the quantum stuff by particle
duality<00:00:09.590> so<00:00:10.590> just<00:00:10.769> have<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.920> really<00:00:11.190> quick

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
duality so just have a really quick

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.070 
duality so just have a really quick
recap<00:00:12.030> on<00:00:12.300> what<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.719> should<00:00:12.900> know<00:00:13.049> about

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
recap on what you should know about

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.760 
recap on what you should know about
light<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:14.900> really<00:00:15.900> it's<00:00:16.020> I'm<00:00:16.320> quite<00:00:16.740> a

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
light and really it's I'm quite a

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.260 
light and really it's I'm quite a
conundrum<00:00:17.100> here<00:00:17.400> which<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:17.910> won't<00:00:18.119> necessarily

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
conundrum here which I won't necessarily

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.710 
conundrum here which I won't necessarily
get<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.410> bottom<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.800> today<00:00:20.460> we<00:00:20.689> know<00:00:21.689> that

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
get to the bottom of today we know that

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.099 
get to the bottom of today we know that
if<00:00:22.260> we're<00:00:22.619> say<00:00:23.039> talking<00:00:23.519> about<00:00:24.050> how<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
if we're say talking about how the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.050 
if we're say talking about how the
photoelectric<00:00:25.890> effect<00:00:26.039> will<00:00:26.460> be<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.789> classic

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
photoelectric effect will be the classic

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.040 
photoelectric effect will be the classic
example<00:00:27.320> we<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.769> consider<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.810> line<00:00:30.810> as

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
example we have to consider the line as

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.160 
example we have to consider the line as
it<00:00:31.080> hits<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.529> metal<00:00:31.769> surface<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.960> kicks<00:00:33.960> out

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
it hits the metal surface and kicks out

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.530 
it hits the metal surface and kicks out
electrons<00:00:34.710> we<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.550> consider<00:00:35.760> its<00:00:36.120> photon

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
electrons we have to consider its photon

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.459 
electrons we have to consider its photon
these<00:00:36.809> discrete<00:00:37.590> packets<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.190> energy

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
these discrete packets of energy

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.720 
these discrete packets of energy
particles<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.160> energy<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
particles and the energy of the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.330 
particles and the energy of the
individual<00:00:42.210> particle<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.899> given<00:00:43.260> x<00:00:43.440> equals

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
individual particle is given x equals

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.389 
individual particle is given x equals
and<00:00:44.520> check<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.870> really<00:00:46.140> can't<00:00:46.379> marry<00:00:47.309> that

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
and check and we really can't marry that

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.049 
and check and we really can't marry that
at<00:00:47.670> all<00:00:47.820> with<00:00:48.090> our<00:00:48.379> away<00:00:49.379> view<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.739> line

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
at all with our away view of line

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.779 
at all with our away view of line
however<00:00:51.059> you've<00:00:51.360> also<00:00:51.539> seen<00:00:52.050> for<00:00:53.010> example<00:00:53.100> if

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
however you've also seen for example if

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.369 
however you've also seen for example if
we<00:00:54.570> should<00:00:54.840> shine<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.770> beam<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.160> laser<00:00:56.340> light<00:00:56.789> on

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
we should shine a beam of laser light on

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.910 
we should shine a beam of laser light on
to<00:00:58.379> two<00:00:58.770> slits<00:01:00.020> then<00:01:01.020> what<00:01:01.410> we<00:01:01.530> see<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
to two slits then what we see on the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.969 
to two slits then what we see on the
screen<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:03.180> number<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.530> bright<00:01:04.920> fringes

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
screen is a number of bright fringes

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.710 
screen is a number of bright fringes
these<00:01:07.979> bright<00:01:08.250> fringes<00:01:08.820> are<00:01:09.090> interference

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
these bright fringes are interference

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.359 
these bright fringes are interference
effects<00:01:10.170> are<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.380> central<00:01:10.830> bright<00:01:11.040> fringe

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
effects are the central bright fringe

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.429 
effects are the central bright fringe
here<00:01:11.640> because<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.659> distance<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.290> same

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
here because that distance is the same

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.920 
interference will real big contradiction
here<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.619> talking<00:01:26.159> about<00:01:26.310> ways<00:01:26.670> here<00:01:27.030> not

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
here and talking about ways here not

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.039 
here and talking about ways here not
talking<00:01:28.350> about<00:01:28.439> waves<00:01:28.799> here<00:01:29.720> being<00:01:30.720> various

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
talking about waves here being various

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.830 
talking about waves here being various
experiments<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.890> try<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.280> marry<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.329> up<00:01:33.570> and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
experiments to try and marry this up and

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.399 
experiments to try and marry this up and
perhaps<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:35.299> best<00:01:36.299> best<00:01:36.750> thing<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.990> say<00:01:37.170> now

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
perhaps the best best thing to say now

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.289 
perhaps the best best thing to say now
is<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.799> way<00:01:37.950> where<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.400> go<00:01:38.549> about<00:01:38.729> marrying

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
is the way where you go about marrying

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.200 
is the way where you go about marrying
the<00:01:39.450> two<00:01:40.280> is<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.490> say<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.820> waves

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the two is to say that the waves

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.800 
the two is to say that the waves
describe<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.350> probability<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:45.149> photon

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
describe the probability of a photon

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.920 
describe the probability of a photon
arriving<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.590> really<00:01:47.340> quite<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.579> big<00:01:47.790> topic<00:01:48.000> if

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
arriving and really quite a big topic if

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.830 
arriving and really quite a big topic if
you<00:01:49.020> can<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.290> physics<00:01:49.649> at<00:01:49.770> university<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.840> can

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
you can do physics at university you can

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.270 
you can do physics at university you can
spend<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.290> rest<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.619> your<00:01:52.770> life<00:01:52.890> thinking

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
spend the rest of your life thinking

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.910 
spend the rest of your life thinking
about<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.960> will<00:01:54.960> now<00:01:55.079> try<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.380> apply<00:01:55.649> that

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
about this will now try and apply that

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.370 
about this will now try and apply that
same<00:01:56.219> idea<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:57.000> electrons<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:59.750> now<00:02:00.750> electrons

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
same idea to electrons and now electrons

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.399

this is a diffraction a wave effect as

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.789 
this is a diffraction a wave effect as

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
gaps in the graphite targeting here so

where<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.250> diameter<00:04:54.000> of<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.180> gap<00:04:54.420> is<00:04:54.930> of

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
where the diameter of the gap is of

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.860 
where the diameter of the gap is of
similar<00:04:55.620> size<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:56.610> one<00:04:57.000> wavelength<00:04:57.240> so<00:04:57.690> if<00:04:57.780> we

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
similar size to one wavelength so if we

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.930 
similar size to one wavelength so if we
consider<00:04:58.290> and<00:04:59.220> you<00:04:59.340> can<00:04:59.490> do<00:04:59.610> this<00:04:59.730> calculation

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
consider and you can do this calculation

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.570 
consider and you can do this calculation
yourself<00:05:00.630> something<00:05:00.870> like<00:05:00.990> a<00:05:01.020> human<00:05:01.350> being<00:05:01.650> if

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
yourself something like a human being if

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.760 
yourself something like a human being if
you<00:05:02.910> divide<00:05:03.270> their<00:05:03.540> momentum<00:05:03.810> you<00:05:04.500> know<00:05:04.590> maybe

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
you divide their momentum you know maybe

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.340 
you divide their momentum you know maybe

together<00:05:10.400> divide<00:05:11.400> it<00:05:11.610> into<00:05:11.850> planks<00:05:12.810> constant

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
together divide it into planks constant

what<00:05:14.460> you<00:05:14.580> find<00:05:14.820> is<00:05:15.090> that<00:05:15.120> a<00:05:15.270> running<00:05:15.660> person

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
what you find is that a running person

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.440 
what you find is that a running person
to<00:05:16.410> be<00:05:16.500> strongly<00:05:16.920> diffracted<00:05:17.640> would<00:05:18.090> need<00:05:18.300> to

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
to be strongly diffracted would need to

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.050 
to be strongly diffracted would need to
pass<00:05:18.690> through<00:05:18.990> a<00:05:19.350> gap<00:05:19.920> very<00:05:20.550> much<00:05:20.730> smaller

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
pass through a gap very much smaller

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.940 
pass through a gap very much smaller
than<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.360> nucleus<00:05:21.720> map<00:05:21.930> okay<00:05:22.710> that's

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
than the nucleus map okay that's

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.070 
than the nucleus map okay that's
physically<00:05:23.370> impossible<00:05:23.450> so<00:05:24.450> if<00:05:24.630> we<00:05:24.780> live<00:05:24.960> our

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
way they all you've got to do is to

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.480 
way they all you've got to do is to
increase<00:05:50.280> your<00:05:50.990> the<00:05:51.990> momentum<00:05:52.560> of<00:05:52.830> the

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
increase your the momentum of the

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.820 
increase your the momentum of the

individual electrons turn up the voltage
and<00:05:56.370> you<00:05:56.730> get<00:05:56.850> a<00:05:56.880> smaller<00:05:57.180> wavelength<00:05:57.690> and<00:05:57.960> you

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
and you get a smaller wavelength and you

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.340 
and you get a smaller wavelength and you
