00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
like the same skin so yeah it's two

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.380 
like the same skin so yeah it's two
different<00:00:58.289> weapons<00:00:58.980> because<00:00:59.640> they<00:00:59.699> were<00:00:59.879> both

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
different weapons because they were both

don't have to kill a lot of enemies
within<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.670> don't<00:02:08.940> even<00:02:09.000> think<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.270> have

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
within this I don't even think you have

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.440 
within this I don't even think you have
to<00:02:09.450> kill<00:02:09.629> any<00:02:09.840> I'm

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450

you<00:02:10.750> have<00:02:10.899> to<00:02:10.989> focus<00:02:11.170> on<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.650> boss<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.160> you

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
you have to focus on the boss and you

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.170 
you have to focus on the boss and you
can<00:02:12.430> get<00:02:12.520> yourself<00:02:12.610> a<00:02:12.970> really<00:02:13.209> easy<00:02:13.629> a<00:02:13.989> ring

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
can get yourself a really easy a ring

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.759 
can get yourself a really easy a ring
but<00:02:16.180> I'm<00:02:16.360> not<00:02:16.510> too<00:02:16.810> sure<00:02:16.840> about<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:17.739> I

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
but I'm not too sure about that so I

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.699 
but I'm not too sure about that so I
will<00:02:17.950> try<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.400> kill<00:02:18.640> off<00:02:18.790> some<00:02:18.819> enemies<00:02:19.709> just

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
will try to kill off some enemies just

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.880 
will try to kill off some enemies just
to<00:02:20.920> make<00:02:21.099> sure<00:02:21.129> I<00:02:21.580> get<00:02:21.640> myself<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:23.500> know<00:02:23.620> some

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
to make sure I get myself you know some

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.259 
to make sure I get myself you know some
chaos<00:02:24.280> but<00:02:24.459> I<00:02:24.519> don't<00:02:24.700> think<00:02:24.790> we<00:02:24.910> have<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.090> kill

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
chaos but I don't think we have to kill

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.199 
chaos but I don't think we have to kill
that<00:02:25.300> many<00:02:25.660> but<00:02:26.110> maybe<00:02:26.830> I'll<00:02:26.980> kill<00:02:27.160> 300<00:02:27.430> 300

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
that many but maybe I'll kill 300 300

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.630 
that many but maybe I'll kill 300 300
seems<00:02:28.450> good<00:02:29.019> enough<00:02:29.080> before<00:02:29.920> I<00:02:30.099> do<00:02:30.160> end<00:02:30.459> off

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
seems good enough before I do end off

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.220 
seems good enough before I do end off
the<00:02:30.819> stage<00:02:31.060> thing<00:02:31.510> is<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.720> don't<00:02:31.780> really<00:02:32.080> know

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
the stage thing is I don't really know

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.140 
the stage thing is I don't really know
exactly<00:02:32.380> what<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.860> amount<00:02:33.040> is<00:02:33.160> but<00:02:33.430> I<00:02:33.700> guess

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
exactly what the amount is but I guess

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.210 
exactly what the amount is but I guess
while<00:02:34.360> he<00:02:34.540> does<00:02:34.810> mess<00:02:35.230> around<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:35.769> should<00:02:35.980> start

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
while he does mess around I should start

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.710 
while he does mess around I should start
throwing<00:02:36.459> off<00:02:36.670> enemies<00:02:37.120> instead<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.569> like

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
throwing off enemies instead of like

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.920 
throwing off enemies instead of like
watching<00:02:38.290> him<00:02:38.739> do<00:02:39.459> nothing<00:02:39.670> waiting<00:02:40.660> for<00:02:40.840> the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
watching him do nothing waiting for the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.270 
watching him do nothing waiting for the
best<00:02:41.230> opportunity<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:41.890> can<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.129> what's<00:02:42.250> a

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.160 
will actually kill him so let's just use
it<00:04:02.829> now<00:04:02.980> because<00:04:03.220> this<00:04:03.489> might<00:04:03.870> kill<00:04:04.870> him

and then we sure if we get more than

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.790 
and then we sure if we get more than
five<00:04:19.140> minutes<00:04:19.530> we're<00:04:19.680> good<00:04:20.570> yeah<00:04:21.680> but<00:04:22.680> I<00:04:22.740> do

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
five minutes we're good yeah but I do

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.680 
five minutes we're good yeah but I do
remember<00:04:22.950> the<00:04:23.190> very<00:04:23.550> first<00:04:23.640> level<00:04:24.210> I<00:04:24.330> tried<00:04:24.570> to

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
remember the very first level I tried to

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.900 
remember the very first level I tried to
kill<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:24.960> crap<00:04:25.800> ton<00:04:26.010> of<00:04:26.070> enemies<00:04:26.340> and<00:04:26.820> they

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
kill a crap ton of enemies and they

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.510 
kill a crap ton of enemies and they
didn't<00:04:27.210> even<00:04:27.330> show<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:27.810> KL<00:04:28.170> counter<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:29.010> only

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
didn't even show the KL counter it only

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.330 
didn't even show the KL counter it only
showed<00:04:29.820> at<00:04:30.090> time<00:04:30.420> and<00:04:30.750> damage<00:04:31.380> taken<00:04:31.860> so<00:04:32.310> I

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
showed at time and damage taken so I

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.040 
showed at time and damage taken so I
have<00:04:32.490> a<00:04:32.520> feeling<00:04:32.850> this<00:04:33.000> stage<00:04:33.330> is<00:04:33.600> just<00:04:33.870> like

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
have a feeling this stage is just like

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.600 
have a feeling this stage is just like
that<00:04:34.290> and<00:04:34.440> all<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.710> enemies<00:04:34.980> I<00:04:35.100> am<00:04:35.220> killing

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
that and all the enemies I am killing

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.090 
that and all the enemies I am killing
aren't<00:04:36.360> necessary<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:37.050> kill<00:04:37.230> but<00:04:37.710> I<00:04:37.890> thought

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
aren't necessary to kill but I thought

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.280 
aren't necessary to kill but I thought
I'd<00:04:38.250> get<00:04:38.400> over<00:04:38.610> a<00:04:38.640> hundred<00:04:39.090> just<00:04:39.360> in<00:04:39.510> case<00:04:39.720> we
