well<00:01:22.740> how<00:01:22.950> do<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.159> know<00:01:23.310> if<00:01:23.490> someone<00:01:23.759> else<00:01:23.909> is

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
well how do you know if someone else is

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.130 
well how do you know if someone else is
blown<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.330> whistle<00:01:24.450> at<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> time<00:01:25.020> that

blown the whistle at the time that

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.210 
blown the whistle at the time that

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
whistle doesn't work very well so this

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.240 
whistle doesn't work very well so this
new<00:01:28.710> bill<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.329> basically<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.380> 13-year<00:01:31.380> effort

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.330 
mean I unfortunately that the Patriot
Act<00:03:58.020> allows<00:03:59.020> for<00:03:59.940> basically<00:04:01.320> are<00:04:02.320> the<00:04:03.100> our

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
Act allows for basically are the our

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.470 
Act allows for basically are the our
government<00:04:03.730> to<00:04:03.790> do<00:04:03.850> anything<00:04:04.090> they<00:04:04.270> want

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
government to do anything they want

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.820 
government to do anything they want
essentially<00:04:05.080> anything<00:04:05.470> they<00:04:05.560> want<00:04:05.739> I

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
essentially anything they want I

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.890 
essentially anything they want I
remember<00:04:06.610> front<00:04:06.880> I<00:04:07.030> think<00:04:07.480> you<00:04:07.600> can<00:04:07.750> be<00:04:07.870> a

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
remember front I think you can be a

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.479 
remember front I think you can be a
whistleblower<00:04:08.110> and<00:04:08.769> go<00:04:08.980> through<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.250> proper

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
whistleblower and go through the proper

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:11.520 
whistleblower and go through the proper
channels<00:04:09.610> at<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.269> same<00:04:10.510> time<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:11.170> not<00:04:11.230> be<00:04:11.500> a

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
channels at the same time and not be a

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.729 
channels at the same time and not be a
whistleblower<00:04:12.150> going<00:04:13.150> to<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.959> media<00:04:14.350> you

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
whistleblower going to the media you

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.250 
whistleblower going to the media you
know<00:04:14.860> what<00:04:14.950> I<00:04:15.010> mean<00:04:15.190> certainly<00:04:15.640> uh<00:04:15.970> so<00:04:16.570> I<00:04:16.840> think

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
know what I mean certainly uh so I think

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.070 
know what I mean certainly uh so I think
if<00:04:17.950> there's<00:04:18.400> discretion<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:19.690> may<00:04:19.810> not<00:04:19.930> have

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
if there's discretion you may not have

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.539 
if there's discretion you may not have
to<00:04:20.140> worry<00:04:20.380> about<00:04:20.500> things<00:04:20.739> like<00:04:20.890> that<00:04:21.160> but<00:04:21.489> I

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
to worry about things like that but I

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:22.800 
to worry about things like that but I
guess<00:04:21.729> it<00:04:21.850> depends<00:04:22.120> on<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.270> nature<00:04:22.450> of<00:04:22.630> what's

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
guess it depends on the nature of what's

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.330 
guess it depends on the nature of what's
going<00:04:22.930> on<00:04:23.140> I'm<00:04:23.350> concerned<00:04:23.650> about

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
going on I'm concerned about

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.340 
going on I'm concerned about
whether<00:04:24.550> some<00:04:24.940> of<00:04:24.970> those<00:04:25.210> provisions<00:04:25.570> in<00:04:25.900> NDAA

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
whether some of those provisions in NDAA

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.320 
whether some of those provisions in NDAA
would<00:04:26.980> would<00:04:27.220> essentially<00:04:27.520> nullify<00:04:28.030> some<00:04:28.240> of

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
would would essentially nullify some of

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.400 
would would essentially nullify some of
the<00:04:28.389> provisions<00:04:28.810> of<00:04:28.900> this<00:04:29.050> whistleblower

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
the provisions of this whistleblower

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.250 
the provisions of this whistleblower
protection<00:04:30.100> bill
