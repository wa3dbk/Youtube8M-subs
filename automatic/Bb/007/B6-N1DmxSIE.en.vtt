redstone<00:00:02.580> tutorials<00:00:03.030> and<00:00:03.210> this<00:00:03.300> time<00:00:03.449> to

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
redstone tutorials and this time to

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:04.820 
redstone tutorials and this time to
showing<00:00:03.780> you<00:00:03.870> guys<00:00:04.049> how<00:00:04.110> to<00:00:04.290> build<00:00:04.589> a

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
showing you guys how to build a

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.950 
showing you guys how to build a
underwater<00:00:05.549> door<00:00:05.850> now<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.270> guy<00:00:06.480> asked<00:00:06.750> me<00:00:06.870> to

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
underwater door now a guy asked me to

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.450 
underwater door now a guy asked me to
build<00:00:07.140> this<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.410> while<00:00:07.620> ago<00:00:07.770> because<00:00:08.069> he<00:00:08.280> said

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
build this a while ago because he said

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.890 
build this a while ago because he said
every<00:00:08.700> time<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:09.000> would<00:00:09.120> make<00:00:09.300> his<00:00:09.450> underwater

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
every time you would make his underwater

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.470 
every time you would make his underwater
door<00:00:10.320> water<00:00:11.219> would<00:00:11.429> end<00:00:11.610> up<00:00:11.700> seeping<00:00:12.150> into<00:00:12.330> the

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
door water would end up seeping into the

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.419 
door water would end up seeping into the
base<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.139> would<00:00:13.230> be<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.559> pain<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.130> get<00:00:14.219> back

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
base and it would be a pain to get back

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.650 
base and it would be a pain to get back
out<00:00:14.639> so<00:00:14.910> that's<00:00:15.030> what<00:00:15.210> I'm<00:00:15.269> gonna<00:00:15.420> set<00:00:15.570> up

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
out so that's what I'm gonna set up

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.540 
out so that's what I'm gonna set up
right<00:00:15.690> now<00:00:15.990> as<00:00:16.320> little<00:00:16.920> I'm<00:00:17.130> pretty<00:00:17.369> sure<00:00:17.460> this

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
right now as little I'm pretty sure this

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.010 
right now as little I'm pretty sure this
is<00:00:17.670> what<00:00:17.789> he<00:00:17.910> meant<00:00:18.029> like<00:00:18.300> water<00:00:18.630> would<00:00:18.810> come

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
is what he meant like water would come

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.109 
is what he meant like water would come
into<00:00:19.170> his<00:00:19.289> base<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.920> then<00:00:20.340> he'd<00:00:20.550> have<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.730> push

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
into his base and then he'd have to push

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.950 
into his base and then he'd have to push
it<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.869> know<00:00:22.289> really<00:00:22.470> try<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:22.980> get<00:00:23.220> out<00:00:23.400> there

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
it you know really try to get out there

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.300 
it you know really try to get out there
man<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.260> takes<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.560> while<00:00:25.590> okay<00:00:26.070> I'm<00:00:26.220> gonna

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
man this takes a while okay I'm gonna

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.240 
man this takes a while okay I'm gonna
just<00:00:26.430> speed<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.090> up<00:00:27.320> so<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.349> actually<00:00:28.920> fixed

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
just speed it up so I actually fixed

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.099 
just speed it up so I actually fixed
this<00:00:29.400> no<00:00:29.609> problem<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.119> was<00:00:30.240> very<00:00:30.599> very<00:00:30.810> easy

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
this no problem it was very very easy

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.580 
this no problem it was very very easy
it's<00:00:31.380> super<00:00:31.830> easy<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.130> do<00:00:32.780> so<00:00:33.780> all<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.170> did<00:00:34.469> was

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
it's super easy to do so all I did was

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.920 
it's super easy to do so all I did was
this<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:35.010> once<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.340> click<00:00:35.370> my<00:00:35.579> lever<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.210> come

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
this so once I click my lever I come

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.360 
this so once I click my lever I come
down<00:00:37.110> now<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:38.690> boom<00:00:39.690> no<00:00:39.989> water<00:00:40.370> beautiful

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
down now and boom no water beautiful

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.389 
down now and boom no water beautiful
beautiful<00:00:42.230> so<00:00:43.230> all<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.890> very<00:00:44.190> very

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
beautiful so all this is is a very very

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.930 
beautiful so all this is is a very very
easy<00:00:45.079> flush<00:00:46.079> piston<00:00:46.559> door<00:00:46.739> with<00:00:47.340> some<00:00:47.520> extra

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
easy flush piston door with some extra

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.520 
easy flush piston door with some extra
pistons<00:00:48.390> on<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.690> bottom<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.140> pop<00:00:49.350> out

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
pistons on the bottom that pop out

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.860 
pistons on the bottom that pop out
before<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.070> flush<00:00:50.250> piston<00:00:50.640> door<00:00:50.820> opens<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.780> it

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
before the flush piston door opens so it

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.959 
before the flush piston door opens so it
ends<00:00:52.140> up<00:00:52.199> trapping<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.829> water<00:00:53.070> one<00:00:53.760> block

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
ends up trapping the water one block

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.689 
ends up trapping the water one block
down<00:00:54.239> more<00:00:54.870> one<00:00:55.170> source<00:00:55.410> block<00:00:55.649> down<00:00:55.920> more<00:00:56.190> so

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
down more one source block down more so

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.490 
down more one source block down more so
it<00:00:56.789> ends<00:00:57.030> up<00:00:57.090> making<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.840> wall<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.140> water

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
it ends up making just a wall of water

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.110 
it ends up making just a wall of water
so<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:58.980> when<00:00:59.160> you're<00:00:59.280> exiting<00:00:59.609> your<00:00:59.730> base<00:00:59.969> all

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
so now when you're exiting your base all

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.220 
so now when you're exiting your base all
you<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.660> literally<00:01:00.960> just

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
you have to do is like literally just

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.700 
you have to do is like literally just
run<00:01:01.410> out<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.800> jump<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.840> so<00:01:03.840> let's<00:01:04.439> try<00:01:04.650> to

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
run out and jump in so let's try to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.740 
run out and jump in so let's try to
recreate<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.369> run<00:01:05.790> out<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.390> jump<00:01:06.600> out

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
recreate that to run out and jump out

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.170 
recreate that to run out and jump out
and<00:01:07.020> go<00:01:07.520> alright<00:01:08.520> guys<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:08.790> let's<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:09.060> start

gonna<00:01:13.680> need<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> few<00:01:14.130> blocks<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.610> our<00:01:14.700> choice

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
gonna need a few blocks of our choice

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.580 
gonna need a few blocks of our choice
some<00:01:15.420> blocks<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:15.810> put<00:01:15.960> our<00:01:16.049> redstone<00:01:16.409> dust

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
some blocks to put our redstone dust

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.140 
some blocks to put our redstone dust
down<00:01:16.830> on<00:01:17.659> 2024<00:01:18.659> redstone<00:01:19.290> does<00:01:19.640> five<00:01:20.640> redstone

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
down on 2024 redstone does five redstone

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.560 
down on 2024 redstone does five redstone
torches<00:01:21.600> five<00:01:22.020> repeaters<00:01:22.590> 14<00:01:23.580> sticky<00:01:24.060> pistons

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
torches five repeaters 14 sticky pistons

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.469 
torches five repeaters 14 sticky pistons
four<00:01:25.380> redstone<00:01:25.770> lamps<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.549> lever<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.240> I'll

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
four redstone lamps and a lever and I'll

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.940 
four redstone lamps and a lever and I'll
show<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.750> where<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.080> can<00:01:28.200> hook<00:01:28.350> up<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.770> T

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
show you where you can hook up a T

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.319 
show you where you can hook up a T
flip-flop<00:01:29.159> if<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.700> don't<00:01:29.880> want<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> lever<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
flip-flop if you don't want a lever and

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.450 
flip-flop if you don't want a lever and
you<00:01:30.420> want<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.600> button<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.799> let's<00:01:32.009> pretend<00:01:32.159> we're

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
you want a button so let's pretend we're

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.649 
you want a button so let's pretend we're
underwater<00:01:32.880> right<00:01:33.030> now<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.360> we're<00:01:33.479> drowning

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
underwater right now and we're drowning

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.620 
underwater right now and we're drowning
so<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.619> very<00:01:35.009> easy<00:01:35.369> way<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.610> start<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.150> off<00:01:36.360> is

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
so a very easy way to start this off is

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:43.249 
going towards the front of the creation
and<00:04:42.029> then<00:04:42.180> come<00:04:42.300> down<00:04:42.330> two<00:04:42.659> blocks<00:04:42.779> underneath

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
and then come down two blocks underneath

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:47.480 
and then come down two blocks underneath
this<00:04:43.409> one<00:04:43.650> so<00:04:43.830> one<00:04:44.039> to<00:04:45.590> put<00:04:46.590> thus<00:04:46.800> on<00:04:47.009> top<00:04:47.189> of<00:04:47.370> it

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
this one so one to put thus on top of it

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.029 
this one so one to put thus on top of it
then<00:04:48.360> put<00:04:48.539> a<00:04:48.689> torch<00:04:48.990> going<00:04:49.169> towards<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.860> inner

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
then put a torch going towards the inner

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:51.730 
then put a torch going towards the inner
part<00:04:50.580> of<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.699> creation<00:04:51.029> right<00:04:51.120> on<00:04:51.300> this<00:04:51.449> side

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
part of the creation right on this side

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.119 
part of the creation right on this side
and<00:04:53.029> then<00:04:54.029> put<00:04:54.180> another<00:04:54.210> two<00:04:54.779> blocks<00:04:54.930> one<00:04:55.379> two

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:56.129 
and then put another two blocks one two

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.059 
and then put another two blocks one two
and<00:04:56.370> then<00:04:56.789> just<00:04:56.969> drag<00:04:57.210> it<00:04:57.360> over<00:04:57.449> to<00:04:57.750> where<00:04:57.960> the

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:58.069 
and then just drag it over to where the

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:00.709 
and then just drag it over to where the
sticky<00:04:59.069> pistons<00:04:59.430> are<00:04:59.550> so<00:04:59.729> like<00:04:59.939> that<00:05:00.180> like<00:05:00.539> so

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:00.719 
sticky pistons are so like that like so

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:04.209 
sticky pistons are so like that like so
and<00:05:01.229> then<00:05:01.409> put<00:05:01.560> your<00:05:01.650> dust<00:05:01.979> along<00:05:02.189> all<00:05:02.520> that

00:05:04.209 --> 00:05:04.219 
and then put your dust along all that

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:06.709 
and then put your dust along all that
and<00:05:05.219> that's<00:05:05.490> it<00:05:05.669> we<00:05:05.879> should<00:05:06.060> be<00:05:06.150> done<00:05:06.300> so<00:05:06.569> if<00:05:06.659> I

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:06.719 
and that's it we should be done so if I

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:08.300 
and that's it we should be done so if I
put<00:05:07.050> a<00:05:07.080> lever<00:05:07.349> on<00:05:07.529> this<00:05:07.680> back<00:05:07.889> block<00:05:08.129> right

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
put a lever on this back block right

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.110 
put a lever on this back block right
here<00:05:08.599> where<00:05:09.599> this<00:05:09.719> torch<00:05:09.990> is<00:05:10.789> so<00:05:11.789> if<00:05:11.879> you<00:05:11.969> just

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
here where this torch is so if you just

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.550 
here where this torch is so if you just
want<00:05:12.270> to<00:05:12.300> keep<00:05:12.479> the<00:05:12.599> lever<00:05:13.110> here<00:05:13.349> actually

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
want to keep the lever here actually

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.679 
want to keep the lever here actually
then<00:05:14.069> all<00:05:14.189> you<00:05:14.279> have<00:05:14.400> to<00:05:14.490> do<00:05:14.639> is<00:05:14.879> put<00:05:15.150> a<00:05:15.330> block<00:05:15.659> a

00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:15.689 
then all you have to do is put a block a

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:20.629 
then all you have to do is put a block a
choice<00:05:16.020> here<00:05:16.909> with<00:05:17.909> a<00:05:17.939> torch<00:05:18.270> and<00:05:19.069> a<00:05:20.069> lever<00:05:20.370> and

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
choice here with a torch and a lever and

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.490 
choice here with a torch and a lever and
then<00:05:21.060> like<00:05:21.240> you're<00:05:21.479> underwater<00:05:21.900> area<00:05:22.379> would

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
then like you're underwater area would

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.200 
then like you're underwater area would
be<00:05:22.529> up<00:05:22.800> more<00:05:25.460> that's<00:05:26.460> like<00:05:26.610> this<00:05:26.819> is<00:05:26.999> if<00:05:27.120> you

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
be up more that's like this is if you

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.339 
be up more that's like this is if you
want<00:05:27.330> to<00:05:27.449> keep<00:05:27.539> this<00:05:27.719> lever<00:05:27.930> and<00:05:28.050> you<00:05:28.139> don't

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
want to keep this lever and you don't

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:30.860 
want to keep this lever and you don't
want<00:05:28.499> a<00:05:28.909> t<00:05:29.909> flip-flop<00:05:30.300> you<00:05:30.449> could<00:05:30.629> just<00:05:30.750> do<00:05:30.810> it

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
want a t flip-flop you could just do it

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.469 
want a t flip-flop you could just do it
like<00:05:31.020> that<00:05:32.990> so<00:05:33.990> now<00:05:34.110> if<00:05:34.289> I<00:05:34.379> click<00:05:34.589> it<00:05:34.710> up

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
like that so now if I click it up

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:38.089 
like that so now if I click it up
everything's<00:05:36.479> closed<00:05:36.860> and<00:05:37.860> then<00:05:37.979> when<00:05:38.069> I

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:38.099 
everything's closed and then when I

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:40.700 
everything's closed and then when I
click<00:05:38.189> it<00:05:38.430> down<00:05:38.900> that<00:05:39.900> part<00:05:40.080> opens<00:05:40.409> up<00:05:40.529> and

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
click it down that part opens up and

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.769 
click it down that part opens up and
then<00:05:40.800> this<00:05:40.889> part<00:05:41.159> opens<00:05:41.460> up<00:05:41.610> beautiful<00:05:42.120> now<00:05:42.629> if

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:42.779 
then this part opens up beautiful now if

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:44.600 
then this part opens up beautiful now if
you<00:05:42.899> do<00:05:43.080> want<00:05:43.349> a<00:05:43.469> T<00:05:43.529> flip-flop<00:05:43.860> what<00:05:44.250> I<00:05:44.279> like<00:05:44.490> to

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
you do want a T flip-flop what I like to

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.189 
you do want a T flip-flop what I like to
do<00:05:44.729> is<00:05:44.939> literally<00:05:45.389> just<00:05:45.419> take<00:05:45.810> this<00:05:45.990> side

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
do is literally just take this side

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.589 
do is literally just take this side
delete<00:05:46.649> this<00:05:46.830> one<00:05:47.029> and<00:05:48.029> then<00:05:48.120> bring<00:05:48.300> the<00:05:48.389> block

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
delete this one and then bring the block

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.139 
delete this one and then bring the block
over<00:05:48.930> to<00:05:49.050> this<00:05:49.169> side<00:05:49.669> with<00:05:50.669> a<00:05:50.699> torch<00:05:51.029> because

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:51.149 
over to this side with a torch because

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:52.429 
over to this side with a torch because
you're<00:05:51.389> gonna<00:05:51.479> have<00:05:51.659> a<00:05:51.689> lot<00:05:51.899> more<00:05:51.930> room<00:05:52.319> in

00:05:52.429 --> 00:05:52.439 
you're gonna have a lot more room in

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:53.779 
you're gonna have a lot more room in
here<00:05:52.560> because<00:05:52.680> this<00:05:52.860> is<00:05:52.979> all<00:05:53.129> gonna<00:05:53.250> be<00:05:53.430> stone

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
here because this is all gonna be stone

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:55.189 
here because this is all gonna be stone
and<00:05:54.060> what<00:05:54.180> not<00:05:54.360> cuz<00:05:54.599> you're<00:05:54.750> building<00:05:55.020> into

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
and what not cuz you're building into

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.200 
and what not cuz you're building into
the<00:05:55.319> side<00:05:55.500> of<00:05:55.529> a<00:05:55.710> wall<00:05:55.740> and<00:05:56.159> then<00:05:56.699> this<00:05:56.939> is<00:05:57.089> your

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
the side of a wall and then this is your

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.850 
the side of a wall and then this is your
sort<00:05:57.449> this<00:05:57.629> is<00:05:57.689> gonna<00:05:57.839> be<00:05:58.020> your<00:05:58.199> input<00:05:58.680> block

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
sort this is gonna be your input block

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.409 
sort this is gonna be your input block
right<00:05:59.009> here<00:05:59.159> with<00:05:59.250> the<00:05:59.339> torch<00:05:59.580> so<00:06:00.149> then<00:06:00.330> you

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
right here with the torch so then you

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:01.969 
right here with the torch so then you
can<00:06:00.539> just<00:06:00.659> bring<00:06:00.779> your<00:06:00.899> T<00:06:01.080> flip-flop<00:06:01.289> out<00:06:01.680> over

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 
can just bring your T flip-flop out over

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:03.649 
can just bring your T flip-flop out over
here<00:06:02.279> and<00:06:02.520> build<00:06:02.759> your<00:06:02.849> T<00:06:02.969> flip-flop<00:06:03.120> and<00:06:03.509> put

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:03.659 
here and build your T flip-flop and put

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:05.119 
here and build your T flip-flop and put
a<00:06:03.689> button<00:06:03.899> inside<00:06:04.080> your<00:06:04.529> creation<00:06:04.949> and

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.129 
a button inside your creation and

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:07.490 
a button inside your creation and
outside<00:06:05.550> of<00:06:05.759> it<00:06:05.879> so<00:06:06.060> yeah<00:06:06.990> guys<00:06:07.110> there<00:06:07.319> you<00:06:07.379> go
