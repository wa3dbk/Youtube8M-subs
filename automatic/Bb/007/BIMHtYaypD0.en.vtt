00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 within 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.070
 stella of his friends his gamer galaxies 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.350
 I hope you're doing a lot less well 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.689
 rather good multiple and too cold but 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.970
 good it's coming today we get 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:29.020
 found for a new squat builder 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.940
 apparently the previous video has you 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.050
 I will put the good in description 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.750
 if you want and there I offer you a 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.870
 squat builder with finally i'm going to do 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.970
 a bpl with thiago silva the 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.800
 best defenders in the world there 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.710
 unfortunately I can not master 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.839
 intensive it is it quite expensive and I have 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.229
 not really the budget but it will happen 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.850
 one day I will try to save a 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:58.510
 little money to buy this check at 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.850
 cinema in blue then to the goal 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.260
 I decided to put a guardian rather 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.150
 known does recipe 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.740
 the chelsea keeper rather good he has 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.810
 already very well balanced for a 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.280
 guardian 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.140
 really beautiful 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.100
 in addition it is very large so it's 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.840
 really amazing then in defense 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.330
 for the first death so I put 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.780
 david luiz it's really ugly too 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.970
 fast and it's amazing how how 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.790
 it's this interception gift is all 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.590
 really there is nothing to say nonsense and 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.770
 I strongly advise you to buy it 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.720
 because there is really a fall 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.520
 unbelievable 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.560
 the ubs is amazing prices before 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.520
 david luiz and cost 14 milage buy it 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.070
 at 6300 so south and 8 went to buy it 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.770
 there are plenty of other players you 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:55.000
 will see now wait we will arrive 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.460
 later on so that's precisely why 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.440
 thiago silva sees the young amy night 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.600
 codis nomine so that should cost 25 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.980
 miles whose prices you see are going down 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.960
 so take advantage of it 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.820
 because after prices will come back to 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.580
 the normal so let's talk a little about 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.590
 thiago silva 88 tech on his schedule 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.000
 it shows that he has good 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.610
 controls it's very important for a 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.760
 defender to have very good control 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.040
 here is a controller is messed up 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.910
 a goal opportunity for the opponent and 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.860
 hop you feel then pulls in blue it 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.010
 really has stats really holds 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.020
 extraordinary magnificent pool for 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.640
 center in the past 84 points in the lead 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.900
 as for me it's one of the best 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:40.000
 will be trained for the left defender 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.020
 of m company then him 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.630
 really c 1.5 c 1 saint roch pa he 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.420
 hope is happening and that's nothing to say 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.800
 accompany him also to lower when 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.560
 even to listen I think in force in 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:03:00.190
 of 30,000 breeding 2010 ok there we go to 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.540
 middle so I opted for this killer 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.400
 stop at their leisure 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.970
 I had to put legend on him 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.310
 it's an English legend from liverpool 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.670
 I think it's been over ten years I do not 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.590
 not really know ten years 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.480
 years he spent in liverpool but 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.930
 it's a legend really there's nothing 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.209
 to say and I respect people here 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.989
 in addition he has shots of sick of 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.940
 sick passes 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.260
 good it's true that the rest not tip top 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.190
 but it's still true that I have 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.810
 so he lost his speed and that's 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.400
 normal when m 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.270
 the same thing that franck lampard then 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:43.850
 there then 10 rue chabot 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:46.300
 uh yeah what it is not actually I 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.300
 had a little problem 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:54.080
 m a mirage but the problem is that 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.640
 I did not put in excess I forgot 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.230
 we think of these serious you you 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.020
 buy it even if it's not so expensive 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.410
 that it also ramires it really 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.240
 fallen 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.220
 I do not think they cost 4 miles 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.420
 while before listening to 8000 so 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.270
 really it's amazing how the 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.890
 chelsea players drop that's not it 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.190
 really this one puts practically all 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.240
 the players here so that's it then for 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.940
 the right winger 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.160
 I put lukasz like that he has very good 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.410
 links with ultimate anna with this beauty 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.420
 see playing in the same club and in the 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.970
 same week nationality for that they 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.330
 kidnap of the collective here go 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:32.150
 now we put horse then for me 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.820
 if not at all it is 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.990
 cheaper than wigan and all it better 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:40.430
 in media is better but here after 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.130
 if you buy it wigan it's like you 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.130
 want but at least you see the patches 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.810
 r &amp; d rather strong one now so we 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.940
 goes to enamels it's not rather the l 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:54.740
 attack we are beautiful c I put hou 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:57.670
 rooney on bass and an atheist but I 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.800
 finds that he is very very strong in 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.720
 emotions really nothing to say he's doing 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.280
 good passes he had to shot beautiful 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.980
 dreams and explains the pretty all 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.210
 beautiful 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.980
 for what is missing it's true the 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.880
 defense is fast it does not feel 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:15.330
 really and there I practically have one 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.340
 the best attacks in bp % me 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.810
 felt of course but all have little to 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:26.420
 make this team go first game but 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:29.550
 luis suarez starts this amazing guy 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.680
 it's beautiful season time I 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.790
 think 20 goals in play that's more than 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.970
 same age but really it's amazing 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.560
 for an attacker he is flexible and 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.610
 extraordinary and the robin van persie 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.860
 then jewish 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.410
 oh my god but he stretches that he has this 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.350
 incredible shooting power of the shots 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.420
 by far the finish the controls a 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.120
 complete this guy it's just not that 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.580
 what he misses is the speed is 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.050
 maybe it's not that bad 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.960
 there is evening to replace then 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.130
 quickly that I put a coach 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:05.850
 so that's good to choose pellegrini 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:08.280
 here and so here are the friends so 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.530
 this video please do not forget to 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.680
 leave a little dyk and we end up 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.990
 in a moment for the review alÃ¨s on 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.660
 is back friends for their hit you 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.850
 so we start quickly with the 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.700
 guardian this heat will eat him nothing 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.980
 to say better are many times this is 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:30.770
 I think the best guardian of the dtn 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:33.630
 after lorie went really well alone 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.530
 launch to the defense so I have a 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:38.540
 trio of sick 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:41.820
 david luiz thiago silva and company m 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.980
 very strong especially who gave this 

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.250
 drug and that has a connection with thiago 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.990
 silva and company it is a 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.890
 very solid defense so speaking 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.080
 quickly david luiz 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:54.180
 very good everything is very good defense 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.460
 very good idea this trident controls very 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.620
 good interceptions very good pass 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:03.960
 nothing to say really and then that a 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:05.910
 strong we sometimes go strong we had 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.920
 good things beautiful same level of 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.430
 comfort and company always so 

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.300
 solid 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.800
 really there is nothing to say 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.229
 now let's go into middle then the 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:19.879
 middle he's also very solid at dr and 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:22.220
 ramirez the rescue hull and I see the 

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:26.030
 site is very good after the distress to 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:28.610
 grow up and now we attack on 

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:31.550
 before night persie hopes an irony the 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:33.500
 worst of the least extraordinary 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.990
 will reside a beautiful and jokes 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.569
 sanitary is also van persie hold 

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.639
 not very sick 

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:43.940
 well it was all for this episode a bit 

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:45.710

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.069
