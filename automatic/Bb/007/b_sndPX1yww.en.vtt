if you look from the back especially but

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.820 
if you look from the back especially but
that<00:02:35.820> thing<00:02:35.970> looks<00:02:36.150> like<00:02:36.300> ice<00:02:36.510> because<00:02:37.320> of<00:02:37.560> all

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
that thing looks like ice because of all

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.160

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
the spiky edges and the light blue color

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.590 
the spiky edges and the light blue color
but<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.520> can<00:02:41.670> clearly<00:02:41.910> see<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.450> he's

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
but you can clearly see that he's

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.449 
but you can clearly see that he's
shooting<00:02:42.930> them<00:02:43.110> from<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.500> palm<00:02:43.739> of<00:02:43.890> his<00:02:43.920> hands

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
and a top layer is transparent so I

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.470 
and a top layer is transparent so I
think<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.620> looks<00:02:49.800> fine<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.970> cannot<00:02:51.239> kick

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
think it looks fine and you cannot kick

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.650 
think it looks fine and you cannot kick
it<00:02:51.600> off<00:02:51.720> it's<00:02:52.080> not<00:02:52.230> removable<00:02:53.510> this<00:02:54.510> is
