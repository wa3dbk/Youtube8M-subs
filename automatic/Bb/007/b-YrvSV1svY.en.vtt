we're going to click space and as you

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.619 
we're going to click space and as you
can<00:00:39.329> see<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.660> feed<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.290> slowly<00:00:40.980> going<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.629> so

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
can see the feed is slowly going up so

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.569 
can see the feed is slowly going up so
now<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:43.649> see<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.010> syrup<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.579> bro<00:00:45.110> and<00:00:46.399> it<00:00:47.399> goes

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
now we see the syrup on bro and it goes

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.799 
now we see the syrup on bro and it goes
pretty<00:00:47.940> slow<00:00:48.390> at<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> start<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:50.039> can<00:00:50.190> see

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
pretty slow at the start as you can see

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.900 
pretty slow at the start as you can see
but<00:00:51.809> eventually<00:00:52.110> it'll<00:00:52.590> heat<00:00:52.980> up<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.640> I'll

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
but eventually it'll heat up so I'll

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:02.810 
but eventually it'll heat up so I'll
just<00:00:54.530> skis<00:00:55.530> up<00:00:55.710> manually<00:01:01.609> eventually<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.699> gets

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
just skis up manually eventually it gets

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.090 
just skis up manually eventually it gets
so<00:01:03.059> fast<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.899> goes<00:01:04.229> down<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:04.949> and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
so fast that it just goes down here and

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.950 
so fast that it just goes down here and
as<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.460> see<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.790> pen<00:01:06.000> color<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.510> changing

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960

was originally going to use um I can

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.389 
was originally going to use um I can
click<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.180> it

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
click on it

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:56.859

hardcore<00:01:50.399> DBZ<00:01:51.090> fans<00:01:51.329> know<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.399> you<00:01:53.399> know

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.730 

showerhead<00:01:57.869> chilla<00:01:59.299> but<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.659> ended<00:02:01.409> up<00:02:01.470> not

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
showerhead chilla but I ended up not

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:13.940 
showerhead chilla but I ended up not
using<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:09.179> as<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.569> can<00:02:09.720> see<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:12.950> think

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
using that so as you can see I think

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.670 
using that so as you can see I think
that<00:02:14.190> was<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.550> really<00:02:14.790> good<00:02:15.000> set<00:02:15.330> Dragon<00:02:16.319> Ball<00:02:16.500> Z

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680

that was a really good set Dragon Ball Z
8<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:17.100> was<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.569> pretty<00:02:18.569> good<00:02:18.750> fit<00:02:18.989> for<00:02:19.020> this

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
8 that was a pretty good fit for this

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.620 
8 that was a pretty good fit for this
