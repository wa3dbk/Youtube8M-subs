00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.540
 welcome room today we are with a 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.330
 new unit Hebrew Bible pixar 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:33.540
 My name is Karim and we are going to learn 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:37.710
 together the vowels in Hebrew 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:41.490
 the vowel system appears 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:46.320
 approximately between the seventh centuries 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:48.920
 and ninth of the common era and it was developed 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.539
 in tiberias 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:56.390
 the scribes at the time that 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:58.930
 they had a little fear about what 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.739
 would happen over the years 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:07.820
 with oral tradition and that's why 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:11.539
 they decided to leave well settled which 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:16.280
 are the vowels and sounds that each 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:19.640
 one of the words of the bible we can 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:24.399
 see here in red three points 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.399
 vocalic we have a 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:33.369
 beside another 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.950
 and in the upper part a point on the 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:39.640
 letter sing 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.630
 what are those points are day points 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:49.119
 critics if the two below represent 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:53.520
 to the vowel ay we can read now without 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:56.890
 no doubt the word already marc 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:02.540
 the point on the without sample that is a 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:05.780
 without just and not a thin 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.830
 the two that are below the sim 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.140
 inameh 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:14.810
 respectively show that they are 2a and not 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.840
 one there is one or any other 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.730

 vocal calls ni cut likud 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:32.030
 literally means vowel points 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:36.470
 and we see here that most of them 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.980
 they write below the consonants by 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.550
 example 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.550
 plus 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.620
 plus 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.790
 me 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.670
 again 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.670
 then we have my 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.590
 in the case of or there is one thing 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.990
 different since it is written above the 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.430
 consonant and not underneath as all the 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:11.200
 rest and finally the mÃªme with the point 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.200
 vocalic form 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:19.629
 and these are the vowels 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.409
 now in the next verse we are going to 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.409

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:41.260
