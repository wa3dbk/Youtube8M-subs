00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
tons worth which created another huge

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.930

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:54.940 
problem so one of the challenges was

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.850 
problem so one of the challenges was
actually<00:06:55.389> getting<00:06:55.629> it<00:06:55.900> to<00:06:55.930> the<00:06:56.319> site<00:06:56.560> we
