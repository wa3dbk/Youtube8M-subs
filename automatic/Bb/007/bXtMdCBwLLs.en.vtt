welcome to the art of photography my
name<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.590> Ted<00:00:19.800> Forbes<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.400> today<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:21.119> are

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
name is Ted Forbes and today we are

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.540 
name is Ted Forbes and today we are
going<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.390> talk<00:00:21.600> about<00:00:21.779> pinhole<00:00:22.560> cameras<00:00:23.039> now

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
going to talk about pinhole cameras now

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.609 
going to talk about pinhole cameras now
last<00:00:23.850> time<00:00:24.119> as<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.330> recall<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:25.109> talked<00:00:25.470> about

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
last time as you recall we talked about

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.019 
last time as you recall we talked about
the<00:00:25.710> camera<00:00:26.039> obscura<00:00:26.189> which<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.880> most

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
the camera obscura which is the most

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.359 
the camera obscura which is the most
basic<00:00:27.539> form<00:00:27.810> that's<00:00:28.349> how<00:00:28.500> all<00:00:28.529> cameras<00:00:29.099> work

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
basic form that's how all cameras work

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.160 
basic form that's how all cameras work
and<00:00:29.609> basically<00:00:30.359> all<00:00:30.449> we<00:00:30.570> had<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.869> we<00:00:30.990> had<00:00:31.019> a

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
and basically all we had is we had a

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.440 
and basically all we had is we had a
dark<00:00:31.439> box<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.980> we<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.309> open<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.880> peer<00:00:33.120> into

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
dark box that we have open to peer into

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.450 
dark box that we have open to peer into
but<00:00:33.930> essentially<00:00:34.320> what<00:00:34.469> happens<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.190> need

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
but essentially what happens is you need

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.190 
but essentially what happens is you need
to<00:00:35.579> project<00:00:35.760> light<00:00:36.239> onto<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.719> back<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.140> this

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
to project light onto the back of this

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.709 
to project light onto the back of this
box<00:00:37.469> whether<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> CCD<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.360> digital

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
box whether you have a CCD and a digital

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.119 
box whether you have a CCD and a digital
camera<00:00:39.960> or<00:00:40.079> whether<00:00:40.350> you're<00:00:40.500> using<00:00:40.530> film<00:00:40.980> and

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
camera or whether you're using film and

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.100 
camera or whether you're using film and
a<00:00:41.160> film<00:00:41.370> camera<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.850> then<00:00:42.480> on<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.780> front<00:00:42.930> you

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
a film camera and then on the front you

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.840 
a film camera and then on the front you
either<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> lens<00:00:43.890> which<00:00:44.250> uses<00:00:44.610> what's

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
either have a lens which uses what's

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.540 
either have a lens which uses what's
called<00:00:45.120> refraction<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:46.649> shape<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.100> light<00:00:47.250> and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
called refraction to shape the light and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.940 
called refraction to shape the light and
focus<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.450> back<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.840> box<00:00:49.020> or<00:00:49.320> in

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
focus it on to the back of the box or in

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.439 
focus it on to the back of the box or in
a<00:00:50.129> pinhole<00:00:50.460> cameras<00:00:50.820> case<00:00:51.000> you're<00:00:51.239> going<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
a pinhole cameras case you're going to

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.080 
a pinhole cameras case you're going to
use<00:00:51.600> projection<00:00:52.320> by<00:00:53.100> basically<00:00:53.489> reducing<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
use projection by basically reducing the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.939 
use projection by basically reducing the
light<00:00:54.239> through<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.510> very<00:00:54.719> teeny<00:00:55.020> tiny<00:00:55.350> pinhole

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
light through a very teeny tiny pinhole

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.099 
light through a very teeny tiny pinhole
to<00:00:56.579> project<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.329> light<00:00:57.480> onto<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> back<00:00:57.960> of

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
to project the light onto the back of

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.779 
to project the light onto the back of
the<00:00:58.170> box<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.620> put<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.859> in<00:00:58.980> focus<00:00:59.129> now<00:00:59.460> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
the box and put it in focus now the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.490 
the box and put it in focus now the
great<00:01:00.210> thing<00:01:00.420> about<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.989> all<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.350> need

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
of the pinhole cameras that I've found

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.440 
of the pinhole cameras that I've found
pretty<00:01:13.200> handy<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.590> my<00:01:13.799> use<00:01:14.090> first<00:01:15.090> camera<00:01:15.420> I

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
affectionately known as the pinhole gun

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.359 
affectionately known as the pinhole gun
now<00:01:18.509> all<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> Holga<00:01:19.920> camera<00:01:20.250> that's

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
now all this is is a Holga camera that's

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.920 
now all this is is a Holga camera that's
been<00:01:20.549> modified<00:01:21.000> into<00:01:21.360> being<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.630> pinhole

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
been modified into being a pinhole

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.600 
been modified into being a pinhole
camera<00:01:21.990> if<00:01:22.619> you<00:01:22.680> don't<00:01:22.860> know<00:01:22.920> what<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> Holga<00:01:23.490> is

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
camera if you don't know what a Holga is

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.060 
camera if you don't know what a Holga is
it's<00:01:23.850> simply<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.210> cheap<00:01:24.869> plastic<00:01:25.110> toy<00:01:25.619> camera

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
it's simply a cheap plastic toy camera

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.609 
it's simply a cheap plastic toy camera
that<00:01:26.640> takes<00:01:26.850> 120<00:01:27.540> medium<00:01:27.780> format<00:01:28.020> film<00:01:28.170> and

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
that takes 120 medium format film and

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.380 
that takes 120 medium format film and
what's<00:01:29.189> great<00:01:29.340> about<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.729> is<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.090> it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
what's great about this is it is it

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.880 
what's great about this is it is it
becomes<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.810> roll<00:01:31.049> film<00:01:31.320> camera<00:01:31.710> if<00:01:31.770> you're

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
becomes a roll film camera if you're

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.319 
becomes a roll film camera if you're
going<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.100> make<00:01:32.250> your<00:01:32.430> own<00:01:32.549> pinhole<00:01:32.970> camera

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
going to make your own pinhole camera

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.580 
going to make your own pinhole camera
you're<00:01:33.509> usually<00:01:33.630> kind<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.049> finding<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.439> way<00:01:34.560> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
you're usually kind of finding a way to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.380 
you're usually kind of finding a way to
stick<00:01:34.920> film<00:01:35.159> into<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.369> back<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.000> it's

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
stick film into the back of it and it's

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.030 
stick film into the back of it and it's
good<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:36.600> one<00:01:36.900> shot<00:01:36.930> until<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.829> get<00:01:37.920> it

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
good for one shot until you can get it

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.740 
good for one shot until you can get it
either<00:01:38.159> into<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.490> dark<00:01:38.759> bag<00:01:38.970> or<00:01:39.210> indoors<00:01:39.509> into

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
either into a dark bag or indoors into

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
model as a pinhole what's great about it

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.929 
model as a pinhole what's great about it
is<00:02:03.829> pin<00:02:04.829> holes<00:02:05.040> because<00:02:05.520> they're<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:05.880> small

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
is pin holes because they're so small

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.910 
is pin holes because they're so small
and<00:02:06.240> don't<00:02:06.479> let<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> lot<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.990> light<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.290> require

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.420 
and don't let a lot of light in require
longer<00:02:08.280> exposures<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:11.190> way<00:02:11.310> the

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
longer exposures and so the way the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.770 
longer exposures and so the way the
whole<00:02:11.580> goes<00:02:11.760> design<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.239> just<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.540> fixed

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
whole goes design is just a fixed

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
camera is another santa bárbara camera

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.360 
camera is another santa bárbara camera
and<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:18.320> only<00:04:18.440> difference<00:04:18.620> between<00:04:18.829> this<00:04:19.159> one

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
and the only difference between this one

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.649 
and the only difference between this one
and<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.519> last<00:04:19.639> one<00:04:19.849> i<00:04:19.970> showed<00:04:20.209> you<00:04:20.269> is<00:04:20.479> this

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:20.659 
and the last one i showed you is this

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:22.450 
and the last one i showed you is this
one<00:04:20.840> has<00:04:20.989> a<00:04:21.019> longer<00:04:21.530> focal<00:04:21.709> length<00:04:22.070> as<00:04:22.190> you<00:04:22.310> can

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
one has a longer focal length as you can

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.040 
one has a longer focal length as you can
see<00:04:22.700> so<00:04:23.000> rather<00:04:23.150> than<00:04:23.330> being<00:04:23.510> a<00:04:23.630> wide<00:04:23.840> angle

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
see so rather than being a wide angle

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.390 
see so rather than being a wide angle
this<00:04:24.320> one's<00:04:24.529> going<00:04:24.710> to<00:04:24.740> act

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
this one's going to act

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.100 
this one's going to act
more<00:04:25.580> like<00:04:25.760> a<00:04:25.790> telephoto<00:04:26.419> or<00:04:26.660> a<00:04:26.690> portrait

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
more like a telephoto or a portrait

types of photography and you don't have

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:33.879 
types of photography and you don't have
to<00:04:32.600> be<00:04:32.690> right<00:04:32.870> up<00:04:32.990> onto<00:04:33.139> your<00:04:33.320> subject<00:04:33.530> to<00:04:33.770> do

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
you can these cameras come with a chart

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.530 
you can these cameras come with a chart
or<00:04:45.860> you<00:04:45.979> could<00:04:46.100> look<00:04:46.190> on<00:04:46.340> their<00:04:46.460> website<00:04:46.820> and

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
they give you exposure equivalents so

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.430 
they give you exposure equivalents so
when<00:04:49.580> you<00:04:49.699> mater<00:04:50.000> you<00:04:50.240> can<00:04:50.389> actually<00:04:50.570> do<00:04:51.290> the

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
when you mater you can actually do the

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
math and figure out what the exposure

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.000 
math and figure out what the exposure
