00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.420
 take into account the following regular 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.720
 the played kun of the so-called 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.850
 a conjugated humor after forgetting how to eat 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.380
 for example if I want they have conjugated of this one of this format that I have here 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.870
 on this ride that I have here web is arrested 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.650
 with plays of race would be the same magazine 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.800
 but now 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.980
 with the opposite operation would also be beni 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.980
 and that would be the with players 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.160
 this pole against the cracker is calculated by subtracting 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.330
 we are an example 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
 an event at the same time of multiplication 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.030
 yes zeta 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.250
 It does not matter 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.290
 To five 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.610
 more three times 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.610
 otr is imaginary 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.500
 between 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.740
 6 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.880
 more twice imagined 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.620
 very used 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.900
 played of the so-called 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.880
 that is to say 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.650
 I'm going to look for a number 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.410
 or rather an operation 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.410
 that was acted that represent with players 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.630
 and really the same operation 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.710
 the roof is going to change slightly 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.720
 instead of being a sum the web will become a magazine 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.880
 and that 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.120
 I'm going to multiply it by both 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.070
 numerator and named sq play 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.770
 the procurator of the so-called 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.689
 6 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.689
 - two imaginary 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.809
 and to multiply power nominator used the same portugal 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:18.579
 6 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.919
 2 imagine 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:23.919
 together observe how this space is repeated 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:30.469
 with the opposite operation because dry players 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:34.159
 from here I am going to get you a question for which I am going to solve this division 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:39.709
 had to multiply applying in the latest inventions I have of algebra 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.569
 these two performances 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.949
 that is, 'I'm going to multiply 

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:46.219
 these two factors 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:49.109
 they become complete factors 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.399
 these factors 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:53.129
 I'm not going to multiply and that's what I'm going to buck 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.669
 5 for 6 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:56.369
 5 for 2 and 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:58.769
 three and for six three innings 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:02:59.919
 potosÃ­ 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.139
 respecting the clear sims 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:03.709
 5 for 6 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.419
 of thirty 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.119
 positive 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.989
 5 for 1-2 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.909
 - 10 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.819
 because this yes 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.819
 3i for six we are positive 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.629
 positive 18 imaginary 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:29.049
 and 3 and positive by two and negative gives me ana 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:33.479
 6 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.049
 6 and square 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.229
 remember that the illia squared equals minus one 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:46.229
 and that concept use here 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.609
 I'm going to look for the one named 

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:56.889
 is for six positives both vega 36 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:05.889
 6 at least two gives me - 12 the i because it is part of the second factor 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.599
 12 and 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.599
 dosil for six gives me more 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:15.149
 12 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.620
 gone and 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.340
 at least two and 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.340
 age k-4 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:27.529
 now call subtract 

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:30.240
 unreal 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.699
 simplifying these equation tests until finding its minimum expression 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.729
 30 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.729
 good for what is 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.389
 30 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.770
 - and +18 win 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.770
 plus 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.099
 - 6 matched 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.099
 - 6 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:04.469
 called 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:07.550
 and that is what we have here -12 and 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:08.699
 martos there 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:09.770
 these 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.150
 they are eliminated 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.559
 since a mere active and others positive 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:16.370
 and I have nothing left these two elements 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.370
 well as I'm called 36 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.900
 four for less 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.659
 30 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:38.349
 more ohtsubo and 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:39.210
 plus 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.639
 6 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.039
 - 6 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:43.319
 for less one 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:46.319
 give me more 6 

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:51.749
 on 

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:56.939
 4 - four at least one gives me more 4 36 +4 gives me 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.520
 This is the same 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.759
 to 36 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:10.499
 8 and 

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:11.830
 nephew 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.900
 40 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.920
 just as we remove the even numbers I can still simplify a bit more 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:21.490
 therefore I will continue with 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.909
 that simplification I will not separate into two versions 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:27.300
 36 out of 40 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.539
 plus 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:31.819
 poch his daughter 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:34.819
 over 40 

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:44.869
 This is the same 

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:47.869
 to 9 out of 10 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:59.419
 about 5 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.430
 then value that I look for is this 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:07.289
 9 out of 10 

00:07:09.369 --> 00:07:11.819
 9 out of 10 

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:13.619
 1 envelope not covered
