Zelda<00:03:22.980> boss<00:03:23.250> right<00:03:23.489> now<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.940> make<00:03:24.299> more<00:03:24.540> money

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
Zelda boss right now and make more money

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.259 
Zelda boss right now and make more money
than<00:03:25.019> this<00:03:25.230> play<00:03:25.560> body's<00:03:25.890> worth<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.579> I<00:03:27.209> don't

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
than this play body's worth and I don't

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.060 
than this play body's worth and I don't
think<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:27.660> could<00:03:27.840> sell<00:03:28.049> it<00:03:28.079> in<00:03:28.350> like<00:03:28.590> 5<00:03:29.040> minutes

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
think I could sell it in like 5 minutes

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.550 
think I could sell it in like 5 minutes
it<00:03:30.060> would<00:03:30.239> take<00:03:30.420> more<00:03:30.630> time<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.900> find<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.350> buyer

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
it would take more time to find a buyer

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.130 
it would take more time to find a buyer
so<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.430> could<00:03:32.640> just<00:03:32.790> kill<00:03:33.030> Jews<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.630> all<00:03:33.690> Rus<00:03:33.930> in

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
so I could just kill Jews and all Rus in

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.080 
so I could just kill Jews and all Rus in
the<00:03:34.350> same<00:03:34.560> time<00:03:34.769> make<00:03:35.070> two<00:03:35.280> hundred<00:03:35.430> thousand

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
the same time make two hundred thousand

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.039 
the same time make two hundred thousand
and<00:03:36.290> have<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.530> play<00:03:37.739> body<00:03:38.010> in<00:03:38.310> my<00:03:38.970> bank<00:03:39.239> that's

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
and have the play body in my bank that's

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.050 
and have the play body in my bank that's
why<00:03:40.290> all<00:03:40.530> of<00:03:40.560> these<00:03:40.829> junk<00:03:41.100> items<00:03:41.280> are<00:03:41.640> still<00:03:41.850> my
