00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.710
 no no 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.990
 I did not know triads well 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.650
 but someone was listening to me playing and 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:25.250
 I assumed that I knew things that maybe more 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.099
 or less sounded but then when it was 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.140
 the level test was very funny that I 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.020
 take this level in the merger in the 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.470
 most advanced level of guitar and not 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.610
 it was good 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.610
 it is true that touching 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.149
 it's true when you get it as a 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.149
 compliment 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.540
 I was going to talk to me very bad 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.950
 like when you have a piece of food in 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.950
 the teeth and nobody says anything to you 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.870
 3 hours before expiration we would not have 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.280
 annoy you make a school you 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.280
 say you have something between the days 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:19.039
 so that really hurt me 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:20.840
 I went to a level at that to the sixth level of 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:25.600
 less equal 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.600
 I did six months of editing and a half 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.590
 as 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.050
 but what I'm going to do is that it would have been 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.730
 much more beneficial within touching 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.250
 very bad our 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.960
 that day I do not also agree with a 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.659
 time 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.700
 you saw those moments that one like 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.990
 understands something between one is always in 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.990
 have but is in when alonso 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.579
 than in a chord in the test of the test 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.240
 of level or something meyssan touch the scale 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.240
 diminished 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:14.950
 and they tell me ok you know the scale 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.150
 diminished and I feel offended as 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:24.310
 I just touched her this does not mean that the c 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.810
 let's see as a thing of how I worry 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.329
 that you think that I 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:33.519
 because I did that if someone told him 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:37.470
 always if the alphabet ends if the 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.470
 abecedario sis a sos a good novelist 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.850
 the alphabet and maybe if I did a 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.360
 second time 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.360
 I was just lucky 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.180
 it's in that sense it seems to me that in those 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:59.819
 tests this is good 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.819
 and show the worst part of boston 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.799
 just touch what you can really touch 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.499
 what he is doing is being there 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.930
 as much time as possible 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:13.659
 learn the most things 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:17.390
 because the title is not worth anything let's say 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:20.210
 if they tell you it 's cooked 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.750
 did not study in berklee suddenly burn 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.750
 Their disks 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.980
 in fact what they say is a 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.980
 figure and types like Gary Burton 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.610
 that in a sliding world you had 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.810
 enough school 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.810
 now to play 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:46.799
 thank you as a return plus not only 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.799
 the title matters 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.810
 I got that and as soon as possible 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:57.760
 touch I do not say it's wrong they end up 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.920
 school but what I'm going with so 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.200
 level test and others it seems to me that 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.260
 it's good to show 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.010
 the worst part of you 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:13.800
 in that situation is that that's what 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.800
 you can really say badly asleep 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.280
 and there you will touch what really 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.359
 you can touch 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.359
 because if I learn
