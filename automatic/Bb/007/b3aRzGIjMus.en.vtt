it<00:02:01.170> kind<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.649> full<00:02:02.990> elegant<00:02:03.990> look<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.590> so

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
it kind of a full elegant look to it so

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.219 
it kind of a full elegant look to it so
I<00:02:05.070> layered<00:02:05.700> quite<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> few<00:02:06.450> trims<00:02:06.780> on<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.200> I

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
think there's five different trims and

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.729 
think there's five different trims and
I've<00:02:09.060> started<00:02:09.300> with<00:02:09.569> some<00:02:09.750> pretty<00:02:10.020> lace<00:02:10.289> and

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
I've started with some pretty lace and

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.930 
I've started with some pretty lace and
then<00:02:11.459> this<00:02:11.640> be

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
then this be

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.470

trim<00:02:15.810> here<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.290> little<00:02:16.530> rope<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.940> then

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060
