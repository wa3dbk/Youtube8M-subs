00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.540 
stiff in the on the bottom bracket very
precisely<00:02:34.160> in<00:02:34.670> descent<00:02:35.180> but<00:02:36.010> comfortable<00:02:37.010> too

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
precisely in descent but comfortable too

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.630 
precisely in descent but comfortable too
it<00:02:38.300> also<00:02:38.450> looks<00:02:38.750> very<00:02:39.140> aerodynamic<00:02:39.770> is<00:02:40.460> that

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
it also looks very aerodynamic is that

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.890 
it also looks very aerodynamic is that
something<00:02:40.880> you've<00:02:40.970> paid<00:02:41.150> attention<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.630> when

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
something you've paid attention to when

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.630 
something you've paid attention to when
designing<00:02:42.230> yes<00:02:44.800> aerodynamics<00:02:45.800> is<00:02:45.950> very<00:02:46.190> very

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
designing yes aerodynamics is very very

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.199 
designing yes aerodynamics is very very
important<00:02:47.209> in<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:48.020> in<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.590> road<00:02:48.770> bike<00:02:48.980> -<00:02:49.400> not

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
important in the in the road bike - not

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.260 
important in the in the road bike - not
only<00:02:50.540> in<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.020> in<00:02:51.380> day<00:02:51.560> time<00:02:51.770> trying<00:02:52.100> bike<00:02:52.400> so

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
only in the in day time trying bike so

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.510 
only in the in day time trying bike so
this<00:02:53.420> part<00:02:53.690> is<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.900> lot<00:02:54.200> of<00:02:54.290> fun<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.590> ride<00:02:54.800> fast

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
this part is a lot of fun to ride fast

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.580 
this part is a lot of fun to ride fast
you<00:02:56.270> can<00:02:56.390> put<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.600> power<00:02:56.780> down<00:02:56.959> but<00:02:57.320> you<00:02:57.410> can

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
you can put the power down but you can

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.770 
you can put the power down but you can
also<00:02:57.709> really<00:02:58.130> enjoy<00:02:58.520> going<00:02:58.970> downhill<00:02:59.300> on

when you ride you have to to feel safe
safety<00:03:07.850> in<00:03:08.720> descent<00:03:09.320> it's<00:03:09.890> very<00:03:10.160> very

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
safety in descent it's very very

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.860 
safety in descent it's very very
important<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.440> with<00:03:12.440> this<00:03:12.920> Fork<00:03:13.220> is<00:03:13.450> you<00:03:14.450> can

write very fast and your bike stay

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.430 
write very fast and your bike stay
without<00:03:21.980> yes<00:03:23.060> when<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.180> sprint<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.690> very<00:03:24.960> very

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
without yes when you sprint is very very

without yes when you sprint is very very
stiff<00:03:25.800> and<00:03:26.300> you<00:03:27.300> can<00:03:27.810> ride<00:03:28.050> five<00:03:28.890> seven<00:03:29.550> hour

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
stiff and you can ride five seven hour

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.600 
stiff and you can ride five seven hour
easy<00:03:30.570> easy<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.590> perfect<00:03:31.950> rollback<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.460> your
