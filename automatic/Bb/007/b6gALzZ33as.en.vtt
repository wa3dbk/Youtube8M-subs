it<00:02:23.340> came<00:02:23.550> from<00:02:23.819> why<00:02:24.120> it's<00:02:24.300> significant<00:02:25.050> why<00:02:25.410> we

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
it came from why it's significant why we

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.010 
it came from why it's significant why we
would<00:02:25.830> even<00:02:25.980> want<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.340> study<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.720> get

I<00:02:57.209> think<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.599> tours<00:02:57.840> really<00:02:58.470> do<00:02:58.650> make<00:02:58.829> history

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
I think the tours really do make history

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.280 
I think the tours really do make history
accessible<00:02:59.579> in<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.299> US<00:03:00.659> I<00:03:00.840> don't<00:03:01.019> think<00:03:01.200> we

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
accessible in the US I don't think we

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.780 
accessible in the US I don't think we
get<00:03:01.439> a<00:03:01.470> very<00:03:01.709> good<00:03:01.950> perspective<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.609> history

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
get a very good perspective of history

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.720 
get a very good perspective of history
at<00:03:03.120> all<00:03:03.269> and<00:03:03.750> when<00:03:04.409> you<00:03:04.500> come<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.799> Europe<00:03:05.159> first

present I think everybody can latch onto

present I think everybody can latch onto
that<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:44.819> everybody<00:03:45.120> can<00:03:45.269> understand<00:03:45.659> that

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
that and everybody can understand that

that and everybody can understand that
quite<00:03:45.959> clearly<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:46.470> in<00:03:46.680> those<00:03:46.889> sorts<00:03:47.400> of

quite clearly and in those sorts of

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.339 
quite clearly and in those sorts of
moments<00:03:47.760> where<00:03:47.879> you<00:03:47.970> do<00:03:48.120> understand<00:03:48.629> that<00:03:48.750> the

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
moments where you do understand that the

in<00:03:51.120> many<00:03:51.299> cases<00:03:51.659> I<00:03:51.810> think<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:52.079> is<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.590> great

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
in many cases I think that is a great
