applications<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.700> amperes<00:00:09.000> law<00:00:09.059> so<00:00:10.070> and<00:00:11.070> you

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
applications of amperes law so and you

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.799 
applications of amperes law so and you
put<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.400> funny<00:00:11.849> I<00:00:11.910> put<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.210> backwards<00:00:12.599> I

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
put that funny I put it backwards I

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.110 
put that funny I put it backwards I
think<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:13.410> supposed<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.679> go<00:00:13.769> this<00:00:13.920> way<00:00:14.120> root

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
think it supposed to go this way root

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.330 
think it supposed to go this way root
sorry<00:00:15.900> I'm<00:00:16.080> Pierre<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.470> know<00:00:16.770> you're<00:00:17.010> long<00:00:17.160> dead

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
sorry I'm Pierre I know you're long dead

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.450 
sorry I'm Pierre I know you're long dead
but<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.580> still<00:00:17.760> don't<00:00:18.449> want<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:19.250> offend<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.369> in

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
but we still don't want to offend you in

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.870 
but we still don't want to offend you in
any<00:00:20.550> way<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:21.240> we<00:00:21.660> calculated<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.880> curl

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
any way so we calculated that the curl

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.710 
any way so we calculated that the curl
the<00:00:24.510> divergence<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.990> B<00:00:25.050> first<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.439> all<00:00:25.529> zero

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
the divergence of B first of all zero

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.130 
the divergence of B first of all zero
the<00:00:27.720> curl<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.170> B<00:00:28.349> however<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:29.750> equal<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.929> MU

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
the curl of B however is equal to MU

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.780 
the curl of B however is equal to MU
knot<00:00:31.320> times<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:33.350> volume<00:00:34.350> current<00:00:34.980> at<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
knot times the volume current at the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.270 
knot times the volume current at the
point<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:36.239> question<00:00:36.800> okay<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:40.129> we<00:00:41.129> can

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
point in question okay and we can

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.770 
point in question okay and we can
rewrite<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.670> an<00:00:41.879> integral<00:00:42.239> form<00:00:42.450> let's<00:00:42.629> draw

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
rewrite this an integral form let's draw

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.240 
rewrite this an integral form let's draw
a<00:00:42.809> box<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.530> differential<00:00:44.070> form

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
a box on this this is differential form

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.209 
a box on this this is differential form
of<00:00:44.399> amperes<00:00:44.820> law<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.500> so<00:00:46.500> if<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:46.800> take<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
of amperes law and so if we take the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.160 
of amperes law and so if we take the
integral<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.960> cross<00:00:48.960> P<00:00:49.260> dot<00:00:50.190> da<00:00:50.430> vector<00:00:51.170> right

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170

integral of cross P dot da vector right
over<00:00:52.379> some<00:00:53.160> surface<00:00:53.780> well<00:00:54.780> that's<00:00:54.960> gonna<00:00:55.079> be

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
over some surface well that's gonna be

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.470 
over some surface well that's gonna be
the<00:00:55.379> same<00:00:55.559> as<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.039> integral<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:57.059> mu<00:00:57.300> naught<00:00:57.449> J

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
the same as the integral of mu naught J

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.180 
the same as the integral of mu naught J
vector<00:00:57.989> dot<00:00:58.320> Da<00:00:58.530> vector<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.969> same<00:01:00.149> surface

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
vector dot Da vector on the same surface

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.229 
vector dot Da vector on the same surface
well<00:01:02.190> what's<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.850> by<00:01:02.969> Stokes

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
well what's this it's a by Stokes

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.780 
well what's this it's a by Stokes
theorem<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.690> we<00:01:03.780> get<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.110> integral<00:01:04.790> around

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
theorem so we get the integral around

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.840 
theorem so we get the integral around
the<00:01:05.850> loop<00:01:06.439> of<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.979> vector<00:01:08.310> dot<00:01:08.900> DL<00:01:09.900> vector<00:01:10.850> is

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
the loop of the vector dot DL vector is

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.429 
the loop of the vector dot DL vector is
equal<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.450> what's<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
equal to what's this this is the the

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.700 
equal to what's this this is the the
total<00:01:16.439> current<00:01:16.950> within<00:01:18.080> that<00:01:19.080> area<00:01:19.619> that

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
total current within that area that

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.219 
total current within that area that
we're<00:01:19.860> looking<00:01:19.950> at<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.460> that's<00:01:21.049> mu<00:01:22.049> naught

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
we're looking at so that's mu naught

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.490 
we're looking at so that's mu naught
times<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.430> enclosed<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.110> integral

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
times the enclosed this is the integral

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.020 
times the enclosed this is the integral
form<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.950> Stokes<00:01:26.250> tan<00:01:26.460> they're<00:01:26.700> equivalent

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
form of Stokes tan they're equivalent

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.859 
form of Stokes tan they're equivalent
you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.170> easily<00:01:28.290> go<00:01:28.560> from<00:01:28.680> one<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.009> other

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
you can easily go from one to the other

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.590 
you can easily go from one to the other
the<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:32.100> problem<00:01:32.640> with<00:01:32.759> Stokes<00:01:33.030> theorem<00:01:33.270> is

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the the problem with Stokes theorem is

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.230 
the the problem with Stokes theorem is
it<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.740> don't<00:01:34.950> know<00:01:35.159> right<00:01:35.369> ahead<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.210> you

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
it you don't know right ahead so you

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.819 
it you don't know right ahead so you
take<00:01:36.479> some<00:01:36.689> arbitrary<00:01:37.200> surface<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.650> this

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
take some arbitrary surface like this

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.749 
take some arbitrary surface like this
and<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:39.030> calculate<00:01:39.770> you<00:01:40.770> know<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.369> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
and you calculate you know the the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.450 
and you calculate you know the the
surface<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.840> then<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.770> say<00:01:43.920> oh<00:01:43.950> that's<00:01:44.130> equal

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
surface and then you say oh that's equal

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.620 
surface and then you say oh that's equal
to<00:01:44.490> going<00:01:44.700> around<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.030> loop<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.299> which<00:01:45.420> way

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
to going around the loop but which way

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.060 
to going around the loop but which way
do<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.840> go<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.110> way<00:01:46.170> or<00:01:46.590> do<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.770> go<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.009> way

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
do you go this way or do you go this way

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.830 
do you go this way or do you go this way
and<00:01:47.220> that's<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:48.299> depends<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.720> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
and that's that depends on the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.170 
and that's that depends on the
right-handed<00:01:49.229> rule<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.310> obviously<00:01:50.970> you're

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
right-handed rule so obviously you're

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.800 
right-handed rule so obviously you're
gonna<00:01:51.270> go<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:52.439> right<00:01:52.619> direction<00:01:53.600> using<00:01:54.600> a

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
gonna go the right direction using a

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.330 
gonna go the right direction using a
vector<00:01:55.259> pointing<00:01:55.590> up<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.799> way<00:01:55.979> if<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.159> vector

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
vector pointing up this way if a vector

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.319 
vector pointing up this way if a vector
is<00:01:56.490> pointing<00:01:56.610> down<00:01:56.820> you're<00:01:56.939> gonna<00:01:57.030> go<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
is pointing down you're gonna go the

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.800 
is pointing down you're gonna go the
opposite<00:01:57.659> direction<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.350> that's<00:01:59.100> the

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
opposite direction so that's the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.340 
opposite direction so that's the
right-handed<00:02:00.810> rule<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:03.750> interesting<00:02:04.170> thing

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
right-handed rule the interesting thing

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.710 
right-handed rule the interesting thing
is<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.850> Gauss's<00:02:05.850> law<00:02:05.960> looks<00:02:06.960> very<00:02:07.290> similar

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.850 

it's<00:02:12.740> you<00:02:13.740> know<00:02:13.860> it's<00:02:14.010> kind<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.280> funny<00:02:14.550> how<00:02:15.860> you

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
it's you know it's kind of funny how you

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.010 
it's you know it's kind of funny how you
start<00:02:17.130> with<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.490> nickel<00:02:18.240> Ohm's<00:02:18.390> law<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.900> you

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
start with the nickel Ohm's law and you

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.370 
start with the nickel Ohm's law and you
end<00:02:19.230> up<00:02:19.380> with<00:02:19.590> Gauss's<00:02:20.100> law<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.750> in<00:02:21.750> magneto

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
end up with Gauss's law and in magneto

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.680 
end up with Gauss's law and in magneto
statics<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:23.070> start<00:02:23.310> with<00:02:23.600> biot-savart<00:02:24.600> law

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
statics you start with biot-savart law

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.130 
statics you start with biot-savart law
and<00:02:25.130> they<00:02:26.130> end<00:02:26.370> up<00:02:26.430> with<00:02:26.490> that<00:02:26.670> pairs<00:02:26.910> law<00:02:27.770> and

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
and they end up with that pairs law and

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.040 
and they end up with that pairs law and
so<00:02:31.140> anyway<00:02:31.440> it's<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:33.150> know<00:02:33.270> it's<00:02:33.810> kind<00:02:33.870> of

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
so anyway it's you know it's kind of

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.480 
so anyway it's you know it's kind of
interesting<00:02:34.320> that<00:02:34.590> math<00:02:34.770> works<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.250> way<00:02:35.430> to

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
interesting that math works that way to

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.400 
interesting that math works that way to
nature<00:02:35.880> happens<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.330> mirror<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.690> it's<00:02:37.260> just

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
nature happens to mirror that it's just

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.500 
nature happens to mirror that it's just
a<00:02:37.470> beautiful<00:02:37.860> symmetry<00:02:38.240> next<00:02:39.240> we're<00:02:39.360> going<00:02:39.450> to

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
a beautiful symmetry next we're going to

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.480 
a beautiful symmetry next we're going to
cover<00:02:39.690> all<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.110> examples<00:02:40.380> seven<00:02:41.280> eight<00:02:41.370> nine

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
cover all the examples seven eight nine

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.180 
cover all the examples seven eight nine
and<00:02:41.550> ten<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.500> then<00:02:43.500> we'll<00:02:43.620> be<00:02:43.710> done<00:02:43.860> with<00:02:43.920> this

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
and ten and then we'll be done with this

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.230 
and ten and then we'll be done with this
section<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:44.670> we'll<00:02:44.790> go<00:02:44.880> on<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.120> next

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
section and we'll go on to the next

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.700 
section and we'll go on to the next
section<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:45.870> thanks<00:02:46.080> for<00:02:46.140> your<00:02:46.200> time<00:02:46.290> take

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
section so thanks for your time take

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.890 
section so thanks for your time take
care<00:02:46.770> bye
