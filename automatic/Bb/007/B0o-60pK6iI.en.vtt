00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
 how many billions are studying their scientists 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.560
 just made an incredible discovery 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.170
 galaxies do not stand still but constantly 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.570
 they move as it drifts on 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.030
 the universe therefore sometimes galaxies 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.280
 face not like a car 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.160
 three years ago by the Russian astrophysicist 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.400
 managed to read rap 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.920
 our galaxy turns the milky way 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.200
 rushing at breakneck speed to the neighboring 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.869
 Andromeda Galaxy 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.800
 if he doesn't change his trajectory then 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.800
 surely she has 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.690
 astrophysicists are confident even if our 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.120
 the milky way will crash into the galaxy 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.270
 Andromeda nebula disaster soon 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.950
 just won't happen just because 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.550
 between the planets and the stars of both 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.160
 galaxies 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.739
 huge distances means probability 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.360
 the fact that the earth will face one of 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.260
 There are very few planets of the Andromeda nebula. 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.480
 planets around stars 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.489
 they are very close hi over the stars 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.680
 star crap like a mother and take create 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.150
 its gravitational field completely 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.100
 subdue seek their own planet and 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.380
 they absolutely care about everything there to everyone 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.820
 faces therefore weave on 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.479
 on the planets it will not produce any 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.420
 almost even if the earth doesn't collide 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.070
 another planet from andromeda nebula 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.310
 there is another danger in the milky 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.470
 Andromeda paths and nebulae are black 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.550
 holes that are in the very center 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.040
 galaxies 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.430
 they possess tremendous power over and 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.680
 able to literally devour everything around 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.310
 stars of the planet and even whole solar 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.250
 systems 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.890
 now both of them are sleeping and not touching 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.620
 around 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.200
 only our galaxy is the milky way and 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.370
 slammed into the andromeda nebula black 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.460
 holes of both galaxies 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.930
 unite and turn eyes 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.510
 in other words 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.479
 giant black hole in the force of attraction 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.330
 which will be hundreds of times more normal 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.700
 and she starts to just suck in herself 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.030
 any substance that will fall and 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.510
 its speed slows down as 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.280
 approaching black darth vader and 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.590
 matter it hardens on a certain 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.819
 the distance 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.459
 it freezes because its something 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.250
 slowed down but because she got into 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:27.120
 Wednesday where time flows is not at all like 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.370
 we have time on earth for our earthly 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.950
 standards are slowing down there 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.269
 therefore the process of penetration inside 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.610
 black hole for us will always be closed 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.560
 escape from our devouring quasar 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.049
 planet earth can only in one 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.420
 if with the sun and others 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.819
 planets will be able to build new 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.380
 the planetary system and with it will 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.630
 fight with enormous gravity 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.190
 cosmic monster after 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.890
 galaxy collisions 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.730
 all stars and planets and comets and in them 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.730
 get mixed up will start forming a new 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.370
 galaxies if our solar system is not 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.040
 can reorganize quasars and and first 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.319
 will draw to himself and then just 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.040
 it will look something like this now 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:18.280
 you see a quasar sucking a star 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.129
 the mass of which is five times the sun it 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.980
 breaks it into pieces and then 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:26.290
 absorbs them every single month 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.959
 a large cluster of stars and 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.659
 one star falls near black 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.299
 that hole from and it can fall on black 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.849
 hole to increase its mass, respectively 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.010
 if after a collision of two galaxies 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.260
 our planet will be able to get into a new 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.980
 the solar system then humanity will 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.129
 saved 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.900
 and get a unique opportunity 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.480
 examine thoroughly how bazaars today 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.129
 make it almost impossible 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.409
 because even the closest ones 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.189
 located at a distance of 7 billion 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.980
 light years 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:59.080
 having studied the quasars of humanity commit 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.270
 giant technology breakthrough 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.980
 After all, the quasar is the most powerful source 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.960
 energy in the universe from all sources 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:13.690
 energy which is known modern 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:16.980
 no physics can explain 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.959
 quasar phenomenon other than gravitational 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:22.650
 well we know the most powerful conclusion 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.730
 energy release let's say 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.270
 thermonuclear energy in the depths of such 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:31.440
 stars like souls on she is not able 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:35.530
 explain here those energy flows 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.930
 which emits even with quite 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:41.800
 average for quasar properties 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:44.410
 quasar and being in billions 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.990
 light years from the earth can even be seen 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.030
 to the naked eye and this despite the fact that 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.580
 they are several times smaller in size 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.320
 our sun is so bright 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.990
 they shine because they have going on 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.670
 Whether nuclear fusion in the sun and 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.070
 completely different gravitational 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.470
 if scientists manage to find out the formula for this 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.870
 reactions and then repeat and on the ground 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.360
 even on a smaller scale then 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.520
 humanity will receive fuel which 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.800
 it will be possible to refuel intergalactic 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.860
 ships able to fly to the brim 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.690
 we settle just imagine the space 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.880
 the ship that will be filled so 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.520
 fuel can in just a few hours 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.900
 fly to the nearest planet be 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.300
 mars or winner 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.450
 and in a few days he or tezoro to 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.790
 neighboring galaxy for comparison today 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:33.620
 using the latest technology 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:37.720
 man will fly to the nearest 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.720
 galaxies more than a hundred thousand thursday 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.419
 it remains to add that very recently 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:50.029
 scientists have released new data on 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:52.309
 the upcoming nebula clash 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:54.949
 andromeda crashes into our galaxy 

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:57.050
 in two billion years so we have with 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:59.599
 you still have time to think of something 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:04.909
 although by space standards 2 billion 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:05.659
 it's very little suddenly killed by me 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:08.749
 other plans 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.619
 intelligence agents no weekend and 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:11.749
 holidays 

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:14.779
 you know my principles i am private orders 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:15.889
 do not perform but processing and 

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:19.430
 overtime 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:22.909
 even more than he is the best there is an urgent 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:25.759
 business today fly south question well 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:28.099
 what a normal woman can stand it 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:32.330
 creepy work schedule makes you 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:35.849
 do something bystritskaya until her daughter have 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:38.659
 us, he did not do anything well that 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:42.469
 exactly blind legendary series 

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:45.240
 sunday all day on ren TV 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:45.809
 when the sun shines the dirt on the windows behind 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.029
 summer 

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:51.419
 luckily i have a magic tool 

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:53.520
 wedge alcohol content just apply 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:55.949
 active foam unlike ordinary 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.809
 funds Klim does not leave a divorce for 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:07:01.409
 any glass surfaces 

00:06:57.809 --> 00:07:04.399
 wedge transforms my life wedge shine 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:04.399
 without divorce
