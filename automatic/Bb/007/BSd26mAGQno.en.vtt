00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.869
 new model on the market but what to do 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.529
 I with my personal data 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.020
 the iphone 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.860
 if I sold it I'll tell 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.320
 you need the following for that 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:44.060
 first, your iphone as a second 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.200
 Of course, the cable to sink and a 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:50.360
 computer is installed on itunes 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.710
 Now proceed as follows 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.890
 Next , connect your iphone 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:01.850
 with the help of the cable with your pc or 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.200
 mac and start itunes as soon as yours 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.239
 iphone was detected 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.960
 you have the following menu item to choose from 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:13.939
 choose iphone restore this one 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.679
 we then ask usunes if we have the 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.409
 I want to secure your software 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:19.549
 they do not want to save it 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.380
 iphone really on the 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.210
 reset factory settings all 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.929
 Media and other data are thereby 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.729
 deleted we want exactly what I want 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.380
 do 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.609
 on the iphone are purchased 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.350
 articles not yet in theirs 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:37.090
 mediathek were transferred 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.340
 that does not matter to me now 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.200
 and now it's time to get going 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.259
 following note that itunes the 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.179
 prepared and the restoration 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.779
 software which is then re-recorded 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.429
 on your iphone is extracted that can 

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:54.560
 depending on speed or connection 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.259
 and your computer a few minutes 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.840
 last 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:03.520
 it's about time 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.520
 restoration is checked 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.270
 but that can take a while as you do 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.650
 sees and then you get the following 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.080
 picture on your iphone 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.700
 it's going to turn black and boot 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:33.990
 then you will see itunes no 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:33.990
 go and then it's time to wait 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.570
 can see up here is now 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.440
 iphone for recovery 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:47.650
 prepared and that can be done again 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.990
 Something lasting I will contact you as soon as it 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:55.650
 so far so that itunes is 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.750
 disappeared and the normal mut screen 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.830
 starts with the apple logo and then 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:06.210
 we should now see how 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.210
 the software is installed 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.260
 sometime now starts at the bar 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.000
 to walk to the right and that too 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.670
 takes a few more minutes you have to 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.560
 have patience 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.530
 during itunes now the new software 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.090
 is still too playable on your iphone 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.950
 mention that it really is unconditional 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.860
 it is necessary that we take this step 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.080
 if you sell your iphone 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.270
 because only then is it guaranteed that 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.190
 no one to your personal data 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:41.140
 which have saved on the iphone 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:43.000
 then comes very important to the 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.930
 restoration of the software will 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.489
 these are still checked by itunes 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.810
 should now about half the loading bar 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.810
 seen on your iphone 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.050
 after the check is also the 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.050
 firmware restored 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.310
 why the firmware is back 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.670
 made and you get the following 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.420
 Note on your computer the iphone 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.250
 was on factory settings 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:18.109
 reset and start right now 9 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.109
 and that's exactly what you can see now 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.770
 during this reboot process gets 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.410
 yes again a screen where again 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.300
 times software is downloaded to the iphone 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.550
 This serves to activate the 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:41.289
 Smartphones and may take several minutes 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.660
 claim and there we have it 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.919
 drove the iphone of the tower and 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.919
 already complains directly no 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:51.190
 sim card is in it when we do the whole thing 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:52.930
 would unlock you get to the 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.699
