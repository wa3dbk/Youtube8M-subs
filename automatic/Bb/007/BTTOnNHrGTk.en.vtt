00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:21.349
 Let's make some examples of poetry 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.860
 2% per month will be proportional to 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.619
 this symbol to how many per cent per year 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.869
 as well as eight tries and months to pass 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.540
 from month to year as proportional rates 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:41.059
 It's 12 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:46.970
 then 2% times 12 will give 24% a year 2% 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:55.159
 per month is proportional to 24% per year per 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:59.239
 example 4 with the letter b cent 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:01.809
 quarter is proportional to how many per 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.670
 cent per year 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.220
 Do you know that the year has four 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.840
 quarters 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:21.290
 soon to pass from trieste to ana x 4 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:31.190
 4% times 4 will give 16% per year for 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:34.630
 example letters i 2% per semester is 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:38.570
 proportional to how many per cent per year 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:44.720
 Do you know that the year has two semesters? 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:49.150
 then give semester to 1 x 2 2% times 2 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.150
 will give 4% per year 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.640
 now for example when I am like this 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:09.159
 60% per year will be proportional to the 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.159
 how many percent per month 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.190
 I want Indian for month from year to month 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:18.110
 Do you know that the year is 12 months old? 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.500
 I want of the year for Mexican of the greatest 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:27.010
 for the smaller then day for me I go 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.010
 divide by 12 you will get 60% 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:42.940
 / said then it will be equal to 5% a month 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:53.410
 60% per year will be proportional to 5% per month 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:57.230
 for example , and 30% per year will be 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.120
 proportional to the accounts percent to 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.819
 half 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.190
 the year has two semesters 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:08.599
 so for pass in the semester term 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.799
 I will divide by 2 30% divided by 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:15.700
 two 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:26.989
 we'll have to send percent per semester 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:29.810
 for example letter f 1 36% per year will be 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:36.340
 proportional to how many percent 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:39.650
 quarter of the year has four quarters 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:44.419
 to stop by stop quarter I will 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:54.910
 divide by 4 36% 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:54.910
 / 4 36% / 4 will give 9% to the quarter 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:04.639
 so light but two rates are 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:09.019
 proportional is the ratio between them 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:12.530
 the same ratio between the unit of time 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:15.169
 that it refers to is the same ratio between 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.299
 the units of time here she who 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:20.299
 refers 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:27.289
 then the rate proportional to the ratio is 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:30.849
 according to each unit of time and we will 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:34.280
 have opportunities to apply this 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:36.409
 we are then at the beginning of the course well at 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.409
 so far things are over 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:42.319
 Easy but I'll stay a little bit longer 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:44.619
 stairs so do not have patience to 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:49.610
 catch these concepts well 

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:52.969
 do not forget to see the support material and 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.610
 I do exercises side support material and 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.449
 they are all answered here in 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.419
 videos 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:03.889
 Let's stay here, we wish you 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.879
 a good strong and good studies and to 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.749
 next 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.749
 thank you
