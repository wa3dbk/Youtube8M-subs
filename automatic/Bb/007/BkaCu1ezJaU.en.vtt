begin to jailbreak now this one I found

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.419 
begin to jailbreak now this one I found
was<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> little<00:00:27.750> bit<00:00:27.960> faster<00:00:28.500> than<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.070> iPhone

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
was a little bit faster than the iPhone

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.650 
was a little bit faster than the iPhone
4s<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.760> that's<00:00:30.000> probably<00:00:30.269> because<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.510> had<00:00:30.630> a

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
4s and that's probably because I had a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.350 
4s and that's probably because I had a
lot<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.990> stuff<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.320> back<00:00:31.500> up<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.920> 4s<00:00:32.369> unlike

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
lot of stuff to back up on the 4s unlike

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.080 
lot of stuff to back up on the 4s unlike
the<00:00:33.630> iPad<00:00:34.020> 2<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.500> now<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:35.370> should<00:00:35.610> see<00:00:35.940> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the iPad 2 so now you should see the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.490

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489

you'll see the Apple logo you'll see the

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.369 
you'll see the Apple logo you'll see the
little<00:01:00.210> loading<00:01:00.539> bar<00:01:00.690> go<00:01:00.870> across<00:01:01.109> really

quickly and you'll continue to see

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.509 
quickly and you'll continue to see
absent<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.110> look<00:01:04.290> just<00:01:04.530> like<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.979> it'll<00:01:05.280> say

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
absent to look just like this it'll say

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.550 
absent to look just like this it'll say
waiting<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.060> reboot<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.930> just<00:01:07.140> give<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.409> few

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
waiting for reboot so just give it a few

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.990 
waiting for reboot so just give it a few
more<00:01:07.740> seconds<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.310> eventually<00:01:08.790> it'll

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
more seconds and eventually it'll

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.380 
more seconds and eventually it'll
proceed<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.290> next<00:01:10.439> step<00:01:10.890> here<00:01:11.060> so<00:01:12.060> we're

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
proceed to the next step here so we're

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.330 
proceed to the next step here so we're
just<00:01:12.420> gonna<00:01:12.659> give<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.960> few<00:01:13.229> more<00:01:13.380> seconds

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
just gonna give it a few more seconds

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.820 
just gonna give it a few more seconds
and<00:01:14.670> again<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.110> much<00:01:16.320> different<00:01:16.799> than

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
and again this is much different than

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.469 
and again this is much different than
previous<00:01:17.130> jailbreaks<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.150> jailbreak

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
previous jailbreaks like the jailbreak

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.630 
previous jailbreaks like the jailbreak
me<00:01:18.810> jailbreak<00:01:19.229> for<00:01:19.409> instance<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.340> it's<00:01:20.460> also

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
me jailbreak for instance and it's also

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.070 
me jailbreak for instance and it's also
quite<00:01:21.030> different<00:01:21.420> from<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.869> traditional

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
quite different from the traditional

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.950 
quite different from the traditional
jailbreaks<00:01:22.890> like<00:01:23.159> red<00:01:23.460> snow<00:01:23.790> snow<00:01:24.330> breeze<00:01:24.659> and

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
jailbreaks like red snow snow breeze and

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.780 
jailbreaks like red snow snow breeze and
things<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.380> nature<00:01:25.500> there's<00:01:26.100> no<00:01:26.220> DFU

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
things of that nature there's no DFU

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.700 
things of that nature there's no DFU
mode<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.390> need<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.600> enter<00:01:27.720> into<00:01:28.020> you

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
mode that you need to enter into you

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.260 
mode that you need to enter into you
just<00:01:28.920> hook<00:01:29.070> up<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> device<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.030> click

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
just hook up the device and you click

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.179 
just hook up the device and you click
jailbreak<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.869> literally<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.710> does<00:01:31.740> its

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
jailbreak and literally it does its

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.010 
jailbreak and literally it does its
thing<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.729> we'll<00:01:32.939> wait<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.119> few<00:01:33.420> more<00:01:33.600> seconds

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
thing so we'll wait a few more seconds

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.170 
thing so we'll wait a few more seconds
here<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.439> there<00:01:35.250> we<00:01:35.340> go<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:35.820> connecting<00:01:36.150> to

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
here and there we go it's connecting to

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.179 
here and there we go it's connecting to
device<00:01:36.600> waiting<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> device<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.950> finish

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
device waiting for the device to finish

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.530 
device waiting for the device to finish
booting<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:40.759> it<00:01:41.759> shouldn't<00:01:42.150> be<00:01:42.270> much<00:01:42.479> longer

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
booting and it shouldn't be much longer

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.249 
booting and it shouldn't be much longer
at<00:01:43.110> all<00:01:44.509> normally<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.570> would<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.750> sped<00:01:46.110> this

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
at all normally I would have sped this

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.380 
at all normally I would have sped this
up<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.100> wasn't<00:01:47.640> long<00:01:47.939> at<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.180> in

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
up but it really wasn't long at all in

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.060 
up but it really wasn't long at all in
the<00:01:48.479> first<00:01:48.630> place<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.200> figured<00:01:49.530> hey<00:01:49.799> just

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the first place so I figured hey just

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.120 
the first place so I figured hey just
let<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.340> let<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:50.939> do<00:01:51.149> its<00:01:51.180> thing<00:01:51.390> gear<00:01:51.979> so<00:01:52.979> I'd

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
let it let it do its thing gear so I'd

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.520 
let it let it do its thing gear so I'd
say<00:01:53.310> at<00:01:53.399> about<00:01:53.610> 10<00:01:54.299> more<00:01:54.479> seconds<00:01:55.020> we<00:01:55.500> should

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
say at about 10 more seconds we should

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.010 
say at about 10 more seconds we should
be<00:01:55.979> there<00:01:56.579> sending<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.240> payload<00:01:57.600> data<00:01:57.750> and

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
be there sending the payload data and

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.359 
be there sending the payload data and
here's<00:01:58.229> where<00:01:58.409> we're<00:01:58.590> really<00:01:58.860> starting<00:01:59.130> to

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
here's where we're really starting to

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.030 
here's where we're really starting to
get<00:02:00.030> down<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:01.170> crunch<00:02:01.409> time<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.920> it's

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
get down to crunch time and it's

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.980 
get down to crunch time and it's
starting<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.460> finish<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.240> jailbreak<00:02:03.659> so

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
starting to finish the jailbreak so

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.730 
starting to finish the jailbreak so
let's<00:02:04.170> head<00:02:04.350> back<00:02:04.380> over<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.829> our<00:02:05.040> iPad<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:06.740> it

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
let's head back over to our iPad and it

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.139 
let's head back over to our iPad and it
should<00:02:08.009> look<00:02:08.190> like<00:02:08.250> this

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
should look like this

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.420 
should look like this
and<00:02:09.539> eventually<00:02:10.020> we<00:02:10.259> will<00:02:10.410> see<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.860> absinthe

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
and eventually we will see the absinthe

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.850 
and eventually we will see the absinthe
