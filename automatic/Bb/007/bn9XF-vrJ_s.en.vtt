00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.629 

so<00:00:09.060> this<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.480> my<00:00:09.600> little<00:00:09.950> Austin<00:00:10.950> Seven<00:00:11.190> garage

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
so this is my little Austin Seven garage

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.940 
so this is my little Austin Seven garage
we're<00:00:12.270> on<00:00:12.800> building<00:00:13.800> this<00:00:13.860> little<00:00:14.130> car

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950 
we're on building this little car

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:17.690 
we're on building this little car
probably<00:00:16.950> looks<00:00:17.100> bigger<00:00:17.310> than<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.520> actually

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:17.700 
probably looks bigger than it actually

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.450 
probably looks bigger than it actually
is<00:00:17.939> in<00:00:18.180> here<00:00:18.420> but<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:19.560> give<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.800> some<00:00:20.040> idea<00:00:20.369> of

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
is in here but to give you some idea of

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.769 
is in here but to give you some idea of
the<00:00:20.490> size<00:00:20.730> it's<00:00:21.000> about<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.300> size<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.689> a

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
the size it's about the size of a

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.130 
the size it's about the size of a
classic<00:00:22.140> mini<00:00:23.660> possibly<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> little<00:00:24.930> bit

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
classic mini possibly a little bit

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.800 
classic mini possibly a little bit
narrower<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.739> a<00:00:25.890> little<00:00:26.310> bit<00:00:26.550> longer<00:00:26.880> just<00:00:27.660> by

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
narrower and a little bit longer just by

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.999 
narrower and a little bit longer just by
a<00:00:27.840> few<00:00:27.900> inches<00:00:30.290> the<00:00:31.290> car<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.560> being<00:00:31.650> assembled

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
a few inches the car is being assembled

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.940 
a few inches the car is being assembled
in<00:00:32.279> here<00:00:32.810> I've<00:00:33.810> got<00:00:33.960> bits<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.560> pieces<00:00:34.829> all

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
in here I've got bits and pieces all

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.389 
in here I've got bits and pieces all
over<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.310> place<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.790> welders<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:37.399> gas

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
over the place and welders and gas

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.580 
over the place and welders and gas
welding<00:00:38.670> gear<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:40.489> materials<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.640> things

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
welding gear and materials and things

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.360 
welding gear and materials and things
this<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.710> where<00:00:43.859> I've<00:00:43.949> got<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> phone

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
this is where I've got the phone

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.000 
this is where I've got the phone
mountain<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.109> phone<00:00:46.260> was<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.620> stuck<00:00:46.829> on

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
mountain so the phone was just stuck on

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.130 
mountain so the phone was just stuck on
the<00:00:47.100> wall<00:00:47.309> here<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:48.480> never<00:00:48.629> actually<00:00:48.840> been

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
the wall here it's never actually been

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.020 
the wall here it's never actually been
used<00:00:49.350> for<00:00:49.559> anything<00:00:49.769> in<00:00:50.010> here<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.429> don't

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
used for anything in here I don't

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.700 
used for anything in here I don't
actually<00:00:51.179> have<00:00:51.449> telephone<00:00:51.870> cables<00:00:52.260> out<00:00:52.410> here

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
actually have telephone cables out here

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.910 
actually have telephone cables out here
but<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:54.109> just<00:00:55.109> sort<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.289> stack<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.649> up<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.890> here

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
but I just sort of stack it up in here

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.310 
but I just sort of stack it up in here
because<00:00:56.339> it<00:00:56.480> it<00:00:57.480> kind<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.749> goes<00:00:57.929> with<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
because it it kind of goes with the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.829 
because it it kind of goes with the
place<00:00:58.969> I've<00:00:59.969> been<00:01:00.149> trying<00:01:00.269> to<00:01:00.420> make<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.629> place

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
place I've been trying to make the place

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.070 
place I've been trying to make the place
look<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.140> bit<00:01:01.289> more<00:01:02.510> suitable<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.660> guess<00:01:03.870> for

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
look a bit more suitable I guess for

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.530 
look a bit more suitable I guess for
building<00:01:04.379> an<00:01:04.470> old<00:01:04.589> car<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.309> various<00:01:06.300> pictures

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
building an old car so various pictures

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.620 
building an old car so various pictures
&amp;<00:01:07.010> pinup<00:01:08.010> girls<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.490> things<00:01:08.730> but<00:01:09.300> this<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
&amp; pinup girls and things but this is the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.050 
&amp; pinup girls and things but this is the
phone<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:09.870> position<00:01:10.440> one<00:01:11.340> thing<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.610> need<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.820> do

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
phone in position one thing I need to do

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.220 
phone in position one thing I need to do
is<00:01:12.420> is<00:01:13.910> basically<00:01:14.910> put<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> electronics<00:01:16.020> into

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
is is basically put the electronics into

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.770 
is is basically put the electronics into
some<00:01:16.410> sort<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.650> small<00:01:16.920> junction<00:01:17.610> box<00:01:17.820> I

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
some sort of small junction box I

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.450 
some sort of small junction box I
couldn't<00:01:19.260> fit<00:01:19.440> them<00:01:19.470> into<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.920> phone<00:01:20.190> there's

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
couldn't fit them into the phone there's

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.820 
couldn't fit them into the phone there's
not<00:01:20.550> enough<00:01:20.610> space<00:01:20.880> inside<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.690> phone<00:01:21.930> so

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
not enough space inside the phone so

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.500 
not enough space inside the phone so
what<00:01:23.160> I'll<00:01:23.280> do<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.490> I'll<00:01:23.700> get<00:01:24.090> some<00:01:24.270> sort<00:01:24.450> of

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
what I'll do is I'll get some sort of

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.780 
what I'll do is I'll get some sort of
bakelite<00:01:25.380> junction<00:01:26.100> box<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.520> mount<00:01:26.670> that

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
bakelite junction box and mount that

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.820 
bakelite junction box and mount that
under<00:01:27.120> here<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.930> then<00:01:28.410> I<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.620> put<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
under here and then I can put the

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.770 
under here and then I can put the
electronics<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:29.940> batteries<00:01:30.360> into<00:01:30.540> that

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
electronics and the batteries into that

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.730 
electronics and the batteries into that
but<00:01:31.770> basically<00:01:31.920> all<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.120> is<00:01:33.240> come<00:01:33.390> along

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
but basically all you do is come along

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.880 
but basically all you do is come along
lift<00:01:34.740> up<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.010> receiver<00:01:36.500> it<00:01:37.500> might<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.860> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
lift up the receiver it might be a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.440 
lift up the receiver it might be a
little<00:01:38.040> bit<00:01:38.220> quiet<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.850> here<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.180> we<00:01:39.270> should

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
little bit quiet in here but we should

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:54.980 
little bit quiet in here but we should
be<00:01:39.540> able<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.720> hear<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.870> plane

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.240 

now<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.619> get<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.070> skip<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.909> next<00:01:56.939> track

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
now to get it to skip to the next track

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:32.940 
now to get it to skip to the next track
you<00:01:59.250> basically<00:01:59.579> hit<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.880> button

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.979 

and<00:02:33.400> then<00:02:33.640> when<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:33.910> gets<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:34.690> point<00:02:34.870> where

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
and then when it gets to the point where

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:46.559 
and then when it gets to the point where
it<00:02:35.200> slows<00:02:35.500> down<00:02:44.640> if<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.819> crank<00:02:46.060> speeds<00:02:46.450> it

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
it slows down if you crank speeds it

00:02:46.569 --> 00:03:03.590 
it slows down if you crank speeds it
back<00:02:46.720> up<00:02:46.840> again

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.510 

now<00:03:04.170> I<00:03:04.200> didn't<00:03:04.500> include<00:03:04.770> any<00:03:05.070> sort<00:03:05.460> of

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
now I didn't include any sort of

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.990 
now I didn't include any sort of
debounce<00:03:06.030> on<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:07.130> detection<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.550> off<00:03:08.820> the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
debounce on the detection of the off the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.950 
debounce on the detection of the off the
hook<00:03:09.150> flash<00:03:09.420> so<00:03:10.850> it<00:03:11.850> doesn't<00:03:12.270> necessarily<00:03:12.840> go

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
hook flash so it doesn't necessarily go

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.690 
hook flash so it doesn't necessarily go
to<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.200> next<00:03:13.350> track<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.860> may<00:03:14.010> jump<00:03:14.370> two<00:03:14.580> or

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
to the next track it may jump two or

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.790 
to the next track it may jump two or
three<00:03:14.880> tracks<00:03:15.180> because<00:03:15.420> of<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.810> bouncing<00:03:16.680> off

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
three tracks because of the bouncing off

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.070 
three tracks because of the bouncing off
the<00:03:17.190> switch<00:03:17.550> and<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.790> interrupt<00:03:18.210> but<00:03:18.960> I

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
the switch and the interrupt but I

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.560 
the switch and the interrupt but I
didn't<00:03:19.260> really<00:03:19.350> worry<00:03:19.620> about<00:03:19.740> that<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.570> it's

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
didn't really worry about that is it's

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.210 
didn't really worry about that is it's
not<00:03:21.720> really<00:03:22.050> a<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.530> go<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.710> the<00:03:22.860> next<00:03:23.010> track

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
not really a to go to the next track

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.610 
not really a to go to the next track
it's<00:03:23.430> just<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.670> change<00:03:23.940> traps<00:03:24.270> so<00:03:24.630> that<00:03:25.470> should

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
it's just a change traps so that should

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:55.940 
it's just a change traps so that should
work<00:03:25.650> fairly<00:03:26.070> well

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.990 

and<00:03:56.520> that's<00:03:56.640> about<00:03:56.790> it<00:03:58.520> one<00:03:59.520> interesting

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
and that's about it one interesting

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.089 
and that's about it one interesting
little<00:04:00.150> side<00:04:00.420> effect<00:04:00.750> is<00:04:00.930> when<00:04:01.739> you<00:04:01.830> hang<00:04:02.010> up

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
little side effect is when you hang up

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.500 
little side effect is when you hang up
the<00:04:02.220> phone<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:02.640> will<00:04:02.730> actually<00:04:02.849> keep<00:04:03.180> playing

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
the phone it will actually keep playing

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.530 
the phone it will actually keep playing
for<00:04:04.220> another<00:04:05.220> 10<00:04:05.640> or<00:04:05.670> 20<00:04:06.030> seconds<00:04:06.420> on<00:04:06.480> the

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
for another 10 or 20 seconds on the

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.410 
for another 10 or 20 seconds on the
power<00:04:06.810> in<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.050> capacitor<00:04:07.500> so<00:04:08.180> but<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.269> does

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
power in the capacitor so but it does

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.050 
power in the capacitor so but it does
turn<00:04:09.569> off<00:04:09.720> eventually
