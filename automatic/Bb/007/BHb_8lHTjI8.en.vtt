00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
did enjoy this card particularly a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.980 
did enjoy this card particularly a
left-wing<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.250> think<00:01:29.640> like<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:29.939> said<00:01:30.390> with<00:01:30.540> messy

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
left-wing I think like I said with messy

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.140 
left-wing I think like I said with messy
with<00:01:31.350> his<00:01:31.590> right-wing<00:01:31.890> version<00:01:32.700> they're

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
with his right-wing version they're

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.510 
with his right-wing version they're
better<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.290> wings<00:01:34.500> because<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.130> provides

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
better on the wings because it provides

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.580 
better on the wings because it provides
so<00:01:35.790> much<00:01:35.970> more<00:01:36.210> space<00:01:36.509> flip<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.079> easier<00:01:37.500> to

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
so much more space flip it's easier to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.380 
so much more space flip it's easier to
coincide<00:01:38.159> he's<00:01:38.579> got<00:01:38.790> some<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.180> best

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
coincide he's got some of the best

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.020 
coincide he's got some of the best
dribbling<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.439> used<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.549> Tim<00:01:41.820> Minear

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030

dribbling I have used it is Tim Minear
version<00:01:42.840> just<00:01:43.020> feels<00:01:43.350> like<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.770> exact<00:01:44.159> same

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430

all the glory with his team in the air
version<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:49.049> feels<00:01:49.259> very<00:01:49.560> very<00:01:49.799> similar

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009

the<00:01:50.490> only<00:01:50.850> negatives<00:01:51.329> are<00:01:51.509> as<00:01:51.689> weak<00:01:51.899> for<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.470> a

the<00:01:55.590> box<00:01:55.829> is<00:01:56.100> sometimes<00:01:56.790> a<00:01:56.939> little<00:01:57.090> bit<00:01:57.299> too

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
the box is sometimes a little bit too

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.710 
the box is sometimes a little bit too
so<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.550> key<00:01:58.700> perceives<00:01:59.090> it<00:01:59.330> a<00:01:59.420> lot<00:01:59.600> of<00:01:59.660> the

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
so the key perceives it a lot of the

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.780 
so the key perceives it a lot of the
time<00:01:59.900> which<00:02:00.050> is<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.230> bit<00:02:00.470> annoying<00:02:00.590> but<00:02:00.890> a<00:02:01.340> lot

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
strikeout had in this team so the power

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.220 
strikeout had in this team so the power
as<00:02:09.500> well<00:02:09.560> of<00:02:10.130> the<00:02:10.369> short<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:10.970> week<00:02:11.230> he's

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
as well of the short and the week he's

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.140 
as well of the short and the week he's
got<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:12.710> much<00:02:12.830> strength<00:02:13.130> I<00:02:13.430> don't<00:02:13.730> understand

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
got so much strength I don't understand

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.880 
got so much strength I don't understand
a<00:02:14.360> literally<00:02:14.810> coupled<00:02:15.380> with<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.560> dribbling

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
a literally coupled with the dribbling

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.580 
a literally coupled with the dribbling
it<00:02:16.070> just<00:02:16.280> makes<00:02:16.550> brain<00:02:17.120> seen<00:02:17.480> runs<00:02:18.140> where<00:02:18.500> you

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
it just makes brain seen runs where you

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.560 
it just makes brain seen runs where you
can<00:02:18.740> just<00:02:18.770> literally<00:02:19.430> power<00:02:19.790> in<00:02:20.120> from<00:02:20.480> the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
can just literally power in from the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.360 
can just literally power in from the
halfway<00:02:20.750> line<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.410> have<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:21.830> shot<00:02:22.160> girl

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
halfway line and have a shot girl

halfway line and have a shot girl
hopefully<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:22.940> goes<00:02:23.060> in<00:02:23.300> he's<00:02:23.720> tall<00:02:24.050> so<00:02:24.620> he's

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
hopefully it goes in he's tall so he's

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.800 
hopefully it goes in he's tall so he's
got<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:24.980> good<00:02:25.400> heading<00:02:25.820> is<00:02:25.970> agility<00:02:26.360> is<00:02:26.540> good

that left wing it opens up so much

that left wing it opens up so much
possibilities<00:02:36.260> his<00:02:36.440> positioning<00:02:37.040> is<00:02:37.190> on

possibilities his positioning is on
point<00:02:38.030> I<00:02:38.450> wouldn't<00:02:38.990> recommend<00:02:39.410> using<00:02:39.830> him<00:02:40.040> as

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
point I wouldn't recommend using him as

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.070 
point I wouldn't recommend using him as
a<00:02:40.160> left<00:02:40.430> need<00:02:40.610> because<00:02:40.790> it'd<00:02:41.030> probably<00:02:41.210> be<00:02:41.330> out

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
a left need because it'd probably be out

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.140 
a left need because it'd probably be out
of<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.260> game<00:02:42.410> but<00:02:42.680> in<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:42.890> 433<00:02:43.520> brackets<00:02:43.940> for

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
which is what I used Amon is very very

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.710 
which is what I used Amon is very very
deadly<00:02:46.460> and<00:02:46.880> that's<00:02:47.180> what<00:02:47.390> I<00:02:47.420> would<00:02:47.570> recommend

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
deadly and that's what I would recommend

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.380 
deadly and that's what I would recommend
him<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.560> 90<00:02:48.920> attend<00:02:49.340> recommendation<00:02:50.120> as<00:02:50.240> I

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
sometimes is sharp accuracy is a bit too

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.720 
sometimes is sharp accuracy is a bit too
close<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.770> the<00:02:54.830> goalkeeper<00:02:55.310> but<00:02:55.490> anyway

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
close to the goalkeeper but anyway

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.430 
close to the goalkeeper but anyway
