manager here of swinging controls I'm
guessing<00:00:04.859> if<00:00:04.920> you're<00:00:05.069> watching<00:00:05.220> this<00:00:05.460> video

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
guessing if you're watching this video

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.670 
guessing if you're watching this video
you've<00:00:06.480> received<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:06.930> panel<00:00:07.230> from<00:00:07.379> us<00:00:07.470> recently

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
you've received a panel from us recently

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.770 
you've received a panel from us recently
and<00:00:07.950> just<00:00:08.220> open<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:08.670> up<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:08.970> find<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.300> drawings

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
and just open it up to find the drawings

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.570 
and just open it up to find the drawings
and<00:00:09.990> thought<00:00:10.440> what<00:00:11.010> have<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.250> gotten<00:00:11.490> myself

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
and thought what have I gotten myself

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.180 
and thought what have I gotten myself
into

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
into

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.099 
into
okay<00:00:14.190> they<00:00:14.940> can<00:00:15.120> look<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.330> little<00:00:15.360> extreme<00:00:15.990> at

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
okay they can look a little extreme at

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.290 
okay they can look a little extreme at
first<00:00:16.440> but<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.160> quick<00:00:17.400> video<00:00:17.580> will<00:00:17.789> get<00:00:18.180> you

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
first but this quick video will get you

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.790 
first but this quick video will get you
started<00:00:18.359> on<00:00:18.779> how<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.050> make<00:00:19.289> sense<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.650> them

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
started on how to make sense of them

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.609 
started on how to make sense of them
with<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> few<00:00:20.939> little<00:00:21.240> hints<00:00:21.720> you'll<00:00:22.170> be<00:00:22.350> ready

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
with a few little hints you'll be ready

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.609 
with a few little hints you'll be ready
to<00:00:22.680> wire<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.100> up<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.340> no<00:00:23.490> time<00:00:24.350> let's<00:00:25.350> start

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
to wire it up in no time let's start

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.660 
to wire it up in no time let's start
with<00:00:25.769> how<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.920> drawings<00:00:26.340> are<00:00:26.430> put<00:00:26.580> together

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
with how the drawings are put together

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.120 
with how the drawings are put together
the<00:00:27.539> bulk<00:00:27.779> of<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.990> pages<00:00:28.230> at<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.590> front<00:00:28.859> show

the bulk of the pages at the front show

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.919 
the bulk of the pages at the front show
you<00:00:29.189> every<00:00:29.640> piece<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.880> equipment<00:00:30.090> wire

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
you every piece of equipment wire

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the panel these are the control

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.729 
the panel these are the control
schematics<00:00:36.079> you'll<00:00:37.079> notice<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.559> left

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
schematics you'll notice on the left

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.990 
schematics you'll notice on the left
side<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.070> each<00:00:38.160> column<00:00:38.550> there<00:00:38.700> are<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> series

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
side of each column there are a series

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.150 
side of each column there are a series
of<00:00:39.180> numbers

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
of numbers

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.770

these<00:00:41.160> are<00:00:41.430> navigation<00:00:42.059> guides<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.510> when<00:00:42.660> you

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
these are navigation guides so when you

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.959 
these are navigation guides so when you
see<00:00:42.960> an<00:00:43.079> arrow<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.920> indicates<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.550> connection

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
see an arrow this indicates a connection

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.670 
see an arrow this indicates a connection
to<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.120> different<00:00:45.539> page

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
to a different page

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.830 
to a different page
or<00:00:46.740> relay<00:00:47.730> block<00:00:47.970> showing<00:00:48.390> where<00:00:48.600> other

contacts<00:00:49.380> tie<00:00:49.650> into<00:00:49.830> the<00:00:49.950> system<00:00:50.310> when<00:00:51.000> you

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
contacts tie into the system when you

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.060 
contacts tie into the system when you
see<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.600> you'll<00:00:52.200> know<00:00:52.350> what<00:00:52.590> sheet<00:00:52.830> to<00:00:52.980> go

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
see this you'll know what sheet to go

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.140 
see this you'll know what sheet to go
look<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.510> so<00:00:54.510> for<00:00:54.720> example<00:00:55.110> here<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:56.150> 703

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
look on so for example here we have 703

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.330 
look on so for example here we have 703
so<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.900> means<00:00:58.110> we<00:00:58.260> should<00:00:58.290> go<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.590> sheet<00:00:58.830> 7

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
so this means we should go to sheet 7

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.430 
so this means we should go to sheet 7
and<00:00:59.570> then<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:00.600> find<00:01:00.930> line<00:01:01.110> 703<00:01:03.110> you'll<00:01:04.110> also

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
and then we find line 703 you'll also

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.219 
and then we find line 703 you'll also
occasionally<00:01:04.920> see<00:01:05.190> dashed<00:01:05.820> boxes<00:01:06.540> with<00:01:06.960> notes

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
occasionally see dashed boxes with notes

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.710 
occasionally see dashed boxes with notes
next<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.710> them<00:01:08.150> typically<00:01:09.150> these<00:01:09.270> are<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.510> piece

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
next to them typically these are a piece

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.420 
next to them typically these are a piece
of<00:01:09.869> equipment<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.350> need<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:10.890> connected
