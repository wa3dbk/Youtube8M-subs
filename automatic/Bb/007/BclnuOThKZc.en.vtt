00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:17.240
We meet graffiti everyday on various places: on blocks, walls, subways and public toilets

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.740
There are a lot of different styles and types of graffiti in the street art

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.620
The so called post-graffiti officially are considered as urban visual art

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.600
The new name is used to separate the new urban art from the vandalism

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.340
Graffiti art as a part of the hip hop culture may have political, social or moral messages

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.780
The advertisement industry starts to use them later

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.200
The valuable in the street art is in its originality, expressivity and accessibility

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.480
Some graffiti artist gain a wide popularity with their street works

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.700
which are not only demonstration of talent but also deep messages

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.520
The Graffiti already found their place in Sofia (BG) through ON!Fest, Sprite Graffiti Fest,  Urban Creatures

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.320
and commercial campaigns as X-Factor and DZP Danone

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.960
My name is Ivo (Yeto / 140 Ideas) and I draw

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:39.180
In 2004 - 2005 there was a big boom of graffiti and street art in Sofia

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.700
Rikardo (Rays): There are a lot of people doing this (graffiti) and the scene is growing up...

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:58.500
Yeto (140 Ideas) and exactly in this moment little by little there start to pop up a lot of canvas, posters and all kind of things different than just simple letters

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:08.420
At the moment there is some accumulation - a lot of the old things are disappeared, there are also few people doing street art and there is some level (of skill)

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.780
The tags showed up when the gangsters were separating their territory in the States

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.720
It s very hard to explain to somebody who does not do graffiti why somebody goes somewhere and write his name there

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.040
I do it for my self, not so much for the culture but for me

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.880
The things we see everyday, the colors and everything around us. Why we cannot change it? We have to create by ourself for ourself

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:06.080
I cannot say that all pieces (works) have the same message. I am trying to think on different topics and also all of the works to corresponding with the place where is done

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:16.880
The things always have different meaning and  every work should provoke the people to think

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.960
does not matter if it will be propaganda or something just colorful

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.660
Graffiti is maybe the most self-contradictory art

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:42.040
There are lame and deep pieces (which goes also to museums and galleries)

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:51.620
The Bombs are illegal graffiti done in a dangerous place for a quick time with high dosage of risk

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:05.380
The people with who I work in Bulgaria are Germain, Flag, Teleto (140 Ideas)

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:14.980
A big respect to XPOME, MORE, VA C

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:35.560
LBC Crew, USA Crew... All who work recently are pretty good

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.240
I am a big fan of Dan Weeds
