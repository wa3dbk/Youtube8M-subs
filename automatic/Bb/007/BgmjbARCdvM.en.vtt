00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
instead of as a unit

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.770 
instead of as a unit

so speaking of segmental we're gonna
come<00:01:25.080> over<00:01:25.320> here<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.830> Anna<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:27.380> we're<00:01:28.380> gonna

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.490 
she's gonna only move at the lower
vertebrae<00:01:51.090> yep<00:01:51.299> keep<00:01:51.509> going<00:01:51.570> keep<00:01:52.049> going<00:01:52.290> but

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
vertebrae yep keep going keep going but

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.469 
vertebrae yep keep going keep going but
not<00:01:52.680> moving<00:01:53.009> up<00:01:53.130> here<00:01:53.399> she's<00:01:53.880> really<00:01:54.329> gonna

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
not moving up here she's really gonna

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.270 
not moving up here she's really gonna
focus<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.409> know<00:01:55.470> she's<00:01:55.740> been<00:01:55.860> working<00:01:56.159> on

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
focus and I know she's been working on

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.399 
focus and I know she's been working on
this<00:01:56.490> she's<00:01:57.149> really<00:01:57.509> gonna<00:01:57.630> focus<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:58.140> just

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
this she's really gonna focus on just

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.340 
this she's really gonna focus on just
the<00:01:58.649> lower<00:01:58.829> vertebrae<00:01:59.520> until<00:01:59.729> eventually<00:02:00.350> she

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
the lower vertebrae until eventually she

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.380 
the lower vertebrae until eventually she
can<00:02:01.500> start<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.920> work<00:02:02.100> her<00:02:02.310> way<00:02:02.340> up<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.270> that

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
can start to work her way up so that

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.969 
can start to work her way up so that
there's<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.630> connection<00:02:04.229> between<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.770> lower

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
there's a connection between the lower

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.990 
there's a connection between the lower
and<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.369> upper<00:02:05.579> spine<00:02:06.920> nice<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.759> can<00:02:08.940> see

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
and the upper spine nice and you can see

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.960 
and the upper spine nice and you can see
she<00:02:09.420> wants<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.989> move<00:02:10.140> more<00:02:10.440> here<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.940> a

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
she wants to move more here this is a

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.190 
she wants to move more here this is a
little<00:02:12.270> bit<00:02:12.450> more<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.989> blind<00:02:13.319> spot<00:02:13.470> for

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
little bit more of a blind spot for

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.590 
little bit more of a blind spot for
so<00:02:14.770> now<00:02:14.920> we'll<00:02:15.040> do<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.220> opposite<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.970> go<00:02:16.150> into

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
so now we'll do the opposite to go into

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.210 
so now we'll do the opposite to go into
the<00:02:16.720> cow<00:02:17.560> pose

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
the cow pose

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.590 
the cow pose
you're<00:02:18.550> gonna<00:02:18.640> start<00:02:18.910> from<00:02:19.060> here<00:02:19.240> don't<00:02:19.480> move

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
you're gonna start from here don't move

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.180 
you're gonna start from here don't move
this<00:02:19.810> at<00:02:19.960> all<00:02:20.110> don't<00:02:20.470> move<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.740> lower<00:02:20.920> back

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
this at all don't move the lower back

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.820 
this at all don't move the lower back
and<00:02:21.460> start<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.570> move<00:02:22.720> your<00:02:22.900> upper<00:02:22.930> back<00:02:23.380> just

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
and start to move your upper back just

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.610 
and start to move your upper back just
moving<00:02:24.100> forward<00:02:24.310> good<00:02:24.790> good<00:02:25.390> she's<00:02:26.290> working

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
moving forward good good she's working

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.730 
moving forward good good she's working
really<00:02:26.830> hard<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.730> eventually<00:02:28.650> she'll<00:02:29.650> be

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
really hard and eventually she'll be

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.100 
really hard and eventually she'll be
able<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.160> do<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.400> whole<00:02:30.550> pose<00:02:30.840> let's<00:02:31.840> see<00:02:31.990> how

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
able to do the whole pose let's see how

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.780 
able to do the whole pose let's see how
Christine's<00:02:32.530> doing<00:02:32.890> with<00:02:33.070> that<00:02:33.280> I'm<00:02:33.640> gonna

rest so if you've been going to yoga
classes<00:03:19.390> and<00:03:19.810> you're<00:03:19.900> used<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:20.200> cat<00:03:20.470> cow<00:03:20.740> I

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
classes and you're used to cat cow I

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.300 
classes and you're used to cat cow I
really<00:03:22.600> encourage<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:23.200> to<00:03:23.230> explore<00:03:23.950> these

really encourage you to explore these
more<00:03:25.030> complex<00:03:26.400> variations<00:03:27.400> that's<00:03:27.880> a<00:03:28.000> little

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
more complex variations that's a little

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.570 
more complex variations that's a little
bit<00:03:28.240> more<00:03:28.330> advanced<00:03:28.690> concepts<00:03:29.380> you'll<00:03:30.310> find

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
bit more advanced concepts you'll find

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.430 
bit more advanced concepts you'll find
that<00:03:30.730> most<00:03:30.910> people<00:03:31.060> move<00:03:31.510> one<00:03:32.020> part<00:03:32.290> of<00:03:32.350> their

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
that most people move one part of their

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.560 
that most people move one part of their
spine<00:03:32.740> in<00:03:33.010> relation<00:03:33.580> to<00:03:33.610> another<00:03:34.180> part<00:03:34.510> of

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
spine in relation to another part of

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.170 
spine in relation to another part of
their<00:03:34.720> spine<00:03:34.990> rather<00:03:35.890> than<00:03:36.190> being<00:03:36.850> able<00:03:37.030> to

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
their spine rather than being able to

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.810 
their spine rather than being able to
control<00:03:37.750> movement<00:03:38.590> at<00:03:39.100> all<00:03:39.280> twenty-four

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
control movement at all twenty-four

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.480 
control movement at all twenty-four
segments<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:41.500> go<00:03:41.710> ahead<00:03:41.800> and<00:03:41.980> come<00:03:42.100> on<00:03:42.190> up<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.460> a

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
segments so go ahead and come on up to a

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:48.450 
segments so go ahead and come on up to a
