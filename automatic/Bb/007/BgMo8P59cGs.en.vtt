take<00:00:41.160> this<00:00:42.160> is<00:00:42.309> what<00:00:42.429> we<00:00:42.519> make<00:00:42.699> but<00:00:42.969> this<00:00:43.149> thing

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359 
take this is what we make but this thing

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:45.779 
take this is what we make but this thing
is<00:00:43.480> nothing<00:00:43.960> to<00:00:44.199> toss<00:00:44.379> around<00:00:44.559> on<00:00:45.460> this<00:00:45.730> one

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
is nothing to toss around on this one

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:48.000 
is nothing to toss around on this one
even<00:00:46.420> with<00:00:46.719> a<00:00:46.750> crack<00:00:47.019> in<00:00:47.199> it<00:00:47.289> and<00:00:47.469> I<00:00:47.679> didn't

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
even with a crack in it and I didn't

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.310 
even with a crack in it and I didn't
Viva<00:00:48.370> it's<00:00:48.760> about<00:00:49.089> twice<00:00:49.449> the<00:00:49.690> way<00:00:49.809> we<00:00:50.109> make

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
Viva it's about twice the way we make

Viva it's about twice the way we make
them<00:00:50.440> by<00:00:50.559> injection<00:00:50.859> molding<00:00:51.309> we<00:00:52.179> start<00:00:52.510> with

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:52.749 
them by injection molding we start with

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:56.459 
them by injection molding we start with
this<00:00:52.929> which<00:00:53.710> is<00:00:54.539> pellets<00:00:55.539> of<00:00:55.629> magnesium<00:00:56.109> so

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
this which is pellets of magnesium so

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.439 
this which is pellets of magnesium so
kind<00:00:57.249> of<00:00:57.280> like<00:00:57.370> a<00:00:57.429> salt<00:00:57.760> shaker<00:00:57.820> you<00:00:58.210> can<00:00:58.329> take

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
kind of like a salt shaker you can take

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.360 
kind of like a salt shaker you can take
it<00:00:58.570> out<00:00:58.719> and<00:00:58.929> this<00:00:59.620> stuff<00:00:59.890> is<00:01:00.100> fully

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
it out and this stuff is fully

what I do when I basically I tell them
you<00:02:25.710> know<00:02:25.830> I<00:02:25.860> run<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.190> machines<00:02:26.490> but<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.760> large

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
you know I run the machines but a large

got<00:02:29.550> those<00:02:30.030> lines<00:02:30.360> into<00:02:30.840> my<00:02:30.930> numbers<00:02:31.350> of

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
got those lines into my numbers of

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.930 
got those lines into my numbers of
machine<00:02:31.740> understands<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.520> it's<00:02:32.610> all<00:02:32.760> based

here this is a fixture that we had made
in<00:02:53.250> order<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.300> make<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.590> rear<00:02:55.770> set<00:02:56.010> bodies

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
in order to make the the rear set bodies

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.540 
in order to make the the rear set bodies
we<00:02:57.030> we<00:02:57.420> cut<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.780> we<00:02:58.650> caught<00:02:58.800> one<00:02:58.950> side<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.280> it

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
we we cut it we caught one side of it

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.550 
we we cut it we caught one side of it
flip<00:02:59.850> it<00:02:59.940> over<00:03:00.060> mount<00:03:00.990> it<00:03:01.110> on<00:03:01.200> these<00:03:01.350> two
