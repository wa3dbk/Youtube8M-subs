00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.819
 cooperative passing of various 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.469
 missions missions total 4 safari arena 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.780
 convoy and boss murder 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:59.459
 Safari you are transport which 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.649
 moves to the helicopter from all sides 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:03.719
 how cockroaches climb a different scoundrel 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.119
 the arena from the name is clear that we are nowhere 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.899
 We do not move but the villains are fine labor 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.929
 from all cracks 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.370
 desperately trying to overwhelm us with a convoy 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.620
 give the technique which is controlled 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.480
 computer and we stupidly accompany 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.620
 given point and of course along the way 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.870
 we shoot a scoundrel 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.090
 probably the most revered and popular 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.410
 mode is killing the boss here the goal 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.660
 mission is kill armored 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.580
 learn to lively technology also all 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.680
 Pavia card is divided into two stages 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.450
 At the end of the first stage, we cut off the pitiful 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.640
 the existence of a mini boss a called 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.460
 juggernaut and at the second stage we turn 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.680
 directly carry out the mission itself 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.990
 you and mode have three levels of difficulty 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.370
 easy and challenging at the easy level 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.140
 you will not be easy 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.150
 quickly shoot everything that moves 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.220
 not paying attention to colleagues in the squad 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.150
 but the remaining 2 difficulties are complete 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.100
 chaos there to survive and win can only 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.810
 if there is an atmosphere of friendship in the detachment and 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.060
 Understanding that in our time 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.950
 is a rarity not enemies 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.140
 just shoot well but still use 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.180
 diverse tactics besides the usual 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.100
 meat in the form of swarming enemies not afraid 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.780
 give your life there so say 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.790
 specialists alone can hide 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.370
 shields enter the pass to the ground and mercilessly 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.540
 nightmare kill others sit at the table and 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.239
 partners 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.349
 3 mark sits sniper rifles 4 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.569
 shelling from rpk 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.730
 what's more, some assholes can 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.329
 try to disorient you by sending 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.340
 eyes into the laser pointer back in 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.079
 Warface is such an entertaining change. 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.110
 when you need help 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:33.390
 help them with a friend to lift 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.650
 or climb high obstacles behind 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.970
 it is by the way give experience 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.880
 so do not neglect this 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.370
 gvp mode features available to you 4 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.560
 class fighters stormtrooper storming sniper 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.360
 sleep before the engineers generic medic he 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.220
 and in africa copper all these classes have 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.320
 fundamental difference in connection with their 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.930
 unique abilities tell 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.250
 a little bit more physician can 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.050
 perform health and return 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.240
 healthy life hopelessly 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.130
 sick but unfortunately playing for 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.290
 the medic will be very hard in the process 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.090
 shootings for this fellow is not equipped 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.550
 long-range weapon can reward 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.620
 only close range attack aircraft 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.160
 unique class that shit all and 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.320
 everywhere 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.209
 excellent beats like a short distance 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.160
 so on darren also this class can 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.709
 perform ammunition and stupid to expect that 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.989
 This uncle run out of ammunition 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.419
 sniper comrades beats very aptly hurt 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.680
 and far and still competent sniper can 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.390
 notice the enemy and complain 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.890
 stormtroopers who turn 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.500
 will quickly come and do that 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.690
 right shit 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.880
 well and the last engineer these guys are not 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.560
 can lead a long battle also lead 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.900
 that fight is only capable of near and 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.190
 average distances but engineer this 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.320
 the only class whose hands 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.169
 sharpened by the right place he 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.400
 only 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.379
 quickly clear mine or 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.060
 mine the ground that others have 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:48.430
 classes takes much longer 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.849
 also engineer can repair damaged 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.550
 armor 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:54.249
 2 graphics doom talk places and engine 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.499
 cryengine 3 gives a stunning picture 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:58.990
 fragments of grenades are flying everywhere and 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:05:00.610
 standing beside explodes different 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.710

 saturate the game with a unique atmosphere and 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.639
 combat operations 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.680
 Warface there is a small reference to the rpg 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:10.749

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:36.849
 such a system of opening objects 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:38.740
 by chance but there is a good chance that he 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:46.270
