 let's do is go to the next 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.840
 link that I will leave in the description 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.850
 of the video as you already know what 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.740
 they have to do was electrical link and 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.530
 automatically it will be opening the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.950
 download page this page is from 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.200
 fear 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.899
 and here what we are going to do is wait for 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.310
 the countdown ends 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.880
 regressive and we are going to download what is 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.490
 the ok file does not weigh much then a 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.979
 once the download is finished it leaves us 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.470
 a rar file then what are we going to 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.530
 do is extract it right click from 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.340
 mouse extract here we wait for it to be 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.280
 extract this will not take long 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.019
 we were a few seconds and here is what 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.260
 that we will find is a folder with the 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.420
 activator ok good friends I'm going to 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.480
 make a recommendation before 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.250
 install the activator that they install 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.519
 All the updates you ask 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.480
 your computer will you start panel 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:30.360
 control systems and security windows 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.340
 update and here they install all the 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.680
 updates as they see me and the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.989
 installed because we are going to install them 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.760
 because once installed what is the 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.489
 crack we will not be able to install 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.980
 updates because if we get to 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.290
 install system updates 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.640
 Operating it will not detect as copy 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.940
 of windows not original 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.709
 and obviously we do not want ok then 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.850
 Once installed all our 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.850
 updates we will open our crack 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.650
 this paraguay well we are windows 7 like this 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.980
 that we will all execute as 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.790
 administrator right click of the mouse 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.790
 execute as an administrator 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.370
 we closed the back window and 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.770
 then we will come out what is the 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.470
 crack here the only thing we're going to do is 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.569
 give in automatically install the 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.480
 program will record all the data 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.160
 the truth is going to give us a series going to 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.230
 register the brand of our 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.680
 computer then the only thing that 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:34.069
 we have to do is give install 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.709
 doing this we give ok and we wait for 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.769
 the computer as the crack ends 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.290
 activation this will restart and 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.390
 we will go back in a second ok where I 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.610
 I will leave the process to see how it 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.170
 active not causing the video I'll leave it 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.489
 run ok 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.819
 we wait for them to finish the 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.819
 activation 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:05.500
 good friends has finished what is the 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.680
 cracker and activated to our is 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.240
 our operating system and horta what 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.730
 asks us is that we restart our 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.950
 computer this and then the 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.880
 I'm going to restart and come back in a second 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.880
 with you ok 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.020
 good friends, I have returned, I have reviewed my 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.700
 computer and now to show them 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.220
 that our operating system has 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.920
 registered correctly we can go from 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.680
 start in team we will select click 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.710
 right properties and we break down to 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.320
 what is the 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.630
 information from our computer here 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.910
 as we can see it says activation of 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.010
 windows windows is activated has us 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.720
 given a series and here we have the 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.570
 logo that our software is 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.460
 original what one friends then the 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.740
 crack the activation and all this is 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.080
 Sure they can use it as a means 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.590
 reliable and now below them 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.740
 I will give a tip what we are going to do is 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:06.650
 direct us to start control panel we 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.410
 let's go to security systems and 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.680
 here we will select activate or 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.590
 disable updates and this option 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.930
 we're going to go to not look 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.880
 updates that I have not recommended 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.110
 let's unmark these two boxes and 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.570
 let's give to accept 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.520
 Now what we are going to do is close 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.699
 this window 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.800
 and this has been all friends one another 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.930
 important recommendation is that later 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.879
 what it is to have utilities and the 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.940
 antivirus detect that it is not 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:40.740
 computer does not have updates 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.090
 then that must be deactivated 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.250
 for example the one for people who 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.180
 they have in the 32 what we are going to do is 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.440
 this 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.669
 open it we are going to give configurations 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.000
 advanced configuration we're going to 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:55.319
 tools system updates 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.680
 and here we will select without 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:06:01.349
 updates we will accept and ready 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.599
 now our if our antivirus does not go 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:05.099
 We will not ask for updates as 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:07.289
 same will do in the boot tunnel 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:08.699
 philippe thys since this program we 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:11.340
 ask for system updates 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:14.159
 operative ok good friends this has been 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.949
