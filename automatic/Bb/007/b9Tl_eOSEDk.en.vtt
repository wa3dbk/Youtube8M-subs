quickly you know forms to abbreviate the

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.340 
quickly you know forms to abbreviate the
image<00:01:50.039> the<00:01:51.039> great<00:01:51.490> thing<00:01:51.700> about<00:01:51.789> using<00:01:52.539> the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
image the great thing about using the

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.559 
image the great thing about using the
acetate<00:01:53.920> is<00:01:54.100> that<00:01:54.280> you<00:01:54.369> can<00:01:54.520> overlay<00:01:55.000> that<00:01:55.300> I

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
acetate is that you can overlay that I

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:57.510 
acetate is that you can overlay that I
read<00:01:55.929> online<00:01:56.080> that<00:01:56.350> you<00:01:56.649> use<00:01:56.920> your<00:01:57.100> paintings

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
read online that you use your paintings

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.219 
read online that you use your paintings
and<00:01:57.700> trans<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.240> that<00:01:58.420> create<00:01:58.780> parallel

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
and trans to that create parallel

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.469 
and trans to that create parallel
universes<00:01:59.890> I'm<00:02:00.369> interested<00:02:00.850> in<00:02:00.970> creating

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
universes I'm interested in creating

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.889 
universes I'm interested in creating
something<00:02:01.810> that<00:02:02.049> is<00:02:03.509> while<00:02:04.509> while

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
something that is while while

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.260 
something that is while while
recognizable<00:02:05.860> that<00:02:06.280> it<00:02:06.549> perhaps<00:02:06.759> doesn't

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
recognizable that it perhaps doesn't

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.060 
recognizable that it perhaps doesn't
relate<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:08.880> a<00:02:09.880> kind<00:02:10.690> of<00:02:10.720> realistic<00:02:11.350> experience

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
relate to a kind of realistic experience

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.370 
relate to a kind of realistic experience
perhaps<00:02:12.970> there<00:02:13.180> are<00:02:13.209> many<00:02:13.540> many<00:02:13.810> things<00:02:13.900> going

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
perhaps there are many many things going

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.199 
perhaps there are many many things going
on<00:02:14.590> outside<00:02:14.799> of<00:02:15.070> what<00:02:15.310> we<00:02:15.489> we<00:02:15.880> kind<00:02:16.150> of

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
on outside of what we we kind of

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.979 
on outside of what we we kind of
understand<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:18.120> if<00:02:19.120> this<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.600> all<00:02:19.750> there<00:02:19.930> is

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
understand and if this is all there is

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.220 
understand and if this is all there is
then<00:02:20.440> it's<00:02:20.680> it's<00:02:21.610> pretty<00:02:21.910> grim

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.100 

he<00:02:25.890> uses<00:02:26.040> a<00:02:26.190> projector<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.880> project<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.540> image

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
he uses a projector to project the image

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.900 
he uses a projector to project the image

really<00:02:38.790> quick<00:02:40.160> it's<00:02:41.160> like<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.580> know<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.730> might

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
really quick it's like you know I might

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.150 
really quick it's like you know I might
I<00:02:42.270> might<00:02:42.959> make<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.380> whole<00:02:43.590> group<00:02:43.830> of<00:02:44.010> these

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
I might make a whole group of these

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.260 
I might make a whole group of these
might<00:02:44.430> be<00:02:44.730> like<00:02:44.850> 10<00:02:45.120> 15<00:02:45.420> images<00:02:45.959> very<00:02:46.320> quickly

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
might be like 10 15 images very quickly

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.970 
might be like 10 15 images very quickly
without<00:02:48.270> thinking<00:02:48.810> about<00:02:48.930> them<00:02:49.140> too<00:02:49.380> much<00:02:49.590> I

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
without thinking about them too much I

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.979 
without thinking about them too much I
think<00:02:50.490> one<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.940> things<00:02:51.120> about<00:02:51.239> painting

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
think one of the things about painting

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.550 
think one of the things about painting
is<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.739> it<00:02:53.190> should<00:02:53.459> feel<00:02:54.140> exciting<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.410> you

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
is that it should feel exciting that you

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.670 
is that it should feel exciting that you
feel<00:02:55.800> like<00:02:56.069> it<00:02:56.880> should<00:02:57.090> feel<00:02:57.270> good<00:02:57.480> fun<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.989> lot

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
feel like it should feel good fun a lot

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.290 
feel like it should feel good fun a lot
of<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.860> time<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.310> images<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.940> I<00:02:59.970> work<00:03:00.270> with

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
of the time the images that I work with

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.800 
of the time the images that I work with
come<00:03:01.230> out<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.910> process<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:03.000> working<00:03:03.480> so

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
come out of the process of working so

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.330 
come out of the process of working so
when<00:03:03.989> I<00:03:04.050> start<00:03:04.410> out<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.650> don't<00:03:04.830> really<00:03:05.040> know

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
when I start out I don't really know

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.920 
when I start out I don't really know
which<00:03:05.489> direction<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:06.180> painting<00:03:06.600> is<00:03:06.690> going<00:03:06.870> to

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
which direction the painting is going to

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.070 
which direction the painting is going to
go<00:03:07.080> in<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:08.070> while<00:03:08.580> I'm<00:03:08.730> working<00:03:09.239> I<00:03:09.390> want<00:03:09.600> the

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
go in and I while I'm working I want the

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.270 
go in and I while I'm working I want the
the<00:03:10.709> painting<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.880> start<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.390> suggest<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:12.959> me

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
the painting to start to suggest to me

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.250 
the painting to start to suggest to me
ways<00:03:14.280> in<00:03:14.580> which<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:15.360> wants<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:15.989> be<00:03:16.080> finished<00:03:18.260> it

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
ways in which it wants to be finished it

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.710 
ways in which it wants to be finished it
it<00:03:19.380> starts<00:03:19.769> merging<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.580> different<00:03:21.450> pictures

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
it starts merging the different pictures

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.300 
it starts merging the different pictures
together<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.410> create<00:03:22.590> one<00:03:22.800> whole<00:03:22.920> picture

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
together to create one whole picture

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.720 
together to create one whole picture
right<00:03:23.850> now<00:03:24.030> it's<00:03:24.269> like<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.480> kind<00:03:25.019> of<00:03:25.080> tusk<00:03:25.730> and

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
right now it's like a kind of tusk and

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.660 
right now it's like a kind of tusk and
then<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.989> starts<00:03:28.320> kind<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.800> more<00:03:28.890> abstract

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
then it starts kind of more abstract

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.870 
then it starts kind of more abstract
I<00:03:29.900> see<00:03:30.900> making<00:03:31.170> workers<00:03:31.829> as<00:03:32.100> an<00:03:32.310> opportunity

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
I see making workers as an opportunity

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.120 
I see making workers as an opportunity
to<00:03:33.150> make<00:03:33.329> a<00:03:33.360> kind<00:03:33.720> of<00:03:33.780> special<00:03:34.200> place<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:34.860> if<00:03:35.010> I

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
to make a kind of special place and if I

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.699 
to make a kind of special place and if I
go<00:03:35.340> back<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:36.060> thinking<00:03:36.720> about<00:03:37.140> why<00:03:37.350> I<00:03:37.380> wanted

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
go back to thinking about why I wanted

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.680 
go back to thinking about why I wanted
to<00:03:37.769> make<00:03:38.010> artwork<00:03:38.370> in<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.790> first<00:03:39.030> place<00:03:39.360> that

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
to make artwork in the first place that

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.539 
to make artwork in the first place that
was<00:03:40.700> that<00:03:41.700> was<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:42.000> provide<00:03:42.360> a<00:03:42.980> space<00:03:43.980> where<00:03:44.519> I

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
was that was to provide a space where I

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.630 
was that was to provide a space where I
could<00:03:44.700> exist<00:03:45.239> and<00:03:45.510> think<00:03:45.750> about<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.170> world

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.210 

the<00:03:49.330> image<00:03:49.870> is<00:03:52.170> developing<00:03:53.170> almost<00:03:53.680> before<00:03:53.950> I

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
the image is developing almost before I

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.060 
the image is developing almost before I
can<00:03:54.520> understand<00:03:55.000> it<00:03:55.210> I<00:03:55.390> don't<00:03:55.570> want<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:56.070> impose

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
can understand it I don't want to impose

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.640 
can understand it I don't want to impose
my<00:03:57.370> kind<00:03:57.580> of<00:03:57.670> limited<00:03:58.120> imagination<00:03:58.390> on<00:03:59.050> things

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
my kind of limited imagination on things

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.100 
my kind of limited imagination on things
I<00:04:00.010> want<00:04:00.220> something<00:04:00.760> to<00:04:00.940> surprise<00:04:01.420> me<00:04:01.690> in<00:04:01.840> the

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
in the kind of making it doesn't have to

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.120 
in the kind of making it doesn't have to
be<00:04:07.330> special<00:04:07.750> paint<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:08.560> it<00:04:08.740> isn't

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
be special paint and it isn't

necessarily about about being skillful

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.890 
necessarily about about being skillful
it<00:04:12.610> can<00:04:12.790> be<00:04:12.910> about<00:04:13.180> just<00:04:15.359> just<00:04:16.359> having<00:04:16.750> in<00:04:16.870> a

Faneuil<00:04:28.780> takes<00:04:29.020> work<00:04:29.350> to<00:04:30.100> be<00:04:30.190> quite<00:04:30.400> abstract

Faneuil takes work to be quite abstract

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.390 
Faneuil takes work to be quite abstract
experimental<00:04:31.870> so<00:04:32.530> it<00:04:32.590> was<00:04:32.740> really<00:04:33.160> different

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
experimental so it was really different

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.640 
experimental so it was really different
from<00:04:33.610> what<00:04:33.700> previous<00:04:34.450> painters<00:04:34.840> will<00:04:35.350> me<00:04:35.500> do

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
from what previous painters will me do

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.000 
from what previous painters will me do

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
what color our scene new take influenced

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.760 
what color our scene new take influenced
me<00:04:39.190> by<00:04:39.370> not<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.150> take<00:04:40.330> painting<00:04:40.870> too<00:04:41.350> seriously

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
me by not to take painting too seriously

completely<00:05:19.919> it's<00:05:20.489> more<00:05:20.699> harder<00:05:21.089> because<00:05:21.839> just

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
completely it's more harder because just

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.290
