only<00:00:55.600> one<00:00:55.750> problem<00:00:56.280> check<00:00:57.280> it<00:00:57.400> out<00:00:59.100> it's<00:01:00.100> the

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
only one problem check it out it's the

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:04.460 
only one problem check it out it's the
slide<00:01:00.699> that's<00:01:00.939> the<00:01:01.650> volume<00:01:02.650> adjustment<00:01:03.640> there

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
slide that's the volume adjustment there

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.469 
slide that's the volume adjustment there
and<00:01:05.470> it's<00:01:06.430> just<00:01:06.610> not<00:01:06.760> making<00:01:06.939> any<00:01:07.270> difference

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
and it's just not making any difference

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.429 
and it's just not making any difference
so<00:01:08.020> I<00:01:08.049> don't<00:01:08.320> what<00:01:08.409> I<00:01:08.439> do<00:01:08.560> up<00:01:08.860> or<00:01:09.010> down<00:01:09.159> I<00:01:10.439> plug

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
so I don't what I do up or down I plug

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:12.300 
so I don't what I do up or down I plug
headphones<00:01:11.619> in

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
headphones in

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.859 
headphones in
I<00:01:12.340> can<00:01:12.640> still<00:01:12.909> hear<00:01:13.090> it<00:01:13.150> with<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.450> headphone

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
I can still hear it with the headphone

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.830 
I can still hear it with the headphone
jack<00:01:14.640> there's<00:01:15.640> no<00:01:15.759> volume<00:01:16.000> coming<00:01:16.509> out<00:01:16.600> of<00:01:16.750> the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
jack there's no volume coming out of the

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.719 
jack there's no volume coming out of the
speakers<00:01:17.229> which<00:01:17.439> which<00:01:17.860> is<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:18.100> shame<00:01:18.700> really

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
speakers which which is a shame really

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.690 
speakers which which is a shame really
because<00:01:19.410> actually<00:01:20.410> it<00:01:20.530> tends<00:01:21.190> to<00:01:21.310> be<00:01:21.460> quite

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
because actually it tends to be quite

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.000 
because actually it tends to be quite
loud<00:01:21.970> it's<00:01:22.330> got<00:01:22.510> good<00:01:22.720> clear<00:01:23.050> good<00:01:23.500> clear<00:01:23.830> and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
loud it's got good clear good clear and

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.440 
loud it's got good clear good clear and
loud<00:01:24.160> sound<00:01:24.720> typically<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:27.400> uh<00:01:27.430> let's<00:01:28.240> open

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
loud sound typically so uh let's open

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.399 
loud sound typically so uh let's open
her<00:01:28.720> up<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:29.020> see<00:01:29.110> what<00:01:29.470> the<00:01:29.650> hell's<00:01:29.830> going<00:01:30.100> on

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
her up and see what the hell's going on

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.990 
her up and see what the hell's going on
well<00:01:32.409> I<00:01:32.440> guess<00:01:32.770> realistically<00:01:33.520> I<00:01:33.550> could<00:01:33.700> have

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
well I guess realistically I could have

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.390 
well I guess realistically I could have
made<00:01:34.420> this<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:35.080> second<00:01:35.740> chapter<00:01:36.010> in<00:01:36.280> the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
made this a second chapter in the

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.070 
made this a second chapter in the
maximum<00:01:37.150> Rd<00:01:37.510> inside<00:01:38.080> series<00:01:39.210> because<00:01:40.210> as<00:01:40.900> you

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
maximum Rd inside series because as you

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.020 
maximum Rd inside series because as you
can<00:01:41.230> see<00:01:41.290> I've<00:01:41.950> removed<00:01:41.980> the<00:01:42.820> four<00:01:43.360> screws

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
can see I've removed the four screws

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.469 
can see I've removed the four screws
from<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.240> case<00:01:47.520> at<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.670> back<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.120> unit

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
from the case at the back of the unit

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.560 
from the case at the back of the unit
and<00:01:49.890> opened<00:01:50.890> her<00:01:51.010> up<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:54.300> yeah<00:01:55.300> it's<00:01:55.479> not

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
and opened her up but yeah it's not

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.780 
and opened her up but yeah it's not
really<00:01:55.930> about<00:01:56.020> that<00:01:56.350> it's<00:01:56.920> about<00:01:57.010> repairing

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
really about that it's about repairing

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.260 
really about that it's about repairing
the<00:01:58.000> problem<00:01:58.330> I'm<00:01:58.750> having<00:01:58.960> with<00:01:59.170> no<00:01:59.470> sound<00:02:00.270> I'm

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
the problem I'm having with no sound I'm

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.090 
the problem I'm having with no sound I'm
gonna<00:02:01.450> macro<00:02:02.440> in<00:02:02.620> a<00:02:02.770> little<00:02:03.010> closer

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.610 

you<00:02:07.100> can<00:02:07.340> see<00:02:07.640> right<00:02:07.880> here<00:02:07.940> ah

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.560 

I'd<00:02:12.620> say<00:02:13.010> that's<00:02:13.310> obviously<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.210> problem

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
I'd say that's obviously the problem

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.550 
I'd say that's obviously the problem
being<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.740> technical<00:02:16.130> wizard<00:02:16.460> that<00:02:16.790> I<00:02:16.850> am<00:02:17.560> the

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
being the technical wizard that I am the

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.280 
being the technical wizard that I am the
little<00:02:19.460> black<00:02:19.850> wire<00:02:21.010> right<00:02:22.010> here<00:02:22.870> right<00:02:23.870> yeah

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
little black wire right here right yeah

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:32.980 
little black wire right here right yeah
just<00:02:24.970> come<00:02:25.970> off<00:02:26.180> from<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:27.670> board<00:02:29.320> and<00:02:31.990> this

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
just come off from the board and this

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.260 
just come off from the board and this
red<00:02:33.380> and<00:02:33.410> black<00:02:33.710> wire<00:02:34.070> are<00:02:34.670> also<00:02:34.910> attached<00:02:37.270> to

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
red and black wire are also attached to

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.860 
red and black wire are also attached to
an<00:02:38.390> internal<00:02:38.780> speaker<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:41.030> there<00:02:41.300> is<00:02:41.630> your

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
an internal speaker so there is your

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.600 
an internal speaker so there is your
culprit

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
culprit

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.290 
culprit
simple<00:02:43.610> enough<00:02:45.040> well<00:02:46.040> let's<00:02:46.880> do<00:02:47.030> something

mod I've done up to this point is adding
a<00:03:11.570> mod<00:03:12.170> chip<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.680> my<00:03:12.800> Sega<00:03:13.100> Saturn<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.780> even

a mod chip to my Sega Saturn and even
that<00:03:16.390> if<00:03:17.390> well<00:03:17.989> it<00:03:18.260> works<00:03:18.530> that's<00:03:19.459> all<00:03:19.730> I'm

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
that if well it works that's all I'm

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.890 
that if well it works that's all I'm
saying<00:03:20.209> on<00:03:20.390> that<00:03:20.630> note<00:03:20.870> it<00:03:21.620> works<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.900> I'm

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
saying on that note it works and I'm

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.900 
saying on that note it works and I'm
quite<00:03:24.170> happy<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:24.680> pleased<00:03:24.950> with<00:03:25.190> myself<00:03:25.370> but

quite happy and pleased with myself but

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.410 
quite happy and pleased with myself but
that's<00:03:26.000> about<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.510> extent<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:28.760> limit<00:03:29.150> of

my modding abilities to this point we do

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.320 
my modding abilities to this point we do

heat soldering iron they've done the job
properly<00:05:15.650> it's<00:05:16.650> funny<00:05:16.919> eh

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
properly it's funny eh

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.390 
properly it's funny eh
when<00:05:17.639> this<00:05:17.759> actually<00:05:18.379> starts<00:05:19.379> making<00:05:19.770> contact

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
when this actually starts making contact

when this actually starts making contact
the<00:05:20.849> light<00:05:21.060> turns<00:05:21.419> red<00:05:22.129> on<00:05:23.129> it<00:05:23.310> when<00:05:23.669> it's

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
the light turns red on it when it's

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:30.980 
the light turns red on it when it's
actually<00:05:24.139> generating<00:05:25.139> heat<00:05:26.240> see<00:05:29.330> that's<00:05:30.330> type

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
actually generating heat see that's type

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.260 
actually generating heat see that's type
of<00:05:31.169> mater<00:05:31.650> I<00:05:31.889> am<00:05:32.159> I<00:05:32.340> can't<00:05:32.639> even<00:05:32.819> use<00:05:32.970> a<00:05:33.000> real

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
of mater I am I can't even use a real

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.710 
of mater I am I can't even use a real
soldering<00:05:33.990> iron<00:05:34.729> yeah<00:05:35.729> well<00:05:36.330> I<00:05:36.360> could

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
soldering iron yeah well I could

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.620 
soldering iron yeah well I could
probably<00:05:37.099> with<00:05:38.099> disastrous<00:05:38.819> results<00:05:39.419> but<00:05:39.599> I

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
probably with disastrous results but I

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.170 
probably with disastrous results but I
don't<00:05:39.870> actually<00:05:40.020> have<00:05:40.229> a<00:05:40.409> real<00:05:40.710> one<00:05:40.909> so<00:05:41.909> I<00:05:41.940> use

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
don't actually have a real one so I use

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.110 
don't actually have a real one so I use
this<00:05:42.389> cold<00:05:42.690> heat<00:05:42.930> model<00:05:43.909> remember<00:05:44.909> the

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
this cold heat model remember the

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.809 
this cold heat model remember the
advertisement<00:05:45.780> for<00:05:45.840> that<00:05:46.110> years<00:05:46.470> back<00:05:46.819> the

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:47.819 
advertisement for that years back the

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:50.330 
advertisement for that years back the
solder<00:05:48.090> a<00:05:48.210> are<00:05:48.630> in<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:49.259> soldering<00:05:49.710> iron<00:05:49.979> that

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
solder a are in the soldering iron that

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.990 
solder a are in the soldering iron that
won't<00:05:50.520> burn<00:05:50.849> you<00:05:51.919> it<00:05:52.919> only<00:05:53.069> actually<00:05:53.400> starts

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
won't burn you it only actually starts

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.080 
won't burn you it only actually starts
heating<00:05:54.180> up<00:05:54.479> when<00:05:54.659> it<00:05:55.130> makes<00:05:56.130> contact<00:05:56.340> with

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
heating up when it makes contact with

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.420 
heating up when it makes contact with
the<00:05:57.330> solder<00:05:57.630> and<00:05:57.780> the<00:05:59.719> connection<00:06:01.430> creates

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
the solder and the connection creates

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.660 
the solder and the connection creates
the<00:06:02.699> heat

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:12.450 

there<00:06:06.670> you<00:06:06.790> go

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:18.600 

and<00:06:13.870> that's<00:06:14.870> that<00:06:15.230> hopefully<00:06:16.660> we<00:06:17.660> shall<00:06:17.870> see

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
and that's that hopefully we shall see

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.190 
and that's that hopefully we shall see
well<00:06:19.610> in<00:06:19.730> the<00:06:19.820> hopes<00:06:19.970> of<00:06:20.120> saving<00:06:20.389> myself<00:06:20.720> some

well in the hopes of saving myself some

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.310 
well in the hopes of saving myself some
frustration<00:06:22.040> I<00:06:22.250> have<00:06:23.060> not<00:06:23.360> put<00:06:23.750> the<00:06:23.780> batteries

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320 
frustration I have not put the batteries

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:39.400
