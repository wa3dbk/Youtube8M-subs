00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
first of all if you didn't know that

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.419 
first of all if you didn't know that
flag<00:00:35.969> up<00:00:36.149> there<00:00:36.359> is<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.780> ghost<00:00:37.019> symbol<00:00:37.649> you

00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:38.429 
flag up there is the ghost symbol you

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:39.770 
flag up there is the ghost symbol you
see<00:00:38.609> if<00:00:38.699> I<00:00:38.730> can<00:00:38.879> get<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:38.999> better<00:00:39.210> view<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.539> it<00:00:39.690> you

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
see if I can get a better view of it you

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.479 
see if I can get a better view of it you
probably<00:00:39.870> saw<00:00:40.199> a<00:00:40.230> little<00:00:40.379> bit<00:00:40.739> easier<00:00:41.249> on<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
probably saw a little bit easier on the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.400 
probably saw a little bit easier on the
beginning<00:00:41.940> but<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.269> the<00:00:42.359> ghosts<00:00:42.809> logo<00:00:43.260> up

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
beginning but that is the ghosts logo up

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.110 
beginning but that is the ghosts logo up
then<00:00:43.679> I<00:00:43.710> didn't<00:00:44.190> really<00:00:44.460> notice<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.879> that

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
then I didn't really notice that that

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.069 
then I didn't really notice that that
might<00:00:45.239> even<00:00:45.359> be<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> splash<00:00:46.050> screen

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
might even be on the splash screen

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.799 
might even be on the splash screen
before<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.769> actually<00:00:46.920> start<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.429> map<00:00:47.749> but<00:00:48.749> I

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
before you actually start the map but I

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.680 
before you actually start the map but I
didn't<00:00:49.079> notice<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.589> at<00:00:49.859> all<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.820> that's

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
didn't notice that at all so that's

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.569 
didn't notice that at all so that's
interesting<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.769> the<00:00:53.069> annoying<00:00:53.280> thing<00:00:53.460> is

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
interesting and the annoying thing is

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.669 
interesting and the annoying thing is
that<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.879> domination<00:00:54.359> this<00:00:54.870> isn't<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.350> point

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
that in domination this isn't a point

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:58.880 
that in domination this isn't a point
which<00:00:56.539> baffles<00:00:57.539> me<00:00:57.749> because<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.469> would<00:00:58.679> make

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
which baffles me because that would make

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.439 
which baffles me because that would make
perfect<00:00:59.069> sense<00:00:59.370> it'd<00:00:59.699> be<00:00:59.789> great<00:00:59.909> to<00:01:00.030> see<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
perfect sense it'd be great to see the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.479 
perfect sense it'd be great to see the
flag<00:01:00.629> up<00:01:00.809> there<00:01:00.960> doing<00:01:01.319> stuff<00:01:01.409> would<00:01:02.399> have

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
flag up there doing stuff would have

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.640 
flag up there doing stuff would have
been<00:01:02.579> cool<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:02.999> that's<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.229> first<00:01:04.379> one

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
been cool but that's the first one

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.870 
been cool but that's the first one
there's<00:01:04.830> also<00:01:04.950> another<00:01:05.220> ghost<00:01:05.520> thing<00:01:05.760> which

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
there's also another ghost thing which

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.060
