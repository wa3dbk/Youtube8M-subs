00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.480
 of the series we are ready for new challenges 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.340
 we leave sports cars at home and 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.400
 electric and dedicate ourselves to off-road 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.189
 but with much heavier vehicles and 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.770
 robust with the six-cylinder engine and the 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.840
 new 4-cylinder 230 hp 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.230
 the unimog range comes with 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.059
 different denominations and all 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.710
 reorganized starting from the cabin a 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:43.030
 classic that characterizes his 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.399
 image from the distant 1974 extended and 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.589
 raised compared to the previous version 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.969
 improves in comfort and condition 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.969
 of interior spaces for the driver 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.280
 I know 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.120
 mercedes engineers have had to 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.280
 study the way to stay under the 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.570
 technologies necessary to respect the 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.520
 euro standard 6 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.650
 and it seems that the revolution aside 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.570
 a new one is well done 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.460
 configuration in fact provides for the 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.890
 thruster shifted backwards by a 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.720
 meter or the curvature of the frame which 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.850
 moving backwards allows you to get a 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.040
 lower center of gravity compared to a 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.900
 high ground clearance which improves 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.500
 also the off-road qualities of the 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.050
 vehicle 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.009
 the renewed regulation system 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.840
 of tires 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.420
 also allows you to set the 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.440
 pressure by default 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.720
 making it suitable for all types of 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.380
 employment available to those sitting at 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.899
 steering wheel 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.250
 the sand and route road modes 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.440
 rough 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.960
 in other words, heavy vehicles destined for a 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.830
 business use without, however, excluding a 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.830
 bit of healthy fun
