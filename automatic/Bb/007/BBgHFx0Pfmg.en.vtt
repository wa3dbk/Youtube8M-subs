00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.390
 to see photos collecting on farms or 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.700
 be at the time of 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.320
 when they grow they collect their as 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.560
 young for cultivated nothing 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.740
 of roads crossing and good the reality 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.909
 it would be spacetime, that's why its game 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.520

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.340
 It's that game, although it's getting more and more 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.340

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.760
 I keep in mind that you are going to fight 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.319

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.120

 medieval dragon in third place 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.459

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:32.000
