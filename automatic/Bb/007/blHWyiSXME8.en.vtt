00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
about this project is that you can

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.980 
about this project is that you can
literally<00:00:26.789> take<00:00:26.939> one<00:00:27.449> pair<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.720> flip-flops

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
literally take one pair of flip-flops

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.130 
literally take one pair of flip-flops
and<00:00:28.500> turn<00:00:29.220> them<00:00:29.400> into<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.910> countless<00:00:30.390> supply<00:00:30.810> of

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
and turn them into a countless supply of

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.549 
and turn them into a countless supply of
sandals<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.740> simply<00:00:32.189> took<00:00:32.809> one<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.840> my<00:00:34.200> scarf

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
sandals I simply took one of my scarf

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.180 
sandals I simply took one of my scarf
and<00:00:34.920> cut<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.850> half<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.870> equal<00:00:37.469> on

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
and cut it in half so that is equal on

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.580 
and cut it in half so that is equal on
both<00:00:38.250> sides<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.719> thing<00:00:39.899> about<00:00:40.110> these<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.379> that

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
both sides the thing about these is that

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.139 
both sides the thing about these is that
they<00:00:40.829> do<00:00:40.890> need<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.250> be<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.550> long<00:00:41.730> scarf<00:00:42.059> so

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
they do need to be the long scarf so

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.560 
they do need to be the long scarf so
I'll<00:00:42.390> take<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.960> okay<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.500> end<00:00:43.710> key<00:00:43.920> yes

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
I'll take that in okay that end key yes

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.799 
I'll take that in okay that end key yes
all<00:00:45.570> right

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809

some people may be thinking okay if I

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.959 
some people may be thinking okay if I

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
cut it in half then I'm gonna have this

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.240 
cut it in half then I'm gonna have this
a<00:00:51.210> raw<00:00:51.449> edge<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.199> side<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.829> personally

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
a raw edge on the side but I personally

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.189 
a raw edge on the side but I personally
don't<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.149> problem<00:00:54.210> with<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.750> riot<00:00:54.930> you

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
know so that right up the edge and then

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.520 
know so that right up the edge and then
you<00:00:56.910> have<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> clean<00:00:57.390> seam<00:00:57.780> there<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.260> then<00:00:58.379> you

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
you have a clean seam there and then you

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.770 
you have a clean seam there and then you
got<00:00:58.710> ready<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.010> get<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.670> work<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.539> you're<00:01:00.660> gonna

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
got ready to get to work so you're gonna

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.429 
got ready to get to work so you're gonna
take<00:01:01.050> your<00:01:01.109> piece<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.649> middle<00:01:02.090> equal<00:01:03.439> in

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
take your piece in the middle equal in

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.200 
take your piece in the middle equal in
the<00:01:05.010> middle<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.460> then<00:01:05.640> you're<00:01:05.790> gonna<00:01:05.880> take

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
the middle and then you're gonna take

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.920 
the middle and then you're gonna take
the<00:01:06.450> loop<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.340> slide<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.670> under<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.540> thong

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
the loop and slide it under the thong

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.890 
the loop and slide it under the thong
the<00:01:10.200> thong<00:01:10.409> song<00:01:10.439> part<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:12.119> then<00:01:12.750> you're

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
the thong song part and then you're

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.760 
the thong song part and then you're
gonna<00:01:12.990> take<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.320> edges<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.530> slide<00:01:16.530> it

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
gonna take the edges and just slide it

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.530 
gonna take the edges and just slide it
on<00:01:16.860> through

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.270 

now<00:01:22.540> you're<00:01:22.720> simply<00:01:23.200> just<00:01:23.470> gonna<00:01:23.680> take<00:01:24.009> both

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
now you're simply just gonna take both

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.320 
now you're simply just gonna take both
pieces<00:01:24.900> separate<00:01:25.900> them<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:27.060> then<00:01:28.060> this<00:01:28.150> is

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
pieces separate them and then this is

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.550 
pieces separate them and then this is
when<00:01:28.479> you're<00:01:28.600> going<00:01:28.720> to<00:01:28.780> start<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.140> wrapping

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
when you're going to start the wrapping

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.080 
when you're going to start the wrapping
so<00:01:29.979> it<00:01:30.040> doesn't<00:01:30.280> really<00:01:30.430> matter<00:01:30.670> which<00:01:30.909> level

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
so it doesn't really matter which level

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.450 
so it doesn't really matter which level
right<00:01:31.420> you<00:01:31.690> decide<00:01:32.049> to<00:01:32.229> go<00:01:32.409> but<00:01:33.009> you're<00:01:33.100> just

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
right you decide to go but you're just

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.590 
right you decide to go but you're just
gonna<00:01:33.610> simply<00:01:33.940> wrap<00:01:34.330> around<00:01:34.960> a<00:01:36.330> part<00:01:37.330> of<00:01:37.479> the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
gonna simply wrap around a part of the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.539 
gonna simply wrap around a part of the
flip-flop<00:01:38.140> so<00:01:38.440> that<00:01:38.590> you're<00:01:38.740> covering<00:01:39.399> it

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
flip-flop so that you're covering it

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.719 
flip-flop so that you're covering it
it's<00:01:40.060> really<00:01:40.270> easy<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:45.159> I'll<00:01:45.280> wrap<00:01:45.549> about

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
it's really easy and I'll wrap about

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.730 
it's really easy and I'll wrap about
three<00:01:46.180> times<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.960> then<00:01:50.110> if<00:01:50.229> you<00:01:50.320> just<00:01:50.500> spread

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
three times and then if you just spread

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.090 
three times and then if you just spread
it<00:01:50.799> out<00:01:51.569> so<00:01:52.569> that<00:01:52.600> really<00:01:53.050> covers<00:01:53.319> it<00:01:53.679> and<00:01:53.950> then

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
it out so that really covers it and then

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.680 
it out so that really covers it and then
you<00:01:54.220> just<00:01:54.399> do<00:01:54.520> it<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:54.819> opposite<00:01:55.240> side<00:01:55.300> as

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
you just do it to the opposite side as

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.029 
you just do it to the opposite side as
well<00:01:55.899> so<00:01:58.229> there's<00:01:59.229> many<00:01:59.350> ways<00:01:59.500> to<00:01:59.649> tie<00:01:59.979> the

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
well so there's many ways to tie the
