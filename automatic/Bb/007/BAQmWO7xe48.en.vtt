00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello this video on the site nexusx.ru 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 and today I would like to tell you 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.179
 about such custom firmware as 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.000
 cataclysm it is based on the operating 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.170
 the android system version 442 well let's 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.260
 let's see what settings we 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.400
 represents this kostanay firmware 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.010
 First of all I liked the most 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.260
 here this mode and an array of modes it allows 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.699
 we enable this mode anywhere then 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.439
 we just have the whole operating room 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.420
 system becomes under inversion mode 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.279
 mod that is, we have lost upper here 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.109
 this menu and bottom buttons 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.300
 I like it very much 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.820
 This mode as a useful area 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.530
 screens get bigger and pages in 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.230
 browser and getting bigger in general 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.239
 notice on the mode let's take it for now 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.710
 turn off and look at other settings 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.270
 who provide this person on 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.390
 system let's go go through all 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.980
 quick setting settings here we are 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.840
 we can choose the switches that are here 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.750
 here we will be hiding by these 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.430
 things are already a lot of things included here 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.020
 we can put ticks we can pull out 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.809
 key network whatever we like more 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.489
 like can also resize 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.040
 these switches you sat he 50 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.540
 percent and here they all started 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.090
 pursed became much smaller 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.130
 can also change the location then 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.020
 there is a change in location 1 relative 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.759
 of the other, that is, it's just a setting 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.590
 of these switches also 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.180
 stretching stretching you seems to me 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.890
 just perfect translation actually 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.640
 here we mean how can we 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.650
 throw out 2 menus is permissible if the case 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.840
 here on the right to be renting here see 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.110
 stretched immediately opens 2 menus to the left 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.390
 just the notification bar you can 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.840
 do thats just so they have eye skills 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.049
 always simple i would picture when also 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:46.070
 you can include 4 column that is 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.149
 carrying the general 4 columns to my sister 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.680
 vibration when pressed that is press 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.930
 a button to get away cozy here I think 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.430
 figure it out yourself on screen options 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.320
 lock but that's enough 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.850
 interesting so you can add hands 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:03.630
 any settings slider select settings 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.430
 calculator need to press well 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.360
 keep necessary and hands and tap 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.580
 saved 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.340
 and now locks the screen Lock the screen 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.500
 and here I have a calculator appeared 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.270
 I turn from different calculator this too 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.500
 very convenient well then let's see 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.120
 further still we have here at all 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.320
 conductors and I think you will understand nothing 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.180
 there is no more interesting 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.960
 let's pour in the next paragraphs 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.850
 blocking incoming it is very convenient it 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.290
 just blacklist that is if you have 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.630
 There are some contacts that you do not 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.910
 you want to call them together 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.940
 here to the blacklist and they are no longer 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.620
 will plague you let's say here i'm 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.230
 your phone blacklist 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.160
 indicated and let's try to call on 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.660
 This phone and blocking rules are necessary 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.220
 specify 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.840
 calls are marked with contacts that is 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.150
 contacts marked out of it now 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.480
 make a call and see what 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.370
 happen now I'll carry the phone 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.660
 mike so you hear what 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.660
 hear the man on that end of the wire 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.530
 Well now let's go beyond the legs 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.690
 let's see what may be 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.640
 us displayed in incoming calls and 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.900
 yes indeed here is one incoming 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.910
 call i megaphone that is call us like 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.920
 would go on the phone nothing 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.319
 but then about incoming 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.480
 calls you can see what was in 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:37.430
 perfect call 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:44.670
 let's turn off unlocking and 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:46.799
 try to call again as you saw 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.360
 the call was successful I did that 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.980
 blacklist this champion feature 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.470
 especially nowadays very often 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.730
 people start all sorts of annoy and with 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.190
 using this blacklist you can 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.720
 get rid of such people oh well 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.010
 let's look further what else do u 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.120
 we have to notice it on the firmware 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.280
 smart radio 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.069
 this function which allows us 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.380
 control our radio wise activate 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.299
 the function our smartphone will start is very smart 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.700
 manage our power consumption 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.680
 modem let's say our phone will be 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.329
 wi-fi network connected then it will 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.579
 turn off mobile data and 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.289
 will transfer the phone automatically to 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.780
 gum to network mode 2g 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:24.030
 since 2g networks they consume less 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.520
 energy ie various power modes 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.590
 let's say that's a high power mod that is 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.750
 mode with its use and I have here 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.880
 worth 3g so it does not work at all 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.580
 and the low power mode was 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.950
 well 2g and here it is automatically there 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.900
 to switch the phone from mode 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.970
 high power module by low power mod 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.560
 reaching a certain charge threshold 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.840
 I put the batteries 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.710
 the default is 20 percent and also i 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.380
 made it so that it automatically 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.330
 stopped in 2g mode if the screen is off 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.340
 also make sure he comes back to 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.300
 high power mode ie vessel mode 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.610
 energy consumption 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.620
 and then when the game is taught and unlocked 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.360
 that is, I unlocked the phone on 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.039
 somatic turned on which jim and i 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.350
 continue to use the function 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:06.990
 disappear from soft keys come on 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.000
 turn it on watch after 4 seconds 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.889
 bottom we have soft keys and they 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.810
 just disappears and you can turn it off 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.330
 feature nothing interesting opinion saw 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.380
 and the battery style changes icon 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.090
 batteries 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.130
 keyboard layout is very much here 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.140
 various keyboard options can be 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.510
 play screen recorder that is here 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.260
 we set the settings that will be 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:32.290
 used when recording video from the screen 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:34.720
 mode for all you can change the size 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.820
 navigation panels inspect doing 18 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.830
 percent and reduce those little 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.920
 Buttons have become do not know why it is done 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:45.280
 will send it is not very convenient but such 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.860
 opportunity is here we define 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.990
 various 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.490
 Perm tires for our applications and you 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.590
 there are different settings there are very 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.630
 many different settings 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.070
 let's take captivating 3g revenge 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.020
 representation of the same stands on 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.290
 arrow mood who 3g will be sure 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:08.590
 always used on also here 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:10.300
 and a variety of other settings as well 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.770
 very convenient that in this operating room 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.380
 the system has the ability to create 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.880
 backup settings for this particular 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.410
 operating system that is exactly this 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.240
 firmware that is, we make a backup 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.490
 a copy 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.140
 took the coupe was welded successful and then 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.910
 we can save where to have on the computer 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:28.060
 and in the case of firmware to return our 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:30.100
 settings it is very convenient as if 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.660
 do you like to flash your smartphone then 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.210
 every time re-tune this very 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.930
 tedious in principle it was all this 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:40.800
 video on the site nexusx.ru subscribe 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.800
 put goodies like goodbye
