the<00:01:01.600> lid<00:01:01.809> here<00:01:03.299> something<00:01:04.299> you<00:01:04.390> want<00:01:04.539> to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
the lid here something you want to

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.260 
the lid here something you want to
remember<00:01:05.019> is<00:01:05.530> when<00:01:06.130> you're<00:01:06.399> using<00:01:06.729> dark

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
remember is when you're using dark

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.440 
remember is when you're using dark
colors<00:01:07.930> you<00:01:08.799> want<00:01:08.950> to<00:01:09.070> use<00:01:09.159> a<00:01:09.369> dark<00:01:09.789> color<00:01:10.119> base

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
colors you want to use a dark color base

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.710 
colors you want to use a dark color base
just<00:01:11.020> like<00:01:11.170> when<00:01:11.320> you're<00:01:11.700> painting<00:01:12.700> a<00:01:12.850> wall<00:01:13.030> if

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
just like when you're painting a wall if

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.330 
just like when you're painting a wall if
you're<00:01:13.840> going<00:01:13.929> to<00:01:13.990> paint<00:01:14.229> a<00:01:14.470> bright<00:01:14.830> red<00:01:15.069> wool

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
you're going to paint a bright red wool

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.669 
you're going to paint a bright red wool
you<00:01:15.789> don't<00:01:15.970> use<00:01:16.149> a<00:01:16.179> white<00:01:16.539> primer<00:01:16.869> it'll<00:01:17.530> turn

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
you don't use a white primer it'll turn

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:20.160 
you don't use a white primer it'll turn
out<00:01:17.740> pink<00:01:18.130> you<00:01:18.310> want<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.610> use<00:01:18.759> a<00:01:18.789> dark<00:01:19.300> colored

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
out pink you want to use a dark colored

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.240 
out pink you want to use a dark colored
primer<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.659> red<00:01:22.840> shows<00:01:23.110> up<00:01:23.319> as<00:01:23.500> it<00:01:24.039> should

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
primer so the red shows up as it should

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.980 
primer so the red shows up as it should
same<00:01:24.850> thing<00:01:25.060> with<00:01:25.179> using<00:01:25.360> your<00:01:25.630> dark<00:01:25.840> eye

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
same thing with using your dark eye

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.289 
same thing with using your dark eye

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
shadows if you've had a problem and you

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.550 
shadows if you've had a problem and you
use<00:01:28.619> Urban<00:01:29.619> Decay's<00:01:29.950> primer<00:01:30.250> potion<00:01:30.759> and<00:01:31.560> you

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
use Urban Decay's primer potion and you

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.620 
use Urban Decay's primer potion and you
feel<00:01:32.799> like<00:01:32.830> it<00:01:33.340> makes<00:01:33.729> your<00:01:33.940> colors<00:01:34.270> last

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
feel like it makes your colors last

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.740 
feel like it makes your colors last
longer<00:01:35.170> but<00:01:35.350> it<00:01:35.409> kind<00:01:35.649> of<00:01:35.709> DOL's<00:01:35.950> them<00:01:36.250> it's

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
longer but it kind of DOL's them it's

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.029 
longer but it kind of DOL's them it's
possibly<00:01:37.750> because<00:01:37.869> maybe<00:01:38.470> you're<00:01:38.649> using<00:01:38.709> your

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
possibly because maybe you're using your

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.090 
possibly because maybe you're using your
darker<00:01:39.369> colors<00:01:39.670> on<00:01:39.819> top<00:01:39.850> of<00:01:40.209> it<00:01:40.299> is<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:42.009> know

darker colors on top of it is you know
virtually<00:01:42.310> flush<00:01:43.000> down<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.560> you<00:01:44.619> might<00:01:44.920> if<00:01:45.100> you

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
virtually flush down so you might if you

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.919 
virtually flush down so you might if you
want<00:01:45.399> to<00:01:45.459> continue<00:01:45.759> using<00:01:46.030> it<00:01:46.330> you<00:01:46.569> can<00:01:46.720> still

use<00:01:46.959> it<00:01:47.289> just<00:01:48.190> um<00:01:48.489> use<00:01:49.149> a<00:01:49.179> darker<00:01:49.599> colored

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.350 

so<00:02:08.380> now<00:02:08.619> they've<00:02:09.280> got<00:02:09.550> that<00:02:09.819> on<00:02:10.000> there<00:02:10.239> I'm

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
so now they've got that on there I'm

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.610 
so now they've got that on there I'm
just<00:02:10.390> going<00:02:10.599> to<00:02:10.690> blend<00:02:10.899> out<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.140> edges<00:02:11.260> a

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
just going to blend out the edges a

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.229 
just going to blend out the edges a
little<00:02:11.709> bit<00:02:12.099> and<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:12.760> doesn't<00:02:13.030> have<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.209> be

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
little bit and it doesn't have to be

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:24.250 
little bit and it doesn't have to be
perfect<00:02:13.690> because<00:02:13.840> this<00:02:14.410> is<00:02:14.560> just<00:02:14.770> your<00:02:14.920> base

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.050 

I'm<00:02:24.769> just<00:02:24.890> kind<00:02:25.099> of<00:02:25.159> working<00:02:25.459> out<00:02:25.549> these<00:02:25.670> edges

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
I'm just kind of working out these edges

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.679 
I'm just kind of working out these edges
another<00:02:27.049> good<00:02:27.430> base<00:02:28.430> for<00:02:28.849> doing<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.150> smoky<00:02:29.629> eye

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 
another good base for doing a smoky eye

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.770 
another good base for doing a smoky eye
is<00:02:30.079> black<00:02:30.409> truck<00:02:30.709> fluid<00:02:31.069> line<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.629> it<00:02:32.629> will

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
is black truck fluid line and it will

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.839 
is black truck fluid line and it will
really<00:02:33.140> make<00:02:33.379> your<00:02:33.560> colors<00:02:33.950> as<00:02:34.189> black<00:02:34.489> as<00:02:34.700> they

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
really make your colors as black as they

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.600

budging increasing because the fluid
line<00:02:44.000> is<00:02:44.180> waterproof<00:02:48.459> okay<00:02:50.140> now<00:02:51.140> I've<00:02:51.290> got<00:02:51.470> my

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
line is waterproof okay now I've got my

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.229 
line is waterproof okay now I've got my
base<00:02:51.769> on<00:02:52.930> essentially<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:54.280> smoky<00:02:55.280> eye<00:02:55.310> means

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
base on essentially a smoky eye means

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.559 
base on essentially a smoky eye means
you<00:02:56.540> are<00:02:56.690> encompassed<00:02:57.049> in<00:02:57.290> the<00:02:57.349> eye<00:02:57.470> in<00:02:57.980> color

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
you are encompassed in the eye in color

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.240 
you are encompassed in the eye in color
and<00:02:59.569> then<00:02:59.959> you're<00:03:00.109> fading<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.739> out<00:03:00.890> that's<00:03:01.129> the

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
and then you're fading it out that's the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.250 
and then you're fading it out that's the
technique<00:03:01.579> in<00:03:01.730> smoky<00:03:02.150> eye<00:03:02.209> is<00:03:02.389> that<00:03:02.629> all<00:03:02.989> the

technique in smoky eye is that all the

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.080 
technique in smoky eye is that all the
color<00:03:03.500> goes<00:03:03.799> around<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.400> eye<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.940> then

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
color goes around the eye and then

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.930 
color goes around the eye and then
diffuses<00:03:05.690> outward<00:03:06.409> creating<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.370> smoke<00:03:07.760> like

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
diffuses outward creating a smoke like

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.479 
diffuses outward creating a smoke like
