a<00:00:00.829> composite<00:00:01.829> motor<00:00:02.250> uses<00:00:02.700> a<00:00:02.730> different<00:00:02.970> type

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
a composite motor uses a different type

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.079 
a composite motor uses a different type
of<00:00:03.300> igniter<00:00:04.130> this<00:00:05.130> is<00:00:05.279> generally<00:00:05.730> called<00:00:05.940> a

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
of igniter this is generally called a

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.110 
of igniter this is generally called a
copperhead<00:00:06.480> or<00:00:06.899> Tiger<00:00:07.379> Tail<00:00:07.700> again<00:00:08.700> we<00:00:08.910> have<00:00:09.090> a

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
copperhead or Tiger Tail again we have a

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.839 
copperhead or Tiger Tail again we have a
pyrogen<00:00:09.660> on<00:00:09.809> one<00:00:10.050> end<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.500> this<00:00:11.490> time<00:00:11.700> it

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
pyrogen on one end and this time it

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.430 
pyrogen on one end and this time it
looks<00:00:12.030> like<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.360> just<00:00:12.420> one<00:00:12.719> strip<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.259> metal

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
looks like it's just one strip of metal

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.799 
looks like it's just one strip of metal
but<00:00:14.280> actually<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:14.940> is<00:00:15.089> two<00:00:15.269> strips<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.719> metal

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
but actually it is two strips of metal

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.519 
but actually it is two strips of metal
that<00:00:16.049> are<00:00:16.109> separated<00:00:16.740> by<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.890> thin<00:00:16.980> insulator

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
that are separated by a thin insulator

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.050 
that are separated by a thin insulator
the<00:00:19.529> reason<00:00:19.920> it's<00:00:20.100> long<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.369> skinny<00:00:20.670> is

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
the reason it's long and skinny is

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.700 
the reason it's long and skinny is
because<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.779> needs<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.109> go<00:00:22.230> down<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
because it needs to go down to the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.170 
because it needs to go down to the
bottom<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.220> rocket<00:00:23.430> motor<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:24.060> a

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
bottom of the rocket motor in a

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.570 
bottom of the rocket motor in a
composite<00:00:24.510> motor<00:00:24.980> what<00:00:25.980> you'll<00:00:26.130> do<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.430> you'll

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
composite motor what you'll do is you'll

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.589 
composite motor what you'll do is you'll
put<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.820> into<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.119> motor

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
put it into the motor

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.419 
put it into the motor
twist<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.380> around<00:00:28.470> until<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:29.070> goes<00:00:29.189> all<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
twist it around until it goes all the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.150 
twist it around until it goes all the
way<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:30.080> you<00:00:31.080> can<00:00:31.109> see<00:00:31.410> as<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.740> pull<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.040> out

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
way in you can see as you pull it out

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.240 
way in you can see as you pull it out
that<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.180> motor<00:00:33.440> igniter<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.649> quite<00:00:34.950> deep

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
that the motor igniter is quite deep

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.380 
that the motor igniter is quite deep
inside<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.790> motor<00:00:40.700> to<00:00:41.700> hook<00:00:41.879> up<00:00:42.000> your<00:00:42.030> net

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
inside the motor to hook up your net

Eclipse to the Copperhead igniter
we<00:00:44.430> can't<00:00:44.760> hook<00:00:45.239> up<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.780> igniter<00:00:46.079> just<00:00:46.350> like

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
we can't hook up the igniter just like

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.340 
we can't hook up the igniter just like
this<00:00:46.710> because<00:00:47.190> both<00:00:47.430> sides<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:48.120> each<00:00:48.899> igniter

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
this because both sides of each igniter

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.889 
this because both sides of each igniter
clip<00:00:49.649> touch<00:00:50.600> each<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.320> Copperhead<00:00:52.949> strips

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
clip touch each of the Copperhead strips

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.479 
clip touch each of the Copperhead strips
this<00:00:54.899> does<00:00:55.110> not<00:00:55.289> allow<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> complete<00:00:56.039> circuit

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
this does not allow a complete circuit

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.810 
this does not allow a complete circuit
we<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.449> insulate<00:00:57.750> one<00:00:58.230> side<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:59.250> each

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
we have to insulate one side of each

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.360 
we have to insulate one side of each
clip<00:01:00.199> this<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.410> done<00:01:01.590> with<00:01:01.770> some<00:01:01.949> pieces<00:01:02.190> of

clip this is done with some pieces of

clip this is done with some pieces of
tape<00:01:03.199> put<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> piece<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.439> tape<00:01:04.589> on<00:01:04.890> one<00:01:05.100> side<00:01:05.339> of

tape put a piece of tape on one side of

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.420 
tape put a piece of tape on one side of
the<00:01:05.610> igniter<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.710> put<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> piece<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.070> tape<00:01:08.220> on

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
the igniter and put a piece of tape on

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.190 
the igniter and put a piece of tape on
