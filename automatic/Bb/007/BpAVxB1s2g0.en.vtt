00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.830 

I<00:00:00.210> just<00:00:00.989> finished<00:00:01.380> this<00:00:02.389> telescope<00:00:03.389> remote

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
I just finished this telescope remote

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.110 
I just finished this telescope remote
focus<00:00:04.290> control<00:00:04.680> so<00:00:05.520> I'll<00:00:05.609> first<00:00:05.819> give<00:00:06.000> me<00:00:06.089> a

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
focus control so I'll first give me a

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.629 
focus control so I'll first give me a
demonstration<00:00:06.600> of<00:00:06.810> how<00:00:06.899> it<00:00:06.930> works<00:00:07.610> when<00:00:08.610> I

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
demonstration of how it works when I

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.270 
demonstration of how it works when I
turn<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.059> knob<00:00:09.090> on<00:00:09.480> this<00:00:09.690> control<00:00:10.110> box<00:00:10.290> the

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
turn the knob on this control box the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.280 
turn the knob on this control box the
focus<00:00:11.730> wheel<00:00:11.940> on<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.240> telescope<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.929> turned

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
focus wheel on the telescope is turned

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.019 
focus wheel on the telescope is turned
in<00:00:13.650> just<00:00:14.099> about<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.340> one-to-one<00:00:14.820> control<00:00:15.830> so

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:17.029 
in just about a one-to-one control so

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.160 
in just about a one-to-one control so
the<00:00:18.029> whole<00:00:18.210> point<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.020> you

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
the whole point of this is so that you

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.420 
the whole point of this is so that you
don't<00:00:19.410> actually<00:00:19.560> have<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.890> touch<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
don't actually have to touch the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.880 
don't actually have to touch the
telescope<00:00:20.910> while<00:00:21.090> focusing<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.869> even<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
telescope while focusing it even the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.859 
telescope while focusing it even the
slight<00:00:23.160> even<00:00:23.730> with<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.880> steady<00:00:24.240> hand<00:00:24.539> very

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
slight even with a steady hand very

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.320 
slight even with a steady hand very
slight<00:00:25.260> vibrations<00:00:25.949> will<00:00:26.250> jiggle<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.060> image

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
slight vibrations will jiggle the image

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.089 
slight vibrations will jiggle the image
and<00:00:27.539> while<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.199> image<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.560> bouncing<00:00:28.980> around

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
and while the image is bouncing around

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.910 
and while the image is bouncing around
it's<00:00:29.400> difficult<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.150> focus<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.410> idea<00:00:31.769> with

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
it's difficult to focus so the idea with

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.250 
it's difficult to focus so the idea with
this<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.300> turn<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.690> knob<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
this is that you can turn the knob and

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.650 
this is that you can turn the knob and
not<00:00:35.040> touch<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.610> telescope<00:00:36.090> at<00:00:36.239> all<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.510> get<00:00:36.630> a

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
not touch the telescope at all and get a

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.260 
not touch the telescope at all and get a
really<00:00:37.050> precise<00:00:37.469> focus<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.940> I'll<00:00:39.059> show<00:00:39.239> you

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
really precise focus so I'll show you

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.030 
really precise focus so I'll show you
how<00:00:39.390> its<00:00:39.600> put<00:00:39.719> together<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:43.230> original<00:00:43.680> focus

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
how its put together the original focus

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.080 
how its put together the original focus
knob<00:00:44.399> for<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.789> telescope<00:00:45.329> was<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:47.090> hollow

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
knob for the telescope was this hollow

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.900 
knob for the telescope was this hollow
rubber<00:00:48.510> knob<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.920> slipped<00:00:50.280> over<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.640> end

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
rubber knob and it slipped over the end

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.330 
rubber knob and it slipped over the end
of<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.270> metal<00:00:52.230> tube<00:00:52.500> sticking<00:00:53.039> out<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
of this metal tube sticking out of the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.970 
of this metal tube sticking out of the
back<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.789> telescope<00:00:54.469> so<00:00:55.469> at<00:00:55.590> first<00:00:55.739> I

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
back of the telescope so at first I

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.290 
back of the telescope so at first I
thought<00:00:56.190> well<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.640> best<00:00:56.820> thing<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.000> do<00:00:57.180> is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
thought well the best thing to do is

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.330 
thought well the best thing to do is
just<00:00:57.449> beat<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.660> couple<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:58.199> motor<00:00:58.770> shaft<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
just beat a couple of motor shaft to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.910 
just beat a couple of motor shaft to
this<00:00:59.489> shaft<00:01:00.079> can<00:01:01.079> be<00:01:01.109> able<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.410> be<00:01:01.559> able<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.770> put

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
this shaft can be able to be able to put

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.280 
this shaft can be able to be able to put
the<00:01:02.010> motor<00:01:02.219> shaft<00:01:02.460> inside<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.899> as<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.080> turns

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
the motor shaft inside but as it turns

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.570 
the motor shaft inside but as it turns
out<00:01:04.470> that's<00:01:04.619> not<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.159> work<00:01:05.220> because

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
out that's not going to work because

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.929 
out that's not going to work because
inside<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.510> shaft<00:01:06.950> there's<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.280> lead<00:01:08.729> screw

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
inside this shaft there's a lead screw

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.730 
inside this shaft there's a lead screw
which<00:01:09.240> actually<00:01:09.630> moves<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.080> mirror<00:01:10.350> inside

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
which actually moves the mirror inside

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.100 
which actually moves the mirror inside
the<00:01:10.920> telescope<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.330> can't<00:01:12.630> put<00:01:12.869> anything

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
the telescope so you can't put anything

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.660 
the telescope so you can't put anything
in<00:01:13.380> here<00:01:13.560> because<00:01:13.680> when<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:13.920> focus<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.520> all

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
in here because when you focus it all

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.070 
in here because when you focus it all
the<00:01:14.760> way<00:01:14.850> out<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.210> lead<00:01:15.390> screw<00:01:15.630> actually

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
the way out the lead screw actually

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.690 
the way out the lead screw actually
backs<00:01:16.380> all<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> way<00:01:16.860> out<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.220> end<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.549> this

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
backs all the way out the end of this

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.880 
backs all the way out the end of this
shaft<00:01:18.030> which<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.780> why<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.080> knob<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.439> hollow

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
shaft which is why this knob is hollow

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.440 
shaft which is why this knob is hollow
too<00:01:20.810> so<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:23.460> get<00:01:23.580> around<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:24.000> problem<00:01:24.030> I

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
too so to get around that problem I

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.030 
too so to get around that problem I
thought<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.810> next<00:01:24.960> best<00:01:25.530> thing<00:01:25.799> would<00:01:25.890> be<00:01:25.950> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
thought the next best thing would be to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.580 
thought the next best thing would be to
put<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.540> ACOG<00:01:28.310> hub<00:01:29.310> sprocket<00:01:29.939> on<00:01:30.030> there<00:01:30.299> and

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
put a ACOG hub sprocket on there and

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.929 
put a ACOG hub sprocket on there and
this<00:01:31.590> would<00:01:31.770> be<00:01:31.890> Hollow<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.280> also<00:01:32.670> get<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
this would be Hollow and also get the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.249 
this would be Hollow and also get the
motor<00:01:33.150> out<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.600> way<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.780> that's<00:01:34.020> what<00:01:34.200> I

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
motor out of the way so that's what I

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.130 
motor out of the way so that's what I
did<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.979> am<00:01:35.570> made<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.840> toothed

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
did so this is am made for a toothed

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.340 
did so this is am made for a toothed
belt<00:01:37.310> part<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.520> got<00:01:38.700> from<00:01:38.850> McMaster<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.659> I

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
belt part that I got from McMaster and I

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.609 
belt part that I got from McMaster and I
machines<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:42.509> original<00:01:42.750> aluminum<00:01:43.409> boss

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
machines the the original aluminum boss

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.800 
machines the the original aluminum boss
out<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> middle<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.640> made<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> plastic

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
out of the middle and made a plastic

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.810 
out of the middle and made a plastic
boss<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.619> will<00:01:46.740> fit<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.130> outside<00:01:47.549> diameter

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
boss that will fit the outside diameter

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.889 
boss that will fit the outside diameter
of<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.329> focus<00:01:48.810> wheel<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:50.600> then<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.659> got<00:01:51.869> a

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
of the focus wheel and then I got a

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.600 
of the focus wheel and then I got a
toothed<00:01:52.619> belt<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:54.409> made<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.619> bracket<00:01:56.399> for<00:01:56.579> a

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
toothed belt and made this bracket for a

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.490 
toothed belt and made this bracket for a
stepper<00:01:56.909> motor<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:58.490> in<00:01:59.490> another<00:02:00.500> sprocket

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
stepper motor and in another sprocket

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.350 
stepper motor and in another sprocket
for<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.799> stepper<00:02:02.399> motor<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.939> then<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.149> can

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
for the stepper motor so then I can

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.330 
for the stepper motor so then I can
pivot<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.380> motor<00:02:04.560> down<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.070> get<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> little

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
pivot the motor down and get a little

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.310 
pivot the motor down and get a little
bit<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.640> tension<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:06.180> really<00:02:06.780> don't<00:02:06.960> need<00:02:07.110> too

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
bit of tension you really don't need too

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.469 
bit of tension you really don't need too
much<00:02:07.469> tension<00:02:07.799> for<00:02:08.160> these<00:02:08.280> belts<00:02:08.759> they

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
much tension for these belts they

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.150 
much tension for these belts they
actually<00:02:09.780> track<00:02:10.050> quite<00:02:10.440> well<00:02:10.649> it's<00:02:10.890> just<00:02:10.920> a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
actually track quite well it's just a

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.650 
actually track quite well it's just a
little<00:02:11.190> tiny<00:02:11.640> bit<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:11.879> tension

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
little tiny bit of tension

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.590 
little tiny bit of tension
so<00:02:13.410> there's<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.240> see<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.510> it

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
so there's that you can see that it

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.260 
so there's that you can see that it
operates<00:02:15.960> really<00:02:16.500> smoothly<00:02:16.890> there's<00:02:17.790> very

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
operates really smoothly there's very

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.780 
operates really smoothly there's very
little<00:02:18.480> slippage<00:02:18.990> in<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:20.220> whole<00:02:20.370> Sydney

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
little slippage in the whole Sydney

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.950 
little slippage in the whole Sydney
whole<00:02:20.940> mechanical<00:02:21.480> system<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:27.540> stepper

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
whole mechanical system the stepper

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.550 
whole mechanical system the stepper
motor<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.530> unipolar<00:02:29.190> four<00:02:30.030> coil<00:02:30.390> motor<00:02:30.750> it

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
motor is a unipolar four coil motor it

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.020 
motor is a unipolar four coil motor it
actually<00:02:31.860> has<00:02:31.950> eight<00:02:32.160> wires<00:02:32.400> coming<00:02:32.790> off<00:02:32.970> of

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
actually has eight wires coming off of

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.930 
actually has eight wires coming off of
it<00:02:33.300> with<00:02:33.480> two<00:02:33.900> Commons<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:34.890> just<00:02:35.190> joined<00:02:35.820> the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
it with two Commons so I just joined the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.770 
it with two Commons so I just joined the
Commons<00:02:36.420> together<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:38.270> then<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.390> have<00:02:39.510> four

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
Commons together and then you have four

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.070 
Commons together and then you have four
phases<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.350> worry<00:02:40.530> about<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:41.100> I<00:02:41.850> used<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.480> just

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
phases to worry about and I used a just

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.880 
phases to worry about and I used a just
a<00:02:43.140> db9<00:02:43.500> connector<00:02:44.390> so<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.540> can<00:02:45.890> just

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
a db9 connector so that I can just

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.500 
a db9 connector so that I can just
disconnect<00:02:47.220> this<00:02:47.550> thing<00:02:47.760> quickly<00:02:48.030> not<00:02:48.360> have

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
disconnect this thing quickly not have

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.700 
disconnect this thing quickly not have
something<00:02:48.870> heavy<00:02:49.050> hanging<00:02:49.470> off<00:02:49.560> the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
something heavy hanging off the

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.280 
something heavy hanging off the
telescope<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.490> only<00:02:51.000> used<00:02:51.270> five<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.080> wires

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
telescope I only used five of the wires

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.260 
telescope I only used five of the wires
so<00:02:52.830> there's<00:02:52.980> just<00:02:53.040> one<00:02:53.190> common<00:02:53.790> with<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.060> four

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
so there's just one common with the four

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.750 
so there's just one common with the four
phases<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.950> motor<00:02:56.130> I<00:02:56.220> think<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.490> rated

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
phases and the motor I think is rated

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.080 
phases and the motor I think is rated
for<00:02:56.880> 24<00:02:57.360> volts<00:02:57.720> DC<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.880> seven<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.060> half

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
for 24 volts DC and seven and a half

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.710 
for 24 volts DC and seven and a half
degrees<00:03:00.780> per<00:03:01.290> step<00:03:02.180> it's<00:03:03.180> actually<00:03:03.540> not<00:03:03.690> very

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
degrees per step it's actually not very

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.990 
degrees per step it's actually not very
powerful<00:03:04.530> if<00:03:04.740> I<00:03:04.830> turn<00:03:05.070> the<00:03:05.220> knob<00:03:05.250> quickly<00:03:05.850> on

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
powerful if I turn the knob quickly on

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.060 
powerful if I turn the knob quickly on
the<00:03:06.120> control<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.600> will<00:03:06.780> slip<00:03:07.340> steps<00:03:08.630> but<00:03:10.070> just

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
the control it will slip steps but just

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.590 
the control it will slip steps but just
turn<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.370> knob<00:03:11.400> slowly<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.180> doesn't

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
turn the knob slowly and it doesn't

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.910 
turn the knob slowly and it doesn't
really<00:03:12.720> matter<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:15.810> only<00:03:16.290> input<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.800> this

of<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.240> phases<00:04:09.480> for<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:09.990> to<00:04:10.080> actually<00:04:10.350> count

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
of the phases for it to actually count

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.890 
of the phases for it to actually count
up<00:04:10.800> or<00:04:11.010> down<00:04:11.160> you<00:04:11.880> can<00:04:12.030> also<00:04:12.180> configure<00:04:12.660> this

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
up or down you can also configure this

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.830 
up or down you can also configure this
chip<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.350> count<00:04:13.620> 2x<00:04:14.160> or<00:04:14.340> 4x<00:04:14.570> so<00:04:15.570> that<00:04:15.720> the

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
chip to count 2x or 4x so that the

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.390 
chip to count 2x or 4x so that the
counter<00:04:16.200> will<00:04:16.350> change<00:04:16.620> for<00:04:16.920> every<00:04:17.160> single

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
counter will change for every single

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.150 
counter will change for every single
state<00:04:17.790> transition<00:04:18.450> but<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:19.290> found<00:04:19.859> that<00:04:19.950> it<00:04:20.070> was

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
state transition but I found that it was

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.490 
state transition but I found that it was
actually<00:04:20.459> too<00:04:20.640> quick<00:04:20.970> and<00:04:21.239> I<00:04:21.330> didn't<00:04:22.260> need

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
actually too quick and I didn't need

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.930 
actually too quick and I didn't need
that<00:04:22.530> much<00:04:22.710> speed<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.250> was<00:04:23.460> actually<00:04:23.640> more

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
that much speed I was actually more

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.760 
that much speed I was actually more
interested<00:04:24.300> in<00:04:24.390> accuracy

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
interested in accuracy

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.439 
interested in accuracy
so<00:04:25.860> for<00:04:26.129> one<00:04:26.310> turn<00:04:26.580> of<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.819> knob<00:04:26.970> I<00:04:27.210> think<00:04:27.389> you

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
so for one turn of the knob I think you

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:29.869 
so for one turn of the knob I think you
get<00:04:27.599> about<00:04:27.810> one<00:04:28.110> turn<00:04:28.440> of<00:04:28.470> about<00:04:29.400> put<00:04:29.669> the<00:04:29.789> way

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:29.879 
get about one turn of about put the way

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:34.460 
get about one turn of about put the way
I<00:04:29.910> have<00:04:30.150> this<00:04:30.300> set<00:04:30.539> up<00:04:30.690> now<00:04:32.900> so<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.020> up/down

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
I have this set up now so the up/down

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.589 
I have this set up now so the up/down
counting<00:04:35.039> out<00:04:35.220> of<00:04:35.340> this<00:04:35.460> Avago<00:04:35.909> chip<00:04:36.150> triggers

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
counting out of this Avago chip triggers

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:40.850 
counting out of this Avago chip triggers
this<00:04:37.340> ELab<00:04:38.340> digital<00:04:39.060> stepper<00:04:40.020> motor<00:04:40.319> control

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
this ELab digital stepper motor control

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.040 
this ELab digital stepper motor control
I<00:04:40.889> see<00:04:41.400> I<00:04:41.639> really<00:04:42.360> could<00:04:42.509> have<00:04:42.539> done<00:04:42.780> this<00:04:42.870> with

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
I see I really could have done this with

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.570 
I see I really could have done this with
a<00:04:43.080> lot<00:04:43.289> of<00:04:43.409> other<00:04:43.560> things<00:04:43.860> even<00:04:44.069> discrete

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
a lot of other things even discrete

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.279 
a lot of other things even discrete
logic<00:04:44.759> components<00:04:45.479> but<00:04:45.599> I<00:04:45.659> had<00:04:45.840> this<00:04:45.990> chip

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
logic components but I had this chip

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.020 
logic components but I had this chip
laying<00:04:46.560> around<00:04:46.740> in<00:04:47.009> my<00:04:47.129> box<00:04:47.400> and<00:04:47.669> I<00:04:47.759> wanted<00:04:47.970> to

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
laying around in my box and I wanted to

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.189 
laying around in my box and I wanted to
use<00:04:48.270> it<00:04:48.449> so<00:04:49.319> this<00:04:49.470> thing<00:04:49.680> just<00:04:49.860> keeps<00:04:50.069> track<00:04:50.370> of

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:51.199 
use it so this thing just keeps track of

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.649 
use it so this thing just keeps track of
the<00:04:52.199> phase<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:53.190> correct<00:04:53.490> phases<00:04:54.389> for<00:04:54.539> the

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
the phase the correct phases for the

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:56.059 
the phase the correct phases for the
stepper<00:04:54.930> motor<00:04:55.020> so<00:04:55.470> all<00:04:55.530> you<00:04:55.650> have<00:04:55.740> to<00:04:55.800> do<00:04:55.919> is

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069 
stepper motor so all you have to do is

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:58.370 
stepper motor so all you have to do is
tell<00:04:56.280> this<00:04:56.430> thing<00:04:56.639> up<00:04:56.879> or<00:04:57.030> down<00:04:57.240> and<00:04:57.599> it<00:04:58.229> will

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
tell this thing up or down and it will

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.960 
tell this thing up or down and it will
keep<00:04:58.560> track<00:04:58.620> of<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:59.039> phases<00:04:59.490> of<00:04:59.520> the<00:04:59.639> stepper

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
keep track of the phases of the stepper

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.899 
keep track of the phases of the stepper
motor<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.740> it<00:05:01.740> just<00:05:01.919> handles<00:05:02.280> that<00:05:02.430> bit<00:05:02.729> and

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:02.909 
motor and it just handles that bit and

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:05.719 
motor and it just handles that bit and
then<00:05:03.659> for<00:05:03.870> the<00:05:03.960> actual<00:05:04.110> motor<00:05:04.860> driving<00:05:05.280> I<00:05:05.520> just

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729 
then for the actual motor driving I just

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.960 
then for the actual motor driving I just
have<00:05:06.080> little<00:05:07.080> NPN<00:05:07.650> transistors<00:05:08.340> probably<00:05:08.729> 20

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
have little NPN transistors probably 20

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.180 
have little NPN transistors probably 20
to<00:05:09.120> 22<00:05:09.659> s<00:05:09.720> to<00:05:10.050> actually<00:05:10.440> handle<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:10.860> the

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
to 22 s to actually handle the the

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.480 
to 22 s to actually handle the the
winding<00:05:11.699> voltage<00:05:12.120> and<00:05:12.530> this<00:05:13.530> chip<00:05:13.800> is<00:05:14.009> just<00:05:14.400> a

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
winding voltage and this chip is just a

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.480 
winding voltage and this chip is just a
5:58<00:05:15.210> timer<00:05:15.539> which<00:05:16.289> provides<00:05:16.710> a<00:05:16.949> clock<00:05:17.219> signal

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
5:58 timer which provides a clock signal

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.270 
5:58 timer which provides a clock signal
for<00:05:17.819> the<00:05:17.909> Avago<00:05:18.389> but<00:05:19.349> the<00:05:19.530> clock<00:05:19.770> is<00:05:19.979> really

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
for the Avago but the clock is really

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.719 
for the Avago but the clock is really
not<00:05:20.400> important<00:05:20.940> all<00:05:21.060> it's<00:05:21.240> there<00:05:21.449> for<00:05:21.750> is<00:05:21.930> to

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
not important all it's there for is to

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.129 
not important all it's there for is to
give<00:05:23.729> the<00:05:23.879> chip<00:05:24.120> something<00:05:24.389> to<00:05:24.629> trigger<00:05:24.930> on

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
give the chip something to trigger on

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.420 
give the chip something to trigger on
but<00:05:25.319> the<00:05:25.440> speed<00:05:25.680> of<00:05:25.710> the<00:05:25.919> clock<00:05:26.129> doesn't

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
but the speed of the clock doesn't

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.890 
but the speed of the clock doesn't
matter<00:05:26.699> it<00:05:27.060> doesn't<00:05:27.090> even<00:05:27.389> matter<00:05:27.599> if<00:05:27.780> it

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
matter it doesn't even matter if it

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.779 
matter it doesn't even matter if it
drifts<00:05:28.289> a<00:05:28.379> lot<00:05:28.560> especially<00:05:29.099> for<00:05:29.669> this

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
drifts a lot especially for this

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:31.790 
drifts a lot especially for this
application<00:05:29.969> since<00:05:30.719> this<00:05:30.870> is<00:05:31.020> a<00:05:31.050> very<00:05:31.469> very

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
application since this is a very very

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:37.459 
application since this is a very very
low<00:05:32.520> speed<00:05:32.940> application<00:05:35.900> so<00:05:36.900> I<00:05:36.930> was<00:05:37.199> totally

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
low speed application so I was totally

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:40.430 
low speed application so I was totally
wrong<00:05:37.800> about<00:05:37.860> the<00:05:38.430> one<00:05:39.240> to<00:05:39.389> one<00:05:39.569> control<00:05:40.050> ratio

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
wrong about the one to one control ratio

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.670 
wrong about the one to one control ratio
it<00:05:40.560> actually<00:05:40.919> turns<00:05:41.130> out<00:05:41.370> that<00:05:42.199> one<00:05:43.199> turn<00:05:43.469> is

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
it actually turns out that one turn is

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.860 
it actually turns out that one turn is
only<00:05:43.830> about<00:05:44.099> a<00:05:44.159> quarter<00:05:44.580> of<00:05:44.759> the<00:05:45.180> actual<00:05:45.599> focus

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
only about a quarter of the actual focus

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.580 
only about a quarter of the actual focus
range<00:05:46.469> and<00:05:46.860> so<00:05:47.419> you<00:05:48.419> know<00:05:48.539> it's<00:05:48.719> to<00:05:49.020> pretend

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
range and so you know it's to pretend

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.050 
range and so you know it's to pretend
this<00:05:49.680> is<00:05:49.800> like<00:05:49.979> straight<00:05:50.250> up<00:05:50.460> and<00:05:50.639> down<00:05:50.699> with

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
this is like straight up and down with

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:57.019 
this is like straight up and down with
this<00:05:51.210> knob<00:05:51.449> here<00:05:54.110> okay<00:05:55.110> so<00:05:56.009> if<00:05:56.190> I<00:05:56.310> if<00:05:56.490> I<00:05:56.669> slowly

00:05:57.019 --> 00:05:57.029 
this knob here okay so if I if I slowly

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:00.230 
this knob here okay so if I if I slowly
turn<00:05:57.449> the<00:05:58.159> control<00:05:59.159> knob<00:05:59.190> all<00:05:59.699> the<00:05:59.729> way<00:05:59.880> around

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
turn the control knob all the way around

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.820 
turn the control knob all the way around
once<00:06:00.599> we've<00:06:00.840> really<00:06:01.110> really<00:06:01.349> got<00:06:01.560> about<00:06:01.770> a

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
once we've really really got about a

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.820 
once we've really really got about a
quarter<00:06:02.250> rotation<00:06:04.789> felt<00:06:05.789> like<00:06:06.000> that<00:06:06.830> so

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
quarter rotation felt like that so

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.890 
quarter rotation felt like that so
that's<00:06:07.919> fine<00:06:08.669> I<00:06:08.699> mean<00:06:09.029> it<00:06:09.150> like<00:06:09.300> you<00:06:09.389> say<00:06:09.569> when

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
that's fine I mean it like you say when

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.570 
that's fine I mean it like you say when
you<00:06:09.990> get<00:06:10.110> down<00:06:10.259> to<00:06:10.319> using<00:06:10.710> this<00:06:10.830> remote<00:06:11.039> focus

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
you get down to using this remote focus

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.339 
you get down to using this remote focus
control<00:06:11.909> it's<00:06:12.180> really<00:06:12.569> for<00:06:12.750> very<00:06:13.020> fine

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:13.349 
control it's really for very fine

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:16.700 
control it's really for very fine
adjustments<00:06:14.990> one<00:06:15.990> thing<00:06:16.169> I've<00:06:16.289> noticed<00:06:16.440> is

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
adjustments one thing I've noticed is

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.930 
adjustments one thing I've noticed is
that<00:06:16.740> it<00:06:16.949> doesn't<00:06:17.250> switch<00:06:17.520> directions

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
that it doesn't switch directions

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.350 
that it doesn't switch directions
particularly<00:06:18.870> well<00:06:19.050> so<00:06:19.349> it<00:06:20.099> it<00:06:20.729> tracks<00:06:21.150> very

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
particularly well so it it tracks very

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.230 
particularly well so it it tracks very
smoothly<00:06:21.930> if<00:06:22.710> you<00:06:23.130> stand<00:06:23.430> in<00:06:23.729> one<00:06:24.029> direction

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
smoothly if you stand in one direction

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.480 
smoothly if you stand in one direction
it's<00:06:24.750> really<00:06:25.050> quite<00:06:25.289> nice<00:06:25.500> and<00:06:25.770> smooth<00:06:26.039> you

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
it's really quite nice and smooth you

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.550 
it's really quite nice and smooth you
can<00:06:26.520> even<00:06:26.849> you<00:06:27.060> can<00:06:27.180> see<00:06:27.419> the<00:06:27.569> actual<00:06:27.960> steps<00:06:28.319> of

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 
can even you can see the actual steps of

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.999 
can even you can see the actual steps of
the<00:06:28.710> motor<00:06:28.919> going<00:06:29.310> by<00:06:29.520> there<00:06:29.789> and<00:06:31.009> that's

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:32.009 
the motor going by there and that's

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.310 
the motor going by there and that's
that's<00:06:32.370> definitely<00:06:33.029> fine<00:06:33.300> enough<00:06:33.569> for<00:06:33.779> focus

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
that's definitely fine enough for focus

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.320 
that's definitely fine enough for focus
control<00:06:34.649> on<00:06:34.860> this<00:06:35.009> telescope

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
control on this telescope

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.770 
control on this telescope
but<00:06:36.659> when<00:06:36.810> you<00:06:36.900> start<00:06:37.289> going<00:06:37.379> back<00:06:37.530> and<00:06:37.949> forth

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
but when you start going back and forth

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.809 
but when you start going back and forth
sometimes<00:06:39.780> the<00:06:40.710> behavior<00:06:41.189> is<00:06:41.340> not<00:06:41.520> quite<00:06:41.789> so

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:41.819 
sometimes the behavior is not quite so

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:43.580 
sometimes the behavior is not quite so
good<00:06:42.240> all<00:06:42.419> it<00:06:42.539> does<00:06:42.689> can<00:06:42.930> be<00:06:42.960> tracking<00:06:43.289> pretty

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:43.590 
good all it does can be tracking pretty

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:47.839 
good all it does can be tracking pretty
nicely<00:06:43.919> now<00:06:45.830> anyway<00:06:46.830> I<00:06:46.860> get<00:06:47.189> to<00:06:47.310> try<00:06:47.520> this<00:06:47.580> out

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:47.849 
nicely now anyway I get to try this out

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:50.770 
nicely now anyway I get to try this out
on<00:06:48.030> an<00:06:48.150> actual<00:06:48.830> telescope<00:06:49.830> viewing<00:06:50.039> night<00:06:50.370> so

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:50.780 
on an actual telescope viewing night so

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.620 
on an actual telescope viewing night so
next<00:06:51.780> video<00:06:52.050> will<00:06:52.259> be<00:06:52.289> that
