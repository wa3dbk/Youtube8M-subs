here it is

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.520 
here it is
size-wise<00:00:43.280> compared<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.930> the<00:00:45.930> X<00:00:46.860> 3<00:00:48.350> you<00:00:49.350> can

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
size-wise compared to the X 3 you can

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.740 
size-wise compared to the X 3 you can

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
see similar sort of size as the x3

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.040 
see similar sort of size as the x3
slightly<00:00:54.750> thicker<00:00:55.110> or<00:00:55.559> wider<00:00:55.800> at<00:00:56.370> least<00:00:57.050> and

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
slightly thicker or wider at least and

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.130 
slightly thicker or wider at least and
will<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.739> able<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.039> pair<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.370> course<00:00:59.609> closer<00:01:00.140> as

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
will be able to pair of course closer as

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.549 
will be able to pair of course closer as
well<00:01:01.530> something<00:01:02.280> that's<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.670> one<00:01:02.820> side<00:01:03.559> okay

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
well something that's on one side okay

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.760 
well something that's on one side okay
so<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.280> obviously<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.909> its<00:01:06.770> silicone

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
so this is obviously in its silicone

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.530 
so this is obviously in its silicone
skin<00:01:09.290> which<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.950> very<00:01:11.700> useful<00:01:11.909> addition

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
skin which is a very useful addition

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.560 
skin which is a very useful addition

have mentioned before that part here

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.350 
have mentioned before that part here
perhaps<00:04:28.960> may<00:04:29.560> not<00:04:29.770> be<00:04:29.980> batt<00:04:30.220> metal<00:04:30.580> and<00:04:31.000> it's

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
perhaps may not be batt metal and it's

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.680 
perhaps may not be batt metal and it's
actually<00:04:31.690> plastic<00:04:32.310> but<00:04:33.310> all<00:04:33.880> around<00:04:34.120> the<00:04:34.450> size

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
actually plastic but all around the size

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.390 
actually plastic but all around the size
here<00:04:35.170> is<00:04:35.350> like<00:04:36.190> a<00:04:36.220> brushed<00:04:36.610> aluminium<00:04:36.790> feel<00:04:38.400> so

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
here is like a brushed aluminium feel so

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.300 
here is like a brushed aluminium feel so
it's<00:04:39.520> got<00:04:39.670> some<00:04:39.700> good<00:04:39.910> solid<00:04:40.210> weight<00:04:40.360> to<00:04:40.540> it

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
it's got some good solid weight to it

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.340 
it's got some good solid weight to it
comparing<00:04:42.310> this<00:04:42.460> with<00:04:42.760> the<00:04:43.500> vo<00:04:44.910> x3<00:04:46.140> you<00:04:47.140> can

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
comparing this with the vo x3 you can

00:04:47.350 --> 00:05:27.970 
comparing this with the vo x3 you can
see<00:04:48.840> at<00:04:49.840> startup<00:04:50.740> time<00:04:51.960> pretty<00:04:52.960> decent<00:04:53.440> okay

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.310
