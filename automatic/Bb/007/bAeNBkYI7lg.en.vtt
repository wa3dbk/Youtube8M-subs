00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.970 
like just the fact that somebody else is
judging<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:35.310> person<00:01:35.730> one<00:01:36.410> woman<00:01:37.410> loved<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.800> I

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
judging the person one woman loved it I

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.740 
judging the person one woman loved it I
think<00:01:38.430> that's<00:01:38.580> this<00:01:38.850> bothersome<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.690> an

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
think that's this bothersome to an

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.630 
think that's this bothersome to an
extent<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.650> also<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.980> guess<00:01:41.160> the<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
extent and also I guess the the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.920 
extent and also I guess the the
time-constrained<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.690> amount<00:01:42.870> of

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
time-constrained that the amount of

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.500 
time-constrained that the amount of
artwork<00:01:43.260> you<00:01:43.290> put<00:01:43.760> and<00:01:44.760> all<00:01:44.910> of<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.390> is

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
artwork you put and all of that it is

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.240 
artwork you put and all of that it is
it's<00:01:46.080> just<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.650> don't<00:01:46.770> think<00:01:47.010> there's<00:01:47.130> any

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
it's just that I don't think there's any

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.790 
it's just that I don't think there's any
other<00:01:47.460> reason<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.410> uncomfortable<00:01:49.410> to

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
other reason it's not uncomfortable to

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.280 
other reason it's not uncomfortable to
watch<00:01:49.980> her<00:01:50.310> with<00:01:50.520> other<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:51.660> not<00:01:51.720> bad<00:01:52.020> why<00:01:52.260> I

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
watch her with other it's not bad why I

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.960 
watch her with other it's not bad why I
said<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.680> profession<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.340> said<00:01:53.610> my<00:01:53.790> head
