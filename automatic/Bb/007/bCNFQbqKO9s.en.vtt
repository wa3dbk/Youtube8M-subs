00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.920
 at the level of the boreal forest one can 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.170
 imagine that it's a huge band 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.330
 green who are using the globe 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.610
 land but south of the Arctic Circle 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.610
 so it is extremely important is 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.000
 33% of the Earth's forest on big at 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.960
 south his anger and his equivalents to 11% 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.029
 the surface of the earth 33% and forests 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.860
 boreal trees make up the forests 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.660
 in environmental terms 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.790
 boreal forest level we can say 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.890
 that there are more than 20 to 100 years of art on 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.110
 talk about spruce we talk about fir 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.940
 malaise of bread and also at the level of 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.940
 hardwood blain of work and transit 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.320
 the boreal forest and a very important 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.579
 in the global ecological cycle 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.010
 since it said it makes an effect 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.950
 of mitigation of big changes 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.750
 climatic conditions and 70% of the boreal forest 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.750
 and a time from an ecological point of view 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:11.990
 over 2.5 million Canadians live 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:14.359
 in the boreal forest 522 communities 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.829
 who live in the forest but do not need 

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:17.899
 forget who we have communities 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.209
 indigenous peoples have been established since 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.499
 long in the boreal forest and those 

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:26.179
 designed for them a living environment 

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:27.679
 extremely important at the 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:30.770
 economic boreal forest 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:33.469
 it's more than 50% 2/3 that cuts in canada 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.380
 this 7000 companies and in 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:37.579
 mainly in communities 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.829
 monoindustrial it is vital for 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.259
 communities in the region it's 400 miners 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:46.849
 in canada so this hobbyist extremely 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:49.189
 important since 1995 

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:51.139
 sustainable forest management and 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.539
 applied generally for canada 

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:56.029
 but with a positive approach and 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.009
 rescue are trying to do it's 

00:01:56.029 --> 00:02:00.829
 mules natural cycles pre 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.439
 industrialists have considered both the 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.349
 harvest and natural losses for 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.750
 make sure that the total of the two friends 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:10.910
 least two executioners than in the period 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.340
 pre-industrial where we were afraid of 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.360
 means of protection 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.220
 since we have again better 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.730
 knowledge and we have tools to 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.320
 research 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.600
 it is to go to the development 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.200
 sustainable forest with an approach 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.580
 ecosystem- wide a great conclusion 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.770
 this approach is that we can 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.860
 to affirm that today the surface 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.150
 covered by forests in 2008 is 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.150
 as important as he says he feels 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.460
 Yes
