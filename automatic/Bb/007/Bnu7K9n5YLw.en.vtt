saying<00:01:17.280> what<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.060> your<00:01:18.240> name<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:19.439> that

saying what is your name and that that

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.289 
saying what is your name and that that
was<00:01:20.159> probably<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.520> main<00:01:20.729> reason<00:01:20.759> why<00:01:21.090> mama

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
was probably the main reason why mama

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.969 
was probably the main reason why mama
knows<00:01:21.450> he<00:01:21.600> doesn't<00:01:21.689> want<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.020> fly<00:01:22.259> that's<00:01:22.799> why

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
knows he doesn't want to fly that's why

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.170 
knows he doesn't want to fly that's why
I'm<00:01:23.070> thinking<00:01:23.430> he<00:01:23.490> doesn't<00:01:23.759> want<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.119> it

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
I'm thinking he doesn't want to and it

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.520 
I'm thinking he doesn't want to and it
was<00:01:24.270> kind<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.479> interesting<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:25.020> he<00:01:25.320> thought

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
was kind of interesting that he thought

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.899 
was kind of interesting that he thought
back<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.040> while<00:01:26.189> he<00:01:26.369> was<00:01:26.460> talking<00:01:26.670> to

was taken on the boat or maybe something

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.800 
was taken on the boat or maybe something

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
of the chapter in my opinion the best

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:10.670 
of the chapter in my opinion the best
part<00:04:09.750> of<00:04:09.810> this<00:04:09.900> chapter<00:04:10.199> and<00:04:10.409> we<00:04:10.500> see<00:04:10.650> this

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
part of this chapter and we see this

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.960 
part of this chapter and we see this
blind<00:04:11.069> man<00:04:11.250> right<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:11.669> he's<00:04:11.759> playing

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970

blind man right and he's playing
roulette<00:04:12.329> I<00:04:12.540> guess<00:04:12.959> these<00:04:13.109> gangsters<00:04:13.620> and

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
roulette I guess these gangsters and

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.439 
roulette I guess these gangsters and
these<00:04:13.859> gangsters<00:04:14.280> are<00:04:14.430> pretty<00:04:14.609> much<00:04:14.699> taking

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
these gangsters are pretty much taking

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.029 
these gangsters are pretty much taking
advantage<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.079> fact<00:04:16.259> that<00:04:16.440> he's<00:04:16.709> blind

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
advantage of the fact that he's blind

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.469 
advantage of the fact that he's blind
and<00:04:17.280> every<00:04:17.639> time<00:04:17.669> that<00:04:17.849> he<00:04:18.090> would<00:04:18.180> win<00:04:18.329> they'd

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
and every time that he would win they'd

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.180 
and every time that he would win they'd
say<00:04:18.659> that<00:04:18.780> he<00:04:18.900> lost<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.470> they<00:04:19.799> say<00:04:19.919> okay<00:04:20.039> you

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
in response this blind man pulls out his

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.800 
in response this blind man pulls out his
sword<00:04:40.920> just<00:04:41.610> a<00:04:41.670> little<00:04:41.970> bit<00:04:42.150> and<00:04:42.270> caused<00:04:42.570> this

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
sword just a little bit and caused this

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.350 
sword just a little bit and caused this
huge<00:04:43.200> like<00:04:44.010> hole<00:04:44.460> in<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.700> floor<00:04:44.940> pretty<00:04:45.180> much

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
huge like hole in the floor pretty much

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.970 
huge like hole in the floor pretty much
i<00:04:45.480> can<00:04:45.630> assume<00:04:45.840> that<00:04:45.900> its<00:04:46.170> gravity<00:04:46.620> related

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
i can assume that its gravity related

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.290 
i can assume that its gravity related
powers<00:04:47.370> i<00:04:47.490> think<00:04:47.700> that's<00:04:47.850> pretty<00:04:48.000> much<00:04:48.180> an

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
powers i think that's pretty much an

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.090 
powers i think that's pretty much an
assumption<00:04:48.600> because<00:04:48.900> we<00:04:49.470> see<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:49.980> know<00:04:50.010> the

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
assumption because we see you know the

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.560 
assumption because we see you know the
guy<00:04:50.310> saying<00:04:50.550> oh<00:04:50.670> it's<00:04:50.850> heavy<00:04:51.000> and<00:04:51.270> then<00:04:51.420> they

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
guy saying oh it's heavy and then they

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.270 
guy saying oh it's heavy and then they
being<00:04:51.840> pushed<00:04:52.050> into<00:04:52.170> the<00:04:52.350> ground<00:04:52.620> so<00:04:53.070> you<00:04:53.100> can

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
being pushed into the ground so you can

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.040 
being pushed into the ground so you can
assume<00:04:53.580> that<00:04:53.610> gravity<00:04:54.150> powers<00:04:54.300> this<00:04:54.750> is<00:04:54.900> what

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
assume that gravity powers this is what

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.540 
assume that gravity powers this is what
gravity<00:04:55.230> powers<00:04:55.470> are<00:04:55.740> and<00:04:55.830> i<00:04:55.890> was<00:04:55.980> waiting<00:04:56.370> for

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
gravity powers are and i was waiting for

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.430 
gravity powers are and i was waiting for
a<00:04:56.580> character<00:04:56.910> with<00:04:57.000> gravity<00:04:57.420> powers<00:04:57.570> I<00:04:57.900> really

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
a character with gravity powers I really

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.350 
a character with gravity powers I really
was<00:04:58.620> so<00:04:58.860> really<00:04:59.490> awesome<00:04:59.850> this<00:04:59.940> guy<00:05:00.030> causes

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
was so really awesome this guy causes

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.730 
was so really awesome this guy causes
this<00:05:00.450> huge<00:05:00.810> hole<00:05:01.080> in<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.290> floor<00:05:01.500> I<00:05:01.530> mean

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
this huge hole in the floor I mean

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.040 
this huge hole in the floor I mean
massive<00:05:02.280> hole<00:05:02.610> and<00:05:02.820> you<00:05:03.510> know<00:05:03.720> that's<00:05:03.930> pretty

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
massive hole and you know that's pretty

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.440 
massive hole and you know that's pretty
much<00:05:04.290> where<00:05:04.560> the<00:05:04.650> chapter<00:05:05.070> ends<00:05:05.280> now<00:05:06.030> people

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
much where the chapter ends now people

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.760 
much where the chapter ends now people
are<00:05:06.480> gonna<00:05:06.600> speculate<00:05:06.960> about<00:05:07.200> this<00:05:07.470> character

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
are gonna speculate about this character

arc<00:05:40.770> I'm<00:05:41.250> guessing<00:05:41.970> possibly<00:05:42.450> he's<00:05:42.570> gonna<00:05:42.690> be

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
arc I'm guessing possibly he's gonna be

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.480 
arc I'm guessing possibly he's gonna be
the<00:05:42.990> friend<00:05:43.260> that<00:05:43.380> you<00:05:43.800> know<00:05:43.860> the<00:05:44.010> trots<00:05:44.250> meet

the friend that you know the trots meet

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.520 
the friend that you know the trots meet
in<00:05:44.669> every<00:05:44.970> arc<00:05:45.150> and<00:05:45.300> they<00:05:45.419> help<00:05:45.630> out<00:05:45.780> that's<00:05:46.320> my

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
in every arc and they help out that's my

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.680 
in every arc and they help out that's my
guess<00:05:46.590> or<00:05:47.070> possibly<00:05:47.520> could<00:05:48.090> be<00:05:48.210> the<00:05:48.330> Admiral

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
guess or possibly could be the Admiral

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.630 
guess or possibly could be the Admiral
who's<00:05:48.780> chasing<00:05:49.140> after<00:05:49.260> Luffy<00:05:49.770> that's<00:05:50.280> also<00:05:50.490> a

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
who's chasing after Luffy that's also a

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.100 
who's chasing after Luffy that's also a
possibility<00:05:50.700> but<00:05:51.300> then<00:05:51.450> again<00:05:51.570> his<00:05:51.900> name<00:05:51.930> is

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
possibility but then again his name is

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.290 
possibility but then again his name is
purple<00:05:52.560> tiger<00:05:52.890> so<00:05:53.130> his<00:05:53.580> name<00:05:53.820> doesn't<00:05:54.030> match

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
purple tiger so his name doesn't match

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.480 
purple tiger so his name doesn't match
anything<00:05:54.840> purple<00:05:55.140> related<00:05:55.650> so<00:05:55.830> I<00:05:56.160> don't<00:05:56.340> see

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
anything purple related so I don't see

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.640 
anything purple related so I don't see
how<00:05:56.610> that<00:05:56.790> would<00:05:56.880> exactly<00:05:57.330> match<00:05:57.570> up<00:05:57.840> but<00:05:58.500> then

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
how that would exactly match up but then

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.080 
how that would exactly match up but then
again<00:05:58.680> who<00:05:59.010> knows<00:05:59.040> guys<00:05:59.460> I<00:05:59.580> can't<00:05:59.760> wait<00:05:59.880> to<00:05:59.970> see
