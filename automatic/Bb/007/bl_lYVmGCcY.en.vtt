when am soil's 20 w 50 motorcycle oil

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.630 
when am soil's 20 w 50 motorcycle oil
could<00:00:40.730> fail<00:00:41.739> in<00:00:42.739> order<00:00:42.860> to<00:00:43.010> test<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:43.370> limits

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
could fail in order to test the limits

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.310 
could fail in order to test the limits
of<00:00:43.700> Amazon's<00:00:44.180> motorcycle<00:00:44.750> oil<00:00:44.870> we<00:00:45.020> needed<00:00:45.230> the

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
of Amazon's motorcycle oil we needed the

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.770 
of Amazon's motorcycle oil we needed the
engine<00:00:45.590> hot<00:00:45.800> so<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.670> first<00:00:46.910> step<00:00:47.090> is<00:00:47.480> to

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
engine hot so the first step is to

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.030 
engine hot so the first step is to
eliminate<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:48.230> air<00:00:48.379> moving<00:00:48.680> across<00:00:48.860> the

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
eliminate the air moving across the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.040 
eliminate the air moving across the
cooling<00:00:49.489> fins<00:00:49.640> these<00:00:50.300> engines<00:00:50.750> are<00:00:50.870> air

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
cooling fins these engines are air

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.840 
cooling fins these engines are air
cooled<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:51.950> things<00:00:52.190> heat<00:00:52.370> it<00:00:52.489> up<00:00:52.550> extremely

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
cooled so things heat it up extremely

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:53.410 
cooled so things heat it up extremely
quickly

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
quickly

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.329 
quickly
next<00:00:54.410> we<00:00:54.530> disconnected<00:00:55.010> all<00:00:55.160> of<00:00:55.280> the

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
next we disconnected all of the

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:56.979 
next we disconnected all of the
temperature<00:00:55.760> safeguards<00:00:56.390> that<00:00:56.870> would

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
temperature safeguards that would

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.170 
temperature safeguards that would
normally<00:00:57.230> protect<00:00:58.129> this<00:00:58.339> engine<00:00:58.850> in<00:00:59.000> the

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
normally protect this engine in the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.750 
normally protect this engine in the
event<00:00:59.420> somebody<00:00:59.750> tried<00:00:59.989> to<00:01:00.019> overheat<00:01:00.559> it<00:01:00.760> we

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
event somebody tried to overheat it we

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.310 
event somebody tried to overheat it we
attached<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.300> number<00:01:02.449> of<00:01:02.690> sensors<00:01:02.930> all<00:01:03.260> over

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
attached a number of sensors all over

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.810 
attached a number of sensors all over
this<00:01:03.739> bike<00:01:03.980> everything<00:01:04.460> from<00:01:04.640> oil

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
this bike everything from oil

gas<00:01:07.370> temperature<00:01:07.850> right<00:01:08.030> down<00:01:08.210> to<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.480> RPM<00:01:08.930> we

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
gas temperature right down to the RPM we

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.860 
gas temperature right down to the RPM we
even<00:01:09.920> set<00:01:10.220> up<00:01:10.250> a<00:01:10.430> heat<00:01:10.640> mapping<00:01:11.030> camera<00:01:11.240> so<00:01:11.780> we

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
even set up a heat mapping camera so we

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.110 
even set up a heat mapping camera so we
could<00:01:12.020> truly<00:01:12.290> watch<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:12.979> heat<00:01:13.250> unfold<00:01:13.850> in

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
could truly watch the heat unfold in

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.670 
could truly watch the heat unfold in
real<00:01:14.420> time<00:01:16.240> we<00:01:17.240> program<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.750> dyno<00:01:17.990> to

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
real time we program the dyno to

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.260 
real time we program the dyno to
simulate<00:01:18.920> conditions<00:01:19.280> that<00:01:19.729> you<00:01:19.850> would<00:01:20.000> see

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
simulate conditions that you would see

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.780 
simulate conditions that you would see
maybe<00:01:21.050> at<00:01:21.229> a<00:01:21.260> motorcycle<00:01:21.590> rally<00:01:22.040> where<00:01:22.580> there

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
maybe at a motorcycle rally where there

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.730 
maybe at a motorcycle rally where there
were<00:01:22.909> periods<00:01:23.330> of<00:01:23.570> extended<00:01:24.170> idling

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
were periods of extended idling

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.670 
were periods of extended idling
extremely<00:01:25.670> slow<00:01:25.969> driving<00:01:26.390> remember<00:01:27.079> we<00:01:27.469> took

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
extremely slow driving remember we took

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.050 
extremely slow driving remember we took
all<00:01:27.860> of<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.070> air<00:01:28.189> cooling<00:01:28.520> away<00:01:28.729> from<00:01:28.939> this

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
all of the air cooling away from this

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.850 
all of the air cooling away from this
engine<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:29.840> it<00:01:29.930> wasn't<00:01:30.229> long<00:01:30.380> before<00:01:30.439> we

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
engine so it wasn't long before we

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.940 
engine so it wasn't long before we
started<00:01:30.979> seeing<00:01:31.549> some<00:01:31.729> extreme<00:01:32.090> temperatures

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
started seeing some extreme temperatures

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.889 
started seeing some extreme temperatures
the<00:01:33.950> temperatures<00:01:34.340> began<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:34.850> rise<00:01:35.090> extremely

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
the temperatures began to rise extremely

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.170 
the temperatures began to rise extremely
quickly<00:01:36.170> in<00:01:36.500> this<00:01:37.460> shot<00:01:37.729> from<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.030> heat

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
quickly in this shot from the heat

quickly in this shot from the heat
imaging<00:01:38.570> camera<00:01:38.960> you<00:01:39.530> can<00:01:39.710> see<00:01:39.920> that<00:01:40.070> the

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
imaging camera you can see that the

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.950 
imaging camera you can see that the

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
the lower head region were 430 degrees

the lower head region were 430 degrees

even<00:04:25.950> though<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.250> oil<00:04:26.280> was<00:04:26.970> at<00:04:27.120> extremely

even though the oil was at extremely

even though the oil was at extremely

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
so what were the results we found that

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.860 
so what were the results we found that
even<00:04:38.440> after<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:38.800> extreme<00:04:39.190> heat<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:40.360> cycling

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
even after the extreme heat the cycling

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.460 
even after the extreme heat the cycling
up<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.139> down<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:42.130> oil<00:04:42.160> held<00:04:42.610> up<00:04:42.760> so<00:04:43.000> well<00:04:43.470> that

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
up and down the oil held up so well that

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.870 
up and down the oil held up so well that
you<00:04:44.560> could<00:04:44.680> put<00:04:44.830> it<00:04:44.919> back<00:04:45.040> in<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.310> motorcycle

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
you could put it back in the motorcycle

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.340 
you could put it back in the motorcycle
for<00:04:46.030> continued<00:04:46.419> use

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350
