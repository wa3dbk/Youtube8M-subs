 Thank you for your presence It is good to know that 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.510

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:29.140
 exercising a public office but herself

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:36.660
 children's fantasy and you can not 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.310
 full 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:43.870
 although you look much more like a sheep 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.940
 black dog which seriously is a country that 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.620
 he is an animal as mayor 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:51.160
 Sarney was standing at the right 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.350
 so you think you're fit for the 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.000

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.440

 so the boats out there mean hearsay 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.490
 I do not know if it's scattered about your 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:09.940
 opponents but are saying that you 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:12.490
 It smells like a semi strip and I've stopped for a long time. 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:15.100
 time in the second to very long even 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.560
 so far is a tradition with 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.090
 American politics is a tradition that 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.060
 always have an American politician 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:25.680
 involved in some sexual scandal you 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.680
 already involved in a sex scandal 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.570
 catch 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:41.110
 handle will warm the front the substitute 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:45.180
 the play is a real politician always 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.180
 corruption
