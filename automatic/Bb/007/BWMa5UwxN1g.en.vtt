00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
it's cool you know having having it on

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.410 
it's cool you know having having it on
the<00:00:47.399> street<00:00:47.699> there's<00:00:48.000> always<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.239> bit<00:00:48.390> more

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the street there's always a bit more

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.290 
the street there's always a bit more
atmosphere<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.110> know<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.610> around<00:00:50.610> amongst

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
atmosphere you know in around amongst

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.960 
atmosphere you know in around amongst
the<00:00:51.390> buildings<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:53.129> seems<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.430> echo<00:00:53.610> off

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
the buildings and it seems to echo off

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.090 
the buildings and it seems to echo off
off<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.300> walls<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.809> bit<00:00:54.960> better<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.440> for<00:00:55.650> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
off the walls a bit better so for the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.090 
off the walls a bit better so for the
noise<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.790> pretty<00:00:57.000> good<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.710> the<00:00:58.710> circuits

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
noise it's pretty good and the circuits

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.549 
noise it's pretty good and the circuits
bumpy<00:00:59.519> and<00:00:59.670> for<00:01:00.480> me<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.600> always<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:01.110> it's<00:01:01.440> got

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
bumpy and for me I always like it's got

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.740 
bumpy and for me I always like it's got
a<00:01:01.589> bit<00:01:01.710> more<00:01:01.829> character<00:01:02.159> so<00:01:02.489> there's<00:01:03.329> no<00:01:03.479> no

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
a bit more character so there's no no

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.539 
a bit more character so there's no no
better<00:01:03.960> way<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.830> these

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
better way to have it in these

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.130 
better way to have it in these
circumstances<00:01:05.970> for<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.600> young<00:01:06.720> kids<00:01:06.960> to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
circumstances for the young kids to

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.020 
circumstances for the young kids to
really<00:01:07.320> experience<00:01:08.280> yeah<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> mini

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
really experience yeah like a mini

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.039 
really experience yeah like a mini

you know a couple couple lights just
around<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.060> circuit<00:01:15.510> and<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.320> give<00:01:17.100> give

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
around the circuit and just to give give

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.429 
around the circuit and just to give give
the<00:01:17.670> people<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:18.060> look<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.420> then<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.080> know<00:01:19.170> came

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
the people a look and then you know came

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.640 
the people a look and then you know came
came<00:01:20.189> here<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.580> did<00:01:20.909> some<00:01:21.060> donuts<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.720> got

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
came here and did some donuts and got

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.200 
came here and did some donuts and got
lots<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.979> smoke<00:01:23.189> lots<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.820> lots<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.030> smoke

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
lots of smoke lots and lots of smoke

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.399 
lots of smoke lots and lots of smoke
which<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.630> good<00:01:24.810> because<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.110> was<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.290> bit

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
which was good because I was a bit

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.200 
which was good because I was a bit
worried<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:26.130> was<00:01:26.280> raining<00:01:26.640> earlier<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.180> I

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
worried it was raining earlier and I

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.550 
worried it was raining earlier and I
thought<00:01:27.420> maybe<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:27.840> won't<00:01:27.900> get<00:01:28.110> much<00:01:28.290> smoke

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
thought maybe we won't get much smoke

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.520 
thought maybe we won't get much smoke
with<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.799> wet<00:01:29.670> asphalt<00:01:29.850> but<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:31.200> definitely

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
with a wet asphalt but that definitely

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.880 
with a wet asphalt but that definitely
wasn't<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.979> case<00:01:32.540> yeah<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.900> mean<00:01:34.110> after<00:01:34.259> four

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
wasn't the case yeah I mean after four

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.950 
wasn't the case yeah I mean after four
races<00:01:35.250> now<00:01:35.369> with<00:01:35.730> HRT<00:01:36.090> I'm<00:01:36.360> starting<00:01:36.930> to

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
races now with HRT I'm starting to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.649 
races now with HRT I'm starting to
develop<00:01:37.830> myself<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.909> know<00:01:39.030> with<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.300> team<00:01:39.480> as

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
develop myself you know with the team as

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.080 
develop myself you know with the team as
well<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.870> bit<00:01:40.170> more<00:01:40.460> getting<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.520> bit<00:01:41.670> more<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.909> an

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
well a bit more getting a bit more of an

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.720 
well a bit more getting a bit more of an
input<00:01:43.080> in<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.740> setup<00:01:43.980> on<00:01:44.220> what<00:01:44.340> we<00:01:44.430> need<00:01:44.550> to

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
input in the setup on what we need to

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.850 
input in the setup on what we need to
move<00:01:44.850> forward<00:01:45.240> now<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.200> I've<00:01:46.470> got<00:01:46.680> an

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
move forward now that I've got an

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.649 
move forward now that I've got an
understanding<00:01:47.400> of<00:01:47.460> what<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.700> car<00:01:47.880> does<00:01:48.120> what

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
understanding of what the car does what

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.120 
understanding of what the car does what
it's<00:01:48.810> good<00:01:48.960> at<00:01:48.990> well<00:01:49.260> it's<00:01:49.409> not<00:01:49.530> good<00:01:49.740> at<00:01:49.890> and

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
it's good at well it's not good at and

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.399 
it's good at well it's not good at and
then<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:51.150> think<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.960> know<00:01:52.020> we<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.320> move

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
then I think you know we can move

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.120 
then I think you know we can move
forward<00:01:52.590> from<00:01:52.920> here

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
forward from here

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.000 
forward from here
I'm<00:01:53.720> progressively<00:01:54.720> getting<00:01:54.960> better<00:01:55.080> you

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
I'm progressively getting better you

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.490 
I'm progressively getting better you
know<00:01:56.130> still<00:01:56.430> nowhere<00:01:56.640> near<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.140> limit<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.320> want

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
know still nowhere near the limit I want

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.380 
know still nowhere near the limit I want
to<00:01:58.590> arrive<00:01:58.830> at<00:01:59.040> but<00:01:59.820> I<00:01:59.850> think<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.270> know

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
to arrive at but I think you know

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.080 
to arrive at but I think you know
definitely<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.870> next<00:02:00.960> fuel<00:02:01.729> confidence<00:02:02.729> to

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
definitely the next fuel confidence to

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.810 
definitely the next fuel confidence to
keep<00:02:03.210> pushing<00:02:03.420> forward
