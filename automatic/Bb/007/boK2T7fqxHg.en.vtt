00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello my name is nastya soul this 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.649
 education channel and such a channel 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.599
 know he is not only for adults he 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.330
 rather further even more for children 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.900
 I would like to tell little 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.949
 short simple truths about who is 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.980
 man namely what man when he 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.210
 small how we feel 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.369
 pedagogical skills this is when 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.980
 you feel in all ages and 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.040
 Now we are starting a project that 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.730
 called anti proverb like the lion said 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.370
 thick 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.670
 all the best life things are simple 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.980
 stuff that's actually a lot of people and 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.989
 many educators many adults 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.300
 they say that they are already there 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.010
 survived they have a life experience so 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.309
 This life experience is already 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.680
 repetition of the long-established Russian 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.050
 the wisdom of Russian folk proverbs and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.360
 actually what will happen in this 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.340
 I will read the proverb 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.960
 reveal it i mean speak at all 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.850
 where did this wisdom come from 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.280
 what does it mean but i will say so 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.670
 I think will be able to read at the bottom of the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.290
 how it interprets in principle society and 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.290
 say whether you like it or not 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.950
 below you will find the link ruslan channel here 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.070

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.990
 and can show this video with yours 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.000
 parents or people who are older than you 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.189

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.619
 Ruslana and actually see how 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.329
 he interprets this proverb I want to start 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.880
 such a proverb 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.170
 she is the first 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.979
 on wikipedia that sounds like this 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.970
 way and where else is there and look how I do it 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.460
 generally understand 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.860
 look many children write and say to me 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.560
 the fact that I already finish grade 9 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.600
 i don't know where to go i am now 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.640
 We're doing Institute please tell me in 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.130
 which institute should i do everything very much 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.990
 you just have to remember the moment when 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.030
 your eyes really burned when 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.789
 you really have this heart 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.380
 lay to that activity but some 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.200
 either activity is not necessarily this 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.899
 some profession job it's just that 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.080
 what are you doing with pleasure and this 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.480
 and will be called by some such 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.370
 great schA dreamed it is not necessary 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.830
 money yes for that there money was received 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.930
 once it just you liked that world 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.690
 he tells us that go work 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.489
 managers can tell you a little go 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.750
 financial institution because it 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.730
 harder you need to take a new level but it 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.549
 settled social lies need to go 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.459
 wherever your heart goes try 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:40.069
 just remember the moment when you 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.590
 liked something and return to it and 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.450
 go there own most important thing 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.450
 do not listen to anyone only listen to yourself 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.519
 for a child who is there 10 9 years old you 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.010
 look at your classmate in school 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.200
 and you like the way he dances it's not 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.480
 mean you have to go there because 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.739
 that this boy he is a successful school 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.930
 because he practices there 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.780
 break dance or hip hop you have to 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.549
 understand but you like why you tend to 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.430
 principle understand what you tend to 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.530
 only having tried it is therefore first 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.500
 stage it try on the most 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.170
 and the second stage look from all this 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.660
 because of this, it's all set 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.750
 liked most and liked 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.389
 go there you can not put likes and 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.170
 do repost one thing and probably you 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:29.769

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.630
