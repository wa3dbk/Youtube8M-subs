 hi to all of this guys new 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.040
 video tutorial always here from your 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.200
 nick relation feels good guys 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.990
 today we will see a long video tutorial 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.109
 today an old man because I will lose better 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.240
 how to use the pci bluetooth 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.070
 since the users who have made a 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.430
 lots of questions below and thank you too 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.720
 for views 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.320
 let's start right away first 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.869
 for those who do not know the PC products 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.960
 first of all, make sure you have network 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.140
 because the old operating systems 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.730
 installed yes and will be seeding or to the pc 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.460
 let's say on the train when I'm the icon 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.290
 But neither when friends rarely do not 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.260
 want to cevolo that a little send files 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.989
 they only introduce the icon while the pc 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.210
 same must have them a good product us 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.879
 let's get started right away 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.859
 devotees for two ways to look for it e 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:05.690
 first went to local disk computer c 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:05.690
 windows system32 and here young f squeeze 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:19.910
 then here it is the product of the pc the 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.490
 second method because i windows 7 e 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.930
 go for sure 20 in the bar that too 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:31.070
 oversight go directly to the bar 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:34.730
 of the menu and v write fs swift so as to 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.390
 do it before or that we have already opened it 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:41.120
 here then I know that for windows vista e 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.729
 windows 7 is also for windows 8 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.380
 the procedure is the same but I am not 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.520
 sure for windows for windows xp 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.940
 however the first thing to do is 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.040
 receive a file from one for security purposes 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.810
 product 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.869
 then why the thing we put high school i 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:05.240
 file and waiting for connection 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:07.060
 now we down down say from a 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.890
 external device 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.010
 we send an image by searching 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.690
 with our device 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.330
 with this course with a telephone i am 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.090
 doing research and mandy is about 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.690
 my pc at this moment I admit that it is 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:27.200
 the selection send data the data sent e 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.269
 the dates are sent to the one here now 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.930
 here stopping puffs we can cast 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:37.000
 its direction we put ok and put 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:41.090
 end here is the picture I sent 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.459
 now let's take back our burning e 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.640
 this with regards to receiving 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.130
 the files better to send them low put 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.440
 at this point what happens 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.840
 when we first sent from 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.570
 our device the file let's say that 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.970
 Hung took him to was the 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.100
 recognized computers analyzed it 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.610
 these things unless anyone milano 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.680
 103 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.299
 but we are going to press and put 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.209
 ahead then his to tiers put the 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.989
 file before and let's go ahead 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.340
 here is who will come out this little window 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.230
 then this window what 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.360
 we are going to do practically fell 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.280
 windows 7 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.480
 the hero of sight I have to go to put a 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:29.110
 number for example put three zeros 1 2 3 e 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.150
 4 zeros and put forward 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.120
 add the current device now 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.590
 then up instead in the fumes fingers on the 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.470
 Our devices of the city 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.710
 requests association from pc us 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.740
 we put ourselves and add from ours 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:50.200
 device whose 40 we put 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:52.120
 here 1 2 3 and 4 and I put ok at this point 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.220
 with the equation of the device its 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:02.200
 device installation 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:04.600
 we will see that it will be installed so here 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:08.110
 went here we see that our file 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.120
 is received is sent here makes the 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.200
 device configuration and the 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.760
 search 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.230
 the device has been added to 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.090
 computer 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.640
 warning to protect the paragraph in 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.130
 question are more or less things like 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.710
 that yes device was the mayor 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:28.300
 then if you want you can search 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:31.150
 windows update do the windows search 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.510

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.640
 best with your device 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.720
 well the boys here we can put an end 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:42.460
