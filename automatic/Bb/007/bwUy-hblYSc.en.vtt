00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 the purpose is to show that you could 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.110
 do with those things that are without 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.110
 expedition 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.080
 hi friends today let's see how to do 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.960
 that the water behaves in a way 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.940
 super strange I want to warn you from 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.340
 the principle that this looks like this only in 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.300
 the camera the human eye perceives it from 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.670
 different way 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.890
 even so the experiment is very 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.650
 interesting and at the same time very simple 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.890
 do and I encourage you to try it we are going 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.890
 there 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.800
 the materials that we will need to 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.890
 this experiment are the central part of 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.530
 a home cinema home cinema surround 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.290
 nap or surround sound call it like 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.830
 you want if you do not have one of these you can 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.380
 use a more or less powerful speaker 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.140
 we are also going to need a table a 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.310
 mobile or a portable electric power 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.720
 and finally continuous source of water 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.570
 optionally you can use something to 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.550
 raise the speaker to a higher height in 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.520
 this case I have used an old 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.920
 computer tower 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.350
 first of all let's create the system 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.179
 at 90 degrees so that the speaker 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.930
 main is positioned 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.090
 vertically 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.160
 we launch the application that we 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.680
 will generate the frequencies and 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.620
 we connect the mobile to the speaker the link 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.510
 of the application is in the description 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.880
 the explanation of this phenomenon would be the 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.760
 next the speaker makes the 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.430
 Hose oscillate exactly 30 times per 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.850
 second on the other hand the camera too 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.910
 it takes 30 images per second for this 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.729
 whenever the camera takes a picture the 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.979
 hose is in the same position as 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.470
 this way it seems that the hose is 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.970
 in complete rest and the same thing happens 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.970
 with the water that comes out of it 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.079
 now let's do the experiment yet 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:05.250
 more interesting through the 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.340
 application on the mobile 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.200
 the sound frequency will change 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.110
 gradually from 35 hertz to 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.140
 twenty-five hertz in a period of 30 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.140
 seconds in this way at the beginning the 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.959
 water will be falling down then it 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.890
 will stop and finally start to climb 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.890
 upwards 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.139

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.970
 Now I show you what happens to the 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:04.189
 change the sound power 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.189

 as always I hope this experiment 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.850
 you liked greetings and even the 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.040

 share comments give to like and 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.360
 subscribe but my friends are going to 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.360
 help your house
