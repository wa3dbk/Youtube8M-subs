00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
not have any sort of support so because

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.819 
not have any sort of support so because
the<00:02:03.299> as<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.750> can<00:02:03.869> see<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.200> mouse<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.409> really

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
the as you can see the mouse is really

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.969 
the as you can see the mouse is really
slim<00:02:05.329> a<00:02:06.329> lot<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.780> people<00:02:06.930> have<00:02:07.170> issues<00:02:07.380> with<00:02:07.799> it

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
slim a lot of people have issues with it

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.550 
slim a lot of people have issues with it
because<00:02:08.280> if<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.750> use<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:09.989> Razer<00:02:10.670> Naga<00:02:11.670> molten

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
because if you use the Razer Naga molten

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.100 
because if you use the Razer Naga molten
or<00:02:12.920> if<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:13.190> use<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.400> razer<00:02:13.790> mice<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.599> mouse

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
or if you use the razer mice a mouse

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.729 
or if you use the razer mice a mouse
they<00:02:16.099> are<00:02:16.730> really<00:02:16.910> bulged<00:02:17.599> from<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.380> center

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
they are really bulged from the center

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.390 
they are really bulged from the center
so<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.340> actually<00:02:19.489> supports<00:02:19.849> your<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:21.440> middle

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
so it actually supports your the middle

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.520 
so it actually supports your the middle
of<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.640> pond<00:02:22.849> the<00:02:23.090> center<00:02:23.420> palm<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:24.319> with

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
of the pond the center palm so with

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.900 
of the pond the center palm so with
these<00:02:24.680> mosses<00:02:24.950> you<00:02:25.280> don't<00:02:25.430> have<00:02:25.580> that<00:02:25.700> support

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
these mosses you don't have that support

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.970 
these mosses you don't have that support
but<00:02:26.420> for<00:02:26.630> some<00:02:26.750> reason<00:02:27.050> I<00:02:27.170> really<00:02:27.560> feel<00:02:27.950> that

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
but for some reason I really feel that

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.830 
but for some reason I really feel that
it's<00:02:28.250> nice<00:02:28.520> because<00:02:28.940> it's<00:02:29.209> easy<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.599> carry

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
it's nice because it's easy to carry

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.390 
it's nice because it's easy to carry
around<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.910> it's<00:02:31.910> violence<00:02:32.450> as<00:02:32.569> well<00:02:32.810> and

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
around and it's violence as well and

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.100 
around and it's violence as well and
yeah<00:02:34.400> that's<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.730> reason<00:02:35.060> I<00:02:35.150> just<00:02:35.360> got<00:02:35.569> it<00:02:35.720> so

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
yeah that's the reason I just got it so

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.100 
yeah that's the reason I just got it so
if<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:37.519> are<00:02:37.670> using<00:02:37.819> a<00:02:38.000> macbook<00:02:38.180> air<00:02:38.540> or<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.780> pro

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
if you are using a macbook air or a pro

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.650 
if you are using a macbook air or a pro
and<00:02:39.440> you<00:02:39.860> need<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.250> carry<00:02:40.880> around<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.480> mouse<00:02:41.630> a

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
and you need to carry around the mouse a

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.630 
and you need to carry around the mouse a
light<00:02:42.140> mouth<00:02:42.410> it's<00:02:42.680> extremely<00:02:42.950> light<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:43.489> has

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
light mouth it's extremely light it has

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.820 
light mouth it's extremely light it has
batteries<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.600> comes<00:02:44.900> in<00:02:45.110> with<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.440> batteries

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
batteries it comes in with the batteries

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.850 
batteries it comes in with the batteries
and<00:02:46.209> that's<00:02:47.209> the<00:02:47.420> switch<00:02:47.930> off<00:02:48.170> an<00:02:48.380> on<00:02:48.620> button

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
and that's the switch off an on button

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.090 
and that's the switch off an on button
so<00:02:49.459> you<00:02:49.489> can<00:02:49.819> switch<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.090> on<00:02:50.299> and<00:02:50.330> off<00:02:50.680> just<00:02:51.680> to

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
so you can switch it on and off just to

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.970 
so you can switch it on and off just to
go<00:02:52.280> through<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:53.390> texture<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:54.019> front<00:02:54.290> seems

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
go through the texture the front seems

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.710 
go through the texture the front seems
like<00:02:55.190> a<00:02:55.220> glass<00:02:55.610> texture<00:02:56.209> even<00:02:56.510> though<00:02:56.600> it's

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
like a glass texture even though it's

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.780 
like a glass texture even though it's
plastic<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:59.019> its<00:03:00.019> really<00:03:00.230> streamlined<00:03:00.920> very

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
plastic and its really streamlined very

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.660 
plastic and its really streamlined very
light<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.540> rubber<00:03:02.750> feet<00:03:03.049> we<00:03:03.950> have<00:03:04.069> the<00:03:04.250> sensor

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
light to rubber feet we have the sensor

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.509 
light to rubber feet we have the sensor
I<00:03:04.910> think<00:03:05.810> it's<00:03:05.900> a<00:03:05.989> laser<00:03:06.230> sensor<00:03:06.890> Bluetooth<00:03:07.340> or

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
I think it's a laser sensor Bluetooth or

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.630 
I think it's a laser sensor Bluetooth or
whatever<00:03:07.790> and<00:03:08.030> we<00:03:08.959> have<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.230> LED<00:03:09.640> indicator

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
whatever and we have the LED indicator

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.940 
whatever and we have the LED indicator
that<00:03:10.730> indicates<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.540> battery<00:03:11.900> level<00:03:12.170> as<00:03:12.290> well

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
that indicates the battery level as well

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.830 
that indicates the battery level as well
as<00:03:13.099> the<00:03:13.280> pairing<00:03:13.790> of<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.120> mouse<00:03:14.330> with<00:03:14.660> your

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
as the pairing of the mouse with your

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.050 
as the pairing of the mouse with your
macbook<00:03:15.170> air<00:03:15.380> or<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.650> pro<00:03:16.010> so<00:03:16.790> if<00:03:16.850> you<00:03:16.940> don't

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
macbook air or the pro so if you don't

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.000 
macbook air or the pro so if you don't
pair<00:03:17.329> it<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:17.690> switch<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:18.109> on<00:03:18.260> its<00:03:18.500> going<00:03:18.799> to

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
pair it and switch it on its going to

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.420 
pair it and switch it on its going to
switch<00:03:19.220> itself<00:03:19.609> off<00:03:20.290> or<00:03:21.290> it's<00:03:22.010> going<00:03:22.190> to<00:03:22.250> go<00:03:22.370> to

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
switch itself off or it's going to go to

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.130 
switch itself off or it's going to go to
sleep<00:03:22.670> mode<00:03:22.970> or<00:03:23.120> whatever<00:03:23.359> to<00:03:23.660> conserve<00:03:23.989> the

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
sleep mode or whatever to conserve the

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.140 
sleep mode or whatever to conserve the
battery<00:03:24.410> life<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:25.220> as<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:25.459> can<00:03:25.670> see<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:25.970> most

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
battery life so as you can see the most

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.910 
battery life so as you can see the most
looks<00:03:26.359> really<00:03:26.660> good<00:03:26.810> that's<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.530> box<00:03:27.739> it<00:03:27.890> came

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
looks really good that's the box it came

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.130 
looks really good that's the box it came
in<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.549> magic<00:03:28.880> mouse<00:03:29.060> I'll<00:03:29.720> quickly<00:03:29.959> go

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
in the magic mouse I'll quickly go

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.470 
in the magic mouse I'll quickly go
through<00:03:30.760> so<00:03:31.760> we<00:03:31.880> have<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.180> wireless

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
through so we have the wireless

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.470 
through so we have the wireless
multi-touch<00:03:33.049> mouse<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:34.220> it<00:03:34.850> mentions<00:03:35.269> that

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
multi-touch mouse and it mentions that

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.599 
multi-touch mouse and it mentions that
there's<00:03:36.109> a<00:03:36.200> one<00:03:36.410> button<00:03:36.560> click<00:03:36.950> on<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.220> center

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
there's a one button click on the center

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.009 
there's a one button click on the center
so<00:03:38.239> there's<00:03:38.450> a<00:03:38.510> one<00:03:38.630> button<00:03:38.780> click<00:03:40.750> to<00:03:41.750> button

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
so there's a one button click to button

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.710 
so there's a one button click to button
clicks<00:03:42.290> to<00:03:42.500> right<00:03:42.680> clicks<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:43.569> then<00:03:44.569> the

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
clicks to right clicks and then the

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.590 
clicks to right clicks and then the
whole<00:03:44.870> surface<00:03:45.220> as<00:03:46.220> you<00:03:46.880> can<00:03:47.030> see<00:03:47.239> here<00:03:47.480> is<00:03:47.569> a

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
whole surface as you can see here is a

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.870 
whole surface as you can see here is a
scroll<00:03:48.049> so<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:48.709> can<00:03:48.889> scroll<00:03:49.130> scroll<00:03:49.639> through

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
scroll so you can scroll scroll through

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.059 
scroll so you can scroll scroll through
and<00:03:50.090> then<00:03:50.600> we<00:03:50.750> have<00:03:50.900> the<00:03:51.049> screen<00:03:51.410> zoom<00:03:51.709> as<00:03:51.829> well

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
and then we have the screen zoom as well

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.940 
and then we have the screen zoom as well
so<00:03:52.609> if<00:03:52.819> you<00:03:53.030> move<00:03:53.239> your<00:03:53.389> finger<00:03:53.690> from<00:03:53.950> the

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
so if you move your finger from the

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.970 
so if you move your finger from the

center to the top it actually zooms the
screen<00:03:58.310> so<00:03:58.639> which<00:03:58.790> is<00:03:58.819> really<00:03:59.090> good<00:03:59.329> and<00:03:59.709> we

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
screen so which is really good and we

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.030 
screen so which is really good and we
have<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.160> two<00:04:01.400> finger<00:04:01.670> swipes<00:04:01.940> as<00:04:02.120> well<00:04:02.329> to

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
have the two finger swipes as well to

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.520 
have the two finger swipes as well to
switch<00:04:04.040> between<00:04:04.069> windows<00:04:04.730> or<00:04:05.299> tabs<00:04:05.750> when

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
switch between windows or tabs when

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.160 
switch between windows or tabs when
you're<00:04:06.680> using<00:04:06.889> your<00:04:07.220> desktop<00:04:07.579> or<00:04:07.790> mac<00:04:08.060> OS<00:04:08.359> not

you're using your desktop or mac OS not

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.410 
you're using your desktop or mac OS not
windows<00:04:09.500> but<00:04:09.739> yeah<00:04:10.040> all<00:04:10.220> desktop<00:04:10.639> you<00:04:11.150> can<00:04:11.209> use

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
windows but yeah all desktop you can use

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.050 
windows but yeah all desktop you can use
the<00:04:11.600> two<00:04:11.750> finger<00:04:12.049> swipes<00:04:12.319> as<00:04:12.560> well<00:04:13.030> which<00:04:14.030> is

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
the two finger swipes as well which is

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.940 
the two finger swipes as well which is
the<00:04:14.299> same<00:04:14.510> as<00:04:14.810> your<00:04:15.820> normal<00:04:16.820> mac<00:04:17.150> a<00:04:17.180> trackpad

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
the same as your normal mac a trackpad

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.620 
the same as your normal mac a trackpad
so<00:04:18.950> it<00:04:19.039> functions<00:04:19.280> as<00:04:19.609> a<00:04:19.669> trackpad<00:04:20.000> as<00:04:20.329> well<00:04:20.510> as

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
so it functions as a trackpad as well as

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.990 
so it functions as a trackpad as well as
a<00:04:20.659> mouse<00:04:20.930> which<00:04:21.200> is<00:04:21.349> really<00:04:21.560> good<00:04:21.769> yeah<00:04:22.520> that's

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
a mouse which is really good yeah that's

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.560 
a mouse which is really good yeah that's
the<00:04:23.150> instruction<00:04:23.539> manual<00:04:23.570> that<00:04:24.110> came

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
the instruction manual that came

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.490 
the instruction manual that came
the<00:04:24.660> mouse<00:04:24.840> in<00:04:25.170> the<00:04:25.350> box<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:26.960> it's<00:04:27.960> basically

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
the mouse in the box and it's basically

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.980 
the mouse in the box and it's basically
a<00:04:28.590> quick<00:04:28.800> start<00:04:29.010> guide<00:04:29.450> it<00:04:30.450> tells<00:04:30.690> you<00:04:30.870> to

bedding on/off switches and indicator

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.790 
bedding on/off switches and indicator
like<00:04:38.640> and<00:04:39.740> how<00:04:40.740> to<00:04:40.880> pair<00:04:41.880> it<00:04:41.910> with<00:04:42.330> your<00:04:42.690> mac<00:04:42.870> so

like and how to pair it with your mac so

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.760 
like and how to pair it with your mac so
as<00:04:43.890> you<00:04:44.010> can<00:04:44.130> see<00:04:44.570> if<00:04:45.570> it<00:04:45.780> glows<00:04:45.900> steadily<00:04:46.590> for

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
as you can see if it glows steadily for

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.710 
as you can see if it glows steadily for
five<00:04:46.950> seconds<00:04:47.400> the<00:04:47.550> LED<00:04:47.880> that<00:04:48.180> means<00:04:48.420> the

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
five seconds the LED that means the

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.760 
five seconds the LED that means the
batteries<00:04:49.080> are<00:04:49.200> good<00:04:49.320> and<00:04:51.440> if<00:04:52.440> it<00:04:52.590> isn't

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
batteries are good and if it isn't

00:04:52.770 --> 00:05:00.200 
batteries are good and if it isn't
paired<00:04:53.300> then<00:04:58.010> the<00:04:59.010> light<00:04:59.190> blinks<00:04:59.640> that<00:05:00.030> it's

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
paired then the light blinks that it's

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.110 
paired then the light blinks that it's
in<00:05:00.360> discovery<00:05:00.840> mode<00:05:01.070> so<00:05:02.070> that<00:05:02.100> your<00:05:02.400> Mac<00:05:02.910> can

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
in discovery mode so that your Mac can

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.630 
in discovery mode so that your Mac can
actually<00:05:03.510> connect<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:04.110> communicate<00:05:05.070> with

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
actually connect and communicate with

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.880 
actually connect and communicate with
the<00:05:05.730> mouse<00:05:05.910> and<00:05:06.270> if<00:05:07.080> you<00:05:07.230> don't<00:05:07.380> pair<00:05:07.590> a<00:05:07.620> mouse

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
the mouse and if you don't pair a mouse

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.890 
the mouse and if you don't pair a mouse
for<00:05:07.920> three<00:05:08.430> minutes<00:05:08.640> it<00:05:09.000> turns<00:05:09.360> off<00:05:09.630> to

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
for three minutes it turns off to

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.410 
for three minutes it turns off to
preserve<00:05:10.200> battery<00:05:10.350> life<00:05:10.760> there's<00:05:11.760> a<00:05:11.910> slide<00:05:12.210> on

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
preserve battery life there's a slide on

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.120 
preserve battery life there's a slide on
and<00:05:12.720> off<00:05:12.810> switch<00:05:13.020> which<00:05:13.590> is<00:05:13.740> really<00:05:13.950> good<00:05:14.190> and

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
and off switch which is really good and

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.920 
and off switch which is really good and
when<00:05:17.130> your<00:05:17.280> mouse<00:05:17.460> is<00:05:17.670> on<00:05:17.820> and<00:05:18.120> paired<00:05:18.540> with

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
when your mouse is on and paired with

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.780 
when your mouse is on and paired with
the<00:05:18.960> battery's<00:05:19.410> charged<00:05:19.950> the<00:05:20.250> light<00:05:20.460> glowed

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
the battery's charged the light glowed

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.410 
the battery's charged the light glowed
steadily<00:05:20.970> steadily<00:05:21.780> so<00:05:22.500> that's<00:05:23.400> about<00:05:23.670> it<00:05:23.700> so

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
steadily steadily so that's about it so

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.410 
steadily steadily so that's about it so
again<00:05:25.020> we<00:05:25.230> have<00:05:25.440> the<00:05:25.470> usual<00:05:26.010> bits<00:05:26.460> so<00:05:27.150> if<00:05:27.300> you

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:27.420 
again we have the usual bits so if you

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.230 
again we have the usual bits so if you
are<00:05:27.540> a<00:05:27.570> new<00:05:27.750> user<00:05:28.050> to<00:05:28.560> magic<00:05:28.920> mouse<00:05:29.100> I'm<00:05:29.940> sure

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
are a new user to magic mouse I'm sure

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.400 
are a new user to magic mouse I'm sure
that<00:05:30.420> you<00:05:30.570> are<00:05:30.780> going<00:05:30.990> to<00:05:31.050> read<00:05:31.200> this
