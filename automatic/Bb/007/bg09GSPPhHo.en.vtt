00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
melts a little bit not even completely

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.850 
melts a little bit not even completely
just<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.610> little<00:00:41.790> bit<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.030> we<00:00:42.090> can<00:00:42.180> get<00:00:42.239> some<00:00:42.860> oil

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
just a little bit so we can get some oil

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.790 
just a little bit so we can get some oil
in<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.100> pan<00:00:44.280> but<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.940> always<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.300> do<00:00:45.800> it's

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
in the pan but I always like to do it's

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.840 
in the pan but I always like to do it's
also<00:00:46.950> something<00:00:47.309> else<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.579> need<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.789> to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
also something else you need you to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.400 
also something else you need you to
break<00:00:48.000> into<00:00:48.120> smaller<00:00:48.300> pieces<00:00:48.450> it'll<00:00:49.260> melt

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
break into smaller pieces it'll melt

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.799 
break into smaller pieces it'll melt
faster<00:00:49.620> but<00:00:50.340> what<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.460> always<00:00:50.640> do<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.210> just<00:00:51.690> to

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
faster but what I always do is just to

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.799 
faster but what I always do is just to
give<00:00:51.989> my<00:00:52.230> vegetables<00:00:53.160> or<00:00:53.969> my<00:00:54.059> aromatics<00:00:54.480> or

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
give my vegetables or my aromatics or

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.170 
give my vegetables or my aromatics or
whatever<00:00:55.050> I'm<00:00:55.140> choosing<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.559> do<00:00:55.710> more<00:00:56.430> face

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
whatever I'm choosing to do more face

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.639 
whatever I'm choosing to do more face
time<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.660> pan<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.870> guess<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> good<00:00:58.440> way<00:00:58.620> of

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
time in the pan I guess is a good way of

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.799 
time in the pan I guess is a good way of
putting<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.980> more<00:00:59.160> playtime<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.570> just<00:01:00.719> go

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
putting it more playtime is I just go

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:01.910 
putting it more playtime is I just go
ahead<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:00.960> drop<00:01:01.140> them<00:01:01.260> right<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.530> there<00:01:01.680> while

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
ahead and drop them right in there while

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.320 
ahead and drop them right in there while
the<00:01:01.980> butter<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.280> melting<00:01:03.619> reason<00:01:04.619> being<00:01:05.330> is

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
the butter is melting reason being is

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.289 
the butter is melting reason being is
that<00:01:07.400> this<00:01:08.400> will<00:01:08.580> actually<00:01:08.729> kind<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.180> go

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
that this will actually kind of go

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.580 
that this will actually kind of go
through<00:01:09.330> i<00:01:09.540> sweating<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.200> then<00:01:10.320> cooking

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
through i sweating and then cooking

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.370 
through i sweating and then cooking
stage<00:01:11.270> which<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> which<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:12.900> good<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.260> know

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
stage which is a which is good you know

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.649 
stage which is a which is good you know
it'll<00:01:13.860> soften<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.280> up<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.909> because<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.509> threw

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
it'll soften it up and because you threw

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.850 
it'll soften it up and because you threw
them<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.810> at<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.960> very<00:01:16.140> very<00:01:16.200> end<00:01:16.530> when<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.770> was

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
them in at the very very end when it was

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.350 
them in at the very very end when it was
already<00:01:17.040> hot<00:01:17.310> you'd<00:01:17.670> go<00:01:17.850> pretty<00:01:18.000> much<00:01:18.090> right

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
already hot you'd go pretty much right

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.359 
already hot you'd go pretty much right
into<00:01:18.600> cooking<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.619> probably<00:01:19.799> lose<00:01:20.100> some

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
into cooking and you probably lose some

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.600 
into cooking and you probably lose some
of<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.610> subtleties<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.840> texture<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
of the subtleties of the texture of the

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.910 
of the subtleties of the texture of the
of<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.360> shallot<00:01:24.960> or<00:01:25.140> whatever<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.770> you're

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
of the shallot or whatever it is you're

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.010 
of the shallot or whatever it is you're
cooking<00:01:26.250> because<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.420> would<00:01:27.540> go<00:01:27.630> right<00:01:27.780> into

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
cooking because you would go right into

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.310 
cooking because you would go right into
like<00:01:28.439> high-heat<00:01:28.799> cooking<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.310> not<00:01:29.400> really

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
like high-heat cooking and not really

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.780 
like high-heat cooking and not really
leaching<00:01:31.320> any<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.650> extra<00:01:32.040> flavor<00:01:32.310> out<00:01:32.549> a

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
leaching any of that extra flavor out a

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.200 
leaching any of that extra flavor out a
little<00:01:33.240> bit<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.479> salt<00:01:35.930> touch<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> pepper<00:01:38.210> all

little bit of salt touch a pepper all

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.760 
little bit of salt touch a pepper all
right<00:01:39.299> now<00:01:39.450> we're<00:01:39.540> going<00:01:39.630> let<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.869> saute

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
right now we're going let this saute

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.020 
right now we're going let this saute
here<00:01:40.950> for<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> couple<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.400> minutes<00:01:41.460> we'll<00:01:41.850> come

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
here for a couple of minutes we'll come

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.789 
here for a couple of minutes we'll come
back<00:01:42.210> when<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.570> little<00:01:42.780> more<00:01:42.899> done<00:01:43.200> at

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
back when it's a little more done at

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.160 
back when it's a little more done at
that<00:01:44.369> point<00:01:44.430> will<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.450> know<00:01:45.689> make<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> roux

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
that point will you know make the roux

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.760 
that point will you know make the roux
and<00:01:46.200> things<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.360> see<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.479> couple

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
and things like that so see in a couple

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.020 
and things like that so see in a couple
all<00:01:49.770> right<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.009> here<00:01:50.100> we<00:01:50.189> are<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.729> couple<00:01:50.970> of

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
all right so here we are in a couple of

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.330 
all right so here we are in a couple of
minutes<00:01:51.259> our<00:01:52.259> shallots<00:01:52.649> have<00:01:52.770> softened<00:01:53.159> up

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
minutes our shallots have softened up

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.490 
minutes our shallots have softened up
the<00:01:54.329> reason<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.630> want<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.780> soften<00:01:54.990> them<00:01:55.200> up<00:01:55.290> is

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
the reason you want to soften them up is

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.990 
the reason you want to soften them up is
because<00:01:55.619> these<00:01:56.070> are<00:01:56.219> going<00:01:56.430> right<00:01:56.640> into<00:01:56.790> that

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
because these are going right into that

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.399 
because these are going right into that
sour<00:01:57.299> cream<00:01:57.600> mixture<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.229> they<00:01:58.350> were

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
sour cream mixture and if they were

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.980 
sour cream mixture and if they were
crunchy<00:01:59.189> or<00:01:59.340> hard<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.689> know<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.840> wouldn't

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
crunchy or hard it you know it wouldn't

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.289 
crunchy or hard it you know it wouldn't
be<00:02:01.170> very<00:02:01.369> tasty<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.549> like<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.000> get<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> little

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
be very tasty I like to get a little

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.999 
be very tasty I like to get a little
color<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.719> these<00:02:03.930> prepping<00:02:04.350> there's<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.860> nice

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
color in these prepping there's a nice

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.520 
color in these prepping there's a nice
color<00:02:05.280> contrast<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:06.990> I'll<00:02:07.079> actually<00:02:07.229> turn<00:02:07.500> a

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
color contrast so I'll actually turn a

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.139 
color contrast so I'll actually turn a
little<00:02:07.710> brown<00:02:08.009> on<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> edges<00:02:08.310> before<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.970> throw
