00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:04.849 

so<00:00:02.429> here's<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.669> video<00:00:02.850> that<00:00:03.240> shows<00:00:03.480> this<00:00:03.859> chain

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
so here's a video that shows this chain

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:13.120 
so here's a video that shows this chain
drive<00:00:05.130> setup<00:00:06.140> for<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:08.480> uomo<00:00:09.480> 205<00:00:10.139> two-stroke

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.130 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.560 

this<00:00:14.130> chain<00:00:14.460> here<00:00:14.990> connects<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.230> two<00:00:17.570> three

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
this chain here connects the two three

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.939 
this chain here connects the two three
and<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.720> half<00:00:18.810> hours<00:00:19.050> lawn<00:00:19.289> mower<00:00:19.529> engines

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
and a half hours lawn mower engines

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.330 
and a half hours lawn mower engines
together<00:00:20.330> so<00:00:21.330> that's<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.660> power<00:00:21.900> unit<00:00:22.340> and

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
together so that's the power unit and

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.580 
together so that's the power unit and
then<00:00:23.430> chain<00:00:24.119> here<00:00:24.359> that's<00:00:24.570> looking<00:00:24.960> seriously

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
then chain here that's looking seriously

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.240 
then chain here that's looking seriously
loose

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
loose

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.950 
loose
that's<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.380> supercharger<00:00:28.380> drive<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.960> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
that's the supercharger drive and the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.950 
that's the supercharger drive and the
supercharger<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.489> eight<00:00:32.610> horse<00:00:32.960> riding

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
supercharger the eight horse riding

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.470 
supercharger the eight horse riding
mower<00:00:34.200> engine<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:35.280> also<00:00:35.460> has<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.910> starter<00:00:36.329> on

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
mower engine it also has the starter on

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.000 
mower engine it also has the starter on
it<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.809> when<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.110> starts<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> engine<00:00:37.590> it

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
it so when it starts the engine it

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.170 
it so when it starts the engine it
cranks<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.520> through<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.870> chain<00:00:40.170> also

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
cranks it through that that chain also

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
cranks it through that that chain also
so<00:00:42.180> that's<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.750> way<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.020> works<00:00:46.370> have<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
so that's the way that works have the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.020 
so that's the way that works have the
original<00:00:49.200> intake<00:00:49.710> block<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.280> was<00:00:50.399> going<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.820> use

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
original intake block I was going to use

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.100 
original intake block I was going to use
here<00:00:51.829> I<00:00:52.829> can<00:00:53.250> show<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.520> more<00:00:54.329> about<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.750> ports

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
here I can show you more about the ports

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:03.229 
here I can show you more about the ports
on<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.320> all<00:00:59.750> that's<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.760> role<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.789> intake

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
on it all that's the role of intake

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.080 
on it all that's the role of intake
ports<00:01:03.660> there<00:01:04.309> they<00:01:05.309> go<00:01:06.799> quite<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> ways<00:01:08.000> quite<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
ports there they go quite a ways quite a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:17.380 
ports there they go quite a ways quite a
ways<00:01:09.330> around<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> cylinder<00:01:15.380> this<00:01:16.380> was<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
ways around the cylinder this was the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.789 
ways around the cylinder this was the
block<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.600> was<00:01:18.780> originally<00:01:18.990> intending<00:01:19.680> on

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
block I was originally intending on

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.920 
block I was originally intending on
using<00:01:20.189> one<00:01:20.729> other<00:01:20.909> thing<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.299> was<00:01:21.390> going<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.780> do

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
using one other thing I was going to do

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.140 
using one other thing I was going to do
was<00:01:23.450> as<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> piston<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.320> JB<00:01:26.310> welded<00:01:26.700> over<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
was as the piston I JB welded over the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.289 
was as the piston I JB welded over the
oil<00:01:27.600> return<00:01:27.869> holes<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.770> oil<00:01:28.950> ring<00:01:30.229> but

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
oil return holes for the oil ring but

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.179 
oil return holes for the oil ring but
for<00:01:33.299> sake<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.689> saving<00:01:34.470> time<00:01:35.420> what<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.450> did

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
for sake of saving time what I did

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:45.940 
for sake of saving time what I did
ended<00:01:38.189> up<00:01:38.280> using<00:01:40.159> my<00:01:42.229> mono<00:01:43.229> soup<00:01:43.619> eight<00:01:43.860> block

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
ended up using my mono soup eight block

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.069 
ended up using my mono soup eight block
it<00:01:46.950> already<00:01:47.189> has<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.729> intake<00:01:48.360> manifold<00:01:48.899> and

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
it already has the intake manifold and

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.749 
it already has the intake manifold and
everything<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.100> also<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.549> same

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
everything on it this is also the same

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.700 
everything on it this is also the same
one<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.570> used<00:01:52.320> for<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:54.710> original

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
one that I used for the original

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.530 
one that I used for the original
supercharged<00:01:56.430> two-stroke<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.149> one<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
supercharged two-stroke the one with the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.010 
supercharged two-stroke the one with the
blue<00:01:57.930> cover<00:01:58.969> so<00:01:59.969> that's<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.750> third

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
blue cover so that's this is the third

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.209 
blue cover so that's this is the third
go<00:02:01.229> around<00:02:01.560> for<00:02:01.920> this<00:02:02.430> particular<00:02:02.969> block<00:02:04.219> this

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
go around for this particular block this

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.600 
go around for this particular block this
time<00:02:05.280> though<00:02:05.780> it<00:02:06.780> has<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> camshaft<00:02:07.710> in<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.129> but

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
time though it has a camshaft in it but

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.390 
time though it has a camshaft in it but
there's<00:02:09.300> no<00:02:09.479> valve<00:02:09.869> lifters<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:11.099> valves

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
there's no valve lifters so the valves

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.970 
there's no valve lifters so the valves
don't<00:02:11.550> open<00:02:11.910> at<00:02:12.030> all<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:13.200> was<00:02:13.290> one<00:02:13.470> thing

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
don't open at all that was one thing

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.009 
don't open at all that was one thing
to<00:02:14.069> do<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.610> had<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.739> take<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.920> valves<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:18.019> grind

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
to do I had to take the valves and grind

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.860 
to do I had to take the valves and grind
them<00:02:19.260> right<00:02:19.470> back<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:23.209> they<00:02:24.209> sat<00:02:24.480> flushed

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
them right back so that they sat flushed

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.830 
them right back so that they sat flushed
at<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.230> top<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:27.030> see<00:02:27.269> they<00:02:27.420> protrude

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
at the top of the you see they protrude

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.449 
at the top of the you see they protrude
past<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.379> top<00:02:28.590> with<00:02:28.769> a<00:02:30.560> head<00:02:31.560> mating<00:02:32.040> surface

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
past the top with a head mating surface

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.809 
past the top with a head mating surface
there

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
there

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.539 
there
I<00:02:32.849> had<00:02:33.269> to<00:02:33.709> machine<00:02:34.709> them<00:02:34.920> right<00:02:35.129> off<00:02:35.310> while

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
I had to machine them right off while

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.460 
I had to machine them right off while
grind<00:02:35.819> them<00:02:35.940> right<00:02:36.090> off<00:02:36.239> flat<00:02:36.540> because<00:02:36.989> my

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
grind them right off flat because my

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.680 
grind them right off flat because my
quarter-inch<00:02:38.040> plate<00:02:38.280> head<00:02:38.549> bolts<00:02:39.269> right<00:02:39.510> on

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
quarter-inch plate head bolts right on

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.160 
quarter-inch plate head bolts right on
there

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
there

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.190 
there
so<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.760> was<00:02:42.180> surprising<00:02:42.690> they<00:02:42.810> took<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:43.049> lot

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
so that was surprising they took a lot

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.930 
so that was surprising they took a lot
of<00:02:43.290> grinding<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:43.799> do<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.129> the<00:02:44.340> exhaust<00:02:44.670> valve

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
of grinding to do that the exhaust valve

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.289 
of grinding to do that the exhaust valve
in<00:02:45.120> particular<00:02:45.629> is<00:02:45.690> very<00:02:45.720> hard<00:02:46.140> material

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
in particular is very hard material

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.660 
in particular is very hard material
anyways<00:02:48.299> so<00:02:48.959> that's<00:02:49.170> my<00:02:50.030> video<00:02:51.030> there<00:02:51.510> of<00:02:51.690> the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
anyways so that's my video there of the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.839
