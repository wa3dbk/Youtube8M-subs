00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.200
 The palms of Gran Canaria have added a 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.960
 attraction to the many it has are 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.790
 is about a new means of communication 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.410
 truly revolutionary is the train 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.290
 vertebrate Spanish that effects a 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.120
 55 kilometers travel from the 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.060
 Port of light to the south of the island 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:35.519
 more specifically in maspalomas where 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:38.609
 It makes a good trip to do something 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.780
 history back in 1940 the 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:42.629
 Spanish engineers 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.809
 lords goicoechea oriol carried out the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.789
 first practices of his famous talgo un 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.100
 light articulated train that supposed a 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.199
 important transformation in the context 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.390
 until then the use of convoys 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.120
 hill daily from those dates the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.620
 balance surcar raudo and successfully diverse 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.940
 national rail routes and 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.370
 foreigners now 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.259
 this new vertebrate train of the same 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.869
 inventors is a step forward 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.060
 and transcendental by the way in the world 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.310
 of the communications your design makes 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.659
 impossible the derailments the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.790
 classic iron wheels go 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.950
 covered by tires which is the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.570
 quieter and more comfortable rolling and 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.780
 finally the speeds that can 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.830
 reach not appreciable in these tests 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.740
 far exceed those that can 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:47.520
 get any conventional train 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:49.439
 and maybe some viewer could think 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.990
 that this new system is only suitable for 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.100
 short distances none of that between 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.810
 invertebrates 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.899
 It can be used for all kinds of 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.369
 medium or long short itineraries and 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.000
 It may also be used in the 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.000
 merchandise transports
