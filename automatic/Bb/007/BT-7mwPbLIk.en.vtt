now what I really really found was one
of<00:05:44.740> the<00:05:44.800> best<00:05:45.010> things<00:05:45.130> about<00:05:45.430> this<00:05:45.700> team<00:05:45.910> was

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
of the best things about this team was

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.050 
of the best things about this team was
how<00:05:46.630> well<00:05:46.990> balanced<00:05:47.680> the<00:05:47.770> team<00:05:48.040> was<00:05:48.280> because

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
how well balanced the team was because

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.650 
how well balanced the team was because

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
you got great dribblers in dimaria

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.990 
you got great dribblers in dimaria
Aguero<00:05:52.800> Iniesta<00:05:53.800> you<00:05:53.890> got<00:05:54.040> great<00:05:54.280> passes<00:05:54.880> of

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
Aguero Iniesta you got great passes of

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.200 
Aguero Iniesta you got great passes of
the<00:05:55.030> ball<00:05:55.330> like<00:05:55.600> demaria<00:05:56.470> again<00:05:56.880> Iniesta<00:05:57.880> and

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
the ball like demaria again Iniesta and

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.350 
the ball like demaria again Iniesta and
verse<00:05:58.930> gets<00:05:59.320> Perez<00:05:59.950> also<00:06:00.850> was<00:06:01.000> actually

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
verse gets Perez also was actually

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.540 
verse gets Perez also was actually
pretty<00:06:01.510> good<00:06:01.720> at<00:06:01.780> passing<00:06:02.220> and<00:06:03.220> you've<00:06:03.400> also

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
pretty good at passing and you've also

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.990 
pretty good at passing and you've also
got<00:06:03.790> the<00:06:03.880> pace<00:06:04.090> with<00:06:04.330> Aguero<00:06:04.870> and<00:06:05.640> dimaria<00:06:06.640> so

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
got the pace with Aguero and dimaria so

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.300 
got the pace with Aguero and dimaria so
I<00:06:07.300> think<00:06:07.510> overall<00:06:07.960> in<00:06:08.200> terms<00:06:08.410> attack<00:06:08.950> and<00:06:09.160> wise

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
I think overall in terms attack and wise

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.550 
I think overall in terms attack and wise
it<00:06:09.670> was<00:06:10.120> very<00:06:10.150> very<00:06:10.720> strong<00:06:11.110> there<00:06:11.260> wasn't

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
it was very very strong there wasn't

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.040 
it was very very strong there wasn't
really<00:06:11.650> any<00:06:11.860> weaknesses<00:06:12.400> chorea<00:06:12.940> was<00:06:13.630> just

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
really any weaknesses chorea was just

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.770 
really any weaknesses chorea was just
you<00:06:14.500> know<00:06:14.620> just<00:06:14.700> punishing<00:06:15.700> the<00:06:16.090> fenders<00:06:16.570> they

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
you know just punishing the fenders they

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.660 
you know just punishing the fenders they
just<00:06:17.230> running<00:06:17.590> past<00:06:17.860> him<00:06:18.070> of<00:06:18.190> ease<00:06:18.430> like

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:18.670 
just running past him of ease like

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.350

Alvarez<00:06:58.480> I<00:06:58.660> think<00:06:58.870> he's<00:06:59.020> actually<00:06:59.230> better

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.560 
Alvarez I think he's actually better

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.430 
Alvarez I think he's actually better
than<00:06:59.650> Casillas<00:07:00.160> overall<00:07:01.000> this<00:07:01.150> team<00:07:01.450> I<00:07:01.690> really

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:02.440 
than Casillas overall this team I really

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.220

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.030 
used this formation much and I thought

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.610 
used this formation much and I thought
this<00:07:07.180> was<00:07:07.360> needed<00:07:07.720> because<00:07:07.870> I<00:07:08.110> wanted<00:07:08.380> to<00:07:08.500> get
