00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.250
 the mitochondrion is a small organelles 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.029
 intracellular that we will find in the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.810
 cytoplasm that is rod-shaped 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.029
 in general or a little spherical 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.380
 there may be some mitochondria 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.340
 or a very large number of mitochondria 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.780
 it depends on the cell type and they 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.399
 can be fixed in some 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.140
 cell locations or on the contrary 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.809
 mobile using the cytoskeleton 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.649
 to get from one place to another the 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.520
 mitochondria with a double membrane 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:54.510
 outer membrane that contacts the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.239
 cytoplasm a very internal membrane 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.730
 different and that has folding this 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.760
 who will develop an internal space 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.510
 embraer between the outer membrane and the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.460
 internal membrane 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.720
 and then inside the mitochondria 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.430
 there is a matrix the two membranes of 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.070
 the mitochondrion outer membrane 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.200
 inner membrane probed bilayer 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.860
 lipid but they are very 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.250
 different 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.009
 the outer membrane will carry in large 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.650
 quantity a particular protein that 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.920
 is called rinne skin which is a 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.960
 protein that will develop channels to 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.960
 inside this outer membrane and 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.329
 therefore will very easily allow 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.520
 exchanges between the site and place 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.220
 the inter membrane space that gives 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.530
 a high permeability to this membrane 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.110
 external 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.689
 the inner membrane on the contrary is a 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.329
 membrane that contains a very large 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.369
 number of proteins about 80% of 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.380
 constituents of this inner membrane 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.329
 are proteins and these are 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.159
 very special protein this is where 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.130
 that we will find proteins 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.689
 of the respiratory chain and protein 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.270
 which ensures the synthesis of atp atp and 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.790
 in cash from the chemical stacks of the 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.770
 cell that contains the energy 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.760
 necessary then to make 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.410
 enzymatic reactions the internal space 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.319
 membrane between outer membrane or 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:27.030
 inner membrane contains enzymes 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.960
 various and h + ions in large 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.290
 amount 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.330
 and in much greater quantity by 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.880
 relation to the numbers dion h more than one 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.760
 found in the matrix of the 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.740
 mitochondria which she is very poor in 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.140
 storm more so the mitochondria to 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.910
 several very important functions 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.970
 the first is to allow 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.440
 provide energy to the rest of the 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.590
 cell for all reactions 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.820
 enzymatic this supply of energy 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:04.140
 is in the form of manufacturing 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:06.540
 of adenosine triphosphate atp which then 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:12.060
 outside the mitochondria can 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:15.420
 to be degraded to a dp adenoids said 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.930
 phosphates and this atp degradation in 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.300
 adp will provide energy that can 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.480
 to be picked up to ensure the reactions 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.630
 enzymatic cell this 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.220
 supply of energy stored in the atp 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:34.980
 it is possible thanks to the degradation 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:39.120
 of basic intracellular constituents 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.910
 amino acids lipids sugar that take place 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.060
 in mitochondria in a cycle 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:48.450
 particular biochemical that's called 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.820
 the creps cycle the mitochondria a 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.500
 also extremely important role 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:59.070
 in cell death the mitochondria 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:02.010
 has its own genome with a code 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:05.930
 particular genetic that is different 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:09.240
 of the genetic code of the nucleus dna 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.010
 this mitochondrion dna they encode 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.460
 for a very small number of proteins 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.470
 10 to 100 proteins while the whole 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.320
 proteins that make up the 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.299
 mitochondria are around 1000 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.670
 different proteins so for 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:27.150
 constitute the mitochondria there is a 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:30.360
 assembly of proteins made at 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.670
 from mitochondrial dna and 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.740
 proteins produced from DNA 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.169
 nuclear 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.850
 when the sperm enters into 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.260
 the ovum 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:44.650
 only the sperm nucleus 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:47.230
 between and no mitochondria of 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.830
 sperm enters the ovum of the 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:54.910
 blow the transmission of mitochondria 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.980
 is done exclusively by the sea ​​there is 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.870
 anomalies from time to time from 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.480
 mitochondrial genome that can be 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.550
 responsible for diseases and 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.190
 particular of muscular diseases 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.340
 since it is to the genome abnormalities 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.890
 mitochondrial will result in a 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.050
 poor energy production while 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.130
 energy is especially important 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.130
 for muscle contraction
