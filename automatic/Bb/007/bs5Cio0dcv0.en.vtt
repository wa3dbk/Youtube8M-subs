00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 in this tutorial we will process the photo 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.480
 vintage style 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.049
 we have already openly photos over which we will 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.269
 work 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.790
 Click the ambassador and translate the photo into 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.370
 the smart object is causing the transformation and 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.830
 slightly reduce it after this layer 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.140
 you can rasterize the mouth by double-clicking 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:26.760
 call the style standing and add white 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:29.070
 a stroke it will serve as a frame we create 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.519
 new empty layer and merge it with 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.380
 a photo 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.210
 this is done in order to further 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.700
 could apply filter 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.010
 directly like vodka so the background doesn't 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.540
 empty create a new layer and fill 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.149
 its any color for example gray meaning 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.110
 we omit the approach you can add 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.300
 texture background 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.060
 in this case we use texture 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.730
 paper 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.430
 drag the paper over the background to them 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.020
 blending modes set multiplication to 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.750
 slightly enhance the texture pattern 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.750
 we cause correction level and we darken 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.020
 now both layers can be removed vadim 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.119
 go to the photo layer select it 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.690
 by clicking on the icon holding the key 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.420
 contour 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.570
 selection menu select modification 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:21.369
 go to the function room and set 15 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:24.220
 pixels without removing the selection go 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:33.250
 distortion filter menu and apply a number 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:34.540
 one hundred percent seemed to me 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.090
 not enough ripples 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:44.740
 and I repeated the effect of increasing by 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:47.080
 two hundred and fifty five percent now 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.970
 vintage frame ready for more 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.170
 aging effect can be torn 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.420
 photo corner 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.200
 for this we take the tool to sleep and 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.200
 cut off the corner 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.759
 call the transformation of a little running away I 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.410
 vadim corner of a little paper texture 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.550
 Create a new layer with a gray brush. 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.550
 I outline you extremely 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.590
 layer styles add some shadow and 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.590
 set blend bleaching mode 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:04.850
 after two layers you can merge us now 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.580
 need a little old photo below 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.310
 Layer panels create adjustment layer 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.460
 color tone and lower saturation 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.460
 Images 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.769
 create a second adjustment layer 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:27.360
 photo filter 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:28.880
 and add a little yellowness to us again 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.770
 it took a paper texture 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.419
 drag it over the layers and set 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.419
 multiplication overlay mode 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:44.949
 to remove all that goes beyond 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.810
 select the photo layer do the inversion and on 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:48.810
 paper layer click to remove 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.220
 layer styles add some shadow 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.220
 approach 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.040
 that the photo looked really 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.230
 old shabby can 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.440
 use more textures add 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.610
 scratches and stains paper folds it's all on 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.430
 your discretion 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.830
 I added a couple more textures on top of all 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.580
 layers in blend mode 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.580
 multiplications 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:36.620
 also put paper under her cattle 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.480
 for textures you can try different 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.430
 blending modes change their transparency 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.330
 it is best to select individually 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.330
 to every word 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.540
 select all layers duplicate them and merge 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.540
 water 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:17.449
 On this layer I turn the filters and add 

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:17.449
 a bit of noise 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:37.229
 this go to filters we choose imitation 

00:07:33.789 --> 00:07:37.229
 treated very small 

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:03.250
 lower the layer opacity and our 

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:03.250
 vintage style ready
