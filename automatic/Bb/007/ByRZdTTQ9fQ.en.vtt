which is a 2088 movement now if you

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.249 
which is a 2088 movement now if you
watch<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.710> move<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.040> second<00:01:59.490> hand<00:01:59.670> there

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
watch the move in the second hand there

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.560 
watch the move in the second hand there
it's<00:02:01.259> not<00:02:01.439> really<00:02:01.649> obvious<00:02:02.540> which<00:02:03.540> is

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
it's not really obvious which is

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.660 
it's not really obvious which is
interesting<00:02:03.840> some<00:02:04.140> some<00:02:04.530> 21-6<00:02:05.250> movements

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
interesting some some 21-6 movements

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.789

like<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:06.180> 7s<00:02:06.540> 26<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.259> I've<00:02:07.350> had<00:02:07.500> in<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.649> few

Seiko<00:05:39.250> movement<00:05:39.669> I<00:05:39.729> have<00:05:40.180> actually<00:05:40.479> stopped

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
Seiko movement I have actually stopped

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.170 
Seiko movement I have actually stopped
buying<00:05:41.050> low<00:05:41.320> in<00:05:41.470> cycles<00:05:41.860> because<00:05:42.130> the<00:05:42.970> lack<00:05:43.150> of

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
buying low in cycles because the lack of

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.930 
buying low in cycles because the lack of
accuracy<00:05:43.690> or<00:05:44.139> regulation<00:05:45.010> just<00:05:45.280> bugs<00:05:45.520> me<00:05:45.639> and

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
accuracy or regulation just bugs me and

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.969 
accuracy or regulation just bugs me and
I've<00:05:46.090> actually<00:05:46.330> had<00:05:46.870> watchmakers<00:05:47.590> try<00:05:47.860> and

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
I've actually had watchmakers try and

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.460 
I've actually had watchmakers try and
regulate<00:05:48.250> a7<00:05:49.030> s26<00:05:49.600> and<00:05:49.840> give<00:05:49.990> up<00:05:50.139> on<00:05:50.320> me

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
regulate a7 s26 and give up on me

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.290 
regulate a7 s26 and give up on me
because<00:05:50.620> you<00:05:51.070> know<00:05:51.130> positional<00:05:52.000> accuracy

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
because you know positional accuracy

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.930 
because you know positional accuracy
just<00:05:52.510> wasn't<00:05:53.050> there<00:05:53.169> so<00:05:54.160> the<00:05:54.460> fact<00:05:54.669> that<00:05:54.760> this

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
just wasn't there so the fact that this

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.200 
just wasn't there so the fact that this
one<00:05:55.150> does<00:05:55.389> have<00:05:56.760> excellent<00:05:57.760> positional

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
one does have excellent positional

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.270 
one does have excellent positional
accuracy<00:05:58.510> it's<00:05:58.990> been<00:05:59.229> reliable<00:05:59.800> whether<00:05:59.979> on

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
accuracy it's been reliable whether on

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.159 
accuracy it's been reliable whether on
the<00:06:00.310> wrist<00:06:00.610> on<00:06:00.789> the<00:06:00.880> watch<00:06:01.030> winder<00:06:01.570> or<00:06:01.840> just

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
the wrist on the watch winder or just

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.170 
the wrist on the watch winder or just
sitting<00:06:02.440> on<00:06:02.530> a<00:06:02.560> desk<00:06:02.770> this<00:06:03.550> is<00:06:03.700> a<00:06:03.729> really<00:06:04.060> good

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
sitting on a desk this is a really good

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.120 
sitting on a desk this is a really good
movement<00:06:04.539> and<00:06:04.660> as<00:06:05.080> regulated<00:06:05.620> by<00:06:05.710> loom<00:06:05.919> tech

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
movement and as regulated by loom tech

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.490 
movement and as regulated by loom tech
it's<00:06:06.310> phenomenal<00:06:06.880> movement<00:06:07.210> so<00:06:08.139> other<00:06:08.320> things

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
it's phenomenal movement so other things

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.260 
it's phenomenal movement so other things
I<00:06:08.560> like<00:06:08.650> about<00:06:08.770> this<00:06:08.950> one<00:06:09.030> if<00:06:10.030> you<00:06:10.120> look

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
I like about this one if you look

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.060 
I like about this one if you look
there's<00:06:10.960> just<00:06:11.050> a<00:06:11.260> little<00:06:11.560> bit<00:06:11.650> of<00:06:11.710> red<00:06:11.830> on<00:06:11.979> the

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
there's just a little bit of red on the

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.580 
there's just a little bit of red on the
dial<00:06:12.220> tip<00:06:12.550> of<00:06:12.639> the<00:06:12.700> second<00:06:13.000> hand

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
dial tip of the second hand

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.050 
dial tip of the second hand
the<00:06:13.680> Loom<00:06:13.890> tech<00:06:14.100> branding<00:06:14.490> which<00:06:14.610> is<00:06:14.730> very

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
the Loom tech branding which is very

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.300 
the Loom tech branding which is very
dark<00:06:15.440> you<00:06:16.440> just<00:06:16.650> kind<00:06:16.800> of<00:06:16.830> see<00:06:16.980> it<00:06:17.070> there<00:06:17.220> as

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
dark you just kind of see it there as

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.490 
dark you just kind of see it there as
the<00:06:17.430> light<00:06:17.550> plays<00:06:17.850> on<00:06:18.030> and<00:06:18.300> then<00:06:18.420> this<00:06:18.600> depth

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
the light plays on and then this depth

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.080 
the light plays on and then this depth
reading<00:06:19.830> there<00:06:20.010> but<00:06:20.430> if<00:06:20.520> you<00:06:20.610> look<00:06:20.640> at<00:06:20.850> it<00:06:20.970> a

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
reading there but if you look at it a

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.540 
reading there but if you look at it a
little<00:06:21.120> bit<00:06:21.330> there<00:06:21.570> it<00:06:22.260> vanishes<00:06:22.680> this<00:06:22.920> is<00:06:23.100> it

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
little bit there it vanishes this is it

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.110 
little bit there it vanishes this is it
actually<00:06:23.910> is<00:06:24.030> not<00:06:24.060> at<00:06:24.480> all<00:06:24.630> a<00:06:25.910> fancy<00:06:26.910> you<00:06:27.000> look

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
actually is not at all a fancy you look

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.600 
actually is not at all a fancy you look
and<00:06:27.240> watch<00:06:27.440> you<00:06:28.440> know<00:06:28.530> this<00:06:28.710> is<00:06:28.860> utilitarian

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
and watch you know this is utilitarian

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.740 
and watch you know this is utilitarian
it's<00:06:30.240> well-made<00:06:30.750> it's<00:06:31.530> a<00:06:31.650> good<00:06:31.800> value<00:06:32.360> and<00:06:33.360> I

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
it's well-made it's a good value and I

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.300 
it's well-made it's a good value and I
like<00:06:33.990> I<00:06:34.140> happen<00:06:34.410> to<00:06:34.440> like<00:06:34.650> the<00:06:34.830> design<00:06:35.040> not

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
like I happen to like the design not

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.040 
like I happen to like the design not
everyone<00:06:35.640> well<00:06:35.820> loom<00:06:36.420> tech<00:06:36.660> has<00:06:36.810> their<00:06:37.020> own

everyone well loom tech has their own

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.200 
everyone well loom tech has their own
design<00:06:37.560> language<00:06:37.980> as<00:06:38.640> you<00:06:38.760> can<00:06:38.880> see<00:06:39.030> with

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
design language as you can see with

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.610 
design language as you can see with
things<00:06:39.390> like<00:06:39.510> these<00:06:39.630> you<00:06:39.900> or<00:06:40.140> be<00:06:40.320> shaped

things like these you or be shaped
markers<00:06:41.100> and<00:06:41.250> then<00:06:41.370> the<00:06:41.520> single<00:06:41.850> 12<00:06:42.590> it's<00:06:43.590> kind

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
markers and then the single 12 it's kind

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.620 
markers and then the single 12 it's kind
of<00:06:43.830> their<00:06:43.950> own<00:06:44.010> way<00:06:44.190> of<00:06:44.220> doing<00:06:44.370> things<00:06:44.540> it's<00:06:45.540> a

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
of their own way of doing things it's a

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.390 
of their own way of doing things it's a
little<00:06:45.990> bit<00:06:46.110> thick<00:06:46.290> and<00:06:46.440> with<00:06:47.070> the<00:06:47.160> square

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
little bit thick and with the square

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.430 
little bit thick and with the square
sides<00:06:47.670> it's<00:06:48.510> not<00:06:48.690> exactly<00:06:49.020> shirt-cuff

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
sides it's not exactly shirt-cuff

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.740 
sides it's not exactly shirt-cuff
friendly<00:06:49.800> but<00:06:50.340> if<00:06:50.430> you<00:06:50.550> take<00:06:51.330> the<00:06:51.450> bracelet

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
friendly but if you take the bracelet

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:53.360 
friendly but if you take the bracelet
off<00:06:51.870> it<00:06:52.140> comes<00:06:52.230> with<00:06:52.440> a<00:06:52.500> nice<00:06:52.620> rubber<00:06:52.920> strap<00:06:53.220> as

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
off it comes with a nice rubber strap as

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.310 
off it comes with a nice rubber strap as
well<00:06:53.400> and<00:06:53.760> it<00:06:54.360> does<00:06:54.480> pretty<00:06:54.660> well<00:06:54.720> on<00:06:54.900> canvas

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320 
well and it does pretty well on canvas

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.170 
well and it does pretty well on canvas
takes<00:06:55.560> it<00:06:55.650> down<00:06:55.770> to<00:06:55.860> around<00:06:55.980> 110<00:06:56.670> grams<00:06:56.970> and

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
takes it down to around 110 grams and

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.520 
takes it down to around 110 grams and
then<00:06:57.240> you<00:06:57.390> actually<00:06:57.780> becomes<00:06:58.020> a<00:06:58.110> reasonable

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 
then you actually becomes a reasonable

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:04.640 
then you actually becomes a reasonable
