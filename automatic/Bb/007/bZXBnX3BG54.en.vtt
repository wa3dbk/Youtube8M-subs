00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.149 
one with two things in a modern warfare
2<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:38.729> like<00:01:38.850> about<00:01:39.060> 20<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:39.780> enough<00:01:40.680> ranting

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
2 it's like about 20 but enough ranting

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.649 
2 it's like about 20 but enough ranting
today<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.750> am<00:01:42.750> using<00:01:43.610> overkill<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:45.299> never

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
today I am using overkill and I never

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.359 
today I am using overkill and I never
took<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.170> book<00:01:46.470> seriously<00:01:46.829> before<00:01:47.130> him

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
took this book seriously before him

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.039 
took this book seriously before him
right<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.670> like<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.090> I'll<00:01:48.750> pull<00:01:48.960> my

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
right here I like this I'll pull my

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.620 
right here I like this I'll pull my
guide<00:01:49.170> pop<00:01:49.380> another<00:01:49.590> guy<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.700> think<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.450> get

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
guide pop another guy and I think I get

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.249 
guide pop another guy and I think I get
one<00:01:51.750> more<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> win<00:01:52.470> but<00:01:53.630> yeah<00:01:54.630> today<00:01:54.899> I'm

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
one more for the win but yeah today I'm

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.160 
one more for the win but yeah today I'm
using<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.799> overkill<00:01:56.369> setup<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.360> honestly

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
using the overkill setup and I honestly

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.010 
using the overkill setup and I honestly
always<00:01:58.380> took<00:01:58.740> over<00:01:58.979> kills<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.520> joke<00:01:59.840> when<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.899> was

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
always took over kills a joke when I was

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.300 
always took over kills a joke when I was
playing<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.320> game<00:02:01.500> before<00:02:01.710> modern<00:02:02.159> warfare

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
playing this game before modern warfare

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.330 
playing this game before modern warfare
2<00:02:02.490> came<00:02:02.850> out<00:02:03.000> because<00:02:03.649> when<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.680> played<00:02:05.159> this

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
2 came out because when I played this

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.069 
2 came out because when I played this
game<00:02:05.579> before<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.270> was<00:02:06.509> always<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.899> kid

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
game before that I was always the kid

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.660 
game before that I was always the kid
using<00:02:07.439> stopping<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:07.979> was<00:02:08.160> too<00:02:08.280> stopping

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
using stopping but I was too stopping

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.580 
using stopping but I was too stopping
powerful<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.479> occasionally<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> juggernaut

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
powerful and occasionally a juggernaut

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.770 
powerful and occasionally a juggernaut
but<00:02:11.520> most<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:11.970> time<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.180> was<00:02:12.390> stopping

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
but most of the time I was stopping

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.370 
but most of the time I was stopping
power<00:02:12.959> and

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
power and

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.190 
power and
and<00:02:13.470> honestly<00:02:13.890> today<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.220> just<00:02:14.430> felt<00:02:14.850> like

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
and honestly today I just felt like

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.080 
and honestly today I just felt like
using<00:02:16.200> overkill<00:02:16.740> because<00:02:16.890> I'm<00:02:17.640> kind<00:02:17.880> of<00:02:17.910> used

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
using overkill because I'm kind of used

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.840 
using overkill because I'm kind of used
to<00:02:18.180> modern<00:02:18.480> warfare<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.110> know<00:02:19.230> having<00:02:19.530> my

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
to modern warfare to you know having my

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.520 
to modern warfare to you know having my
intervention<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.390> having<00:02:21.600> my<00:02:21.750> spaz<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.470> I

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
intervention and having my spaz so I

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.350 
intervention and having my spaz so I
just<00:02:22.770> decided<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.460> recreate<00:02:23.820> that<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.060> little

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
just decided to recreate that a little

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.250 
just decided to recreate that a little
bit<00:02:24.510> with<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.890> M<00:02:25.980> 21<00:02:26.340> W<00:02:26.880> 1200<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.690> both<00:02:28.050> these

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
bit with the M 21 W 1200 and both these

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.780 
bit with the M 21 W 1200 and both these
guns<00:02:28.500> are<00:02:28.680> great<00:02:28.800> over<00:02:29.190> killed<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.700> they

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
guns are great over killed and they

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.520 
guns are great over killed and they
don't<00:02:29.970> need<00:02:30.090> stopping<00:02:30.570> power<00:02:30.690> necessarily

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
don't need stopping power necessarily

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.100 
don't need stopping power necessarily
are<00:02:32.430> they<00:02:32.550> only<00:02:32.640> else<00:02:32.910> with<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.180> m21<00:02:33.690> with

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
are they only else with the m21 with

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.590 
are they only else with the m21 with
stopping<00:02:34.560> power<00:02:34.710> that<00:02:35.310> like<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:36.180> could<00:02:36.390> get<00:02:36.540> a

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
stopping power that like you could get a

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.290 
stopping power that like you could get a
one-shot<00:02:37.290> like<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.800> their<00:02:37.980> upper<00:02:38.700> neck<00:02:38.910> area

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
one-shot like in their upper neck area

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.540 
one-shot like in their upper neck area
or<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.930> like<00:02:40.140> lower<00:02:40.380> neck<00:02:40.620> area<00:02:40.980> or<00:02:41.190> something

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
or the like lower neck area or something

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.310 
or the like lower neck area or something
but<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.210> didn't<00:02:42.420> have<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.630> be<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:42.780> headshot<00:02:43.140> you

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
but it didn't have to be a headshot you

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.110 
but it didn't have to be a headshot you
can<00:02:43.440> still<00:02:43.590> get<00:02:43.710> in<00:02:43.800> one<00:02:43.950> shot<00:02:44.190> but<00:02:44.490> when<00:02:45.030> you

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
can still get in one shot but when you

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.880 
can still get in one shot but when you
don't<00:02:45.270> use<00:02:45.510> Tommy<00:02:45.840> pon<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.170> m21<00:02:46.620> it's

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
don't use Tommy pon the m21 it's

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.400 
don't use Tommy pon the m21 it's
basically<00:02:47.460> always<00:02:47.610> two<00:02:47.880> shots<00:02:48.210> unless<00:02:49.080> you

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
basically always two shots unless you

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.600 
basically always two shots unless you
hit<00:02:49.530> him<00:02:49.650> in<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.800> head<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.220> they<00:02:50.310> don't<00:02:50.490> have

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
hit him in the head and they don't have

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.310 
hit him in the head and they don't have
juggernaut<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.480> most<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.930> time<00:02:52.110> would<00:02:52.230> be

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
juggernaut so most of the time would be

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.010 
juggernaut so most of the time would be
two<00:02:52.470> shots<00:02:52.710> but<00:02:53.670> that's<00:02:54.270> no<00:02:54.480> big<00:02:54.510> deal<00:02:54.870> because

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
two shots but that's no big deal because

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.710 
two shots but that's no big deal because
okay<00:02:55.770> look<00:02:55.950> at<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:56.160> pro<00:02:56.610> right<00:02:56.910> here<00:02:56.940> he

him and then I just put a bolt this way

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.600 
him and then I just put a bolt this way
because<00:03:09.260> fears<00:03:10.260> camper<00:03:10.710> that<00:03:11.190> was<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.370> pretty

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
because fears camper that was a pretty

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.090 
because fears camper that was a pretty
fierce<00:03:11.940> fail<00:03:12.240> I<00:03:12.270> mean<00:03:12.750> that's<00:03:13.590> pretty<00:03:13.770> funny

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
fierce fail I mean that's pretty funny

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.680 
fierce fail I mean that's pretty funny
but<00:03:14.930> yeah<00:03:15.930> honestly<00:03:16.770> modern<00:03:17.760> warfare<00:03:17.910> 2<00:03:18.090> I'm

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
but yeah honestly modern warfare 2 I'm

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.630 
but yeah honestly modern warfare 2 I'm
just<00:03:18.960> taking<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.230> break<00:03:19.380> and<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:19.860> think<00:03:20.190> having
