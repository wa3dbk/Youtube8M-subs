Pteranodon<00:00:54.570> which<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.379> don't<00:00:55.739> appear<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.190> have

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
Pteranodon which I don't appear to have

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.330 
Pteranodon which I don't appear to have
but<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.300> will<00:00:57.510> look<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:57.870> one<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:59.129> these

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.250 
but I will look for that one so these
are<00:00:59.609> just<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> little<00:01:00.059> small<00:01:00.270> poly<00:01:00.570> bags<00:01:00.809> once

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
promotion which i think is Japanese I'm

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.170 
promotion which i think is Japanese I'm
not<00:01:10.950> really<00:01:11.070> sure<00:01:11.369> anyway<00:01:12.060> let's<00:01:12.390> build<00:01:12.600> these

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
not really sure anyway let's build these

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.179 
not really sure anyway let's build these
well<00:01:15.180> before<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.509> build<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.200> dumped<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
well before I build it I dumped the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.039 
well before I build it I dumped the
contents<00:01:17.369> out<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.390> table<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:18.900> both

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
contents out here on the table for both

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.969 
contents out here on the table for both
sets<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.830> realized<00:01:20.540> that<00:01:21.560> this<00:01:22.560> set<00:01:22.799> came

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
sets and I realized that this set came

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.270 
sets and I realized that this set came
out<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.220> 2004<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.150> wanted<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.479> show<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.750> that

thing with the light grey is the light
bluish<00:01:42.479> grey<00:01:42.780> not<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.259> old<00:01:43.409> light<00:01:43.680> grey<00:01:43.979> so

bluish grey not the old light grey so

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.999 
bluish grey not the old light grey so
this<00:01:44.430> 2004<00:01:45.299> was<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.930> first<00:01:46.200> year<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.590> these

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
this 2004 was the first year of these

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.880 
this 2004 was the first year of these
blueish<00:01:50.009> Gray's<00:01:51.320> also<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.409> reddish<00:01:52.649> Browns

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
blueish Gray's also the reddish Browns

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.810 
blueish Gray's also the reddish Browns
and<00:01:53.509> some<00:01:54.509> other<00:01:54.659> colors<00:01:54.960> changed<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.820> some

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
and some other colors changed but some

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.850 
and some other colors changed but some
sets<00:01:57.090> actually<00:01:57.420> had<00:01:57.840> some<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.500> old<00:01:58.649> grey

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
sets actually had some of the old grey

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.889 
sets actually had some of the old grey
still<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.310> them<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.579> 2004<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.719> try

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
still in them so 2004 you have to try

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.500 
still in them so 2004 you have to try
and<00:02:01.049> check<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.860> these<00:02:01.979> are<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:03.119> new<00:02:03.299> colors

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
and check so these are the new colors

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.330 
and check so these are the new colors
all<00:02:05.510> right<00:02:05.750> here<00:02:06.229> are<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.619> completed

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
all right here are the completed

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.380 
all right here are the completed
dinosaurs<00:02:09.039> Apatosaurus<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.310> I'm<00:02:10.910> guessing

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
dinosaurs Apatosaurus and I'm guessing

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.300 
dinosaurs Apatosaurus and I'm guessing
this<00:02:11.569> is<00:02:11.780> supposed<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.319> be<00:02:12.530> kind<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.160> like<00:02:13.280> a

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
this is supposed to be kind of like a

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.990 
this is supposed to be kind of like a
t-rex<00:02:14.890> got<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.010> big<00:02:16.160> mouth<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.760> get<00:02:16.850> the

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
t-rex got the big mouth to get the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.979 
t-rex got the big mouth to get the
little<00:02:17.209> arms<00:02:17.630> and<00:02:18.790> screen<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.120> got<00:02:20.420> a<00:02:20.450> tail<00:02:20.690> I

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
little arms and screen and got a tail I

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.809 
little arms and screen and got a tail I
don't<00:02:21.319> know<00:02:21.380> that's<00:02:22.130> what<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.370> think<00:02:22.640> what<00:02:22.760> do

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
don't know that's what I think what do

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.190 
don't know that's what I think what do
you<00:02:22.910> think<00:02:23.150> what<00:02:23.270> kind<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.480> dinosaur<00:02:23.930> is<00:02:23.959> it

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
you think what kind of dinosaur is it

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.809 
you think what kind of dinosaur is it
now<00:02:24.380> these<00:02:24.530> are<00:02:24.739> real<00:02:24.950> easy<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.340> build<00:02:25.580> the

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
now these are real easy to build the

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.590 
now these are real easy to build the
real<00:02:26.739> common<00:02:27.739> pieces<00:02:27.980> as<00:02:28.310> well<00:02:28.550> so<00:02:29.000> it<00:02:29.330> can<00:02:29.480> be

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
real common pieces as well so it can be

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.860 
real common pieces as well so it can be
built<00:02:29.810> from<00:02:30.700> pieces<00:02:31.700> that<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:32.030> can<00:02:32.300> readily

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
built from pieces that you can readily

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.960 
built from pieces that you can readily
find<00:02:33.560> today<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:36.800> can<00:02:36.980> find<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.400> instructions

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
find today you can find the instructions

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.990 
find today you can find the instructions
online<00:02:38.180> I'm<00:02:38.600> sure<00:02:39.040> we'll<00:02:40.040> get<00:02:40.459> down<00:02:40.640> here<00:02:40.850> and

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
online I'm sure we'll get down here and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.390 
online I'm sure we'll get down here and
give<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.239> better<00:02:41.420> look<00:02:41.720> at<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.959> dinosaur

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
give you a better look at the dinosaur

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:49.330 
give you a better look at the dinosaur
I'm<00:02:43.400> going<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:43.670> call<00:02:43.820> this<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.510> t-rex<00:02:48.340> but

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
I'm going to call this the t-rex but

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.180 
I'm going to call this the t-rex but
basically<00:02:50.380> it's<00:02:51.380> a<00:02:51.440> lot<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:51.680> common<00:02:51.980> pieces

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
basically it's a lot of common pieces

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.300 
basically it's a lot of common pieces
the<00:02:52.640> slopes<00:02:53.680> probably<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.769> hardest<00:02:55.100> pieces

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
the slopes probably the hardest pieces

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.910 
the slopes probably the hardest pieces
you<00:02:55.700> might<00:02:56.120> find<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.510> get<00:02:56.660> or<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.959> hinge

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
you might find to get or the hinge

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.280 
you might find to get or the hinge
bricks<00:02:59.380> but<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.500> can<00:03:00.650> see<00:03:00.830> there<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:03.230> can

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
bricks but you can see there you can

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.870 
bricks but you can see there you can
almost<00:03:03.470> build<00:03:03.800> it<00:03:03.950> just<00:03:04.160> by<00:03:04.280> looking<00:03:04.670> at<00:03:04.790> it

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
almost build it just by looking at it

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.710 
almost build it just by looking at it
not<00:03:07.880> much<00:03:08.030> to<00:03:08.360> it

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
not much to it

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.420 
not much to it
I<00:03:08.750> think<00:03:09.470> this<00:03:09.620> one<00:03:09.769> actually<00:03:09.799> looks<00:03:10.070> better

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
I think this one actually looks better

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.400 
I think this one actually looks better
and<00:03:10.790> nice<00:03:11.420> but<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:11.660> built<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:12.019> than<00:03:12.140> it<00:03:12.230> did<00:03:12.260> on

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
and nice but I built it than it did on

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.640 
and nice but I built it than it did on
the<00:03:12.560> bag<00:03:12.799> they're<00:03:13.220> just<00:03:14.209> shown<00:03:14.480> oh<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:15.530> know

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
the bag they're just shown oh you know

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.650 
the bag they're just shown oh you know
what's<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.040> same<00:03:16.280> it's<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:16.880> angle<00:03:17.360> they<00:03:17.480> took

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
what's the same it's the angle they took

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.280 
what's the same it's the angle they took
the<00:03:17.810> picture<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:19.180> here<00:03:20.180> is<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:20.450> epitarsis

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
the picture and here is the epitarsis

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.780 
the picture and here is the epitarsis
probably<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.799> hardest<00:03:22.070> pieces<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.489> get<00:03:22.640> or

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
probably the hardest pieces to get or

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.960 
probably the hardest pieces to get or
your<00:03:23.000> little<00:03:23.150> feet<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:25.340> everything's

your little feet that everything's

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.830 
your little feet that everything's
pretty<00:03:26.660> much<00:03:26.780> common<00:03:27.790> and<00:03:28.790> colors<00:03:29.540> that<00:03:29.720> are

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
pretty much common and colors that are

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.900 
pretty much common and colors that are
readily<00:03:30.590> available<00:03:30.769> today<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.519> dark<00:03:31.700> bluish

readily available today the dark bluish
gray<00:03:32.209> I<00:03:33.310> like<00:03:34.310> how<00:03:34.430> he<00:03:34.489> has<00:03:34.760> a<00:03:34.970> trans<00:03:36.340> red<00:03:37.340> eye

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
gray I like how he has a trans red eye

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.620 
gray I like how he has a trans red eye
there

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.620 

and<00:03:42.630> it's<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:42.930> one<00:03:44.180> so<00:03:45.180> there<00:03:45.330> you<00:03:45.420> have<00:03:45.450> it

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
and it's that one so there you have it

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.010 
and it's that one so there you have it

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
one from this series I don't think I

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.510

you<00:04:08.220> like<00:04:08.400> these<00:04:08.520> little<00:04:08.820> poly<00:04:09.030> bags<00:04:09.300> they're

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
you like these little poly bags they're

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.240 
you like these little poly bags they're
relatively<00:04:12.020> common<00:04:13.020> pieces<00:04:13.230> wouldn't<00:04:14.160> pay

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
relatively common pieces wouldn't pay

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.729 
relatively common pieces wouldn't pay
too<00:04:14.310> much<00:04:14.460> for<00:04:14.850> these<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.660> maybe<00:04:15.930> just<00:04:16.470> make

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
too much for these and maybe just make

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.039 
too much for these and maybe just make
