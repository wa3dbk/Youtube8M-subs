00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
you can't really see it from here but uh

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.530 
you can't really see it from here but uh
it<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:18.030> indeed<00:02:18.450> points<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.140> condenser<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:20.190> I

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
it is indeed points and condenser so I

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.740 
it is indeed points and condenser so I
had<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.570> nice<00:02:21.780> fun<00:02:22.110> time<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.739> removing<00:02:23.280> this

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
had a nice fun time of removing this

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.430 
had a nice fun time of removing this
rusted<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:25.230> fly<00:02:25.650> wheel<00:02:25.920> off<00:02:26.190> of<00:02:26.430> there

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
rusted the fly wheel off of there

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.120 
rusted the fly wheel off of there
finally<00:02:28.440> got<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.770> off<00:02:28.920> while<00:02:29.370> wd-40<00:02:30.830> got<00:02:31.830> under

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
finally got it off while wd-40 got under

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.199 
finally got it off while wd-40 got under
there<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:33.020> pretty<00:02:34.020> straightforward<00:02:35.209> there

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
there and pretty straightforward there

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.070 
there and pretty straightforward there
was<00:02:36.330> some<00:02:36.810> oil<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.380> there<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.650> uh<00:02:38.450> next

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
was some oil in there and uh next

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.790 
was some oil in there and uh next
40<00:02:40.830> ohms<00:02:40.980> Brian<00:02:41.520> on<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:42.290> shaft<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.470> get<00:02:43.620> the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
40 ohms Brian on the shaft to get the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.890 
40 ohms Brian on the shaft to get the
flywheel<00:02:44.640> off<00:02:44.820> leaked<00:02:45.150> into<00:02:45.450> there<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:45.810> the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
flywheel off leaked into there so the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.970 
flywheel off leaked into there so the
points<00:02:46.230> were<00:02:46.380> wet<00:02:47.240> dry<00:02:48.240> them<00:02:48.390> all<00:02:48.540> off<00:02:48.920> took<00:02:49.920> a

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
points were wet dry them all off took a

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.700 
points were wet dry them all off took a
little<00:02:50.160> bit<00:02:50.280> sandpaper<00:02:50.850> 2<00:02:51.060> points<00:02:51.560> kind<00:02:52.560> of

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
little bit sandpaper 2 points kind of

car I turn it sucks it in keep turning
it<00:04:01.170> gets<00:04:01.440> to<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.650> compression<00:04:02.040> stroke<00:04:02.550> and

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
it gets to the compression stroke and

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.979 
it gets to the compression stroke and
this<00:04:04.650> little<00:04:04.980> vent<00:04:05.700> hose<00:04:05.970> him<00:04:06.330> she<00:04:06.630> can<00:04:06.870> at

white<00:04:09.810> cloud<00:04:10.350> comes<00:04:10.680> out<00:04:10.860> of<00:04:11.010> it<00:04:11.100> on<00:04:11.570> what

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
white cloud comes out of it on what

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.479 
white cloud comes out of it on what
would<00:04:12.720> be<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:12.959> compression<00:04:13.500> stroke<00:04:13.800> well

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
would be the compression stroke well

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.940 
would be the compression stroke well
okay<00:04:14.910> one<00:04:15.750> of<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.930> vowels<00:04:16.320> is<00:04:16.440> stuck<00:04:16.739> open

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
okay one of the vowels is stuck open

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.750 
okay one of the vowels is stuck open
then<00:04:17.480> alright<00:04:18.480> sure<00:04:18.870> enough<00:04:19.549> don't<00:04:20.549> get<00:04:20.640> the

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
uh little calf there to get to the valve

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.880 
uh little calf there to get to the valve
springs<00:04:28.530> and<00:04:28.890> that<00:04:30.230> you<00:04:31.230> can<00:04:31.410> see<00:04:31.590> one<00:04:31.740> of<00:04:31.830> the

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
springs and that you can see one of the

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.980 
springs and that you can see one of the
valves<00:04:32.100> being<00:04:32.580> held<00:04:32.880> forward<00:04:33.450> the<00:04:33.660> exhaust

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
valves being held forward the exhaust

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.610 
valves being held forward the exhaust
valve<00:04:34.320> okay<00:04:35.300> alright<00:04:36.300> take<00:04:36.720> a<00:04:36.750> little<00:04:36.960> about

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
valve okay alright take a little about

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.490 
valve okay alright take a little about
the<00:04:37.830> shroud<00:04:38.160> out<00:04:38.430> of<00:04:38.580> the<00:04:38.640> way<00:04:38.790> here<00:04:39.380> get<00:04:40.380> the

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
the shroud out of the way here get the

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.909 
the shroud out of the way here get the
head<00:04:40.680> off

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
head off

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.890 
head off
sure<00:04:41.580> enough<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:43.580> preston<00:04:44.580> valve<00:04:45.000> seat

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
sure enough the preston valve seat

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.890 
sure enough the preston valve seat
for<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.740> exhaust<00:04:47.250> valve<00:04:47.580> had<00:04:47.910> become<00:04:48.270> unrest

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
for the exhaust valve had become unrest

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.640 
for the exhaust valve had become unrest
and<00:04:50.450> was<00:04:51.450> this<00:04:51.570> kind<00:04:51.750> of<00:04:51.870> flapping<00:04:52.140> around<00:04:52.380> in

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
and was this kind of flapping around in

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.440 
and was this kind of flapping around in
there<00:04:52.860> and<00:04:52.950> the<00:04:53.040> valve<00:04:53.250> went<00:04:53.550> to<00:04:53.670> shut<00:04:53.970> and<00:04:54.240> not

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
there and the valve went to shut and not

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.170 
there and the valve went to shut and not
kind<00:04:55.200> of<00:04:55.350> caught<00:04:55.740> it<00:04:55.890> sideways<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:56.700> belt<00:04:56.880> seat

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
kind of caught it sideways the belt seat

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.780 
kind of caught it sideways the belt seat
that<00:04:57.390> is<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:58.590> it's<00:04:58.770> holding<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.130> valve<00:04:59.310> open

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
that is and it's holding the valve open

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.390 
that is and it's holding the valve open
about<00:05:00.000> I<00:05:00.270> don't<00:05:00.570> know<00:05:00.660> eighth<00:05:00.930> of<00:05:01.110> an<00:05:01.200> inch<00:05:01.400> so

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
about I don't know eighth of an inch so

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.170 
about I don't know eighth of an inch so
my<00:05:03.000> solution<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.840> this<00:05:04.020> was<00:05:04.350> to<00:05:04.970> hold<00:05:05.970> the

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
my solution to this was to hold the

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.030 
my solution to this was to hold the
valve<00:05:06.390> forward<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:07.080> screwdriver

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
valve forward the screwdriver

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.640 
valve forward the screwdriver
grab<00:05:08.700> the<00:05:08.850> little<00:05:08.970> valve<00:05:09.270> seat<00:05:09.630> this<00:05:10.380> is<00:05:10.470> kind

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
grab the little valve seat this is kind

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.230 
grab the little valve seat this is kind
of<00:05:10.710> you<00:05:10.800> know<00:05:10.920> set<00:05:11.460> it<00:05:11.490> back<00:05:11.730> in<00:05:11.910> there

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
of you know set it back in there

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.180 
of you know set it back in there
let<00:05:12.420> the<00:05:12.570> valves<00:05:12.900> slap<00:05:13.230> back<00:05:13.470> onto<00:05:13.770> it<00:05:14.010> and

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
let the valves slap back onto it and

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.030 
let the valves slap back onto it and
