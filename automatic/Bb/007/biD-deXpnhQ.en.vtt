00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
that's what you got to do something

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.300 
that's what you got to do something
about<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:15.410> consider<00:00:16.410> myself<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.770> intermediate

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
about I consider myself the intermediate

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.189 
about I consider myself the intermediate
level<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.789> even<00:00:18.539> for<00:00:18.720> me<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:18.960> was<00:00:19.050> pretty

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
level and even for me it was pretty

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.290 
level and even for me it was pretty
challenging<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:20.070> even<00:00:20.730> if<00:00:20.880> someone<00:00:21.180> is

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
challenging so even if someone is

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.060 
challenging so even if someone is
advanced<00:00:21.960> level<00:00:22.289> it's<00:00:22.560> pretty<00:00:22.800> challenging

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
advanced level it's pretty challenging

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.130 
advanced level it's pretty challenging
for<00:00:23.369> them<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.820> stuff<00:00:24.029> especially<00:00:24.210> such<00:00:24.900> time

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
for them and stuff especially such time

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.109 
for them and stuff especially such time
interval<00:00:25.590> so<00:00:25.800> like<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.189> rest<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.640> little<00:00:26.789> and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
interval so like you rest a little and

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.630 
interval so like you rest a little and
then<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.720> workout<00:00:28.260> intensely<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.490> it

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
then you workout intensely so it

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.519
