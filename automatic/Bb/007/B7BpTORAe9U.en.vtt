I'm<00:00:23.789> thinking<00:00:24.029> about<00:00:24.269> while<00:00:24.750> riding<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.320> steep

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
I'm thinking about while riding in steep

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.040 
I'm thinking about while riding in steep
powder<00:00:25.830> which<00:00:26.490> really<00:00:26.880> keep<00:00:27.090> me<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.420> control

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
powder which really keep me in control

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.009 
powder which really keep me in control
and<00:00:28.320> balance<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:29.130> my<00:00:29.160> snowboard<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.019> first

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
and balance on my snowboard the first

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.990 
and balance on my snowboard the first
thing<00:00:31.230> I'm<00:00:31.349> thinking<00:00:31.410> about<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.099> my<00:00:32.399> back<00:00:32.700> foot

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
thing I'm thinking about is my back foot

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.630 
thing I'm thinking about is my back foot
so<00:00:33.809> every<00:00:34.200> time<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.469> finish<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:35.010> turn<00:00:35.340> I'm

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
so every time I finish a turn I'm

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.150 
so every time I finish a turn I'm
putting<00:00:36.270> pressure<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.780> my<00:00:37.020> back<00:00:37.230> foot<00:00:37.559> to

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
putting pressure on my back foot to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.729 
putting pressure on my back foot to
control<00:00:38.579> my<00:00:38.700> speeds<00:00:39.059> being<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.079> control<00:00:40.530> is

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
control my speeds being in control is

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.580 
control my speeds being in control is
crucial<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.670> steep<00:00:42.030> run<00:00:42.300> like<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.500> I'm

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
crucial on a steep run like this so I'm

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.709 
crucial on a steep run like this so I'm
really<00:00:43.860> focused<00:00:44.460> on<00:00:44.610> pressuring<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.480> back

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719

each time I make a turn from the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.189 
each time I make a turn from the
pressure<00:00:54.539> I'm<00:00:54.870> putting<00:00:54.899> on<00:00:55.350> my<00:00:55.469> back<00:00:55.680> foot
