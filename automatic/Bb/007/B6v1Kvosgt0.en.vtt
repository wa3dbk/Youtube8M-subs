00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.700
 and so pro nobis lindos today 's video is 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.979
 request a written begging 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.809
 explain the mode domain where lol then 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.190
 I thought it was cool, I did not see any projects 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.530
 video really explaining the goal 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.809
 that way in Portuguese at least 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.370
 although it's nothing complicated about you 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.830
 I understood the way to beginners. 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.110
 to play badly would be cool and how it grows 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.020
 more and more in conservative brazil 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.390
 I think a good good video domain is 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.220
 the second official game mode I do not care 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.200
 of legends and when I say way I 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.480
 I mean objectives to cover 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.190
 existed at that time but it was something 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.199
 according to the players and not 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.210
 a mode where even though you 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.730
 want you can not buy an item or 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.289
 hold on base so it was not official 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.659
 the game arrived at about the beginning of 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.550
 year at the end of aciso 1 at the beginning 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.140
 session 2 and completely changed the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.359
 perception connecting fillet people by 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.519
 less for me was a new map and beyond 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.769
 it with new goals that are summarized 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.569
 capture the control points of the 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.089
 map which are five in total 

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:02.010
 defend the dominated points perform 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.569
 missions involving stealing 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.760
 already dominated by the 

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:09.000
 enemy and finally will be the life of the nexus 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.490
 enemy in theory this seems simple but 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.840
 It's not that simple. 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.600
 there are many differences in 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.730
 the firm sun in this mode does not 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.430
 it's the focus and yes you get stronger 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.230
 attacking and defending by capturing or 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.690
 protecting the points the more points 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.670
 captured are more than the enemy 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.740
 plus the life of his attachment will end 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.030
 descending troops only appears in the game at 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.190
 from the moment you capture a 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.060
 point and it will only come out of the 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.460
 captured 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.020
 the map has several points several points 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.330
 even talking about points but yes they are 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.730
 several points on the map that differ from the 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.220
 normal map this map the domain it has 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.700
 several points also that recover the hp 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.500
 emana are more wines of life is 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.880
 besides they also jumped that 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.950
 ensures speed of movement by 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.690
 some moments are three in total is 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.040
 making the game even more dynamic and 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.440
 you do not have to go back to 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.330
 the basis to ensure you do not need 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.400
 buy items because you have the 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.120
 speedy buddhism on the map and so it's cool 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.070
 too much 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.360
 beyond these points in the middle of the map 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.969
 There is an altar with shells 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.249
 storm one for each team that besides 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:12.689
 a shield that recovers 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:13.860
 if you stay ten seconds and it has to be 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.900
 wholesale it 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.880
 has given extra every four seconds 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.040
 in your basic attacks it 's kind of a thunderbolt 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.600
 that leaves its passive attacks 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.790
 The blitz is very similar. 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.470
 so you 've been the one more this defense 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.080
 you start the game already on level 3 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.480
 different from conventional mode with 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.060
 more gold and earns it passively a lot 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.070
 faster and also the return on base is 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.650
 much faster than ordinary 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.450
 various items in the game are unique and 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.770
 are only present in this mode some 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.540
 similar with the map of his wife 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.490
 judith but still with some 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.920
 particularities that make them 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.380
 specifically for that mode and the 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.820
 game very bloody even summarizing the 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.650
 domain is a much more 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.540
 aggressive what counts is your ability 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.310
 to move faster 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.380
 possible and still be able to 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.209
 fight and defend your points until 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.160
 Related enemy fall I hope I have helped 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.380
 A little there, whoever is new to the game is 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.239
 To understand this way I hope that you 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.640
 play it to have a bigger idea still 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.239
 and until the next video a kiss on the butt 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.239
 yours
