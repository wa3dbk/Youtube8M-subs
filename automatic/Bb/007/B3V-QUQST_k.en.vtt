it's it's progressive it's only gotten
worse<00:03:51.040> over<00:03:51.489> time<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:56.250> his<00:03:57.250> muscles<00:03:57.760> in<00:03:58.030> his

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
worse over time and his muscles in his

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.159 
worse over time and his muscles in his
back<00:03:58.660> and<00:03:59.019> a<00:03:59.109> stomach<00:03:59.620> and<00:03:59.859> his<00:04:00.099> legs<00:04:00.579> are<00:04:00.970> very

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
back and a stomach and his legs are very

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.770 
back and a stomach and his legs are very
weak<00:04:02.519> because<00:04:03.519> he's<00:04:03.730> been<00:04:03.909> in<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.090> chair<00:04:04.389> for

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
weak because he's been in a chair for

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.470 
weak because he's been in a chair for
six<00:04:05.109> years<00:04:05.470> so<00:04:05.829> I<00:04:06.099> wouldn't<00:04:06.819> say<00:04:07.000> they're<00:04:07.209> gone

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
six years so I wouldn't say they're gone

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.869 
six years so I wouldn't say they're gone
I<00:04:07.930> would<00:04:08.199> just<00:04:08.230> say<00:04:08.470> they've<00:04:08.879> deteriorated

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
I would just say they've deteriorated

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.670 
I would just say they've deteriorated
some<00:04:10.239> and<00:04:10.569> can<00:04:11.349> be<00:04:11.530> built<00:04:11.799> back<00:04:12.280> up<00:04:13.470> it's<00:04:14.470> just

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
some and can be built back up it's just

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.439 
some and can be built back up it's just
very<00:04:14.829> difficult<00:04:14.980> because<00:04:15.879> there's<00:04:16.269> no

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
very difficult because there's no

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:32.279 
very difficult because there's no
control<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:20.530> we're<00:04:21.190> hoping<00:04:21.639> that<00:04:22.800> this<00:04:23.800> helps

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.349
