00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.860 

sometimes<00:00:10.730> there's<00:00:10.910> a<00:00:10.940> wake-up<00:00:11.240> call<00:00:11.540> and

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
sometimes there's a wake-up call and

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:12.880 
sometimes there's a wake-up call and
there<00:00:11.990> are<00:00:12.080> other<00:00:12.200> times<00:00:12.410> where<00:00:12.680> the<00:00:12.740> time

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:12.890 
there are other times where the time

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.440 
there are other times where the time
like<00:00:13.040> the<00:00:13.190> end<00:00:13.340> early<00:00:13.550> life<00:00:13.730> but<00:00:13.940> life<00:00:14.210> isn't

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
like the end early life but life isn't

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.070 
like the end early life but life isn't
happening<00:00:15.020> right<00:00:15.320> so<00:00:16.250> you're<00:00:17.210> in<00:00:17.360> it<00:00:17.570> I<00:00:17.810> mean

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
happening right so you're in it I mean

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.130 
happening right so you're in it I mean
very<00:00:18.410> definitely<00:00:19.279> happen<00:00:19.700> you<00:00:20.390> know<00:00:20.540> and<00:00:20.570> then

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
very definitely happen you know and then

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.400 
very definitely happen you know and then
of<00:00:21.440> course<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:21.920> end<00:00:22.100> is<00:00:22.310> the<00:00:22.790> unknown<00:00:23.090> so<00:00:24.080> so<00:00:24.380> I

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
of course the end is the unknown so so I

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.590 
of course the end is the unknown so so I
mean<00:00:24.770> I<00:00:24.860> think<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:25.490> regeneration<00:00:26.120> is<00:00:26.420> that

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
mean I think the regeneration is that

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.590 
mean I think the regeneration is that
that<00:00:26.960> hole<00:00:27.260> actually<00:00:28.220> there<00:00:29.000> is<00:00:29.120> another<00:00:29.360> life

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
that hole actually there is another life

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.650 
that hole actually there is another life
right<00:00:30.550> so<00:00:31.550> I<00:00:31.580> think<00:00:31.760> that<00:00:32.029> in<00:00:32.180> the<00:00:32.300> end<00:00:32.450> it's

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
right so I think that in the end it's

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.660 
right so I think that in the end it's
like<00:00:33.520> you<00:00:34.520> know<00:00:34.640> there's<00:00:35.239> a<00:00:35.360> clear<00:00:35.600> balance<00:00:36.670> to

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
like you know there's a clear balance to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.290 
like you know there's a clear balance to
the<00:00:37.790> whole<00:00:38.949> puzzle<00:00:39.949> of<00:00:40.190> existence<00:00:40.760> it's<00:00:41.090> not

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
the whole puzzle of existence it's not

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.020 
the whole puzzle of existence it's not
just<00:00:41.600> by<00:00:41.989> happenstance<00:00:42.640> these<00:00:43.640> all<00:00:43.879> the

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
just by happenstance these all the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.600 
just by happenstance these all the
questions<00:00:44.420> that<00:00:44.480> you<00:00:44.629> ask<00:00:45.050> we<00:00:45.260> have<00:00:45.440> to<00:00:45.680> you're

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
questions that you ask we have to you're

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.250 
questions that you ask we have to you're
pulled<00:00:46.850> in<00:00:47.030> even<00:00:47.239> if<00:00:47.449> you're<00:00:47.600> not<00:00:47.690> aware<00:00:47.989> of<00:00:48.050> it

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
pulled in even if you're not aware of it

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.969 
pulled in even if you're not aware of it
you're<00:00:48.800> in<00:00:49.040> you're<00:00:49.489> involved<00:00:50.739> because<00:00:51.739> there

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:51.979 
you're in you're involved because there

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:53.479 
was a period where the work that it was

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:56.740 
was a period where the work that it was
more<00:00:53.839> about<00:00:53.930> facility<00:00:54.559> and<00:00:55.390> that<00:00:56.390> was<00:00:56.600> the

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
more about facility and that was the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.570 
more about facility and that was the
period<00:00:57.620> from<00:00:58.180> 1974<00:00:59.180> to<00:00:59.600> 83<00:01:00.409> and<00:01:00.650> these<00:01:01.370> that

easy and number eight represents that

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.969 
easy and number eight represents that
you<00:01:10.370> know<00:01:10.549> like<00:01:10.700> a<00:01:11.350> realization<00:01:12.350> yeah<00:01:12.560> you

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
you know like a realization yeah you

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
sort of has what I call over this which

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.779 
sort of has what I call over this which
is<00:01:17.979> unexplained<00:01:18.979> things<00:01:19.009> you<00:01:19.430> think<00:01:19.610> that<00:01:19.700> you

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
is unexplained things you think that you

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.580 
is unexplained things you think that you
can't<00:01:20.000> necessarily<00:01:20.180> what<00:01:20.840> it<00:01:20.930> is<00:01:21.049> what<00:01:21.350> it<00:01:21.469> is

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
can't necessarily what it is what it is

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.980 
can't necessarily what it is what it is
is<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.829> lot<00:01:21.979> you<00:01:22.340> know<00:01:22.460> it's<00:01:23.030> not<00:01:23.180> about<00:01:23.329> a<00:01:23.630> five

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
is a lot you know it's not about a five

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.090 
is a lot you know it's not about a five
surface<00:01:24.409> it's<00:01:24.560> about<00:01:24.710> something<00:01:25.100> that's

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
surface it's about something that's

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.219 
surface it's about something that's
breathes<00:01:28.100> you<00:01:28.460> know<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:28.850> my<00:01:29.539> god

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
breathes you know and my god

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.029 
breathes you know and my god
you<00:01:31.130> know<00:01:31.250> nobody<00:01:31.670> we<00:01:32.240> got<00:01:32.390> number<00:01:33.039> fourteen

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
you know nobody we got number fourteen

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.429 
you know nobody we got number fourteen
and<00:01:34.579> then<00:01:35.180> number<00:01:35.450> forty-three<00:01:36.079> those<00:01:36.259> are

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
and then number forty-three those are

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.560 
and then number forty-three those are
probably<00:01:36.619> three<00:01:37.149> there<00:01:38.149> have<00:01:38.270> been<00:01:38.329> other

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
probably three there have been other

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.999 
probably three there have been other
important<00:01:39.079> works<00:01:39.229> but<00:01:39.469> those<00:01:39.590> are<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:39.799> three

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
important works but those are the three

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.609 
important works but those are the three
that<00:01:40.159> actually<00:01:40.549> come<00:01:40.759> together<00:01:40.909> and<00:01:41.469> you<00:01:42.469> can

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
that actually come together and you can

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.349 
that actually come together and you can
see<00:01:42.829> it<00:01:42.979> you<00:01:43.369> look<00:01:43.520> at<00:01:43.609> number<00:01:43.909> eight<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:44.270> you

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:44.359 
see it you look at number eight and you

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:45.880 
see it you look at number eight and you
look<00:01:44.509> at<00:01:44.630> number<00:01:44.869> 14<00:01:45.200> which<00:01:45.320> is<00:01:45.380> a<00:01:45.500> rusted

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
look at number 14 which is a rusted

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.010 
look at number 14 which is a rusted
piece<00:01:45.920> and<00:01:46.759> you<00:01:46.939> look<00:01:47.060> at<00:01:47.149> number<00:01:47.359> 43<00:01:47.630> is<00:01:47.810> that

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
piece and you look at number 43 is that

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.959 
piece and you look at number 43 is that
40<00:01:48.500> view<00:01:48.649> is<00:01:48.710> a<00:01:48.770> combination<00:01:49.369> of<00:01:49.460> those<00:01:49.609> of

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
40 view is a combination of those of

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:52.419 
40 view is a combination of those of
memory<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:50.600> number<00:01:50.840> 14<00:01:51.229> it's<00:01:51.770> pretty<00:01:51.950> obvious

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
memory and number 14 it's pretty obvious

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.429 
memory and number 14 it's pretty obvious
obviously<00:01:53.299> I<00:01:53.539> think<00:01:53.689> they're<00:01:53.929> not<00:01:54.079> as<00:01:54.170> I<00:01:54.259> say

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
obviously I think they're not as I say

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.830 
obviously I think they're not as I say
you<00:01:54.499> will<00:01:54.649> pick<00:01:54.829> up<00:01:54.950> my<00:01:55.100> Wacom<00:01:55.789> the<00:01:56.509> idea<00:01:56.719> of

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
you will pick up my Wacom the idea of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.419 
you will pick up my Wacom the idea of
decay<00:01:57.109> you<00:01:58.479> know<00:01:59.479> birth<00:01:59.899> life<00:02:00.320> death<00:02:00.710> and

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
decay you know birth life death and

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:02.870 
decay you know birth life death and
regeneration

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
regeneration

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.980 
regeneration
Korpela<00:02:03.720> bet<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.080> pretty<00:02:04.710> much<00:02:04.970> about<00:02:05.990> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
Korpela bet is pretty much about the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.669 
Korpela bet is pretty much about the
first<00:02:07.950> two<00:02:08.220> but<00:02:08.880> it<00:02:09.000> absolutely<00:02:09.440> states<00:02:10.440> that

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
first two but it absolutely states that

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.240 
first two but it absolutely states that
in<00:02:10.890> number<00:02:11.009> twenty-three<00:02:12.770> make<00:02:13.770> these<00:02:14.010> works

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
in number twenty-three make these works

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.620 
in number twenty-three make these works
that<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.580> can't<00:02:14.790> get<00:02:14.910> out<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.030> your<00:02:15.120> house<00:02:15.360> and

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
slightly you have a puzzle put them

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.130 
slightly you have a puzzle put them
together<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:17.940> like<00:02:18.150> okay<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.750> know<00:02:18.870> we<00:02:18.990> only

together so like okay you know we only

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.390 
together so like okay you know we only
make<00:02:19.320> that<00:02:19.410> mistake<00:02:19.470> once<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.130> think

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
make that mistake once and think

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.710 
make that mistake once and think
something<00:02:20.700> too<00:02:20.820> big<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.150> get<00:02:21.240> out<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> door

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
something too big to get out the door

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.690 
something too big to get out the door
and<00:02:22.320> then<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.620> say<00:02:22.860> like<00:02:23.010> okay<00:02:23.280> I'm<00:02:23.370> gonna<00:02:23.490> get

and then you say like okay I'm gonna get

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.160 
and then you say like okay I'm gonna get
smart<00:02:23.940> says<00:02:24.270> it's<00:02:24.480> break<00:02:24.900> about<00:02:25.050> me

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170

together and it's perfect - yeah it got

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.820 
together and it's perfect - yeah it got
really<00:02:29.940> good<00:02:30.150> at<00:02:30.209> data<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.650> point

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
really good at data and to the point

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.000 
really good at data and to the point
where<00:02:32.070> now<00:02:32.340> when<00:02:33.300> i<00:02:33.470> dismantle<00:02:34.470> works<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.860> lot

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
where now when i dismantle works a lot

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.729 
where now when i dismantle works a lot
of<00:02:35.100> times<00:02:35.310> because<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.840> shakes<00:02:37.440> could<00:02:37.650> be

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
of times because the the shakes could be

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.850 
of times because the the shakes could be
on<00:02:37.890> 24<00:02:38.370> by<00:02:38.459> 24<00:02:38.520> plates<00:02:39.380> though<00:02:40.380> they<00:02:40.680> can<00:02:40.830> be

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
on 24 by 24 plates though they can be

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.340 
on 24 by 24 plates though they can be
mixed<00:02:41.489> very<00:02:41.850> easily<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.570> know<00:02:42.690> into<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.110> next

mixed very easily you know into the next

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.000 
mixed very easily you know into the next
piece<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.610> it's<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:44.970> very<00:02:45.209> idea<00:02:45.570> of

otherwise it would be this brooding
person<00:04:55.140> and<00:04:55.290> I<00:04:55.350> mean<00:04:55.590> so<00:04:55.860> like<00:04:56.100> you<00:04:56.250> just<00:04:56.280> let

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
know so I think that realized for the

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.030 
know so I think that realized for the
worse<00:05:02.010> but<00:05:02.820> in<00:05:03.450> the<00:05:03.570> end<00:05:03.750> though<00:05:04.020> if<00:05:04.320> it<00:05:04.740> as<00:05:04.890> it

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
worse but in the end though if it as it

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.370 
worse but in the end though if it as it
filters<00:05:05.280> through<00:05:05.460> me<00:05:05.850> it<00:05:06.120> does<00:05:06.390> become<00:05:06.900> a<00:05:07.110> part

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
filters through me it does become a part

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.620 
filters through me it does become a part
of<00:05:07.440> something
