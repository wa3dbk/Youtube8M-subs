off<00:02:00.890> look<00:02:01.100> at<00:02:01.159> this<00:02:01.280> nice<00:02:01.520> cluster<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:02.180> stone<00:02:02.420> I

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
off look at this nice cluster of stone I

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.149 
off look at this nice cluster of stone I
mean<00:02:02.750> we've<00:02:03.229> placed<00:02:03.500> them<00:02:03.680> with<00:02:03.799> composition

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
mean we've placed them with composition

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.250 
mean we've placed them with composition
we've<00:02:04.520> did<00:02:04.790> three<00:02:05.060> pieces<00:02:05.330> right<00:02:05.600> here<00:02:05.659> and

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
we've did three pieces right here and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.210 
we've did three pieces right here and
then<00:02:06.350> we<00:02:06.409> have<00:02:06.560> this<00:02:06.650> approach<00:02:06.950> where<00:02:07.130> you'll

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
then we have this approach where you'll

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.280 
then we have this approach where you'll
be<00:02:07.310> able<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.490> walk<00:02:07.670> up<00:02:07.909> and<00:02:08.090> just<00:02:08.149> be<00:02:08.989> at<00:02:09.110> one

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
be able to walk up and just be at one

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.900 
be able to walk up and just be at one
with<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.500> fish<00:02:09.709> you<00:02:10.070> could<00:02:10.190> sit<00:02:10.399> on<00:02:10.429> this<00:02:10.640> rock

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
with the fish you could sit on this rock

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.670 
with the fish you could sit on this rock
put<00:02:11.450> your<00:02:11.570> feet<00:02:11.720> in<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.870> pond<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:12.560> we're

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
put your feet in the pond so we're

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.910 
put your feet in the pond so we're
making<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:12.980> pond<00:02:13.130> very<00:02:13.400> approachable<00:02:14.769> if<00:02:15.769> you

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
making the pond very approachable if you

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.020 
making the pond very approachable if you
look<00:02:16.070> down<00:02:16.250> on<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.430> bottom<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.790> pond<00:02:16.970> I'm

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
look down on the bottom of the pond I'm

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.250 
look down on the bottom of the pond I'm
going<00:02:17.150> to<00:02:17.209> climb<00:02:17.360> down<00:02:17.600> in<00:02:17.750> here<00:02:17.840> you<00:02:17.959> can<00:02:18.080> see

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
going to climb down in here you can see

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.289 
going to climb down in here you can see
how<00:02:18.380> much<00:02:18.470> deeper<00:02:18.860> we<00:02:18.980> made<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.459> I'll<00:02:20.120> be

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
how much deeper we made it and I'll be

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.420 
how much deeper we made it and I'll be
able<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.510> show<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.900> fish<00:02:21.110> tunnel<00:02:21.440> as<00:02:22.190> it's

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
able to show you the fish tunnel as it's

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.630 
able to show you the fish tunnel as it's
being<00:02:22.579> integrated<00:02:23.000> into<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.420> shelf<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:27.640> see

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
being integrated into the shelf you see

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.120 
being integrated into the shelf you see
this<00:02:28.760> white<00:02:28.970> pipe<00:02:29.209> right<00:02:29.450> here<00:02:29.480> this<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.470> 12

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
this white pipe right here this is a 12

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.089 
this white pipe right here this is a 12
inch<00:02:31.340> tunnel<00:02:31.850> and<00:02:32.060> so<00:02:32.540> you<00:02:33.080> saw<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.920> large

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
inch tunnel and so you saw the large

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.260 
inch tunnel and so you saw the large
fish<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.489> we<00:02:34.580> had<00:02:34.730> in<00:02:34.819> here<00:02:34.910> we'll<00:02:35.060> be<00:02:35.150> able

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
fish that we had in here we'll be able

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.520 
fish that we had in here we'll be able
to<00:02:35.390> get<00:02:35.630> into<00:02:35.750> this<00:02:35.930> tunnel<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.410> evade

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
to get into this tunnel and evade

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.420 
to get into this tunnel and evade
predators

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
predators

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.240 
predators
now<00:02:37.519> we've<00:02:37.670> already<00:02:37.849> made<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:39.010> easier<00:02:40.010> for<00:02:40.189> the

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
now we've already made it easier for the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.459 
now we've already made it easier for the
fish<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.579> evade<00:02:40.849> predators<00:02:41.060> by<00:02:41.390> creating<00:02:42.379> a

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:42.469 
fish to evade predators by creating a

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:44.289 
fish to evade predators by creating a
greater<00:02:42.769> depth<00:02:43.129> but<00:02:43.670> we've<00:02:43.790> also<00:02:44.000> created

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
greater depth but we've also created

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.449 
greater depth but we've also created
this<00:02:44.599> fish<00:02:44.840> tunnel<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.379> when<00:02:45.859> we're<00:02:46.040> done<00:02:46.250> you

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
this fish tunnel and when we're done you

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.099 
this fish tunnel and when we're done you
won't<00:02:46.640> see<00:02:46.909> it<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:47.659> still<00:02:47.870> have<00:02:47.989> this

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
won't see it and you still have this

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.009 
won't see it and you still have this
huge<00:02:48.439> deep<00:02:48.680> end<00:02:48.890> right<00:02:49.099> here<00:02:49.310> so<00:02:49.879> that's<00:02:50.840> an

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
huge deep end right here so that's an

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.240 
huge deep end right here so that's an
exciting<00:02:51.439> feature<00:02:53.650> hey<00:02:54.650> I'm<00:02:54.739> glad<00:02:54.950> we<00:02:55.099> caught

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
exciting feature hey I'm glad we caught

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:56.530 
exciting feature hey I'm glad we caught
them<00:02:55.370> at<00:02:55.489> this<00:02:55.639> stage<00:02:55.849> of<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.120> game<00:02:56.150> here

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
them at this stage of the game here

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.819 
them at this stage of the game here
today<00:02:56.689> because<00:02:57.049> what<00:02:57.260> they're<00:02:57.379> doing<00:02:57.409> right

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
today because what they're doing right

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.559 
today because what they're doing right
now<00:02:57.859> is<00:02:58.129> they're<00:02:58.219> trenching<00:02:58.760> behind<00:02:59.450> the

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
now is they're trenching behind the

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.330 
now is they're trenching behind the
waterfall<00:03:00.049> so<00:03:00.079> we<00:03:00.319> can<00:03:00.469> inject<00:03:00.739> air<00:03:01.010> into<00:03:01.040> this

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
waterfall so we can inject air into this

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.949 
waterfall so we can inject air into this
when<00:03:01.489> we<00:03:01.579> clean<00:03:01.819> it<00:03:01.969> now<00:03:02.299> as<00:03:02.480> I<00:03:02.569> said<00:03:02.780> we're

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
when we clean it now as I said we're

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.869 
when we clean it now as I said we're
using<00:03:03.139> new<00:03:03.349> technology<00:03:03.950> here<00:03:04.159> we<00:03:04.489> have<00:03:04.609> a<00:03:04.639> back

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
using new technology here we have a back

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.940 
using new technology here we have a back
flushable<00:03:05.269> system<00:03:05.780> here<00:03:06.049> where<00:03:06.409> we<00:03:06.560> can<00:03:06.709> we

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
flushable system here where we can we

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.619 
flushable system here where we can we
can<00:03:07.099> take<00:03:07.280> water<00:03:07.549> from<00:03:07.819> the<00:03:07.909> pond<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.359> dump<00:03:08.540> it

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
can take water from the pond and dump it

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.390 
can take water from the pond and dump it
into<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.930> top<00:03:09.170> of<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.379> filter<00:03:09.590> as<00:03:09.919> it's

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
into the top of the filter as it's

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.009 
into the top of the filter as it's
draining<00:03:10.849> out<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.180> bottom<00:03:11.510> of<00:03:11.569> it<00:03:11.689> during<00:03:11.930> the

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
draining out the bottom of it during the

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.750 
draining out the bottom of it during the
cleaning<00:03:12.230> process<00:03:12.400> but<00:03:13.400> what<00:03:13.519> we're<00:03:13.609> going<00:03:13.639> to

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
cleaning process but what we're going to

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.369 
cleaning process but what we're going to
do<00:03:13.909> is<00:03:14.030> we're<00:03:14.150> going<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.299> inject<00:03:14.689> air<00:03:14.989> into

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
do is we're going to inject air into

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.159 
do is we're going to inject air into
this<00:03:15.530> filter<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:16.220> it<00:03:17.120> gets<00:03:17.299> this<00:03:17.450> air<00:03:17.720> boiling

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:18.169 
this filter and it gets this air boiling

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.170 
this filter and it gets this air boiling
effect<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:18.650> what<00:03:18.739> it<00:03:18.829> does<00:03:18.950> is<00:03:19.099> dislodge<00:03:19.939> is

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
effect and what it does is dislodge is

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.699 
effect and what it does is dislodge is
all<00:03:20.329> the<00:03:20.540> sediment<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.049> debris<00:03:21.200> that<00:03:21.379> this

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
all the sediment and debris that this

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.559 
all the sediment and debris that this
filter<00:03:21.950> is<00:03:22.129> collected<00:03:22.669> and<00:03:22.819> then<00:03:23.329> when<00:03:23.480> we

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
filter is collected and then when we

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.599 
filter is collected and then when we
back<00:03:23.810> flush<00:03:24.109> through<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.409> top<00:03:24.620> down<00:03:24.919> it<00:03:25.250> helps

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
back flush through the top down it helps

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.159 
back flush through the top down it helps
assist<00:03:26.060> it<00:03:26.239> so<00:03:26.389> the<00:03:26.480> air<00:03:26.599> boil<00:03:26.900> is<00:03:27.019> what

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.169 
assist it so the air boil is what

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:28.839 
assist it so the air boil is what
they're<00:03:27.319> installing<00:03:27.680> right<00:03:27.950> now<00:03:28.129> through<00:03:28.730> the

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
they're installing right now through the
