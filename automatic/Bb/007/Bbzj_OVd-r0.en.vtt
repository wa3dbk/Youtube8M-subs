It has a capsule with 1" dual diaphragm

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000

and transparent sound

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.500
and perfectly reproduces the harmonics
of the audio signal.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000

throughout the range

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.500

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.500

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.500
with low-frequency filter
and input attenuation.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000

instruments recording.
