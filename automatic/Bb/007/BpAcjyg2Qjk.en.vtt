00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.760 
made my liner my first large templates
and<00:02:03.210> much<00:02:03.329> longer<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.840> made<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.350> be<00:02:04.560> sure<00:02:04.740> to

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
and much longer I made that be sure to

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.789 
and much longer I made that be sure to
add<00:02:05.070> some<00:02:05.520> extra<00:02:05.909> length<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:07.229> ends

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
add some extra length on the ends

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.850 
add some extra length on the ends
because<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.700> wanted<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.420> actually<00:02:09.599> wrap<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.379> so

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
because I wanted to actually wrap it so

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.869 
because I wanted to actually wrap it so

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
you on this one the paper is actually

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.170 
you on this one the paper is actually
not<00:02:18.810> stuck<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.980> cup<00:02:20.160> itself<00:02:20.580> we're<00:02:21.030> gonna

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
not stuck to the cup itself we're gonna

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.680 
not stuck to the cup itself we're gonna
stick<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.780> paper<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.140> itself<00:02:22.880> like<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:23.910> so

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
stick the paper to itself like that so

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.600 
stick the paper to itself like that so
it'll<00:02:24.810> just<00:02:24.870> slide<00:02:25.320> on<00:02:25.350> and<00:02:25.740> stay<00:02:25.980> if<00:02:26.340> you

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
it'll just slide on and stay if you

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.430 
it'll just slide on and stay if you
wanted<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.030> add<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.210> few<00:02:27.510> glue<00:02:27.780> dots<00:02:28.020> on<00:02:28.230> there

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
wanted to add a few glue dots on there

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.260 
wanted to add a few glue dots on there
you<00:02:28.590> could<00:02:28.920> but<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.400> haven't<00:02:29.760> had<00:02:29.880> really<00:02:30.090> any

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
you could but I haven't had really any

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.900 
you could but I haven't had really any
trouble<00:02:30.720> with<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:30.900> coming<00:02:31.320> off<00:02:31.470> but<00:02:32.400> basically

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
trouble with it coming off but basically

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.150 
trouble with it coming off but basically
the<00:02:33.180> idea<00:02:33.210> is<00:02:33.840> once<00:02:34.290> you've<00:02:34.470> cut<00:02:34.740> this<00:02:34.920> nice

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
the idea is once you've cut this nice

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.220 
the idea is once you've cut this nice
and<00:02:35.190> long<00:02:35.610> add<00:02:35.910> one<00:02:36.360> strip<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.810> sticky<00:02:37.170> strip

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
and long add one strip of sticky strip

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.590 
and long add one strip of sticky strip
on<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.950> right<00:02:38.130> side<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:39.060> one<00:02:39.300> on<00:02:39.360> the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
on the right side and one on the

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.650 
on the right side and one on the
backside<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.940> then<00:02:41.940> you're<00:02:42.090> gonna<00:02:42.180> put<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.570> on

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
backside and then you're gonna put it on

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.580 
backside and then you're gonna put it on
your<00:02:42.810> cup<00:02:43.020> like<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:46.050> just<00:02:46.290> kind<00:02:46.500> of

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
your cup like this and I just kind of

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.770 
your cup like this and I just kind of
wrapped<00:02:46.830> it<00:02:47.010> around<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:48.000> this<00:02:48.360> side<00:02:48.630> obviously

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
wrapped it around so this side obviously

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.310 
wrapped it around so this side obviously
will<00:02:49.650> tuck<00:02:50.520> under<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:51.600> side<00:02:51.840> will<00:02:51.959> go<00:02:52.140> on

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
will tuck under and this side will go on

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.110 
will tuck under and this side will go on
top<00:02:52.620> like<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:54.180> that's<00:02:54.900> how<00:02:55.110> I<00:02:55.560> created

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
top like that and that's how I created

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.170 
top like that and that's how I created
this<00:02:57.120> little<00:02:57.390> liner<00:02:57.709> okay<00:02:58.709> now<00:02:59.400> once<00:02:59.820> I<00:02:59.970> have

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
this little liner okay now once I have

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.690 
this little liner okay now once I have
that<00:03:00.209> I<00:03:00.780> also<00:03:01.110> have<00:03:01.470> another<00:03:01.830> little<00:03:02.280> template

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
that I also have another little template

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.510 
that I also have another little template
and<00:03:02.910> that's<00:03:03.360> for<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:03.959> piece<00:03:04.260> now<00:03:05.100> again

put a couple of glue dots just to hold
it<00:03:44.160> in<00:03:44.250> place<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:46.590> big<00:03:46.799> one<00:03:46.980> seems<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.519> stay<00:03:47.730> in

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
it in place the big one seems to stay in

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.460 
it in place the big one seems to stay in
place<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.090> little<00:03:48.450> bit<00:03:48.660> better<00:03:48.720> than<00:03:49.170> this<00:03:49.350> one

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
place a little bit better than this one

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.020 
place a little bit better than this one
but<00:03:52.470> you'll<00:03:52.680> want<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:52.980> definitely<00:03:53.370> use<00:03:53.459> sticky

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
but you'll want to definitely use sticky

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.550 
but you'll want to definitely use sticky
strip<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:55.190> hold<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.370> ends<00:03:56.820> together<00:03:57.560> you

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
strip to hold the ends together you

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.039 
strip to hold the ends together you
definitely<00:03:59.100> need<00:03:59.340> a<00:04:00.530> stronger<00:04:01.530> adhesive

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
definitely need a stronger adhesive

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.840 
definitely need a stronger adhesive
there<00:04:04.049> we<00:04:04.140> go

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
there we go

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.750 
there we go
