00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
as soon as I relaxed it fella what I've

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.960 
as soon as I relaxed it fella what I've
been<00:01:44.510> doing<00:01:44.900> really<00:01:45.410> is<00:01:45.710> so<00:01:46.100> simple<00:01:46.490> I

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
been doing really is so simple I

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.060 
been doing really is so simple I
personally<00:01:47.840> have<00:01:48.020> noticed<00:01:48.440> that<00:01:48.530> when<00:01:48.800> I<00:01:49.010> do

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
personally have noticed that when I do

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.910 
personally have noticed that when I do
wash<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:49.790> go<00:01:49.910> styling<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:51.080> hair<00:01:51.110> in<00:01:51.560> my<00:01:51.710> neck

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
wash and go styling the hair in my neck

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.240 
wash and go styling the hair in my neck
tends<00:01:52.220> to<00:01:52.400> grow<00:01:52.640> back<00:01:53.390> a<00:01:53.720> lot<00:01:54.020> more<00:01:54.320> quicker<00:01:54.920> I

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
tends to grow back a lot more quicker I

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.520 
tends to grow back a lot more quicker I
think<00:01:55.880> that<00:01:56.119> is<00:01:56.390> possibly<00:01:56.899> because<00:01:57.229> when<00:01:57.410> I<00:01:57.440> do

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
think that is possibly because when I do

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.230 
think that is possibly because when I do
my<00:01:57.800> hair<00:01:57.950> washing<00:01:58.310> goes<00:01:58.580> I<00:01:58.729> do<00:01:58.790> try<00:01:59.180> to

actually absorbs into the Strand and it

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.490 
actually absorbs into the Strand and it
really<00:03:53.790> helps<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.180> actually<00:03:54.660> moisturize<00:03:55.349> the
