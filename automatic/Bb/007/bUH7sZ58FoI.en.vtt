00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
call it that now guys got a call to test

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.580 
call it that now guys got a call to test
you<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:36.000> they're<00:01:36.270> gonna<00:01:36.420> create<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.560> a

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
don't stab me I would love for this to

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.020 
don't stab me I would love for this to
exist<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.979> would<00:02:11.250> love<00:02:11.489> for<00:02:11.550> there<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.879> be<00:02:11.970> a

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
exist I would love for there to be a

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.000 
exist I would love for there to be a
high-speed<00:02:12.569> transportation<00:02:13.230> system

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
high-speed transportation system

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.100 
high-speed transportation system
at<00:02:14.189> least<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.580> start<00:02:14.640> there<00:02:15.180> maybe<00:02:15.810> we<00:02:15.989> can

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
at least to start there maybe we can

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.559 
at least to start there maybe we can
connect<00:02:16.439> Bay<00:02:16.590> Area<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.250> LA<00:02:17.819> maybe<00:02:18.209> we<00:02:18.390> can

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
connect Bay Area to LA maybe we can

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.300 
connect Bay Area to LA maybe we can
connect<00:02:18.840> many<00:02:19.439> other<00:02:19.680> parts<00:02:20.069> of<00:02:20.159> the<00:02:20.220> country

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
connect many other parts of the country

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.940 
connect many other parts of the country
that<00:02:20.760> also<00:02:21.120> exists<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.829> essentially<00:02:22.829> I'm

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
that also exists it essentially I'm

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.410 
that also exists it essentially I'm
hoping<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.310> they'll<00:02:23.700> connect<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.209> world

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
hoping that they'll connect the world

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.690 
hoping that they'll connect the world
yeah<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.590> then<00:02:25.980> it's<00:02:26.310> just<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.549> would

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
yeah and then it's just it would

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.330 
yeah and then it's just it would
revolutionize<00:02:27.629> so<00:02:27.870> many<00:02:28.079> industries<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:29.099> mean

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
revolutionize so many industries I mean

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.119 
revolutionize so many industries I mean
forget<00:02:29.819> air<00:02:30.060> travel<00:02:30.629> or<00:02:30.989> anything<00:02:31.920> like<00:02:31.950> that

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
forget air travel or anything like that

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.190 
forget air travel or anything like that
I<00:02:32.549> mean<00:02:33.000> even<00:02:33.090> hotels<00:02:33.510> would<00:02:33.750> be<00:02:33.900> impacted

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
I mean even hotels would be impacted

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.280 
I mean even hotels would be impacted
because<00:02:34.560> like<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.549> could<00:02:35.760> just<00:02:36.209> be<00:02:36.599> back<00:02:36.959> home

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
because like you could just be back home

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.899 
because like you could just be back home
I<00:02:37.620> would<00:02:37.890> love<00:02:38.069> that<00:02:38.129> you<00:02:38.340> know<00:02:38.549> in<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.819> couple
