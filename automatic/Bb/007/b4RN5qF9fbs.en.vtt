00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.250 
see those two really before jury I have
the<00:00:29.670> first<00:00:29.910> time<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.090> was<00:00:30.359> at<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.539> o2<00:00:30.660> arena<00:00:30.840> was

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
the first time I was at the o2 arena was

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.950 
the first time I was at the o2 arena was
David<00:00:31.650> Haye<00:00:31.859> versus<00:00:32.550> MGM<00:00:33.000> Marinelli<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.809> what

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
think any fight you've got demographics

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.620 
think any fight you've got demographics
from<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.280> course<00:02:14.310> Europe<00:02:14.700> wouldn't<00:02:15.360> be<00:02:15.450> so

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
from of course Europe wouldn't be so

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.090 
from of course Europe wouldn't be so
into<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.140> got<00:02:16.260> Asia<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.770> going<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.980> be

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
into it you got Asia is going to be

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.660 
into it you got Asia is going to be
sorted<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.550> course<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.510> Americas<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:20.640> I

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
sorted of course in the Americas so I

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.410 
sorted of course in the Americas so I
believe<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.480> will<00:02:21.569> break<00:02:21.720> all<00:02:22.020> records<00:02:22.290> and

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
believe it will break all records and

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.490 
believe it will break all records and
there's<00:02:24.420> no<00:02:24.540> place<00:02:24.720> I'd<00:02:24.840> rather<00:02:24.900> be<00:02:25.140> than<00:02:25.230> that

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
there's no place I'd rather be than that

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.459 
there's no place I'd rather be than that
fight<00:02:27.290> do<00:02:28.290> anything<00:02:28.860> students<00:02:29.160> box<00:02:29.340> though
