00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.250 
in this industry I would probably have
been<00:03:43.400> a<00:03:43.430> teacher<00:03:43.730> because<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.720> know<00:03:44.840> granddad

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
been a teacher because you know granddad

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.590 
been a teacher because you know granddad
was<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:45.830> mom<00:03:45.980> was<00:03:46.190> but<00:03:46.910> there<00:03:47.060> was<00:03:47.090> no

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
was and mom was but there was no

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.660 
was and mom was but there was no
pressure<00:03:47.959> on<00:03:48.200> taking<00:03:48.920> up<00:03:49.070> science<00:03:49.340> or

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
pressure on taking up science or

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.509 
pressure on taking up science or
whatever<00:03:49.730> it<00:03:50.060> was<00:03:50.180> always<00:03:51.100> whatever<00:03:52.100> you<00:03:52.310> want

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
whatever it was always whatever you want

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.310 
whatever it was always whatever you want
to<00:03:52.580> do<00:03:52.700> whatever<00:03:52.910> you<00:03:53.390> are<00:03:53.510> happy<00:03:53.780> doing<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.230> I

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
to do whatever you are happy doing and I

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.080 
to do whatever you are happy doing and I
think<00:03:54.530> I'm<00:03:54.739> very<00:03:54.799> lucky<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.340> have<00:03:55.459> things<00:03:55.790> like

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
think I'm very lucky to have things like

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.150 
think I'm very lucky to have things like
that<00:03:56.120> very<00:03:56.540> first<00:03:56.930> shot<00:03:57.230> I<00:03:57.440> think<00:03:57.560> company

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
that very first shot I think company

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.979 
that very first shot I think company
many<00:03:58.640> actually<00:03:59.120> go<00:03:59.299> as<00:03:59.450> can<00:03:59.660> you<00:03:59.780> say

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
many actually go as can you say

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.780 
many actually go as can you say
parachute<00:04:00.500> here<00:04:00.799> I<00:04:00.920> started<00:04:01.310> with<00:04:01.430> that<00:04:01.549> and

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
parachute here I started with that and

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.580 
parachute here I started with that and
also<00:04:02.060> I<00:04:02.239> go<00:04:02.360> first<00:04:02.540> so<00:04:02.690> together<00:04:02.989> I<00:04:03.200> think<00:04:03.470> the

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
also I go first so together I think the

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.650 
also I go first so together I think the
first<00:04:03.890> day<00:04:04.720> we<00:04:05.769> shot<00:04:07.120> some<00:04:08.120> things<00:04:08.390> the

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
first day we shot some things the

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.720 
first day we shot some things the
opening<00:04:09.170> mountain<00:04:09.560> where<00:04:09.769> we<00:04:09.920> were<00:04:10.040> coming<00:04:10.519> in

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
opening mountain where we were coming in

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.030 
opening mountain where we were coming in
to<00:04:11.030> go<00:04:11.209> us<00:04:11.390> so<00:04:11.690> it<00:04:11.870> was<00:04:11.900> I<00:04:12.290> think<00:04:12.650> it's<00:04:12.799> the

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
to go us so it was I think it's the

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.039 
to go us so it was I think it's the
beginning<00:04:13.220> of<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:13.760> go<00:04:14.000> chapter<00:04:14.450> also<00:04:14.600> and

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
beginning of the go chapter also and

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.770 
beginning of the go chapter also and
from<00:04:15.680> actually<00:04:16.190> shooting<00:04:16.489> it<00:04:16.849> together<00:04:17.539> and

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
from actually shooting it together and

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.020 
from actually shooting it together and
we<00:04:17.930> used<00:04:18.049> to<00:04:18.200> always<00:04:18.320> joke<00:04:18.470> about<00:04:19.220> that<00:04:19.549> Cigna

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
we used to always joke about that Cigna

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.979 
we used to always joke about that Cigna
