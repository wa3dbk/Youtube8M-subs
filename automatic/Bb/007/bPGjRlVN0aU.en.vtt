this twitch has it on lockdown but to be

the<00:03:39.800> biggest<00:03:39.980> disappointment<00:03:40.370> for<00:03:40.880> me<00:03:40.970> though

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
the biggest disappointment for me though

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.270 
the biggest disappointment for me though
is<00:03:41.420> that<00:03:41.450> you<00:03:41.720> can't<00:03:42.020> transfer<00:03:42.290> your<00:03:42.770> progress

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
is that you can't transfer your progress

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.760 
is that you can't transfer your progress
across<00:03:43.610> console<00:03:44.240> generations<00:03:44.990> and<00:03:45.230> will<00:03:45.590> need

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
across console generations and will need

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.610 
across console generations and will need
to<00:03:45.950> start<00:03:46.160> everything<00:03:46.670> from<00:03:46.880> scratch

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
to start everything from scratch

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.930 
to start everything from scratch
hopefully<00:03:48.620> it'll<00:03:48.800> be<00:03:48.980> a<00:03:49.010> bit<00:03:49.310> easier<00:03:49.730> this

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
hopefully it'll be a bit easier this

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.610 
hopefully it'll be a bit easier this
time<00:03:50.180> around<00:03:50.450> as<00:03:50.690> you'll<00:03:50.870> already<00:03:51.050> have<00:03:51.410> built

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
time around as you'll already have built

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.560 
time around as you'll already have built
up<00:03:51.890> some<00:03:52.130> skills<00:03:52.490> but<00:03:53.090> going<00:03:53.240> through<00:03:53.390> the

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
up some skills but going through the

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.020 
up some skills but going through the
motions<00:03:54.110> at<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.380> start<00:03:54.740> can<00:03:55.130> be<00:03:55.370> more<00:03:55.730> than<00:03:55.760> a

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
motions at the start can be more than a

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.260 
motions at the start can be more than a
bit<00:03:56.270> tedious<00:03:57.250> so<00:03:58.250> then<00:03:58.459> should<00:03:58.940> you<00:03:59.090> upgrade

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
bit tedious so then should you upgrade

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.260 
bit tedious so then should you upgrade
to<00:03:59.600> the<00:03:59.690> Xbox<00:04:00.110> one<00:04:00.320> or<00:04:00.500> ps4<00:04:00.920> versions<00:04:01.730> if<00:04:01.910> you

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
to the Xbox one or ps4 versions if you

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.900 
to the Xbox one or ps4 versions if you
already<00:04:02.420> own<00:04:02.810> Rocksmith<00:04:03.380> 2014<00:04:03.860> on<00:04:04.520> the

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
already own Rocksmith 2014 on the

already own Rocksmith 2014 on the
previous<00:04:05.420> gen<00:04:05.810> well<00:04:06.530> it<00:04:06.830> all<00:04:07.010> comes<00:04:07.250> down<00:04:07.550> to

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
previous gen well it all comes down to

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.699 
previous gen well it all comes down to
personal<00:04:07.970> preference<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:08.900> space<00:04:09.410> management

personal preference and space management

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.130 
personal preference and space management
I<00:04:10.130> guess<00:04:10.370> if<00:04:11.000> you<00:04:11.240> are<00:04:11.390> desperate<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:11.959> keep

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
I guess if you are desperate to keep

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.540 
I guess if you are desperate to keep
learning<00:04:12.290> and<00:04:12.620> want<00:04:12.770> to<00:04:12.890> pack<00:04:13.070> away<00:04:13.220> your

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
learning and want to pack away your

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.340 
learning and want to pack away your
older<00:04:13.790> consoles<00:04:14.300> to<00:04:14.480> save<00:04:14.750> room<00:04:15.050> in<00:04:15.200> your

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
older consoles to save room in your

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.890 
older consoles to save room in your
house<00:04:15.560> then<00:04:16.010> I'd<00:04:16.190> say<00:04:16.489> it's<00:04:16.670> just<00:04:17.209> about<00:04:17.600> worth

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
house then I'd say it's just about worth

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.470 
house then I'd say it's just about worth
the<00:04:18.109> upgrade<00:04:18.250> but<00:04:19.250> if<00:04:19.520> you<00:04:19.790> have<00:04:19.940> a<00:04:19.970> nice<00:04:20.209> big
