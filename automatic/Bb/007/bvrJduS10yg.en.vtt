another video today we're gonna go in
depth<00:00:15.600> talk<00:00:15.869> about<00:00:16.049> raid<00:00:16.490> customization<00:00:17.490> I

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
depth talk about raid customization I

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.580 
depth talk about raid customization I
think<00:00:18.300> I'm<00:00:18.390> going<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.570> do<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> part<00:00:19.350> by<00:00:19.439> part

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
think I'm going to do a part by part

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.290 
think I'm going to do a part by part
series<00:00:19.980> so<00:00:20.099> I'm<00:00:20.220> going<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.369> talk<00:00:20.519> about<00:00:20.640> raid

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
series so I'm going to talk about raid

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.840 
series so I'm going to talk about raid
tuner<00:00:21.990> street<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.890> kind<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.369> go<00:00:23.460> through<00:00:23.490> all

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
tuner street and kind of go through all

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.850 
tuner street and kind of go through all
of<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.090> different<00:00:24.119> parts<00:00:24.780> so<00:00:25.320> today<00:00:25.590> we're

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
of the different parts so today we're

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.930 
of the different parts so today we're
going<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.010> be<00:00:26.100> talking<00:00:26.220> about<00:00:26.369> raid<00:00:26.699> without

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940 
going to be talking about raid without

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.670 
going to be talking about raid without
further<00:00:27.360> ado<00:00:27.720> let's<00:00:27.960> get<00:00:28.110> straight<00:00:28.350> into<00:00:28.470> the

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
further ado let's get straight into the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.800 
further ado let's get straight into the
video<00:00:28.949> okay<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:29.520> in<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> crew<00:00:30.150> there's<00:00:30.449> six

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
video okay so in the crew there's six

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.290 
video okay so in the crew there's six
tune<00:00:31.380> expect<00:00:31.800> if<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.160> include<00:00:32.669> fully<00:00:32.969> stock

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
tune expect if you include fully stock

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.240 
tune expect if you include fully stock
there's<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.170> fully<00:00:34.620> stocked<00:00:34.680> obviously

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
there's a fully stocked obviously

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.250 
there's a fully stocked obviously
there's<00:00:35.430> street<00:00:35.760> raid<00:00:36.510> performance<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
there's street raid performance the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.709 
there's street raid performance the
circuit<00:00:37.710> each<00:00:38.219> tuning<00:00:38.940> spec<00:00:39.179> has<00:00:39.420> its<00:00:39.569> own

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
circuit each tuning spec has its own

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.669 
circuit each tuning spec has its own
separate<00:00:40.350> ability<00:00:40.879> and<00:00:42.019> kind<00:00:43.019> of<00:00:43.109> suit<00:00:43.530> a

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:43.679 
separate ability and kind of suit a

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:45.860 
separate ability and kind of suit a
different<00:00:44.190> play<00:00:44.309> style<00:00:44.639> now<00:00:44.789> trade<00:00:45.089> in<00:00:45.420> this

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
different play style now trade in this

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.099 
different play style now trade in this
case<00:00:46.109> is<00:00:46.260> kind<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.649> brute<00:00:47.100> force<00:00:48.109> play

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
case is kind of the brute force play

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:50.989 
case is kind of the brute force play
style<00:00:49.499> it's<00:00:49.979> the<00:00:50.159> one<00:00:50.309> where<00:00:50.460> if<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.819> just

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:50.999 
style it's the one where if you just

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:52.399 
style it's the one where if you just
want<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.179> absorb<00:00:51.389> all<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.870> damage<00:00:51.899> if<00:00:52.319> you

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
want to absorb all the damage if you

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:54.229 
want to absorb all the damage if you
want<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.620> go<00:00:52.710> off<00:00:52.859> road<00:00:53.129> if<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:54.030> want<00:00:54.210> to

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
want to go off road if you just want to

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.899 
want to go off road if you just want to
completely<00:00:54.749> just<00:00:55.199> mess<00:00:56.069> up<00:00:56.100> your<00:00:56.339> opponent<00:00:56.760> by

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
completely just mess up your opponent by

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.000 
completely just mess up your opponent by
using<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.629> brute<00:00:58.019> force<00:00:58.289> just<00:00:58.530> generally

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
using you brute force just generally

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.610 
using you brute force just generally
just<00:00:59.100> using<00:00:59.370> brute<00:00:59.579> force<00:00:59.670> this<00:01:00.659> is<00:01:00.929> the<00:01:01.170> setup

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
just using brute force this is the setup

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.919 
just using brute force this is the setup
you're<00:01:01.859> going<00:01:01.979> to<00:01:02.039> use<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.600> it's<00:01:03.600> mainly

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
you're going to use and it's mainly

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.080 
you're going to use and it's mainly
tailored<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.920> know<00:01:05.070> events<00:01:05.760> where<00:01:05.970> you

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
tailored to you know events where you

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.270 
tailored to you know events where you
want<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.330> kind<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.510> take<00:01:06.780> down<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.159> target<00:01:08.159> or

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
want to kind of take down a target or

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.640 
want to kind of take down a target or
maybe<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.210> don't<00:01:09.570> know<00:01:09.630> go<00:01:09.840> off-road<00:01:10.230> whilst

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
maybe I don't know go off-road whilst

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.990 
maybe I don't know go off-road whilst
taking<00:01:10.800> on<00:01:11.040> hug<00:01:11.250> or<00:01:11.430> something<00:01:11.460> across<00:01:11.820> those

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
taking on hug or something across those

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.880 
taking on hug or something across those
lines<00:01:12.270> okay<00:01:12.930> for<00:01:13.170> race<00:01:13.320> back<00:01:13.620> there's

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
lines okay for race back there's

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.080 
lines okay for race back there's
obviously<00:01:14.130> gonna<00:01:14.250> be<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> bit<00:01:14.670> less<00:01:14.820> body

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
obviously gonna be a bit less body

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.600 
obviously gonna be a bit less body
customization<00:01:16.100> because<00:01:17.100> obviously<00:01:17.280> it's

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
customization because obviously it's

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.490 
customization because obviously it's
kind<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.910> it's<00:01:18.420> tailored<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.050> do<00:01:19.170> one<00:01:19.470> thing

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
kind of it's tailored to do one thing

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.410 
kind of it's tailored to do one thing
and<00:01:20.010> the<00:01:20.100> car<00:01:20.310> needs<00:01:20.550> to<00:01:20.610> look<00:01:20.730> a<00:01:20.880> certain<00:01:21.180> way

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and the car needs to look a certain way

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.140 
and the car needs to look a certain way
so<00:01:22.200> obviously<00:01:22.740> bottom<00:01:23.040> funny<00:01:23.520> customization

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
so obviously bottom funny customization

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.850 
so obviously bottom funny customization
is<00:01:24.210> very<00:01:24.390> limited<00:01:24.540> however<00:01:24.900> performance<00:01:25.680> is

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
is very limited however performance is

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.640 
is very limited however performance is
across<00:01:26.610> across<00:01:27.270> all<00:01:27.480> boards<00:01:27.930> like<00:01:28.110> all<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
tuning specs you can change the gearbox

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.740 
tuning specs you can change the gearbox

the racing specs are the same however

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.220 
the racing specs are the same however
the<00:01:41.790> body<00:01:42.000> customization<00:01:42.690> is<00:01:42.780> very<00:01:42.990> limited

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
the body customization is very limited

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.860 
the body customization is very limited
are<00:01:43.650> limited<00:01:44.190> on<00:01:44.250> rates<00:01:44.550> back<00:01:44.790> because<00:01:45.510> they

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
are limited on rates back because they

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.330 
are limited on rates back because they
want<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.410> look<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.650> certain<00:01:46.860> way<00:01:47.040> because

want it to look a certain way because

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.160 
want it to look a certain way because
it's<00:01:47.430> made<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.730> do<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.940> certain<00:01:48.180> job<00:01:48.300> however

can't look like the rush the cruise car
sort<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.890> maybe<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.430> don't<00:02:11.670> know<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:12.390> your

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
sort of maybe I don't know that your

with one white stripe down the middle

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.910 
with one white stripe down the middle
you<00:02:16.379> can<00:02:16.680> still<00:02:16.950> do<00:02:17.099> that<00:02:17.249> you<00:02:17.400> know

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
you can still do that you know

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.500 
you can still do that you know
that's<00:02:18.040> not<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.190> problem<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:18.670> that<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:19.330> it<00:02:19.360> for

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
that's not a problem so that is it for

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.680 
that's not a problem so that is it for
raid<00:02:19.840> customization<00:02:21.000> as<00:02:22.000> for<00:02:22.330> any<00:02:22.450> of<00:02:22.599> the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
raid customization as for any of the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.449 
raid customization as for any of the
side<00:02:22.930> note<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.410> would<00:02:23.500> say<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.010> race<00:02:24.160> back

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
side note I would say the race back

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.550 
side note I would say the race back
health<00:02:25.000> wise<00:02:25.209> is<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.569> lot<00:02:25.750> better<00:02:25.959> than<00:02:26.230> any<00:02:26.440> of

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
health wise is a lot better than any of

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.530 
health wise is a lot better than any of
the<00:02:26.680> spec<00:02:26.950> because<00:02:27.580> obviously<00:02:27.730> it's<00:02:28.270> made<00:02:28.510> to

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
the spec because obviously it's made to

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.100 
the spec because obviously it's made to
be<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.050> brute<00:02:29.290> force<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.709> for<00:02:29.920> Cyril

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
be that brute force and for Cyril

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.570 
be that brute force and for Cyril
besides<00:02:32.110> that<00:02:32.290> really<00:02:32.920> there<00:02:33.099> isn't<00:02:33.250> any<00:02:33.459> of

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
besides that really there isn't any of

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.520 
besides that really there isn't any of
the<00:02:33.640> benefits<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:34.270> dirt<00:02:34.510> spec<00:02:34.810> is<00:02:35.020> probably

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
the benefits the dirt spec is probably

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.680 
the benefits the dirt spec is probably
going<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:35.800> be<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.130> preferred<00:02:36.850> class<00:02:37.209> if<00:02:37.480> you

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
going to be the preferred class if you

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.660 
going to be the preferred class if you
are<00:02:37.840> looking<00:02:37.959> for<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.319> genuine<00:02:38.950> off-road<00:02:39.400> car

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
are looking for a genuine off-road car

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.820 
are looking for a genuine off-road car
but<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.810> know<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.140> rate<00:02:41.290> spec<00:02:41.500> is<00:02:41.620> great

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
but you know the rate spec is great

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.470 
but you know the rate spec is great
again<00:02:42.370> for<00:02:42.550> being<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.880> enforce<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.270> role<00:02:43.450> for

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
again for being that enforce a role for

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.100 
again for being that enforce a role for
taking<00:02:43.840> out<00:02:43.930> targets<00:02:44.970> me<00:02:45.970> personally<00:02:46.720> if<00:02:46.930> I

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
taking out targets me personally if I

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.570 
taking out targets me personally if I
had<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.319> choose<00:02:47.380> between<00:02:47.560> either<00:02:47.890> I<00:02:48.310> probably

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
had to choose between either I probably

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.940 
had to choose between either I probably
use<00:02:48.910> the<00:02:49.360> dirt<00:02:49.599> spec<00:02:49.930> because<00:02:50.170> obviously<00:02:50.319> it's

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
use the dirt spec because obviously it's

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.160 
use the dirt spec because obviously it's
going<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:51.160> be<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.250> lot<00:02:51.760> more<00:02:51.790> nimbler<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:53.080> it

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
going to be a lot more nimbler and it

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.259 
going to be a lot more nimbler and it
probably<00:02:53.380> will<00:02:53.590> be<00:02:53.650> better<00:02:53.890> on<00:02:54.130> dear<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.580> I

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
probably will be better on dear and I

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.809 
probably will be better on dear and I
can't<00:02:55.870> see<00:02:56.019> myself<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.620> know<00:02:56.650> being<00:02:57.489> the
