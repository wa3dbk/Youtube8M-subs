the electronic power steering 2 is

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.830 
the electronic power steering 2 is
better<00:04:16.000> suited<00:04:16.269> for<00:04:16.450> lower<00:04:16.810> speeds<00:04:18.359> if<00:04:19.359> you

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
better suited for lower speeds if you

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.110 
better suited for lower speeds if you
top<00:04:20.079> the<00:04:20.260> cabin<00:04:20.620> space<00:04:20.859> will<00:04:21.040> great<00:04:21.340> take<00:04:22.090> a

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
top the cabin space will great take a

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.540 
top the cabin space will great take a
look<00:04:22.330> at<00:04:22.450> the<00:04:22.570> boot<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:23.710> huge<00:04:24.070> remote

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
look at the boot the huge remote

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.810 
look at the boot the huge remote
operated<00:04:25.120> boot<00:04:25.330> can<00:04:25.900> swallow<00:04:26.460> 490<00:04:27.460> litres<00:04:27.790> of

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.830 

so<00:04:52.840> overall<00:04:53.169> what<00:04:53.530> did<00:04:53.680> we<00:04:53.830> think<00:04:54.010> of<00:04:54.160> the<00:04:54.310> car

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
so overall what did we think of the car
