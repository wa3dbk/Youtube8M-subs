00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.670
The Bible, as a historical artifact, if we
look at it just in that way, is vital to understanding

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.960
western culture.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:21.950
The Bible as a book is more than just a transmission
of a narrative or an oral history or any kind

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.470
of literary tradition.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.779
It in essence the Book of all books.

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.430
It's the best selling book of all time, it
still has more impact than any book ever written.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.680
The Bible is significant because it's talking
about itself but because it's pointing beyond

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.100
itself.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.030
When we first got started we were just looking
at buying an artifact or two and we kept having

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.370
opportunities being presented and we just
kept buying.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.560
Today, we have over 40,000 items in the collection.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.530
This is not a small time operation.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.160
The breadth of the collection is kind of breathtaking.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.530
Mr. Green's vision is actually the fruition
of what people have been dreaming about for

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.530
decades.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.530
This is about the Bible.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.780
It's not about a faith tradition or a church
or a denomination, it's about a book.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:21.290
We're trying to present the biblical narratives
in a clear, objective just descriptive way

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.840
because people just don't even know the stories.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.340
And part of the history we're trying to tell
is to do justice to the wide range of people

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.390
who claim this book as their own.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.540
Who have participated in its survival.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.430
Who have had their lives changed by it.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.400
Some of the exciting objects that we have
that people would recognize are of course

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.850
our Dead Sea Scroll fragments.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.750
Papyrus 39, it's a fragment from the gospel
of John, found at the site of Oxyrhynchus.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.560
It is from a passage in John 8 and with its
third century date, that papyrus is the earliest

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.520
surviving witness for that passage in John.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.680
We have one of the largest collections in
private hands of Torah scrolls and it's really

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.410
a incredible conflation of all the Jewish
communities throughout Europe, the Middle

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.189
East and North Africa.

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:22.540
The collection contains just about every significant
biblical imprint that has ever been printed

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.540
in America.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.530
These artifacts, which deserve to be studied,
are being made available at a high rate for

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.719
the people who are, who have spent years of
their lives acquiring the understanding to

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.060
learn from them.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.030
There's just moments of awe.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.189
The wealth of information that they have provided
related to the Bible, its transmission, its

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:49.670
history, is completely unparalleled.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.980
Museums are a contemporary commentary on our
culture.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.459
So Washington DC is a great location for us
to be able to share this story with people

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.569
all over the world.

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.939
Putting ourselves in the middle of that holds
us to quite a high standard.

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:09.779
It says that we're willing to engage on that
level.

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:15.540
To have the Museum of the Bible there as a
part of that overall culture adds to the commentary

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.299
of who we are.

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.480
I really hope that they will leave there with
a spark in their heart and their soul.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.370
That they'll want to know more and learn more
and come back.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.689
Whether they're young or old, people of faith,
all ethnicities, that it will just spark something

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:31.689
in their heart.

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.430
So I'm rather bold about asking people to
get involved.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.189
We hope this is an encouragement to people.

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:47.549
If we can bring a greater awareness to our
world of this book and its potential impact

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.799
that is an exciting adventure to be on.
