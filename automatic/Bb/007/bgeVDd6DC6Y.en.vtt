00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 haley and welcome to one 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.509
 new video from me today is mine 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.309
 food hold because after you take that off 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.110
 has liked videos so much and you more 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.570
 I wanted to know about it 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.910
 my week shopping is definitely too 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.130
 very relevant because I really buy 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.630
 always the whole healthy things one 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.640
 the vegetables and the vegetables in my 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.289
 refrigerator should never be missing and 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.570
 maybe it helps the one or 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.430
 others keep on knowing 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.800
 how do I eat healthy what is important 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.539
 you and I show you today 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.550
 my shopping to thank songs in 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.530
 Lately, often simply note 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.510
 It's quick to go shopping there because he does 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.680
 the most important things have always been and me 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.390
 was still a few at dm 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.579
 to bring trifles also in order 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.260
 so no cosmetics today 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.059
 and i would say i wish you 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.660
 Now just have fun with that 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.430
 video so we start with the wiedl 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.210
 buy and I grab indiscriminately in the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.550
 bag pure 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.530
 now it will wash for the first time 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.879
 be the first has taken what 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.859
 maybe the advent is still 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.199
 not quite as I that comes about 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.809
 but now I love strawberries 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.309
 easy and they just have to be there 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.979
 because that is my absolute favorite 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.090
 fruit and I think that is always possible 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.740
 I also have to hinder myself 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.150
 brought there's family too 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.710
 Frozen there you can do a lot 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.600
 save money because the cheap in my 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.130
 but after all that is such a thing 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.630
 Nice big pack and so fresh 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.159
 raspberries that's really great 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.880
 That's why I took them with me 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.990
 then I have low-fat kefir 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.000
 you can take along as well 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.710
 take buttermilk I'm completely there 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.119
 sometimes like shakes bananas 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.610
 sheikh or something like that 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.380
 must always be really good and totally 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.630
 refreshing on the warm summer days 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.280
 now I have at home 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.390
 Oatmeal taken 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.680
 I always do my goal in the morning 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.000
 So my 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.040
 oatmeal I overnight on 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.780
 that's what I have in football 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.390
 I also shown in the left below in the 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.640
 infobox as I always do and the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.580
 must always be there in stock 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.370
 then I bought a lot better 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.229
 unspectacular mainz because he left and 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.640
 I have Greek yogurt 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.840
 taken that is my absolute 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.420
 I can recommend everyone to you 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.030
 it gives you fat and ten percent 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.979
 it drops and falls with two percent 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.800
 I'm next to the two percent 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.180
 Of course, better than low-fat and 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.190
 replaces my normal yogurt because 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.739
 I think that's a lot creamier and 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.850
 much tastier and fall percent I think 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.110
 are completely alright 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.720
 I also got out of that 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.370
 Cooling shelf more importantly I can 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.140
 I took fresh cheese with it 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.030
 always in stock even if it is in the evening 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.170
 has to go fast 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.700
 You can eat that as comfortably as one 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.860
 yogurt you can use then still 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.100
 accordingly and is also very 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.480
 unique and very healthy and i have 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.220
 still little taken 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.410
 I do not like this live with the ones I like 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.140
 not personally so then I take 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.850
 rather the normal one 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.230
 I took chicken breast with me 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.850
 I already have you in butare 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.459
 so I always do mine 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.590
 zucchini carbonara because I like it 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.120
 breast most personally I like it 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.549
 also ham before then I still have 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:09.870
 I have to watch that we do not fall out 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:14.160
 apple also taken to fruit yet 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.260
 Bananas and vegetables were this week 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.670
 A little fun just for the reason 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.840
 because I did not have so much at home 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.780
 but especially not for lunch 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.100
 or dinner so that would be 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.510
 I will only be sick but have it here 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.120
 I definitely brought tomatoes 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.630
 They last for over a week and 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.630
 I still have 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.830
 a cucumber still taken with it exactly 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.920
 I always like to make dead salad 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.410
 for example, I still have from the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.790
 deeply refrigerated've taken hake 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.800
 I never tried but I wanted 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.640
 absolutely fish without this panade 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.500
 outside this is it just well yes 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.060
 that I did not want breaded fish 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.980
 because that's just finished 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.510
 I wanted to give it a try 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.050
 with lemon and pepper before 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.730
 spiced and sounds really delicious and me 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.850
 have from the freezer shelf again on 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.710
 good favorite vegetables and taken 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.180
 that 's spinach and then I pick up 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.380
 So the space spinner did not work there 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.840
 I do not care about this one 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.880
 I just like that 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.760
 love creamed and goes from the values 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.680
 Her really totally has 148 calories 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.010
 which in my opinion totally okay 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.010
 is 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.240
 I still took it with me 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.970
 ten pieces so I always need 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.970
 in stock and I even have this time 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.370
 Ostermayer said this with many colorful 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.170
 because I always lately in the evening 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.570
 has total desire for boiled eggs and 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.130
 then just do not feel like it every time 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.990
 one person in the cooking pot 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.850
 is also totally the change 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.280
 waste of energy and that's why I have 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.990
 taken with demand there would have been big 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.090
 it took the Veedel ultra 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.370
 cheap I cost 70 cents 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.260
 I think that's really good 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.910
 somewhere else already paid more for 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.560
 and I still had a fight 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.810
 taken away then I take always with the 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.700
 a little less fat simply because he 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.350
 really better tastes too creamy 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:05.090
 I do not like it now and it is like that 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:07.560
 golden middle of the 1 39 percent fat 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.200
 and the last thing I got from the title 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.760
 has a perfect pro with it 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.750
 I have my bread for the university I have 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.970
 wholegrain toast for a while 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.010
 But I noticed that something like that 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.800
 really more filling and above all here 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.810
 makes you feel sick for a long time 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.310
 taken away and I forgot 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.690
 was very boring after all 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.390
 but I did not find something 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.100
 have and therefore I still raffaels 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.560
 took 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.380
 There is a new species or variety of hanuta 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.940
 so outside with too chocolate and in such 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.390
 Milk cream and I really wanted 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.460
 try and I've told you I 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.680
 It still sweets from time to time 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.270
 and I am not totally strict with it now 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.100
 me and that works very much 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.170
 Well, well, and we are already 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.820
 I shop at the dm I have once 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.710
 closing it strives taken 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.480
 come in all different types of the 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.970
 are there with nuts in it 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.620
 There is a chocolate taste there 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.000
 it now here with forest fruits and there 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.240
 I really like it, we're up 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.140
 right raspberry pieces in it and whole 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.300
 sure sky show 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.330
 I think that 's really really tasty 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.650
 out and that I took with dm 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.330
 and I know the dm in the yard 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.240
 welcome as well as in the Kaufland but me 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.010
 think it's best an apple 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.500
 I like because it's just an apple news 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.970
 Replacement it really is cooked only 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.340
 apple and then tasted without sugar 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.930
 additions or anything else and if 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.490
 I'm doing pancakes then I have 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.620
 usually no desire nor a sauce 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.190
 belong to it and then that always 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.720
 and that's really delicious and yummy 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.160
 I finds 30 also fully in order so 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.230
 since there is the brand new here now 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.790
 There are also priced from alnatura 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.430
 actually takes nothing and it 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:42.590
 I've taken that with me now 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.630
 and besides, I have the little one 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.920
 Size taken when I'm not like that 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.500
 is hungry then enough 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:50.420
 that from this and last but not least the 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.300
 There is an apple market with bananas 

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:55.580
 also with banana and apple pear and with 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.090
 johannes b that is a very red so there 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.860
 There are very different 

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.670
 Flavors should be something for everyone 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.340
 to be there 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.680
 and yes I still have at dm 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.240
 taken away yes and will be back in 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.340
 warms slipped my head of 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:12.080
 Food woods are natural 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:13.040
 hello yes he can stay in the head 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.810
 now he is empty 

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.820
 I definitely hope the video has 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.500
 you like and if you continue 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.030
