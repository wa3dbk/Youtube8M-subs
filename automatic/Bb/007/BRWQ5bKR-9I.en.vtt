zone<00:01:28.470> well<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:30.210> I'd<00:01:30.930> like<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.290> use<00:01:31.500> rulers

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
zone well I like I'd like to use rulers

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.149 
zone well I like I'd like to use rulers
a<00:01:32.040> lot<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.850> square<00:01:33.630> everything<00:01:33.990> up<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.829> make

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
a lot and square everything up and make

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.850 
a lot and square everything up and make
it<00:01:35.189> look<00:01:35.460> neat<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.790> nice<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:37.590> was

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
it look neat and nice and this was

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.219 
it look neat and nice and this was
definitely<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.640> different<00:01:39.240> approach<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:40.020> that

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
definitely a different approach to that

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.670 
definitely a different approach to that
as<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.579> see<00:01:41.880> i<00:01:42.180> mean<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.750> line<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.350> it's

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
as you can see i mean the line is it's

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.710 
as you can see i mean the line is it's
kind<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.070> curved<00:01:44.430> coming<00:01:44.850> down<00:01:45.000> here<00:01:45.210> normally

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
kind of curved coming down here normally

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.230 
kind of curved coming down here normally
I<00:01:45.750> would<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.140> cut<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.590> straight<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
I would have cut that straight and the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.149 
I would have cut that straight and the
same<00:01:48.479> thing<00:01:48.720> above<00:01:49.020> here<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.860> know<00:01:49.979> they're

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
same thing above here you know they're

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.789 
same thing above here you know they're
all<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> little<00:01:50.460> bit<00:01:50.729> different<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.530> it<00:01:52.530> just

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
all a little bit different and it just

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.609 
all a little bit different and it just
makes<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.399> more<00:01:53.460> interesting<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.600> think<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:55.290> a

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
makes it more interesting I think to a

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.010 
makes it more interesting I think to a
little<00:01:56.100> bit<00:01:56.189> more<00:01:56.369> movement<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.659> quilt

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
little bit more movement in in the quilt

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.020 
little bit more movement in in the quilt
too<00:01:58.490> okay<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.700> what<00:01:59.850> about<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
too okay and what about the

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.990 
too okay and what about the
