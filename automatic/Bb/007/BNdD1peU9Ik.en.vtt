that scroll of a regeneration and then
you<00:06:04.010> basically<00:06:04.159> pump<00:06:04.820> it<00:06:04.940> out<00:06:05.000> like<00:06:05.210> this<00:06:05.360> you

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
you basically pump it out like this you

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.149 
you basically pump it out like this you
can<00:06:05.690> even<00:06:05.780> do<00:06:05.960> a<00:06:05.990> little<00:06:06.169> you<00:06:06.650> know<00:06:06.710> the<00:06:06.830> animal
