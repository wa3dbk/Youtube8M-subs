00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
we're gonna really carry the energy i

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.019 
we're gonna really carry the energy i
think<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:16.379> know<00:00:16.410> ray<00:00:16.980> really<00:00:17.460> stepped<00:00:17.760> up<00:00:17.850> as

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
think you know ray really stepped up as

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.910 
think you know ray really stepped up as
a<00:00:18.060> leader<00:00:18.119> these<00:00:18.539> last<00:00:18.779> two<00:00:18.960> games<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.590> Maui

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
and the whole team actually just kind of

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.609

drew<00:00:25.320> drew<00:00:25.920> off<00:00:26.070> his<00:00:26.400> energy<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.619> hopefully

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
drew drew off his energy and hopefully
