or playing a sport or man doesn't
actually<00:00:45.600> reflect<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.469> rankings<00:00:46.859> which

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
actually reflect in the rankings which

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.590 
actually reflect in the rankings which
is<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> bit<00:00:47.429> annoying<00:00:47.699> because<00:00:48.059> there<00:00:48.510> could

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
is a bit annoying because there could

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.479 
is a bit annoying because there could
have<00:00:48.660> been<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.929> separate<00:00:49.199> ranking<00:00:49.590> board<00:00:49.800> so

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
have been a separate ranking board so

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.220 
have been a separate ranking board so
anywhere<00:00:51.059> you've<00:00:51.359> then<00:00:51.539> got<00:00:51.719> choice<00:00:52.079> of

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
anywhere you've then got choice of

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.810 
anywhere you've then got choice of
difficulty<00:00:52.769> which<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.160> lot<00:00:53.429> more<00:00:53.609> difficult

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
difficulty which is a lot more difficult

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.119 
difficulty which is a lot more difficult
eSports<00:00:54.570> easy<00:00:55.019> basically<00:00:55.559> makes<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.980> much

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
eSports easy basically makes it much

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.709 
eSports easy basically makes it much
easier<00:00:56.429> and<00:00:56.699> as<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.910> can<00:00:57.030> see<00:00:57.089> there<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.449> by

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
easier and as you can see there just by

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.119 
easier and as you can see there just by
the<00:00:57.780> picture<00:00:58.140> diagram<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.800> gets<00:00:58.949> rid<00:00:59.100> of

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
the picture diagram it gets rid of

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.029 
the picture diagram it gets rid of
enemies<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.699> mix<00:00:59.940> jumps<00:01:00.420> not<00:01:01.320> jump<00:01:01.859> ish

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
enemies of mix jumps not jump ish

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.919 
enemies of mix jumps not jump ish
instead<00:01:02.519> and<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.269> say<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.570> makes<00:01:03.809> it

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
instead and as I say it just makes it

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.649 
instead and as I say it just makes it
easier<00:01:04.290> you've<00:01:04.920> then<00:01:05.129> got<00:01:05.420> pretty<00:01:06.420> much<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
easier you've then got pretty much the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.149 
easier you've then got pretty much the
same<00:01:06.810> setup<00:01:07.200> as<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.560> last<00:01:07.740> game<00:01:07.950> you've<00:01:08.130> got

beat<00:01:32.969> next<00:01:33.240> because<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.930> where<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.229> game

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
beat next because the where the game

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.889 
beat next because the where the game
works<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.159> pretty<00:01:35.610> much<00:01:35.729> all<00:01:35.909> sons<00:01:36.210> work<00:01:36.390> it's

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
works and pretty much all sons work it's

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:38.990 
works and pretty much all sons work it's
been<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> strategy<00:01:37.409> thing<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.399> beat<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> person

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
been a strategy thing you beat a person

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.149 
been a strategy thing you beat a person
and<00:01:39.570> there's<00:01:40.259> always<00:01:40.380> one<00:01:40.680> person<00:01:40.890> who's

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
and there's always one person who's

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.530 
and there's always one person who's
waited<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> others<00:01:41.939> who<00:01:42.030> doesn't<00:01:42.329> need

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
waited on the others who doesn't need

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.899 
waited on the others who doesn't need
any<00:01:42.840> extra<00:01:42.990> help<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.680> beat<00:01:44.159> him<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.729> his

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
any extra help you beat him and his

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.420 
any extra help you beat him and his
weapon<00:01:45.329> will<00:01:45.750> be<00:01:45.780> powerful<00:01:46.710> or<00:01:46.920> weak<00:01:46.950> but

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
weapon will be powerful or weak but

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.219 
weapon will be powerful or weak but
either<00:01:47.640> way<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.090> will<00:01:48.240> actually<00:01:48.450> screw<00:01:49.020> over

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
either way it will actually screw over

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.170 
either way it will actually screw over
another<00:01:49.500> boss<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.369> you've<00:01:50.490> got<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> figure<00:01:50.939> out

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
another boss so you've got a figure out

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.270 
another boss so you've got a figure out
who<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.450> beat<00:01:51.780> them<00:01:51.930> when<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.380> where<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.100> go

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
who of beat them when and where to go

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.370 
who of beat them when and where to go
next<00:01:53.490> because<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:54.750> example<00:01:55.140> on<00:01:55.289> the

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
next because it's a for example on the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.929 
next because it's a for example on the
original<00:01:55.799> game<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.070> had<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> fire<00:01:56.460> weapon<00:01:56.820> and

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
original game you had a fire weapon and

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.120 
original game you had a fire weapon and
a<00:01:56.969> nice<00:01:57.119> weapon<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.289> fire<00:01:58.469> weapon<00:01:58.890> killed

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
a nice weapon so the fire weapon killed

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.130 
a nice weapon so the fire weapon killed
the<00:01:59.280> ice<00:01:59.399> guy<00:01:59.670> easier<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.210> ice<00:02:00.329> guy<00:02:00.570> killed

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
the ice guy easier the ice guy killed

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.959 
the ice guy easier the ice guy killed
the<00:02:01.200> pie<00:02:01.409> guy<00:02:01.619> easier<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.460> just<00:02:02.789> have<00:02:02.939> to

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the pie guy easier so you just have to

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.300 
the pie guy easier so you just have to
basically<00:02:03.270> clear<00:02:03.689> forward<00:02:04.310> experimenta

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
basically clear forward experimenta

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.580 
basically clear forward experimenta
strategize<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.030> just<00:02:06.180> stuff<00:02:06.390> like<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.780> and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
strategize and just stuff like that and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.440 
strategize and just stuff like that and
then<00:02:08.429> you'll<00:02:08.729> be<00:02:08.849> able<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.060> bait<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.300> gear

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
then you'll be able to bait the gear

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.860 
then you'll be able to bait the gear
amazing<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.470> anyway<00:02:11.180> other<00:02:12.180> than<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.540> bosses

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
amazing so anyway other than the bosses

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.720 
amazing so anyway other than the bosses
which<00:02:13.050> I've<00:02:13.230> mentioned<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.830> whole<00:02:14.010> basic

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
which I've mentioned the whole basic

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.309 
which I've mentioned the whole basic
premise<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.239> key<00:02:15.360> M<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.629> equal<00:02:15.870> left/right

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
premise to the key M is equal left/right

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.550 
premise to the key M is equal left/right
up/down<00:02:16.470> kill<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.280> enemies<00:02:18.140> it's<00:02:19.140> one<00:02:19.470> of

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
up/down kill the enemies it's one of

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.050 
up/down kill the enemies it's one of
those<00:02:19.620> games<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.069> it<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.430> hard<00:02:20.700> but<00:02:20.940> if

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
those games that it is hard but if

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.580 
those games that it is hard but if
you've<00:02:21.150> got<00:02:21.180> some<00:02:21.510> patience<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.140> if<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.379> able

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
you've got some patience and if you able

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.350 
you've got some patience and if you able
to<00:02:22.739> concentrate<00:02:23.160> which<00:02:23.550> unfortunately<00:02:23.879> I'm

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
to concentrate which unfortunately I'm

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.630 
to concentrate which unfortunately I'm
not<00:02:24.390> able<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.959> do<00:02:25.080> at<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.260> moment<00:02:25.530> then<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.310> can

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
not able to do at the moment then it can

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.640 
not able to do at the moment then it can
be<00:02:26.790> made<00:02:26.940> much<00:02:27.120> easier<00:02:27.180> but<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.870> think<00:02:28.140> patience

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
be made much easier but I think patience

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.589 
be made much easier but I think patience
probably<00:02:29.040> is<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.459> best<00:02:29.670> thing<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.420> can<00:02:30.540> have

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
probably is the best thing you can have

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.059 
probably is the best thing you can have
for<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.930> game<00:02:31.110> because<00:02:31.410> if<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.560> try<00:02:31.769> and<00:02:31.890> rush

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
for the game because if you try and rush

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.530 
for the game because if you try and rush
through<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.430> then<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:32.819> will<00:02:33.090> end<00:02:33.269> up<00:02:33.420> getting

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
through it then you will end up getting

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.170 
through it then you will end up getting
yourself<00:02:33.959> killed<00:02:34.019> but<00:02:35.010> anywhere

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
yourself killed but anywhere

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.059 
yourself killed but anywhere
co-op<00:02:36.690> left/right<00:02:37.260> up/down<00:02:37.410> kill<00:02:37.950> the

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
co-op left/right up/down kill the

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.100 
co-op left/right up/down kill the
enemies<00:02:38.370> kill<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.730> bosses<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.599> you

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
enemies kill the bosses and that and you

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.360 
enemies kill the bosses and that and you
just<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:40.410> it<00:02:40.530> for<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.769> other<00:02:40.799> throughout<00:02:41.220> the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
just do it for the other throughout the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.860 
just do it for the other throughout the
entire<00:02:41.640> game<00:02:41.880> the<00:02:42.209> game<00:02:42.360> doesn't<00:02:42.599> change

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
entire game the game doesn't change

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.330 
entire game the game doesn't change
unless<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.380> go<00:02:43.470> into<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.709> challenges<00:02:44.130> which

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
unless you go into the challenges which

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.360 
unless you go into the challenges which
I'm<00:02:44.489> just<00:02:44.519> going<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.849> cut<00:02:44.940> in<00:02:45.060> here<00:02:45.180> now<00:02:46.370> so

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
I'm just going to cut in here now so

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.280 
I'm just going to cut in here now so
challenges<00:02:48.120> are<00:02:48.239> things<00:02:48.450> like<00:02:48.630> this<00:02:48.900> one<00:02:49.079> here

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
challenges are things like this one here

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.420 
challenges are things like this one here
for<00:02:49.470> example<00:02:49.560> where<00:02:49.980> you've<00:02:50.099> just<00:02:50.130> got<00:02:50.400> to

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
for example where you've just got to

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.710 
for example where you've just got to
basically<00:02:50.640> make<00:02:51.000> it<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.390> call

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
basically make it to the call

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.270 
basically make it to the call
you<00:02:51.840> can't<00:02:52.079> shoot<00:02:52.319> or<00:02:52.500> anything<00:02:52.709> you've<00:02:53.069> just

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
you can't shoot or anything you've just

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.220 
you can't shoot or anything you've just
gotta<00:02:53.459> burn<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:53.970> make<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.450> ball<00:02:54.629> so<00:02:55.110> it

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
gotta burn and make it to the ball so it

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.750 
gotta burn and make it to the ball so it
may<00:02:55.440> seem<00:02:55.680> easy<00:02:55.829> but<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.340> is<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.610> first

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
may seem easy but it is the first

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.330 
may seem easy but it is the first
challenge<00:02:57.239> so<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:58.379> do<00:02:58.530> things<00:02:58.829> like<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.160> all

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
challenge so you do things like that all

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.100 
challenge so you do things like that all
the<00:02:59.430> way<00:02:59.489> through<00:02:59.549> for<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.090> Year<00:03:00.450> lemma<00:03:00.750> and

is then the medium is good enough to buy
it<00:03:09.120> for<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.569> main<00:03:09.720> game<00:03:09.900> alone<00:03:10.140> it's<00:03:10.379> one<00:03:10.530> of

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
some extra game time so it's worth

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.670 
some extra game time so it's worth
giving<00:03:24.329> them<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.540> Gore<00:03:24.750> even<00:03:25.170> if<00:03:25.260> it's<00:03:25.410> not<00:03:25.590> the

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
giving them a Gore even if it's not the

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.559 
giving them a Gore even if it's not the
type<00:03:25.859> of<00:03:25.889> thing<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.310> usually<00:03:26.430> like<00:03:26.760> so

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
anyway that's basically some of the

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.699 
anyway that's basically some of the
challenges<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:31.049> whole<00:03:31.200> point<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.560> them

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
challenges and the whole point of them

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.650 
challenges and the whole point of them
all<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.370> time<00:03:32.459> attack<00:03:32.849> mode<00:03:33.120> which<00:03:33.389> is

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
all the time attack mode which is

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.240 
all the time attack mode which is
standard<00:03:34.230> time<00:03:34.410> attack<00:03:34.709> whether<00:03:34.889> the<00:03:35.130> whole

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
standard time attack whether the whole

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.830 
standard time attack whether the whole
point<00:03:35.489> is<00:03:35.639> you<00:03:35.819> beat<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.239> in<00:03:36.359> the<00:03:36.419> best<00:03:36.630> time

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
point is you beat it in the best time

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.379 
point is you beat it in the best time
they<00:03:36.989> can<00:03:37.230> do<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:38.099> I'll<00:03:38.549> put<00:03:38.819> it<00:03:38.880> on<00:03:38.970> this<00:03:39.150> stage

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
they can do so I'll put it on this stage

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.059 
they can do so I'll put it on this stage
because<00:03:39.630> I'm<00:03:39.720> gonna<00:03:39.959> get<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.950> other

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
because I'm gonna get and the other

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.650 
because I'm gonna get and the other
thing<00:03:41.280> about<00:03:41.340> Time<00:03:41.669> Attack<00:03:41.819> which<00:03:42.209> I<00:03:42.419> believe

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
thing about Time Attack which I believe

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.449 
thing about Time Attack which I believe
I've<00:03:42.810> already<00:03:43.049> mentioned<00:03:43.260> is<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:44.040> does<00:03:44.250> give

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
I've already mentioned is it does give

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.159 
I've already mentioned is it does give
you<00:03:44.609> all<00:03:44.849> the<00:03:45.030> weapons<00:03:45.419> right<00:03:45.599> away<00:03:45.870> so<00:03:45.930> I

you all the weapons right away so I

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:47.300 
you all the weapons right away so I
cannot<00:03:46.410> wait<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.709> show<00:03:46.859> off<00:03:46.919> some<00:03:47.160> of<00:03:47.250> the

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
cannot wait to show off some of the

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.849 
cannot wait to show off some of the
weapons<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:48.329> weapons<00:03:48.450> system<00:03:49.049> works<00:03:49.290> if

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
weapons the weapons system works if

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.440 
weapons the weapons system works if
again<00:03:50.609> if<00:03:50.760> you've<00:03:50.880> never<00:03:51.030> played<00:03:51.239> it<00:03:51.389> before

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
again if you've never played it before

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.409 
again if you've never played it before
works<00:03:51.900> in<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.139> wheel<00:03:52.290> you've<00:03:52.919> got<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:54.299> can

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
works in the wheel you've got you can

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:55.879 
works in the wheel you've got you can
equip<00:03:54.630> them<00:03:54.780> at<00:03:54.870> any<00:03:54.989> time<00:03:55.079> and<00:03:55.500> you've<00:03:55.709> got

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
equip them at any time and you've got

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.430 
equip them at any time and you've got
limited<00:03:56.160> ammunition<00:03:56.669> for<00:03:57.120> them<00:03:57.239> so<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:58.290> have

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440

very<00:04:52.740> well<00:04:53.070> series<00:04:53.520> even<00:04:53.729> though<00:04:54.060> to<00:04:54.600> be<00:04:54.720> fair

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750

the<00:04:55.020> rebirth<00:04:55.260> savings<00:04:55.650> has<00:04:55.740> been<00:04:55.860> a<00:04:55.889> bit<00:04:56.070> in

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
the rebirth savings has been a bit in

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.700 
the rebirth savings has been a bit in
but<00:04:56.880> still<00:04:57.360> it's<00:04:57.750> good<00:04:57.930> to<00:04:58.110> say<00:04:58.260> that<00:04:58.289> games

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
but still it's good to say that games

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.379 
but still it's good to say that games
developers<00:04:59.340> are<00:04:59.430> looking<00:04:59.460> backwards<00:05:00.150> as<00:05:00.270> well

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389
