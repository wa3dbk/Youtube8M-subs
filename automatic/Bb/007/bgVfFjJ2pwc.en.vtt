00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:36.069 
the video on the backup camera is very

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:40.529 
the video on the backup camera is very
poor<00:04:36.639> at<00:04:37.300> night<00:04:37.599> get<00:04:38.159> barely<00:04:39.159> usable<00:04:39.539> compared

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
poor at night get barely usable compared

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:43.050 
poor at night get barely usable compared
to<00:04:40.689> other<00:04:41.229> system<00:04:41.710> especially<00:04:41.889> Toyota<00:04:42.759> for<00:04:42.939> me

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
to other system especially Toyota for me

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.360 
to other system especially Toyota for me
as<00:04:43.180> the<00:04:43.360> best<00:04:43.689> system<00:04:43.960> ever<00:04:44.860> I<00:04:45.009> mean<00:04:45.249> the

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
as the best system ever I mean the

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.429 
as the best system ever I mean the
camera<00:04:45.699> is<00:04:45.759> really<00:04:46.449> the<00:04:46.659> best<00:04:46.840> around

00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:47.439 
camera is really the best around

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:49.709 
camera is really the best around
they<00:04:47.620> are<00:04:47.770> nice<00:04:47.979> and<00:04:48.219> it<00:04:48.729> looked<00:04:48.939> like<00:04:48.999> it<00:04:49.300> GT

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:49.719 
they are nice and it looked like it GT

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:52.800 
they are nice and it looked like it GT
me<00:04:49.870> so<00:04:50.830> a<00:04:51.370> little<00:04:52.029> bit<00:04:52.180> of<00:04:52.300> a<00:04:52.330> letdown<00:04:52.539> because

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
me so a little bit of a letdown because

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.559 
me so a little bit of a letdown because
a<00:04:52.990> brand-new<00:04:53.439> pickup<00:04:53.770> brand-new<00:04:54.430> year<00:04:54.639> 2014<00:04:55.539> a

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
a brand-new pickup brand-new year 2014 a

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.450 
a brand-new pickup brand-new year 2014 a
minute<00:04:55.870> certainly<00:04:56.439> can<00:04:56.620> cost<00:04:56.860> that<00:04:57.039> much<00:04:57.279> to

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
minute certainly can cost that much to

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.429 
minute certainly can cost that much to
make<00:04:57.580> a<00:04:57.639> better<00:04:58.060> quality<00:04:58.300> backup<00:04:59.110> camera<00:04:59.409> so

00:04:59.429 --> 00:04:59.439 
make a better quality backup camera so

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:01.459 
make a better quality backup camera so
there<00:04:59.740> we<00:04:59.919> need<00:04:59.979> to<00:05:00.249> improve<00:05:00.520> on<00:05:00.699> on<00:05:01.029> that<00:05:01.180> side

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:01.469 
there we need to improve on on that side

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:04.800 
there we need to improve on on that side
other<00:05:02.469> little<00:05:02.830> chip<00:05:03.129> detail<00:05:03.460> all<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.419> windows

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
other little chip detail all the windows

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.830 
other little chip detail all the windows
are<00:05:04.990> one<00:05:05.259> push<00:05:05.529> down<00:05:06.009> of<00:05:06.400> course<00:05:06.759> but<00:05:07.060> one<00:05:07.629> push

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
are one push down of course but one push

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.779 
are one push down of course but one push
up<00:05:08.080> only<00:05:08.379> the<00:05:08.620> driver<00:05:08.860> side<00:05:09.129> I<00:05:09.370> mean<00:05:09.580> that's

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
up only the driver side I mean that's

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.510 
up only the driver side I mean that's
also<00:05:10.090> a<00:05:10.120> bit<00:05:10.330> cheap<00:05:10.770> we<00:05:11.770> had<00:05:11.860> a<00:05:11.889> century<00:05:12.340> two

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
also a bit cheap we had a century two

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.279 
also a bit cheap we had a century two
weeks<00:05:12.729> ago<00:05:12.969> and<00:05:13.150> it<00:05:13.270> had<00:05:13.479> two<00:05:13.629> point<00:05:13.840> push<00:05:14.050> up

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
weeks ago and it had two point push up

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:16.980 
weeks ago and it had two point push up
for<00:05:14.889> all<00:05:15.009> the<00:05:15.159> windows<00:05:15.460> so<00:05:15.639> I<00:05:15.699> mean<00:05:15.879> why<00:05:16.300> wiping

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
for all the windows so I mean why wiping

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.170 
for all the windows so I mean why wiping
a<00:05:17.169> chip<00:05:17.650> on<00:05:17.830> this<00:05:18.069> a<00:05:18.189> little<00:05:18.460> little<00:05:18.879> annoying

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
a chip on this a little little annoying

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.019 
a chip on this a little little annoying
especially<00:05:19.810> I<00:05:20.259> get<00:05:20.500> the<00:05:20.620> cabin<00:05:20.979> inside<00:05:21.310> is<00:05:21.580> so

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:22.029 
especially I get the cabin inside is so

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:24.209 
especially I get the cabin inside is so
nice<00:05:22.300> it<00:05:22.599> looks<00:05:22.810> like<00:05:23.050> a<00:05:23.080> really<00:05:23.770> upscale

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:24.219 
nice it looks like a really upscale

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:26.579 
nice it looks like a really upscale
truck<00:05:24.699> everything<00:05:25.089> looks<00:05:25.300> fantastic<00:05:26.229> all<00:05:26.409> the

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:26.589 
truck everything looks fantastic all the

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:29.369 
truck everything looks fantastic all the
buttons<00:05:27.009> and<00:05:27.250> everything<00:05:27.699> looks<00:05:28.629> very<00:05:28.839> high

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:29.379 
buttons and everything looks very high

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:31.860 
buttons and everything looks very high
and<00:05:29.620> so<00:05:29.889> it's<00:05:30.159> too<00:05:30.400> bad<00:05:30.550> to<00:05:30.729> chip<00:05:30.939> out<00:05:31.060> of<00:05:31.120> to

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
and so it's too bad to chip out of to

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
stuff in the back you don't have to

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.939 
stuff in the back you don't have to
worry<00:06:25.539> about<00:06:25.629> driving<00:06:26.080> over<00:06:26.439> a<00:06:26.469> bump<00:06:26.800> and

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:26.949 
worry about driving over a bump and

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:29.189 
worry about driving over a bump and
getting<00:06:27.490> everything<00:06:28.059> out<00:06:28.569> of<00:06:28.749> place<00:06:28.990> or

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 
getting everything out of place or

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:31.320 
getting everything out of place or
broken<00:06:30.009> so<00:06:30.159> I<00:06:30.189> think<00:06:30.399> that's<00:06:30.550> the<00:06:30.669> way<00:06:30.819> most

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
broken so I think that's the way most

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.779 
broken so I think that's the way most
pickup<00:06:32.229> owner<00:06:32.469> will<00:06:32.740> will<00:06:33.129> want<00:06:33.370> the<00:06:33.520> drives

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:33.789 
pickup owner will will want the drives
