00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.759
 Good morning guys, the second match in 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.870
 ranking with 1 with the grêmio ee shirt 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.460
 now has in that match against 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.400
 Flemish, how have you been, very good year? 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.439
 past the crowded maracana who knows 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.050
 hopes to repeat that performance and from now on 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.160
 little should start the game as 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.769
 holder 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.880
 The first good day to everyone. 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:33.780
 this is the goal of every player, right? 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:36.690
 do their best to 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.960
 coach waits for the board the supporter 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.890
 and we, too, who are always 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.950
 cheering for us 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.090
 I think that regardless of the difficulties 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.579
 it has to be overcome so that the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.820
 people can continue this good 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.469
 Moment in Brazil, a big year in the 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.090
 has had a good income is a 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.620
 of the leaders of the Brazilian championship 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.829
 but in the last three matches it ended 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.629
 maintaining two defeats and the attackers 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.430
 has not done very well. 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.080
 the store has been talking to theirs the question 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.570
 of the finalization he has charged a lot 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.369
 How is he working this? 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.049
 so that the attackers come back and score goal 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.840
 and has the guild continue with a 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.180
 having positive results 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.640
 yes yes we have worked hard 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.700
 these jobs that the roger has done 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.650
 as you have seen many are good and 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.439
 work hard to finalize you 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.400
 Can I work short with you? 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.500
 can defend to attack and press 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.210
 do all that games 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.710
 require so I think this is key 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.890
 the goals 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.390
 I think it happens naturally in the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.600
 interest in the last three games has 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.280
 few happened but we have to 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.860
 work to improve 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.200
 fernandinho you played little with the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.970
 Fuck you and now the roger is 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.280
 implementing a form of play 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.159
 different without reference to everyone 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.439
 arrives and has a lot of change of position this 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.030
 is the football that best suits your 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.729
 way to play 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.969
 Look how the rock has played yes 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.580
 is something that is good for players 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.530
 who plays on the sides of the field 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.650
 players of my characteristic that 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.599
 help make it easier 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.819
 we have to continue this 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.459
 working in a way that pleases the 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.040
 coach as the group has done and I 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.769
 I think this is fundamental. 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.650
 how do you see this 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.840
 Flemish now has a double 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.420
 very strong and offensive emerson sheik and 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.379
 paulo warrior including debuting in 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.970
 maracana 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.739
 are very strong opponents 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.689
 offensively clear that it has the function is 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.180
 more will be talking about finalization 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:43.680
 further along but as a whole are 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.180
 opponents need to be neutralized 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.019
 by the bandit, right? 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.489
 Yes, they are players who decide 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.889
 matches 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.569
 the paulo warrior so comments oms 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:59.760
 nor winning players and where they pass 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.519
 they conquer and our team knows we 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.189
 we have an excellent defense in my 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:09.450
 very good opinion very very safe in 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:10.920
 passes a very good confidence and with 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.959
 sure we will do our best to 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.879
 neutralize this strong point of the 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.239
 Flemish it is good to remember that they come from 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:21.750
 a defeat in the Brazilian championship is 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.930
 At home, I guess. 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.060
 this helps us to push good pace 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:32.010
 even playing in maracanã probably 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.019
 with the premiere of the warrior and 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.449
 more but our team is focused and 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.199
 You know what we have to look for. 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:39.180
 alternative first time I speak 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:41.340
 with you after the return to talk about 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.139
 this passage in Italian football and 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.760
 that changed the first time you had 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.669
 here in Porto Alegre with this 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.370
 It was a good departure for you that 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:53.549
 characteristics or it was not cool to 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.340
 experience that only helps 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:59.129
 add our football our growth 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.900
 although it was a short time it was well 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.269
 Nice was very well received there. 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.659
 I met Brazilian friends who had 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.760
 played that I played in the athletic miner 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:12.209
 even played here also that rafa 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:16.079
 marquez so that a great defender 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:19.229
 as a very nice person and soccer 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.930
 Italian is what helps because it is 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.580
 a game very much taken thanks 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.320
 also helps in marking the attackers 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.990
 going there back 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.800
 tactically 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.949
 better and I think this has tem tem 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.900
 yes we helped the fernandinho 4 a 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:39.470
 expectation for the season and places 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.300
 will be the number of goal to make games 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.750
 neder number of games in minutes minutes 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:48.500
 played, wait, wait, look, I want to. 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:52.460
 work to reach the greatest number of 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.340
 possible games and not one of form 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.860
 negative is more of a positive power 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.470
 help the team with goals with a pass 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.599
 with the help in the marking that is 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.270
 mainly in this way 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:07.550
 that the roger plays with these two 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.159
 players on the sides of the field that are 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.349
 fundamental in this scheme has to 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:14.020
 also help without the ball and with 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:17.030
 the ball has to make the moves 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.919
 proper fight asking on the day 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.020
 about the grammy limits cut the 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.240
 Copa do Brasil simultaneously wear 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.240
 is greater so far as it can reach the 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.949
 team in brazil and in the cup of brazil 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.289
 tomorrow we are living a 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:34.610
 very good brazilian championship moment 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:38.000
 The canopy of Brazil is kills we know 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.500
 that we lost the game at home but that did not 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.150
 I mean, nothing is open yet. 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:46.909
 we can go there and win the match and in the 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:51.139
 Brazilian I believe that we will go far 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:52.880
 head thought the goals the 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.979
 The roger's work has also been 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.099
 fundamental I do not need to talk you have 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:00.229
 seen and how he works in 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:03.680
 honestly correct way I think everything 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:04.370
 This helps us achieve something very 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.699
 bigger 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.680
 white boy when you was in Italy the 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:13.039
 players got to talk to the direction 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.080
 and to ask for his return the rhodolfo does not 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:17.030
 You know that you are very close to him he 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.909
 have a situation of who knows how to 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.889
 club now you or the group have arrived 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:24.020
 make the reverse process talk to 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:24.590
 Rhodolfo can stay here for now 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.250
 I spoke 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:30.860
 I already faked the law, Port helps me 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.909
 help I'm late now that although I 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.000
 to abandon 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:37.219
 we know that the good situation for 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.560
 he is also coughing good or better 

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:40.080
 he's my friend from the sao paulo 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.599
 knowing 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.090
 there and I'm in the crowd to be 

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:48.180
 made the best if in his life right? 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:51.659
 Of course, for me, it's good too. 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:54.780
 have the presence of rhodolfo is a leader and 

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:56.849
 It is one of the best defenders in the 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.939
 brazilian and soccer championship 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:03.689
 Brazil today and would be a very 

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:06.530
 big but if it's the best for him I'm 

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:06.530
 hoping that everything works out 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.940
 i
