00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.310
 Russia and President Putin in particular 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.750
 directly responsible for making 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.460
 separatists collaborate with experts 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.540
 that's less of what they can do 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.839
 territory controlled by Russia 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.029
 Russian-supported rebels and weapons 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.779
 more likely to be delivered 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.519
 Russia Russia can not just wash their hands 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.869
 This tragedy is the result of the fact that Russia 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.849
 destabilize a sovereign state 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.590
 violates its territorial integrity 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.759

 groupings council of ministers of foreign 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.230
 I decided to expand the black list 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.809
 Russian citizens who will 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.340
 extend new sanctions list 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.160
 also included Russian companies 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.800
 working in the field of energy defense and 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.660
 Finance was also compiled 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.500
 one document is the so-called list 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.050
 sanctions 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.480
 Level three reports that these 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.460
 sanctions will be imposed in case 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.949
 Russia will continue to supply the rebels 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:04.140
 weapons technology and people with regard to 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.880
 measures taken from they are 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.710
 natural consequences of the adopted 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.450
 European Council decisions and 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.260
 continuing absence 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.090
 cooperation from the Russian side 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.640
 the white house has long insisted 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.009
 to have taken a tougher stance in 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.500
 Regarding Russia, the United States welcomes 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.930
 EU imposed sanctions and even 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.180
 insist on full weapons m borg 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.049
 France has announced that it will fulfill its 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.040
 obligations for the submission of Russia 1 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.229
 Mistral-type helicopter carrier 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.430
 but may be forced to give up 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.329
 sending the second ship to Moscow 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.829
 washington is definitely trying 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.509
 take advantage of the situation to 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.920
 destroy the french european 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.560
 military industry 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.659
 I am talking about the ships Mistral I do not think 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.549
 that we will stop the delivery french 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.270
 the government stated that the final 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.310
 the answer will be given in October 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.270
 uk minister of internal affairs 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.880
 announced open 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.700
 investigations into the death of the former 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.150
 FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko in 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.880
 2006 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.520
 this part is being held Russophobic 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.930
 uk government companies 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.030
 hope to pay attention again 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.160
 public on this matter she will be able to 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.790
 set up more people against Russia 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.170
 I think this is just a political move. 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.150
 according to reports the english minister 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.770
 stated that the decision to 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.730
 investigating the case 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.310
 Litvinenko 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.130
 right now just a coincidence 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.770
 which is likely to worsen the already 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.580
 strained relations with Russia Polina
