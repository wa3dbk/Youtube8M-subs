00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.330
 in my garden the bux fuming rages 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.590
 the Buchholzz端nsler is only a few 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.150
 a pest and we can then over 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.640
 the second also talk namely that is 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.380
 the mushroom so boxwood to the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.960
 There is a fight against the Buchholzz端nslers 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.529
 biologically only a single agent 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:29.310
 bacillus thuringiensis that is under 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.849
 the name central copies is in the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.000
 trade 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.030
 You have to do it exactly at the time where 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.480
 Apply the crawlers and apply 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.710
 while applying with such a strong 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.160
 inject that you really 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.680
 this waxy and money spinning 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.239
 the mesh penetrates it must directly 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.800
 be caterpillar infested 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.050
 So who is to be feared so you have to 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.360
 say and that had to and unfortunately has to 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.219
 we are in Austria in the east 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.949
 Austria is extremely come four 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.730
 to six generations four to six 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.590
 generations 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.680
 that means you have to do that four to six 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:09.740
 times apply is different depending 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.409
 on how fast I travel so 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.030
 an average of 14 days three weeks 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.650
 this is the boxwood breeder and now 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.119
 Can I have a second sad message 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.680
 say I say only with the box is in 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.590
 die at the moment of the boxwood mushroom 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.920
 cylinder gladium buchsi cola at home too 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.840
 Life 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.350
 Now you notice the skin before that was 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.420
 the main question of recent years begins 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.310
 as if to mark cats on one 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.259
 hedge gate brown spot gate brown 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.659
 stain and everything dies with one blow 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.060
 his small vegetable garden 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.610
 bauerngarten had no bugs hedge 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.649
 as well as cut in baroque gardens with too 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.200
 balls will be wonderful 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.370
 really looked within a 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.680
 Only summer has been there 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.810
 to do something like that and have it now 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.050
 organic gardener almost on the border whole 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.150
 horsetail tea take ten degrees 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.220
 several times over again if it is only 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.630
 Preventive or steam is at 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.280
 any of targeted and say 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.200
 we have fungicides there you have to 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.930
 every three weeks on walls and always 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.570
 it always alternates and turns it on 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.430
 eternal and that is that's the problem 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:21.370
 and that's what that's supposed to be 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.790
 exactly 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.790
 it is exotic 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.220
 In principle, the garden world always says 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.830
 is not nature so the garden world 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.900
 is always an artificial world and grew 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.030
 in fitted and he was great he 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.360
 has been raped, of course 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.340
 originally some plants in the 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.620
 home plant some plants and what we have 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.020
 made of it we have set design 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.240
 we have patience we really have 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.500
 fed in infinite measure that he 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.380
 grows faster and eventually 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.760
 probably program and that is 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.310
 probably the point you are right 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.110
 there are wonderful alternative to 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.820
 first book the first dying 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.680
 handsome ericsson with prince charles and 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.310
 heiko was probably the garden scant 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.180
 visit 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.650
 there everything was amt and replaced amanda 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.130
 Amanda replaces is a beautiful one 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.530
 plant amanda dough rome has no 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.540
 leaves you can cut and has for 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.640
 these little ones are just chopping and talking 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.489
 this bauerngarten hedges the honorable 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.610
 garden buchs it is beautiful for 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.220
 the bigger ones i would take alex 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.989
 alex holly that does not exist in any 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.989
 different platforms is one 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:39.420
 beautiful plants 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:42.280
 Outside stands only for books 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.080
 we also surrendered at home 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.180
 the only nice thing about it is that one 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.530
 few neighbors are happy because finally 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.900
 recently but neighbor to me and has 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.440
 blasted with you now too die 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.269
 plant a few 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.780
 no, that's just too hard 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.340
 become 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.599
 I was too big for that 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.200
 also convinced that in a few 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.670
 years as well as every illness itself 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.170
 normalized a bit again 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.459
 then again certain things possible 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.620
 I am also convinced but 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.390
 At the moment it is really only quartering 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.519
 your book relatively difficult perhaps 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.680
 an interesting observation because 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.989
 that is an interactive through which he is in 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.790
 internet represented www biogarten at 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.979
 get a lot of mails and have 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.180
 some mood has got the amseln 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.610
 apparently the caterpillars of the 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.860
 discovered Baumholzz端nslers and bring the 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.400
 there is now compare but me 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:32.320
 said thinking back 20 to 30 years ago 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.810
 the first clip gaps came up 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.840
 have everyone said it must not 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.280
 and common today is likely 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.970
 and probably is at the beginning 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.180
 been 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.630
 this is not the case of the Buchholzz端nsler systems 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.860
 tasted so own own so bad 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.050
 so there is somehow 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.060
 it will be all the same 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.380
 somehow off and also with the mushrooms 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:59.830
 against mushrooms and I am I am there always 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.300
 very optimistic and positive thinking it 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.130
 will solve itself maybe it is not 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.650
 makes sense every year three billion 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.370
 books sold and sets this 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.370
 probably was too much
