 is f 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:52.040

 The easiest way to press f 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.940
 How to use simple f code 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.310
 Eg c 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.680
 scene 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.890
 a minor 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.019
 Suppose there is a code progression f 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.620
 can 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.620
 scene 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.850

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.850
 me 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.210
 me

 It is hard to hold the last f valley code 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.530
 In this case, use the simple way of pressing f 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.490
 This way you can use a simple f 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:33.000
