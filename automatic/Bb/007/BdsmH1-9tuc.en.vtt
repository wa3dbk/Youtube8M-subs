Hi everyone and welcome for this new recipe

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.000
We're going to cook "sticks feuilletés"

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We need puff pastry, poppy, cumin and sesam seeds, 
 egg yolk ans a bit of salt

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Unroll puff pastry, then mix egg yolk with a 
 pinch of salt and a spoon of water

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Spread it, that will give a golden and crunchy effect

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Separate it in 3 parts, use sesame for the first one then poppy and cumin 
 to finish, but don't put too much of it, it's a strong flavored seed

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Now, cut sliver vertically

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and recut them in 3 horizontally

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Let them like this or twist them to have something more attractive

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Cook them for about 10 - 15 minutes, but keep an eye on them, 
 they need to be just lightly brown otherwise they will be too dry

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.000
They're perfect, use your imagination, you can replace seeds by 
 dry tomatoes, herbs or whatever you want ...

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's nice and tasty, why should i resist 
 ?!
my favorites are with poppy seeds

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Bon appétit !
