00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
actually used the F but just basically

actually used the F but just basically
the<00:05:29.669> shape<00:05:29.880> about<00:05:30.180> describing<00:05:30.630> FD<00:05:30.960> like<00:05:31.020> use

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
the shape about describing FD like use

it wait for it to actually connect and
then

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
then

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.690

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
the whole look took he did it was like a

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.730 
the whole look took he did it was like a
like<00:05:42.420> love<00:05:42.630> take<00:05:42.810> ed<00:05:43.020> public<00:05:43.350> but<00:05:43.560> he<00:05:43.620> was<00:05:43.710> just

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
like love take ed public but he was just

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.590 
like love take ed public but he was just
on<00:05:44.040> the<00:05:44.130> boundary<00:05:44.430> I<00:05:44.520> guessed<00:05:44.790> that<00:05:45.480> was

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 
on the boundary I guessed that was

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.960 
on the boundary I guessed that was
really<00:05:45.870> on<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.140> edge<00:05:46.760> but<00:05:47.760> don't

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
really on the edge but don't

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.610 
really on the edge but don't
underestimate<00:05:48.240> how<00:05:48.630> fast<00:05:48.660> that<00:05:49.170> projectile

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
underestimate how fast that projectile

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.860 
underestimate how fast that projectile
travels<00:05:50.040> 1100<00:05:50.820> is<00:05:51.030> like<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:51.330> least<00:05:51.570> that's

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
travels 1100 is like the least that's

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.930 
travels 1100 is like the least that's
how<00:05:51.960> fast<00:05:52.230> it<00:05:52.380> is<00:05:52.500> right<00:05:52.710> there<00:05:52.740> yeah<00:05:53.550> plenty

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
how fast it is right there yeah plenty

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.490 
how fast it is right there yeah plenty
