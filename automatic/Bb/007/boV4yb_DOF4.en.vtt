00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.480
 hello everyone a greeting from sucre 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.000
 city quesada san carlos from 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.740
 hydrogen vehicular costa rica east 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.380
 Now what we want to show is 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.880
 basically this good this is a 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.309
 hydrogen system that we place does 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.890
 several months what we want to show in 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.630
 really good here we have all the 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.329
 components that we normally use 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.350
 this has two reserves but what 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:28.320
 we want to show is like this 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.250
 it really is the method that we use 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.270
 to measure fuel consumption 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.490
 then on this occasion 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.530
 let's go to do the tour that 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.990
 we usually do 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.790
 see you later 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.050
 the route that we normally do with 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.780
 this device with this device 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.090
 We can measure fuel consumption 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.950
 in real time 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.510
 and this 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:58.019
 and this is not necessary 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.870
 fill the tank and much less here 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.719
 we can see then what would be the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.970
 fuel reading or consumption of 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.590
 real-time fuel that is the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.659
 immediate and the one below is the average 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.870
 then currently the one that matters to us 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.910
 is the average 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.910
 and we are going to do the test 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.470
 ah 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.700
 only with fear 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.420
 that we turn the route east 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.040
 around three kilometers in 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.030
 kilometer and a half or one way and that two 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.030
 meters and a half of laps 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.460
 this same test is done to 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.100
 vehicle before installation and 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.600
 after doing the installation of both 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.280
 good strings the previous one and the 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.640
 before the system and after 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.640
 system 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.379
 i 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.840
 point 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:42.170
 ok and here we have then our 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:46.300
 measured with 32.4 30 and 2.5 kilometers 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:50.450
 gallon is that he now performs the vehicle 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:53.240
 that ok we have an interesting increase in 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.770
 24 kilometers per gallon to 32.5 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.020
 kilometers per gallon 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:01.830
 and then this is the way we measure 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.050
 fuel consumption and this is a 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:08.569
 apparatus a device well enough 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.569
 pretty good pretty trust ok
