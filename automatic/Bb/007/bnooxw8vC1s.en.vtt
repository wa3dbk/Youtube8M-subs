 the camera can see right law here 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.850
 behind the box has the specifications 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.609
 his 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.160
 the box is not too big and well 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.820
 compact even I do not know why that 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.550
 to taste good cheaper I think 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.430
 same language he's talking about that comes 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.620
 madrid box and his specifications 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.460
 Now we're going to open here with a 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.410
 kitchen knife a person after 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.110
 much suffering me I use a camera 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.829
 I managed to open the box is already on the floor. 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:01:01.350
 counts in the annoying box of April but already 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:01:08.430
 done here face comes with the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:10.260
 of the worm is strong in 11 techniques 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:20.880
 way to use this kind of thing does not 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:22.560
 leave well here sticker and one more to 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.340
 so I do not know what is probably 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:35.990
 this in the specifications for not taking 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:35.990
 nothing to conquer 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.990
 an adapter an expander of cars 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.740
 probably you are not using a 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.220
 little away from only your office you can 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.280
 use the icon has been expelled 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.200
 His case is very simple on the staff. 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.250
 Let's talk a little about the cable he 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.740
 Come on, I'll get the microphone. 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.470
 you can put journalists 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.130
 nelito is not very thick some 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.150
 people have some problems since the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.040
 20th century 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.510
 there is a city that at Cape Green is 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.640
 personal lie 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.470
 It may even be that the end is very 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.240
 thick but that goes of the dollar does not have 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.190
 people who stay for years against the invitation 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.930
 people who stay that way depends on the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.840
 government for not being very careful about 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:32.730
 my camera man is not careful on r7 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.380
 Then what happens? I do not know, I will. 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.330
 traveling I'll talk to you at the end of 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.150
 video was unbelievable longing passed 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.660
 said Andrew and until I have a 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:48.690
 exit of carlo ponti that yes a tip 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:52.830
 goes the roni and the microphone is very soft is 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.989
 and pulled it I hope not take no 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.970
 I'm the ear, I think you can see me. 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.230
 I even found it a little close 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.790
 You can see that not that rubber 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:05.100
 It's a very well ventilated his school a 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.230
 symbol and if we dictate you can 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.680
 take hours with passages that people 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:18.270
 Wow, you have a drawing is forces and 11 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:21.810
 it's retractable too so it comes written 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:25.200
 maybe for those who work with 20 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:29.220
 his microphone is standard is not the 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.360
 microphone as if it were you keep him 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.000
 he is very simple 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.470
 it moves quite nearly 360 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.480
 degrees 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.819
 I recommend that you take care 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.610
 because it might be that if you have too much 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.280
 Careful, you're advancing to megaezzim. 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.200
 and it will not get very nice 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.769
 Good thing I can already say of 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.599
 This website is very light and is 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.420
 extremely high in the case where all 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:04:03.080
 very light even if there is no 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:06.380
 here to see if it's soft guys is fine 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.720
 soft it covers the entire ear 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.650
 almost does not result in computing by 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.620
 out 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:16.100
 he is well over five table 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.049
 he is not that the ons in note 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.570
 it is normal but you can use a 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:27.290
 rope 7 story to go there will get better 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:30.169
 still comes with a fan here is not anymore 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.210
 in your head that usually 07 when 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.290
 you use a lot then start the island with 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.720
 head 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:40.340
 so we'll be back in the 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.360
 microphone personnel is the test 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.130
 microphone 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.350
 I really liked his microphone. 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.840
 excellent quality I'll just let you know 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.030
 here he is very sensitive to the microphone 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.530
 so avoid buying who to avoid 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.650
 leave very close to your mouth to 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.970
 avoid hissing or those spitting boring 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.370
 microphone that I hope is not 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.470
 happening to me at the exact moment 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.150
 sensitivity is very high so I 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.110
 I do not recommend that you use more than ten 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:08.270
 decibels on windows is on the wire 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.130
 I had spoken of the adapter that did not 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.900
 You know, there's no such thing as a personal inclusion. 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.050
 they did it just in case you want 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.810
 use it on your cell phone or mp3 and the senator 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.900
 want to use and how raid71 pc you go 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.520
 need rather deputy luizinho to 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.760
 you have the tip on the microphone to turn on 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.950
 it is compatible with windows and mech 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.720
 I talked to the mechanic so I do not have 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.580
 sure if you can use it as e 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.100
 seven on linux 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.530
 I'm not sure that he is well 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.090
 light it gives a very good bass to 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.460
 quality of the speaker is very 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.040
 really good 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.290
 although it is not a 7.1 as matte tea 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.280
 or how they deal with life they did not receive 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.550
 the thousand reais 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.230
 it is very good isolates when 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.730
 I was in a song what is 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.480
 happening around you so if you 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:58.520
 want to get rid of songs or things 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.920
 what are going on just turns noise 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.170
 in your house use it is very loud or not 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.790
 much at the time do not think the ear that 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.940
 you will disappear 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.950
 He is very good, there are no ears. 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.890
 The year at least with me is happening. 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.660
 it insulates well as I already said 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.190
 it serves right on the clear ear that 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.440
 you have now much too big will 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.940
 lose a much bigger set but this one already 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.970
 it's a good size 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.500
 he is very soft the part he portrays but 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.480
 you have in your head serves think 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.830
 all kinds of head then you will not 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.810
 have a problem with that 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.800
 This is it, I hope you guys have 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.900
 liked what you saw 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.880
 I'm sorry for my clothes because I had 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.480
 just woke up when it ran 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.400
 arrived and I'm sorry and also there 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.840
 nice review audio scoreboard 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.460
 meant very good stayed a bit 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.770
 quality will burst and I'll see if I can 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:49.540
 I can improve on editing a bit 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.540
 That's when I said ok, and see you later.
