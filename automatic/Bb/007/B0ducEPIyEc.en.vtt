okay<00:00:12.420> here's<00:00:12.690> what<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:12.870> did<00:00:12.990> I've<00:00:13.620> got<00:00:13.889> two

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
okay here's what I did I've got two

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.070 
okay here's what I did I've got two
sprockets<00:00:14.490> stacked<00:00:15.059> on<00:00:15.269> top<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.599> each<00:00:15.780> other

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
sprockets stacked on top of each other

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.960 
sprockets stacked on top of each other
it's<00:00:16.590> kind<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.859> hard<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.130> see<00:00:17.400> down<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:17.789> there

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
it's kind of hard to see down in there

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.210 
it's kind of hard to see down in there
but<00:00:18.660> there<00:00:18.810> are<00:00:18.960> two<00:00:19.140> sprockets<00:00:19.500> in<00:00:19.920> between

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
but there are two sprockets in between

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.740 
but there are two sprockets in between
the<00:00:20.340> two<00:00:20.460> sprockets<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.270> little<00:00:21.420> collar

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
the two sprockets is that little collar

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.490 
the two sprockets is that little collar
that<00:00:22.590> holds<00:00:23.039> your<00:00:23.160> original<00:00:23.580> sprocket<00:00:24.090> on<00:00:24.500> so

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
that holds your original sprocket on so

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.880 
that holds your original sprocket on so
this<00:00:25.949> outer<00:00:26.220> sprocket<00:00:27.029> basically<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.990> just<00:00:28.680> on

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
this outer sprocket basically is just on

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.439 
this outer sprocket basically is just on
that<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.220> little<00:00:29.340> bit<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.640> spline<00:00:30.029> that's

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
that a little bit of spline that's

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.900 
that a little bit of spline that's
sticking<00:00:30.990> out<00:00:31.230> from<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.529> collar<00:00:31.820> put<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
sticking out from that collar put the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.229 
sticking out from that collar put the
two<00:00:33.090> bolts<00:00:33.500> in<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.620> center<00:00:34.980> here<00:00:35.010> well<00:00:36.000> not

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
two bolts in the center here well not

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.190 
two bolts in the center here well not
the<00:00:36.329> center<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.660> off<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> left<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.170> right

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the center of it off the left and right

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.459 
the center of it off the left and right
I<00:00:38.180> clean<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.329> threads<00:00:39.570> off<00:00:39.899> down<00:00:40.170> close<00:00:40.440> to

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
I clean the threads off down close to

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.590 
I clean the threads off down close to
the<00:00:40.649> head<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.550> they<00:00:41.700> actually<00:00:41.850> have<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.360> thread

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
the head so they actually have to thread

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.630 
the head so they actually have to thread
through<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.200> then<00:00:43.680> they<00:00:43.800> grab<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.250> second

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
through and then they grab the second

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.610 
through and then they grab the second
one<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:44.969> then<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.539> can<00:00:45.719> tighten<00:00:46.050> them<00:00:46.140> down<00:00:46.170> and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
one and then I can tighten them down and

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.920 
one and then I can tighten them down and
it<00:00:46.739> locks<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.250> sprocket<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.149> inside

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
it locks that sprocket to the inside

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.319 
it locks that sprocket to the inside
sprocket<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.730> then<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.789> course<00:00:50.850> we<00:00:51.090> drilled

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
sprocket and then of course we drilled

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.779 
sprocket and then of course we drilled
the<00:00:51.449> shaft<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.280> threaded<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.520> was<00:00:53.610> kind

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the shaft and threaded it that was kind

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.299 
the shaft and threaded it that was kind
of<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.910> pain<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.239> butt<00:00:54.590> but<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.860> Bolton

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
of a pain in the butt but this Bolton

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.160 
of a pain in the butt but this Bolton

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
the back i do have a bracket made know

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.090 
the back i do have a bracket made know
if<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.229> see<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.590> downer<00:01:16.770> there's<00:01:17.009> a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
if you can see that downer there's a

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.050 
if you can see that downer there's a
bracket<00:01:17.670> that's<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.119> stock<00:01:18.479> honda<00:01:18.960> sprocket

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
bracket that's the stock honda sprocket

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.510 
bracket that's the stock honda sprocket
with<00:01:21.060> an<00:01:21.330> adapter<00:01:21.720> bracket<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.710> what<00:01:23.310> that

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
with an adapter bracket and what that

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.630 
with an adapter bracket and what that
does<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.820> allows<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.659> rear<00:01:25.080> sprocket<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:26.400> set

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
does is allows the rear sprocket to set

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.030 
does is allows the rear sprocket to set
inward<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.960> actually<00:01:28.110> sits<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.680> kind<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.979> a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
inward it actually sits in kind of a

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.310 
inward it actually sits in kind of a
little<00:01:29.189> bit<00:01:29.280> over<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> hub<00:01:29.939> that's<00:01:30.720> probably

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
little bit over the hub that's probably

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.899 
little bit over the hub that's probably
what<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.710> mean<00:01:31.860> I've<00:01:31.950> actually<00:01:32.159> what's<00:01:32.460> causing

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
what I mean I've actually what's causing

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.390 
what I mean I've actually what's causing
the<00:01:33.030> chain<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.299> rebel<00:01:33.720> my<00:01:33.869> tire<00:01:34.110> but<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:35.280> I

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the chain to rebel my tire but like I

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.280 
the chain to rebel my tire but like I
said<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.909> doesn't<00:01:35.939> hit<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.329> wheel<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.869> I

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
said it doesn't hit the wheel and I

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.020 
said it doesn't hit the wheel and I
figured<00:01:37.650> forget<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.430> chain<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.790> going<00:01:38.939> to

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
figured forget it the chain is going to

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.510 
figured forget it the chain is going to
win<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.869> know<00:01:39.990> chain<00:01:40.320> versus<00:01:40.710> tire<00:01:40.920> forget<00:01:41.400> it

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
win you know chain versus tire forget it

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.219 
win you know chain versus tire forget it
so<00:01:42.450> any<00:01:42.659> rate<00:01:43.490> that<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.729> about<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.420> as<00:01:45.869> far<00:01:46.079> as

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
so any rate that is about it as far as

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.940 
so any rate that is about it as far as
what<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.380> had<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.710> do<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:46.979> run<00:01:47.399> one<00:01:47.610> single<00:01:48.090> chain

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
what I had to do to run one single chain

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.450 
what I had to do to run one single chain
it's<00:01:49.950> uh

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.859 

like<00:01:53.180> I<00:01:53.270> say<00:01:53.510> oh<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.110> shifter<00:01:54.650> yes<00:01:55.869> okay

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
like I say oh and the shifter yes okay

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.740 
like I say oh and the shifter yes okay
moving<00:01:57.140> in<00:01:57.320> on<00:01:57.440> the<00:01:57.470> shifter<00:01:58.010> here<00:01:58.250> I<00:01:58.659> had<00:01:59.659> to

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
moving in on the shifter here I had to

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.890 
moving in on the shifter here I had to
take<00:01:59.960> the<00:01:59.990> shifter<00:02:01.330> little<00:02:02.330> little<00:02:02.659> piece

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
take the shifter little little piece

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.800

here this isn't sitting in as far as it
should<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.480> just<00:02:23.630> barely<00:02:23.840> clears<00:02:24.319> the

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
should and it just barely clears the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.860 
should and it just barely clears the
sprocket<00:02:24.950> but<00:02:25.610> he'll<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:25.940> hasn't<00:02:26.300> moved<00:02:26.420> on<00:02:26.720> me

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
sprocket but he'll it hasn't moved on me

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.800 
sprocket but he'll it hasn't moved on me
at<00:02:26.989> all<00:02:28.180> yeah<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.239> don't<00:02:29.480> need<00:02:29.570> to<00:02:29.630> know<00:02:29.720> about

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
at all yeah you don't need to know about

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.240 
at all yeah you don't need to know about
the<00:02:29.989> bracket<00:02:30.380> you're<00:02:30.530> not<00:02:30.620> doing<00:02:30.890> that<00:02:30.920> but

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
the bracket you're not doing that but

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.180 
the bracket you're not doing that but
that<00:02:32.180> works<00:02:32.420> out<00:02:32.600> for<00:02:32.810> me<00:02:32.870> pretty<00:02:33.140> good<00:02:33.440> so

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
that works out for me pretty good so

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.979 
that works out for me pretty good so
short<00:02:34.880> of<00:02:34.970> taking<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.269> inner<00:02:35.420> sprocket<00:02:35.959> and

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
short of taking the inner sprocket and

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.470 
short of taking the inner sprocket and
you<00:02:36.800> know<00:02:36.920> grinding<00:02:37.670> all<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.880> teeth<00:02:38.090> off<00:02:38.330> of

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
you know grinding all the teeth off of

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.449 
you know grinding all the teeth off of
it<00:02:38.600> I<00:02:38.660> figured<00:02:38.959> why<00:02:39.080> waste<00:02:39.290> 27<00:02:39.950> bucks<00:02:40.190> because

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
it I figured why waste 27 bucks because

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.910 
it I figured why waste 27 bucks because
I<00:02:40.790> bought<00:02:41.450> two<00:02:41.630> brand<00:02:42.019> new<00:02:42.110> sprockets<00:02:42.650> I<00:02:42.739> think

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
I bought two brand new sprockets I think

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.949 
I bought two brand new sprockets I think
their<00:02:43.040> son<00:02:43.280> lines<00:02:43.519> brockett's<00:02:44.090> they<00:02:44.180> were<00:02:44.239> 27

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
their son lines brockett's they were 27

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.320 
their son lines brockett's they were 27
bucks<00:02:45.170> piece<00:02:45.560> so<00:02:46.489> I<00:02:46.519> figured<00:02:46.850> this<00:02:46.910> way<00:02:47.150> when

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
bucks piece so I figured this way when

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.120 
bucks piece so I figured this way when
one<00:02:47.480> wears<00:02:47.690> out<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:47.930> can<00:02:48.170> take<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.530> apart<00:02:48.680> flip

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
one wears out I can take it apart flip

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.380 
one wears out I can take it apart flip
it<00:02:49.250> around<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.640> still<00:02:49.850> got<00:02:49.970> another<00:02:50.209> good

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
it around I still got another good

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.330 
it around I still got another good
