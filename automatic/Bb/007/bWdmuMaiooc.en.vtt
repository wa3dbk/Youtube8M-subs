00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
biomechanical causes of knee pain

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.660 
biomechanical causes of knee pain
probably<00:00:04.470> one<00:00:04.740> of<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.890> most<00:00:04.980> commonly<00:00:05.490> cited

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
probably one of the most commonly cited

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.610 
probably one of the most commonly cited
running<00:00:06.390> injuries<00:00:06.810> any<00:00:06.960> way<00:00:07.170> would<00:00:07.470> be<00:00:07.500> to

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
running injuries any way would be to

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.430 
running injuries any way would be to
have<00:00:08.340> anterior<00:00:09.179> or<00:00:09.240> front<00:00:09.360> knee<00:00:09.840> pain<00:00:10.110> pain

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
have anterior or front knee pain pain

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.290 
have anterior or front knee pain pain
behind<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.740> kneecap<00:00:10.920> or<00:00:11.400> pain<00:00:11.580> around<00:00:11.910> the

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
behind the kneecap or pain around the

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.560 
behind the kneecap or pain around the
kneecap<00:00:12.630> area<00:00:13.790> essentially<00:00:14.790> if<00:00:15.089> you<00:00:15.210> think<00:00:15.420> of

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
kneecap area essentially if you think of

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.880 
kneecap area essentially if you think of
the<00:00:15.660> knee<00:00:15.839> as<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:17.480> it's<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.570> hinge<00:00:18.810> or<00:00:19.170> modified

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
the knee as a it's a hinge or modified

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.529 
the knee as a it's a hinge or modified
hinge<00:00:20.160> joint<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.789> allows<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.240> rotate

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
hinge joint that allows you to rotate

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.769 
hinge joint that allows you to rotate
through<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.830> has<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.220> be<00:00:23.340> stable<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:24.359> both<00:00:24.570> that

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
through it has to be stable in both that

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.220 
through it has to be stable in both that
position<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.920> position<00:00:26.210> it<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:28.199> a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
position and that position it is a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.560 
position and that position it is a
tension<00:00:29.189> compression<00:00:29.550> matrix<00:00:30.269> so<00:00:30.390> there's

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
tension compression matrix so there's

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.569 
tension compression matrix so there's
soft<00:00:30.810> tissue<00:00:31.050> holding<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.279> pulling

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
soft tissue holding it and pulling

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.430 
soft tissue holding it and pulling
against<00:00:33.180> itself<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.809> all<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> different

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
against itself in all the different

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.790 
against itself in all the different
directions<00:00:34.820> it's<00:00:36.020> translating<00:00:37.020> force<00:00:37.380> that's

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
directions it's translating force that's

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
directions it's translating force that's
created<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:39.180> hip<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.590> in<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.829> foot<00:00:41.040> okay

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
created in the hip and in the foot okay

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.639 
created in the hip and in the foot okay
so<00:00:41.879> as<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> foot<00:00:42.480> rolls<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:42.989> out<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.350> moves

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
so as the foot rolls in and out it moves

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.709 
so as the foot rolls in and out it moves
the<00:00:43.800> tibia<00:00:44.129> as<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.850> hip<00:00:45.000> rolls<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.450> out<00:00:45.570> it

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
the tibia as the hip rolls in and out it

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.910 
the tibia as the hip rolls in and out it
moves<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.260> femur<00:00:47.149> so<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:48.510> your<00:00:49.170> foots<00:00:49.469> rolling

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
moves the femur so if your foots rolling

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.299 
moves the femur so if your foots rolling
in<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.280> your<00:00:51.000> femurs<00:00:51.480> rolling<00:00:51.780> out<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.890> get<00:00:53.100> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
in and your femurs rolling out you get a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.520 
in and your femurs rolling out you get a
twist<00:00:53.670> going<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.149> at<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.300> knee<00:00:54.449> or<00:00:54.629> vice<00:00:55.020> versa

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
twist going on at the knee or vice versa

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.049 
twist going on at the knee or vice versa
so<00:00:55.829> they<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.370> happen<00:00:56.579> in

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
so they have to happen in

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.819 
so they have to happen in
synchronization<00:00:57.719> with<00:00:58.170> each<00:00:58.289> other<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
synchronization with each other the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.270 
synchronization with each other the
rolling<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.430> out<00:00:59.870> if<00:01:00.870> they<00:01:01.379> don't<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:02.039> get

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
rolling in and out if they don't you get

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.700 
rolling in and out if they don't you get
the<00:01:02.850> kneecap<00:01:03.239> running<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.049> down<00:01:04.140> out<00:01:04.530> of

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
the kneecap running up and down out of

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.039 
the kneecap running up and down out of
its<00:01:04.860> groove<00:01:05.159> or<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.580> get<00:01:05.760> excess<00:01:06.180> load<00:01:06.450> medial

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
its groove or you get excess load medial

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.920 
its groove or you get excess load medial
knee<00:01:07.200> pain<00:01:07.549> through<00:01:08.549> there<00:01:09.260> also<00:01:10.260> things<00:01:11.040> like

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
knee pain through there also things like

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.420 
knee pain through there also things like
weak<00:01:12.930> muscles<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> inside<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:14.130> your<00:01:14.220> knee

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
weak muscles on the inside of your knee

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.219 
weak muscles on the inside of your knee
will<00:01:14.939> mean<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.330> kneecap<00:01:15.689> doesn't<00:01:16.049> run

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
will mean that the kneecap doesn't run

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.080 
will mean that the kneecap doesn't run
smoothly<00:01:16.590> say<00:01:16.920> start<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.340> get<00:01:17.490> knee<00:01:17.610> pain<00:01:17.880> like

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
smoothly say start to get knee pain like

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.749 
smoothly say start to get knee pain like
that<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:18.869> essentially<00:01:19.409> from<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.920> from<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.580> foot

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
that but essentially from a from a foot

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.120 
that but essentially from a from a foot
point<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.119> view<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.990> pronate<00:01:22.409> too<00:01:22.860> late

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
point of view if you pronate too late

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.969 
point of view if you pronate too late
into<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.520> step<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.840> rolls<00:01:25.200> your<00:01:25.470> tibia<00:01:25.830> in

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
into the step it rolls your tibia in

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.289 
into the step it rolls your tibia in
well<00:01:26.250> your<00:01:26.400> theme<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.759> trying<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> roll<00:01:27.180> you

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
well your theme is trying to roll you

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.870 
well your theme is trying to roll you
out<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.229> end<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.590> getting<00:01:28.740> twists<00:01:29.670> and

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
out so you end up getting twists and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.910 
out so you end up getting twists and
compressions<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.570> rotations<00:01:31.049> there<00:01:31.320> if<00:01:31.619> it

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
compressions and rotations there if it

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.980 
compressions and rotations there if it
happens<00:01:32.250> too<00:01:32.430> quickly<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.329> can<00:01:33.479> get<00:01:33.570> strange

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
happens too quickly you can get strange

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.560 
happens too quickly you can get strange
down<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.439> iliotibial<00:01:34.710> band<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.670> into<00:01:36.479> the

down the iliotibial band and into the
outside<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.170> knee<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.729> have<00:01:39.150> a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
outside of the knee if you have a

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.420 
outside of the knee if you have a
blockage<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.380> function<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.890> your<00:01:40.979> big<00:01:41.159> toe<00:01:41.189> for

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
blockage in function of your big toe for

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.450 
blockage in function of your big toe for
instance<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.540> can't<00:01:42.840> bend<00:01:43.140> forward<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.100> some

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
instance you can't bend forward so some

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.249 
instance you can't bend forward so some
people<00:01:44.670> might<00:01:44.970> hyper<00:01:45.329> extend<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.930> knee<00:01:46.079> or

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
people might hyper extend the knee or

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.310 
people might hyper extend the knee or
bend<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.649> too<00:01:47.189> far<00:01:47.460> backwards<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.869> depends

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
bend it too far backwards so it depends

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.889 
bend it too far backwards so it depends
on<00:01:49.409> how<00:01:50.130> you're<00:01:50.430> put<00:01:50.640> together<00:01:50.790> as<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.720> where

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
on how you're put together as to where

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.619 
on how you're put together as to where
your<00:01:52.079> pain<00:01:52.290> will<00:01:52.470> go
