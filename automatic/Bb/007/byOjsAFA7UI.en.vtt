teammates who are trying to secure the
running<00:01:25.200> lane<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:26.070> trap<00:01:26.689> so<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:28.350> lose<00:01:28.590> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
running lane so I can trap so we lose a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.050 
running lane so I can trap so we lose a
little<00:01:28.920> ground<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:30.240> drop<00:01:30.600> step<00:01:31.040> slightly

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
little ground we drop step slightly

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.039 
little ground we drop step slightly
pointing<00:01:33.060> our<00:01:33.740> play<00:01:34.740> side<00:01:35.130> toe<00:01:35.869> towards<00:01:36.869> the

pointing our play side toe towards the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.980 
pointing our play side toe towards the
target<00:01:37.850> John<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.180> target<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.689> man<00:01:39.840> I'm

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
target John is the target the man I'm

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.880 
target John is the target the man I'm
trapping<00:01:40.700> move<00:01:41.700> up<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.880> little<00:01:42.030> John<00:01:42.320> okay<00:01:43.320> so

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
trapping move up a little John okay so

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.950 
trapping move up a little John okay so
here's<00:01:44.729> what<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.970> bird<00:01:45.149> dog<00:01:45.420> would<00:01:45.600> look<00:01:45.780> like

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
here's what the bird dog would look like

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.249 
here's what the bird dog would look like
trap<00:01:46.649> right<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:48.329> have<00:01:48.450> always<00:01:48.630> found<00:01:49.020> that

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
trap right and I have always found that

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.289 
trap right and I have always found that
the<00:01:49.409> upper<00:01:49.680> body<00:01:49.920> dictates<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.759> lower<00:01:50.939> body

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the upper body dictates the lower body

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.490 
the upper body dictates the lower body
so<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:51.990> throw<00:01:52.500> my<00:01:52.530> elbow<00:01:53.159> aggressively<00:01:54.140> back<00:01:55.140> I

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
so I throw my elbow aggressively back I

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.039 
so I throw my elbow aggressively back I
punch<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.280> back<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:57.149> my<00:01:57.270> hips<00:01:57.570> will<00:01:57.750> open

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
punch it back so my hips will open

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.350 
punch it back so my hips will open
appropriately<00:01:58.770> for<00:01:59.040> me<00:01:59.219> all<00:01:59.850> right<00:01:59.969> ramp

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
appropriately for me all right ramp

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.240 
appropriately for me all right ramp
right<00:02:00.630> bird<00:02:00.899> dogging<00:02:01.290> trap<00:02:01.530> right<00:02:01.770> sad<00:02:02.490> huh

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
right bird dogging trap right sad huh

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.310 
right bird dogging trap right sad huh
let's<00:02:05.060> go<00:02:05.240> lose<00:02:05.540> a<00:02:05.570> little<00:02:05.810> ground<00:02:06.140> with<00:02:06.290> that

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
let's go lose a little ground with that

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.320 
let's go lose a little ground with that
first<00:02:06.710> step<00:02:07.040> turn<00:02:09.880> bird-dogging<00:02:10.880> prep<00:02:11.090> right

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
first step turn bird-dogging prep right

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.540 
first step turn bird-dogging prep right
sad<00:02:12.080> good<00:02:12.710> huh

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
and my second step kicks through and now

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.020 
and my second step kicks through and now
I'm<00:02:16.340> on<00:02:16.460> my<00:02:16.730> good<00:02:16.970> tramp<00:02:17.330> angle<00:02:18.910> okay<00:02:19.910> I'll
