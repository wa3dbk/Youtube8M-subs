00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.700
 how does that work? 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.290
 food industry 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.110
 she will now do that to everyone 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.269
 explain openly and above all finished and 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.639
 because they really mean it has 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.279
 for that extra a club founded 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.410
 We think that's great and because the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.900
 food industry now so honest 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.150
 has jürgen abraham the tv 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.980
 broadcast hard but fair visited the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.170
 younger after this factory a lot 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.029
 Zink and he is the chief boss of 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.130
 whole food industry 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.739
 he knows so well 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.960
 That's why Jürgen explained why now 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.420
 the meat in the supermarket in one 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.059
 plastic bowl packed and why there 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.210
 something of a protective atmosphere on the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.460
 This is why this medium is used 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.100
 it uses oxygen it is nothing 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.489
 harmful to the longer fresh too 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.289
 hold 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.210
 is also out there but remains 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.770
 Quality in itself does not suffer if one 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.260
 the expiration date is taken into account 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.909
 Oxygen is great without oxygen 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.979
 oxygen could not give us 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.590
 Every child knows that and that's why we're happy 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.570
 us about oxygen and fats and 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.580
 egg whites in the meat in the packaging 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.759
 are also happy because they are with the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.409
 oxygen can react well and then 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.960
 the meat gets really fast 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.780
 tough and rancid but the meat becomes 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.030
 because of this bright red and therefore extra 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.460
 fresh out and because of the great road 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.770
 Looks buy that customers because they 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.530
 think to buy extra fresh meat 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.650
 that pleases the food industry however 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.869
 At the place that is not happy at all and also the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.909
 Industry actually knows for the customers 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.880
 is not a good thing that writes 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.060
 even the 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.759
 already sour substance makes meat tough and 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.110
 rancid the younger one sees it all 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.700
 completely different 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.079
 I 'm wondering about that today 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.869
 busy and I got that 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:57.759
 can be submitted and it is clearly so 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.470
 that the quality under this 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.759
 Treatment of oxygen is not long 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.350
 own industry leaflet has me 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.210
 written 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.829
 that is three years old the newest 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.310
 investigation that I read today 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:11.110
 say something else that interests 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.030
 But now we have it for us 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.650
 quickly written to the jury and 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.110
 we asked him which one 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.819
 investigation the thing is unfortunately 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.170
 our message seems to be on the way 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.660
 to have been lost 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.150
 So we wrote one again 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.860
 to be completely sure that we will not 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.390
 repeatedly prescribed at the address 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.810
 we also have this here 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.810
 called 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.950
 we did not reach that 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.739
 may well lie 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.810
 and unfortunately he never answered us 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.150
 And he never gave us an examination 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.519
 shown that claims something other than 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.250
 all previous investigations namely 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.019
 meat becomes tough and rancid when it's in 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.290
 packed in an oxygen atmosphere 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.750
 becomes 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.650
 because you could smooth down the idea 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.109
 come 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.090
 the order lied to the audience 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.069
 that has us a bit in the 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.600
 that's the new one 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.780
 honesty of the food industry 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.519
 or maybe industry worked 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.130
 for too long under one 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.549
 kind of political protective atmosphere like that 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.980
 one 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.019
 your products and ideas always fresh 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.049
 lets look though they ran very nice 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.190
 There are foodwatch cries with 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.620
 the oxygen treatment of 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.750
 fresh meat and draw now 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:29.040
 our e-mail action at www.vox.de 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.040
 action - fresh soft
