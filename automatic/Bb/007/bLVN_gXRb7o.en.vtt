00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
know the really thin bezel on it and
it's<00:01:48.270> almost<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:48.689> watching<00:01:49.939> TV<00:01:50.939> without<00:01:51.149> any

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
it's almost like watching TV without any

it's almost like watching TV without any
bezel<00:01:51.780> absolutely<00:01:52.229> just<00:01:52.409> eight<00:01:52.590> millimeters

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
bezel absolutely just eight millimeters

in terms of the distance between the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.730 
in terms of the distance between the

edge of the picture to the actual edge
of<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.890> cabinet<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.729> almost<00:01:57.180> 100%<00:01:57.659> picture

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
of the cabinet it's almost 100% picture

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.600 
of the cabinet it's almost 100% picture
we're<00:01:58.770> going<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.950> get<00:01:59.040> as<00:01:59.130> close<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.399> we

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
we're going to get as close as we

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.490 
we're going to get as close as we
possibly<00:01:59.640> can<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.450> we're<00:02:00.869> still<00:02:01.079> working<00:02:01.409> on

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
possibly can and we're still working on

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.959 
possibly can and we're still working on
a<00:02:01.530> solution<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.100> make<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.549> hundred<00:02:02.759> percent

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
a solution to make it a hundred percent

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.760 
a solution to make it a hundred percent
picture<00:02:03.509> there's<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.229> lot<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.469> people<00:02:04.680> out

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
picture there's a lot of people out

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.399 
picture there's a lot of people out
there<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.070> do<00:02:05.219> 100%<00:02:05.759> picture<00:02:06.210> no<00:02:06.659> bezel<00:02:07.020> and

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
there that do 100% picture no bezel and

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.340 
there that do 100% picture no bezel and
we're<00:02:07.590> getting<00:02:07.799> very<00:02:07.950> close

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
we're getting very close

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.160 
we're getting very close
and<00:02:08.890> of<00:02:09.070> course<00:02:09.220> this<00:02:09.370> is<00:02:09.640> a<00:02:09.670> world<00:02:10.150> record<00:02:10.360> at

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
and of course this is a world record at

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.610 
and of course this is a world record at
the<00:02:11.260> moment<00:02:11.590> it's<00:02:12.460> the<00:02:12.580> world's<00:02:12.910> slimmest

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
the moment it's the world's slimmest

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.010 
the moment it's the world's slimmest
fulfill<00:02:14.620> led<00:02:14.980> so<00:02:15.430> we're<00:02:16.060> very<00:02:16.090> excited<00:02:16.660> about

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
fulfill led so we're very excited about

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.380 
fulfill led so we're very excited about
this<00:02:17.710> particularly<00:02:17.980> Affinia<00:02:18.460> range<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:19.270> do

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
this particularly Affinia range and do

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.550 
this particularly Affinia range and do
you<00:02:19.480> think<00:02:19.660> it'll<00:02:19.780> still<00:02:20.050> be<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:20.260> world's

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
you think it'll still be the world's

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.020 
you think it'll still be the world's
thinnest<00:02:20.890> by<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.100> end<00:02:21.310> of<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.520> short<00:02:21.730> do<00:02:21.940> you

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
thinnest by the end of the short do you

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.120 
thinnest by the end of the short do you
think<00:02:22.180> someone<00:02:22.450> off<00:02:22.620> I'm<00:02:23.620> sure<00:02:23.800> you'll<00:02:23.950> let<00:02:24.100> us

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
think someone off I'm sure you'll let us

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.530 
think someone off I'm sure you'll let us
know<00:02:24.250> either<00:02:24.520> way<00:02:24.730> I'm<00:02:24.940> sure<00:02:25.300> there'll<00:02:25.510> be

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
know either way I'm sure there'll be

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.790 
know either way I'm sure there'll be
other<00:02:25.750> things<00:02:25.930> coming<00:02:26.290> out<00:02:26.410> there<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:26.710> it's

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
other things coming out there so it's

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.410 
other things coming out there so it's
always<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:27.010> bit<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.280> risky<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:28.270> might

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
always a bit of a risky so you might

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.150 
always a bit of a risky so you might
have<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.600> kill<00:02:29.200> that<00:02:29.230> world's<00:02:29.650> slimmest<00:02:29.830> off

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
have to kill that world's slimmest off

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.530 
have to kill that world's slimmest off
just<00:02:30.400> just<00:02:30.670> in<00:02:30.880> case<00:02:31.000> there's<00:02:31.210> something<00:02:31.330> else

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
just just in case there's something else

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.520 
just just in case there's something else
but<00:02:31.690> we<00:02:31.810> still<00:02:31.990> believe<00:02:32.260> we've<00:02:32.440> got

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
but we still believe we've got

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.190 
but we still believe we've got
confidence<00:02:32.920> in<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:33.160> we<00:02:33.910> think<00:02:34.200> technology

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
confidence in it we think technology

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.260 
confidence in it we think technology
that<00:02:35.320> we've<00:02:35.440> have<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.890> pattern<00:02:36.130> on<00:02:36.340> say<00:02:36.790> we

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
that we've have a pattern on say we

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.430 
that we've have a pattern on say we
don't<00:02:37.480> believe<00:02:37.660> that<00:02:37.720> anybody<00:02:38.020> else<00:02:38.230> will

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
don't believe that anybody else will

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.600 
don't believe that anybody else will
have<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.710> a<00:02:38.890> slimmer<00:02:39.760> full<00:02:40.210> LED<00:02:41.310> TV<00:02:42.310> out<00:02:42.430> there

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
have the a slimmer full LED TV out there

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.910 
have the a slimmer full LED TV out there
so<00:02:42.820> we're<00:02:43.360> confident<00:02:43.690> on<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:43.990> I'm<00:02:44.680> sure<00:02:44.860> you

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
so we're confident on that I'm sure you

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.270 
so we're confident on that I'm sure you
let<00:02:45.130> us<00:02:45.160> know<00:02:45.250> but<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:46.240> is<00:02:46.510> swim<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.860> big<00:02:48.040> thing

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
let us know but it is swim the big thing

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.530 
let us know but it is swim the big thing
in<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.460> moment<00:02:48.760> is<00:02:48.850> that<00:02:49.000> what's<00:02:49.210> going<00:02:49.450> to

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
in the moment is that what's going to

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.780 
in the moment is that what's going to
shell<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.900> TVs<00:02:50.230> for<00:02:50.410> you<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.710> think<00:02:51.160> slim<00:02:51.430> is<00:02:51.580> it

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
shell the TVs for you I think slim is it

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.310 
shell the TVs for you I think slim is it
is<00:02:52.240> just<00:02:52.330> one<00:02:52.630> thing<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:52.960> think<00:02:53.050> people

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
is just one thing and I think people

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.630 
is just one thing and I think people
that<00:02:53.440> want<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.740> actually<00:02:54.040> now<00:02:54.130> wall<00:02:54.340> map<00:02:54.520> the

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
that want to actually now wall map the

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.370 
that want to actually now wall map the
TVs<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.210> depth<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.660> products<00:02:55.990> is<00:02:56.110> really

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
TVs the depth of the products is really

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.600 
TVs the depth of the products is really
important<00:02:56.770> to<00:02:56.830> get<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.100> flush<00:02:57.370> wall

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
important to get that flush wall

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.520 
important to get that flush wall
mounting<00:02:58.000> just<00:02:58.270> close<00:02:58.750> up<00:02:58.780> against<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.380> wall

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
mounting just close up against the wall

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.110 
mounting just close up against the wall
there's<00:03:00.040> slim<00:03:00.250> isn't<00:03:00.490> everything<00:03:00.700> picture

also the one thing about these ultra

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.580 
also the one thing about these ultra

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
compromised with our invisible speaker

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.050 
compromised with our invisible speaker
technology<00:03:14.680> we've<00:03:15.250> actually<00:03:15.400> rapidly

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
technology we've actually rapidly

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.360 
technology we've actually rapidly
improved<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.840> actual<00:03:17.140> audio<00:03:17.440> quality<00:03:17.650> from

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
improved the actual audio quality from

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.490 
improved the actual audio quality from
this<00:03:18.520> particular<00:03:18.760> television<00:03:19.210> however<00:03:20.020> if

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
this particular television however if

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.660 
this particular television however if
you're<00:03:20.620> looking<00:03:20.710> at<00:03:20.950> this<00:03:21.010> type<00:03:21.220> of<00:03:21.340> TV<00:03:21.490> you

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
you're looking at this type of TV you

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.690 
you're looking at this type of TV you
really<00:03:22.030> need<00:03:22.270> a<00:03:22.960> sound<00:03:23.770> system<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.190> go<00:03:24.310> with<00:03:24.520> it

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
really need a sound system to go with it

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.910 
really need a sound system to go with it
so<00:03:25.000> our<00:03:25.150> sound<00:03:25.450> bar<00:03:25.690> proposition<00:03:26.380> with<00:03:26.830> the

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
so our sound bar proposition with the

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.950 
so our sound bar proposition with the
blu-ray<00:03:27.250> built<00:03:27.490> in<00:03:27.640> is<00:03:27.760> one<00:03:28.180> opportunity<00:03:28.810> to

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
blu-ray built in is one opportunity to

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.140 
blu-ray built in is one opportunity to
then<00:03:29.110> put<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:29.380> together<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:30.640> we're<00:03:30.790> trying<00:03:31.030> to

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
then put it together so we're trying to

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.610 
then put it together so we're trying to
you<00:03:31.840> know<00:03:31.870> improve<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.350> sound<00:03:32.500> quality

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
you know improve the sound quality

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.040 
you know improve the sound quality
within<00:03:33.130> our<00:03:33.250> LED<00:03:33.580> products<00:03:33.970> as<00:03:34.090> well<00:03:34.270> I<00:03:34.540> think

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
within our LED products as well I think

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.450 
within our LED products as well I think
we<00:03:35.170> get<00:03:35.320> in<00:03:35.440> there<00:03:35.620> we're<00:03:35.950> getting<00:03:36.160> closer<00:03:36.370> and

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
we get in there we're getting closer and

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.860 
we get in there we're getting closer and
closer<00:03:36.670> to<00:03:36.910> getting<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.180> best<00:03:37.330> picture<00:03:37.690> and

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
closer to getting the best picture and

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.930 
closer to getting the best picture and
the<00:03:38.080> best<00:03:38.260> sound<00:03:38.470> of<00:03:38.590> one<00:03:38.800> but<00:03:39.250> obviously<00:03:39.550> for

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
the best sound of one but obviously for

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.100 
the best sound of one but obviously for
the<00:03:40.030> forum<00:03:40.330> members<00:03:40.630> I<00:03:40.690> think<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:40.930> we<00:03:40.990> all

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
the forum members I think that we all

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.210 
the forum members I think that we all
know<00:03:41.290> that<00:03:41.320> you<00:03:41.590> know<00:03:41.680> you<00:03:41.740> need<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:42.010> have<00:03:42.100> a

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
know that you know you need to have a

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.010 
know that you know you need to have a
separate<00:03:42.820> sound<00:03:43.000> device<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.480> really<00:03:43.750> get<00:03:43.930> the

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
separate sound device to really get the

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.480 
separate sound device to really get the
benefit<00:03:44.350> of<00:03:44.410> these<00:03:44.590> great<00:03:44.830> pictures<00:03:45.190> that<00:03:45.370> the

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
benefit of these great pictures that the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.280 
benefit of these great pictures that the
the<00:03:45.820> full<00:03:46.000> LED<00:03:46.150> slim<00:03:46.540> infinity<00:03:46.930> range<00:03:47.140> will
