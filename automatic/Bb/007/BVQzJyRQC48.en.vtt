00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.929
 Welcome once again to our 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:15.420
 section of express videos of wines to the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.329
 dotcom letter in this special recipes 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.669
 of thermomix that we are going to do and we are going to 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:22.410
 gather all the maximum that we can that 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.060
 have all the recipes as a condition 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.160
 that one of its ingredients is wine 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.529
 in any of its varieties in this 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.570
 case we are going to use white wine already 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.949
 you know I always tell you the same 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.739
 both in the special recipes with 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.150
 thermomix as in the special that 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.160
 we have recipes that we already have 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.809
 very many I always do the same 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.969
 The better comment is the matter 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.850
 premium is the best result with which 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.280
 a good white wine that is medianito 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.840
 that is nice, it's great, what are we going 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.750
 We are going to make some mussels 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.000
 White wine is a very nice recipe 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.010
 to eat the truth is that I can 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.539
 ensure that it is a success at the table and that 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.219
 It is very simple to do the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.629
 ingredients are basic let's do 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.550
 half a kilo of mussels that already 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.619
 we have here washed and cleaned of 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.030
 beards of everything he has in dirty by 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.500
 the shell with which we already have them 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.750
 here prepared 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.110
 let's use half onion two 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.290
 we have garlic cloves 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.450
 and peladitos in 2 cloves of garlic we are going to 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.700
 also use white wine that 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.800
 We will use 2 beakers approximately 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.950
 a little salt and we will use 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.660
 crushed natural tomato nothing else 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.310
 We teach right now how we do to 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.350
 certainly as a suggestion of the pairing 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.880
 a fine to a chamomile because it's a 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.530
 recipe that logically with a wine 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.780
 white and one of the fines and manzanillas 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.300
 so excellent that we have in our 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.729
 country is a dish that will strengthen 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.510
 enormously we teach you how we do it 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.510
 which is very simple 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.920
 perfect because the first thing we do is 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.110
 that we open the thermomix that we are going to 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.630
 do we are going to put the new onion 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.520
 weight goes by size we have said that 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.500
 we used half an onion because this 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.810
 it's just half onion half 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.330
 onion and the two cloves of garlic what 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.040
 let's automatically crush us 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.810
 leaves more crushed we make a tad of 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.880
 noise you know we're going progressive 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.880
 1 3579 come 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.260
 with which speed is more 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.329
 vertiginous with the spatula we go down 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.549
 everything that we have left on the walls and 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.110
 before a failure of the direct as it is usually 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.730
 say I forgot to tell you that 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.950
 we had to be half a cup of 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.629
 olive oil to be able to sautÃ© the 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.609
 onion but logically this is not us 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.040
 is going to get what we're going to 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:44.920
 do now throw half a cup of 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.659
 green olive oil cited already 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.310
 you know that the more green the 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.859
 olive oil better is the result 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.980
 bringing them here with oil 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.150
 I'm generous, it's the same with salt 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.920
 perfect then what are we going to do 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.840
 now I am logically happy this 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.190
 we put the cup upside down so that 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.230
 we do not like it and what we are going to do is 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.060
 schedule 5 minutes 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.340
 with the button on the right you know that 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.920
 we go faster and faster 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.269
 barhom at speed 1 because not anymore 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.920
 we want to be crushed just 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.420
 we want it to move so that it does not 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.549
 paste now we show you how 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.920
 we continue good because it is not gray 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.049
 thermomix warn us that already others or 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.940
 fried the onion and the careful twist 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.250
 with the steam that you already know has 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.290
 we put the cup upside down and now 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.519
 what we are going to add is to see if I am 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.900
 able not to burn with the goblet 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:34.600
 let's add two cubes of me 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.360
 burning white wine 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.210
 one 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.700
 2b the starts to cool that was very 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.610
 very strong temperature and a cube of 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.740
 natural crushed tomato of the brand that 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.420
 you use at home you do not know that I am 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.830
 specialist in private label and also 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.360
 I am completely in favor of them 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.190
 because behind them there are great 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.190
 signatures and a little bit of salt 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.710
 and you know that you do not have to throw in excess 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.230
 because the mussels logically at 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.810
 come from the sea and attract its channel I will 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.610
 put it in the basket but if we were 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.020
 of quantities to a kilo of mussels 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.390
 logically we would have to put the 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.830
 barona because because we would not enter 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.300
 this recipe the truth for the quantity 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.320
 which is perfectly market in the 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.330
 basket and water and then we put him 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.160
 the lid at the moment the goblet fits 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.050
 although it stays there a little bit wrong 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.470
 placed and now you have to program 15 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.470
 minutes 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.360
 hundreds you already know that with the button of the 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.300
 right always to take less let's go 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.819
 to go to temperature bar or ma ya a 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.870
 speed two and a half three is worth between the 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.460
 2 and 3 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.889
 now we show you the final result of 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.629
 this recipe for nothing our thermomix 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.759
 he will not be there, he has warned us that 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:48.620
 was on our plate ready and here 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.270
 he is not ready to put him 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.470
 directly the fork and a piece of 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.470
 bread in that sauce that does not have 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.150
 waste a luxury recipe with a 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.550
 chamomile or a fine that of course goes 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.229
 to enhance this dish enormously nothing 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.210
 more friends a pleasure to have done this 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.400

 we also take it to the table with 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.219
 which more comfortable impossible that we 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.840
