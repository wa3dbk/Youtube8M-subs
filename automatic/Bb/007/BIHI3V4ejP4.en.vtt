00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.809 
in this quick video we're going to
examine<00:00:02.429> how<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:02.970> draw<00:00:03.300> straight<00:00:03.780> lines

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:04.819 
examine how to draw straight lines

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.610 
examine how to draw straight lines
connecting<00:00:05.819> lines<00:00:06.060> using<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:07.639> shift<00:00:08.639> key

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 
connecting lines using the shift key

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.950 
connecting lines using the shift key
will<00:00:10.639> focus<00:00:11.639> particularly<00:00:12.179> on<00:00:12.330> how<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.690> draw

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
will focus particularly on how to draw

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.220 
will focus particularly on how to draw
the<00:00:13.019> triangle<00:00:13.500> for<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:15.210> house<00:00:15.389> project

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
straight line as opposed to that I could

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.229 
straight line as opposed to that I could
touch<00:00:40.710> my<00:00:40.920> mouse<00:00:41.100> down<00:00:41.399> hold<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.910> shift<00:00:42.120> key

the shift key to the very end but I am
going<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.030> let<00:01:06.150> go<00:01:06.330> my<00:01:06.510> mouse<00:01:06.720> key<00:01:07.020> now<00:01:07.340> I'm

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
going to let go my mouse key now I'm

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.679 
going to let go my mouse key now I'm
going<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.549> take<00:01:08.700> my<00:01:08.939> mouse<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.360> where<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> want

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the next straight line touch it down let

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.530 
the next straight line touch it down let
go<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.340> mouse<00:01:14.369> move<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.150> where<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.299> want

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
go of the mouse move it to where I want

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.020 
go of the mouse move it to where I want
the<00:01:15.630> next<00:01:15.869> straight<00:01:16.140> line<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:17.100> end<00:01:17.310> touch<00:01:17.880> it

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the next straight line to end touch it

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.679 
the next straight line to end touch it
down<00:01:18.259> and<00:01:19.259> go<00:01:20.009> over<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.670> where<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.820> want<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
down and go over to where I want the the

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.050 
down and go over to where I want the the
the<00:01:22.350> shape<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.740> end<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.220> touch<00:01:23.369> my<00:01:23.580> mouse<00:01:23.759> down

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the shape to end and touch my mouse down

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.179 
the shape to end and touch my mouse down
then<00:01:24.720> I'll<00:01:24.750> let<00:01:25.020> go<00:01:25.229> my<00:01:25.500> shift<00:01:25.799> key<00:01:25.979> so

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
then I'll let go my shift key so

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.880 
then I'll let go my shift key so
throughout<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.790> whole<00:01:27.200> process<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.560> have<00:01:28.710> my

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
throughout that whole process I have my

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.649 
throughout that whole process I have my
shift<00:01:29.220> key<00:01:29.460> held<00:01:29.729> down<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.090> never<00:01:30.240> let<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.509> go

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
shift key held down and never let it go

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.690 
shift key held down and never let it go
so<00:01:30.930> let's<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.409> again<00:01:31.560> I'll<00:01:32.400> touch<00:01:32.670> my

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
so let's do that again I'll touch my

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.910 
so let's do that again I'll touch my
mouse<00:01:33.030> down<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.750> then<00:01:34.140> hold<00:01:34.350> my<00:01:34.470> shift<00:01:34.530> key

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
mouse down and then hold my shift key

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.929 
mouse down and then hold my shift key
down<00:01:36.470> let<00:01:37.470> go<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.770> my<00:01:37.890> mouse<00:01:38.159> button<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:38.790> not

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
down let go of my mouse button but not

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.560 
down let go of my mouse button but not
my<00:01:39.119> shift<00:01:39.420> key<00:01:39.630> i'll<00:01:39.810> take<00:01:40.909> my<00:01:41.909> mouse<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.450> where

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
my shift key i'll take my mouse to where

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.840 
my shift key i'll take my mouse to where
I<00:01:42.600> want<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> first<00:01:43.170> line<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:44.070> connect<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
I want the first line to connect to the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.920 
I want the first line to connect to the
other<00:01:45.000> dot<00:01:45.240> let<00:01:46.049> go<00:01:46.200> my<00:01:46.439> mouse<00:01:46.649> key<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.930> move

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
other dot let go my mouse key and move

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.810 
other dot let go my mouse key and move
it<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.140> where<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.409> want<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.799> next<00:01:50.040> line<00:01:50.280> to

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
it to where I want the next line to

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.380 
it to where I want the next line to
touch<00:01:51.030> down<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.600> then<00:01:53.240> finally<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.360> last

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
touch down and then finally the last

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.380 
touch down and then finally the last
line<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:54.960> again<00:01:55.380> all<00:01:55.560> through<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.390> have

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
line and again all through that I have

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.209 
line and again all through that I have
my<00:01:57.540> mouse<00:01:57.750> key<00:01:59.000> or<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.060> shift<00:02:00.390> key<00:02:00.540> held<00:02:00.719> down

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
my mouse key or the shift key held down

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.709 
my mouse key or the shift key held down
so<00:02:02.219> maybe<00:02:02.460> we<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.759> do<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.939> again<00:02:03.180> hold<00:02:03.600> my

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
so maybe we can do it again hold my

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.899 
so maybe we can do it again hold my
shift<00:02:03.780> key<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.290> could<00:02:04.409> also<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.189> you

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
shift key you could also do it to you

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.979 
shift key you could also do it to you
know<00:02:06.000> make<00:02:06.210> other<00:02:06.450> shapes<00:02:08.239> so<00:02:09.239> it's<00:02:09.539> Mouse

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
know make other shapes so it's Mouse

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.240 
know make other shapes so it's Mouse
touches<00:02:10.500> down<00:02:10.679> hold<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.129> shift<00:02:11.340> key

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
touches down hold the shift key

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.250 
touches down hold the shift key
touchdown<00:02:14.250> let<00:02:14.849> go<00:02:15.060> touchdown<00:02:15.780> like<00:02:16.230> a

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
touchdown let go touchdown like a

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.320 
touchdown let go touchdown like a
touchdown<00:02:17.129> when<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.370> say<00:02:17.549> let<00:02:17.760> go<00:02:17.909> on<00:02:18.060> letting

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
touchdown when I say let go on letting

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330 
touchdown when I say let go on letting
go<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.450> mouse<00:02:18.750> button<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.500> shift<00:02:19.830> key<00:02:20.010> never
