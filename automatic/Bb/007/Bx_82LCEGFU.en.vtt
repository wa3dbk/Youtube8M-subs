00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hi, everyone, I'm May Kobe 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.549
 we are in minecraft reviewing a mod 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.210
 that we are using the series of worlds 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.370
 creel 2 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.200
 it's about tale of king down and good 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.509
 as you see with generates a castle 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.860
 pretty cool and quirky that you can 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.420
 choose yourselves more or less the site 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.880
 where do you think spawn and even though 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.680
 generate better said is squeezing them and if 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.570
 I'm not wrong and more or less appears by 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.640
 inside chooses I do not say more or less because 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.990
 sometimes it hits you and you choose what you think 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.240
 that you are going to appear over there is displayed 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.859
 from behind but good more or less than 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.289
 the subject of this is quite good 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.380
 well as you can see there is a good theory of 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.930
 1 pc is with which we can interact 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.030
 there is a kind of farmer baker there 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.469
 a blacksmith who can buy it and 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.750
 sell him little things which is pretty 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.239
 well there we have where they hang the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.850
 poor people who behave badly is not what 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.410
 it seems and here we have an uncle 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.440
 which is kind of like a bank or 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.090
 banker call it whatever you want which one 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.730
 You can save the money you gain 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.980
 you since with this mod as you go 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.359
 advancing bugs that are minecraft 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.829
 original because they are giving you some 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.450
 coins with which you can then 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.400
 buy this man 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.350
 to the baker while at the bank do 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.370
 a series of things other than that too 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.290
 We have an uncle here who is here 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.480
 hello what kind sir good as is a little 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.280
 slow because they are people who take the 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.600
 life with pause and if you know how 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.420
 We were here in Havana, I know 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.210
 all very soft the good Czech we remove 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.130
 this hunger that is a kind of 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.450
 architect control builder that with 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.960
 this man then he can follow 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.090
 creating your kingdom so to speak, not that 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.830
 it will be once you complete a kind 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.830
 of mission does not cost hand as you want 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.119
 that we have hello how about people like 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.979
 you see here everyone taking 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.560
 beers quietly and with the 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.619
 florecillas is here I saw the staircase 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.940
 good as you see this is the kind of 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:53.000
 Masters or what would be the 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.320
 the king of the castle call us the king or 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.600
 we simply have to be the teacher 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.400
 of all these people and with this you can 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.130
 do a kind of mission as you put 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.050
 the way to king shift to reign something 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.030
 well and good you can sign a contract 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.200
 which is a kind of mission 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.330
 you can hire 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.470
 what are assassins to help you 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.400
 to kill sayings out there and good the truth 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.310
 which is very good and once 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.810
 you complete all that mission you can do 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.300
 your own empire with the name that 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.160
 we have seen here below and which is 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.950
 a lot, not since you can do a 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.080
 kind of castle go putting 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.380
 implementing little things and the truth that 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.489
 is very good so nothing this mod is 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.620
 one of what we are using the series 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.209
 hostile world 2 and good is not that you add 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.160
 too many things apart from this castle 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.019
 there is no kind of enemies 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.019
 I'm not very clear in the past 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.140
 always right now in 1.6 I'm not 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.000
 I sure do not think 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.710
 and nothing simply this we hope has 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.180
 liked anything let me 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.990

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.770
 theme of the skins and sometimes I go in and I'm 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.360
 the one of always and again the center I am 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.550

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.550
