motor 1m1 contact and motor to which for

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.200 
motor 1m1 contact and motor to which for
boaters<00:00:13.200> i've<00:00:13.559> used<00:00:13.799> light<00:00:14.070> bulbs<00:00:14.519> here<00:00:14.820> so

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
boaters i've used light bulbs here so

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.820 
boaters i've used light bulbs here so
this<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.480> going<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.660> be<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.990> contact<00:00:16.199> number

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
this is going to be the contact number

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.980 
this is going to be the contact number
one<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.220> control<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:17.760> one<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.690> will<00:00:18.869> be

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
one to control this one this will be

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.960 
one to control this one this will be
contact<00:00:19.560> number<00:00:19.920> two<00:00:20.130> which<00:00:20.400> will<00:00:20.550> control

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
contact number two which will control

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.730 
contact number two which will control
this<00:00:21.210> one<00:00:21.480> I'm<00:00:21.900> going<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.050> do<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.350> kind<00:00:22.560> of

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
this one I'm going to do this kind of

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.980 
this one I'm going to do this kind of
fast<00:00:23.070> because<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.580> time<00:00:23.939> allotted<00:00:24.300> I've

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
fast because the time allotted I've

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.740 
fast because the time allotted I've
already<00:00:25.230> pre<00:00:25.740> wired<00:00:26.000> 120<00:00:27.000> volts<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.599> it

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
already pre wired 120 volts to it

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.200 
already pre wired 120 volts to it
because<00:00:28.140> they<00:00:28.289> do<00:00:28.349> require<00:00:28.650> 120<00:00:29.550> volts<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:30.060> and

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
because they do require 120 volts in and

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.749 
because they do require 120 volts in and
out<00:00:30.330> these<00:00:30.720> are<00:00:30.840> 120<00:00:31.439> volt<00:00:31.619> light<00:00:31.830> bulbs<00:00:32.279> but

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
out these are 120 volt light bulbs but

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.670 
out these are 120 volt light bulbs but
the<00:00:32.850> actual<00:00:33.210> system<00:00:33.780> itself<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.350> going<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.559> be

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
the actual system itself is going to be

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.910 
the actual system itself is going to be
controlled<00:00:35.489> by<00:00:35.760> control<00:00:36.630> wires<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.620> had<00:00:37.800> to

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
controlled by control wires so I had to

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.160 
controlled by control wires so I had to
keep<00:00:38.070> them<00:00:38.340> separate<00:00:38.940> I've<00:00:39.450> got<00:00:39.629> two<00:00:39.840> feeds

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
keep them separate I've got two feeds

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.440 
keep them separate I've got two feeds
here<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.620> 120<00:00:41.160> volts<00:00:41.700> coming<00:00:42.000> into<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.270> top

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
here this 120 volts coming into the top

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.930 
here this 120 volts coming into the top
and<00:00:42.719> one<00:00:43.050> out<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.890> one<00:00:44.070> light<00:00:44.280> bulb<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.789> then

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
and one out to one light bulb and then

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.139 
and one out to one light bulb and then
another<00:00:45.180> 120<00:00:45.899> volts<00:00:46.230> into<00:00:46.379> em<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:47.149> contact

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
another 120 volts into em to contact

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.420 
another 120 volts into em to contact
feeding<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.930> second<00:00:49.350> light<00:00:49.530> bulb<00:00:49.800> now<00:00:50.250> i'm

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
feeding the second light bulb now i'm

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.799 
feeding the second light bulb now i'm
going<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.670> interlock<00:00:51.090> with<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.420> control

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
going to interlock with the control

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.500 
going to interlock with the control
system<00:00:52.379> when<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.160> use<00:00:53.280> red<00:00:53.550> wires<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.149> keep<00:00:54.329> it

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
system when you use red wires to keep it

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.099 
system when you use red wires to keep it
separate<00:00:55.309> what<00:00:56.309> we're<00:00:56.430> going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.640> do<00:00:56.789> here

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
separate what we're going to do here

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.209 
separate what we're going to do here
we're<00:00:58.109> gonna<00:00:58.230> start<00:00:58.500> actually<00:00:58.710> with<00:00:59.039> our

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
we're gonna start actually with our

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.700 
we're gonna start actually with our
white<00:00:59.460> wires<00:00:59.820> because<00:01:00.660> according<00:01:01.410> we're

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
white wires because according we're

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.110 
white wires because according we're
going<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.890> do<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.160> paper<00:01:02.430> right<00:01:02.820> here<00:01:02.850> i

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
going to do this paper right here i

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.250 
going to do this paper right here i
don't<00:01:03.180> know<00:01:03.359> if<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:03.629> see<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> video

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
don't know if you can see in the video

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.649 
don't know if you can see in the video
that<00:01:04.739> actually<00:01:05.100> requires<00:01:05.220> three<00:01:05.880> neutrals<00:01:06.479> in

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
that actually requires three neutrals in

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.840 
that actually requires three neutrals in
a<00:01:07.140> system<00:01:07.619> like<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.830> it's<00:01:08.280> best<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.670> go<00:01:08.700> ahead

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
a system like this it's best to go ahead

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.870 
a system like this it's best to go ahead
and<00:01:09.150> put<00:01:09.299> your<00:01:09.330> neutrals<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.049> first<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:11.430> we

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
and put your neutrals in first so we

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.330 
and put your neutrals in first so we
have<00:01:12.030> one<00:01:12.330> neutral<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.110> saying<00:01:13.380> goes<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.890> m1

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
have one neutral it's saying goes to m1

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.050 
have one neutral it's saying goes to m1
which<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:15.330> 96<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.439> your<00:01:16.590> contactor<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.640> it

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
which is 96 on your contactor and it

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.450 
which is 96 on your contactor and it
says<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.450> got<00:01:18.600> another<00:01:18.960> neutral<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
says we got another neutral going to a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.910 
says we got another neutral going to a
pilot<00:01:21.150> light<00:01:21.360> over<00:01:21.689> here<00:01:21.720> which<00:01:22.409> i<00:01:22.530> think<00:01:22.799> you

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
pilot light over here which i think you

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.010 
pilot light over here which i think you
can<00:01:23.189> see<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.549> your<00:01:23.580> picture<00:01:24.150> we're<00:01:24.840> going<00:01:24.930> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
can see in your picture we're going to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.200 
can see in your picture we're going to
go<00:01:25.140> ahead<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.409> put<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.590> right<00:01:25.950> there<00:01:26.210> and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
go ahead and put that right there and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.210 
go ahead and put that right there and
then<00:01:27.360> my<00:01:27.659> back<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.170> take<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.530> off<00:01:28.740> here<00:01:29.009> put

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
then my back and take this off here put

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.859 
then my back and take this off here put
a<00:01:29.250> dance<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.700> little<00:01:29.820> shorter<00:01:30.329> it's<00:01:30.509> all<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
a dance a little shorter it's all on the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.899 
a dance a little shorter it's all on the
same<00:01:31.049> circuit<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.070> do<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.400> will

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
same circuit so you can do that will

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.520 
same circuit so you can do that will
come<00:01:33.060> off<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.900> says<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.259> need<00:01:34.290> to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
come off of this and it says we need to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.929 
come off of this and it says we need to
have<00:01:34.680> one<00:01:34.920> coming<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.610> contact<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:37.229> now

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
have one coming to this contact so now

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.429 
have one coming to this contact so now
I'm<00:01:38.939> going<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.180> start<00:01:39.420> with<00:01:39.509> my<00:01:39.659> control<00:01:40.140> wires

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
I'm going to start with my control wires

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.350 
I'm going to start with my control wires
it's<00:01:41.130> saying<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.090> have<00:01:42.240> an

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
it's saying that I have to have an

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.840 
it's saying that I have to have an
emergency<00:01:42.450> stop<00:01:43.049> with<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.130> start<00:01:44.490> stops

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
emergency stop with with to start stops

we're going to go to number three's

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.590 
we're going to go to number three's
start<00:03:07.790> so<00:03:08.390> this<00:03:08.660> will<00:03:08.810> be<00:03:08.989> right<00:03:09.590> here<00:03:09.950> okay

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
and then from number three start you

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.860 
and then from number three start you
also<00:03:14.299> want<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.810> feed<00:03:15.019> this<00:03:15.260> pilot<00:03:15.890> light<00:03:16.870> okay

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
also want to feed this pilot light okay

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.500 
also want to feed this pilot light okay
and<00:03:18.110> then<00:03:18.470> from<00:03:18.709> that<00:03:18.769> pilot<00:03:19.549> light<00:03:19.760> now<00:03:20.030> it's

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
and then from that pilot light now it's

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.050 
and then from that pilot light now it's
telling<00:03:20.750> us<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.170> jump<00:03:21.530> down<00:03:21.769> from<00:03:22.160> here<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:23.000> go

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
telling us to jump down from here and go

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.600 
telling us to jump down from here and go
over<00:03:23.959> and<00:03:24.170> now<00:03:24.320> we're<00:03:24.560> starting<00:03:24.980> our<00:03:25.070> second

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
over and now we're starting our second

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.509 
over and now we're starting our second
m1<00:03:26.060> our<00:03:26.329> second<00:03:26.840> contact<00:03:27.410> so<00:03:28.070> we'll<00:03:28.250> put<00:03:28.489> that

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
m1 our second contact so we'll put that

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.350 
m1 our second contact so we'll put that
on<00:03:28.730> one<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:29.540> we'll<00:03:29.989> repeat<00:03:30.440> that<00:03:30.680> process<00:03:31.360> so

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
on one and we'll repeat that process so

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.360 
on one and we'll repeat that process so
stick<00:03:32.989> with<00:03:33.019> yellow<00:03:33.440> here<00:03:33.799> because<00:03:33.980> it's<00:03:34.130> easy

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
stick with yellow here because it's easy

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.470 
stick with yellow here because it's easy
to<00:03:34.549> see<00:03:34.850> so<00:03:35.720> we're<00:03:35.870> going<00:03:35.959> to<00:03:36.049> go<00:03:36.079> from<00:03:36.470> one<00:03:37.480> and

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
it what it does from one is it comes out

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.030 
it what it does from one is it comes out
on<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.489> other<00:03:40.640> one<00:03:41.209> right<00:03:42.110> here<00:03:42.380> it<00:03:42.620> goes<00:03:42.829> in

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
on the other one right here it goes in

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.190 
on the other one right here it goes in
one<00:03:43.220> side<00:03:43.489> one<00:03:43.850> press<00:03:44.239> Start<00:03:44.390> comes<00:03:44.870> out<00:03:45.019> the

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
one side one press Start comes out the

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.729 
one side one press Start comes out the
other<00:03:45.230> side<00:03:45.470> now<00:03:46.370> we<00:03:46.430> need<00:03:46.519> to<00:03:46.700> feed<00:03:47.000> too<00:03:47.329> hot

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
other side now we need to feed too hot

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.069 
other side now we need to feed too hot
so<00:03:48.739> we'll<00:03:48.920> do<00:03:49.040> is<00:03:49.160> we'll<00:03:49.280> put<00:03:49.519> that<00:03:49.549> there

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
so we'll do is we'll put that there

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
we're going to complete the same process

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.290 
we're going to complete the same process
we're<00:03:52.820> going<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.000> go<00:03:53.090> from<00:03:53.239> two

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
we're going to go from two

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.160 
we're going to go from two
to<00:03:55.600> m2's<00:03:56.320> to<00:03:56.740> now<00:03:57.040> which<00:03:57.640> is<00:03:57.850> right<00:03:58.030> here<00:03:58.170> too

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
to m2's to now which is right here too

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.410 
to m2's to now which is right here too
is<00:03:59.380> a<00:03:59.410> constant<00:04:00.040> feed<00:04:00.340> whereas<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.910> three<00:04:01.270> is

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
is a constant feed whereas the three is

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.540 
is a constant feed whereas the three is
just<00:04:01.630> a<00:04:01.720> trigger<00:04:02.050> that<00:04:02.170> pulls<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.710> contact<00:04:03.250> in

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
just a trigger that pulls the contact in

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.820 
just a trigger that pulls the contact in
okay<00:04:04.330> then<00:04:04.600> it<00:04:04.720> says<00:04:04.930> from<00:04:05.110> there<00:04:05.350> we<00:04:05.500> go<00:04:05.620> from

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
okay then it says from there we go from

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:12.090 
okay then it says from there we go from
three<00:04:06.250> of<00:04:06.580> this<00:04:06.820> switch<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:09.480> 32<00:04:10.480> this<00:04:10.920> now<00:04:11.920> that

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
three of this switch to 32 this now that

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.280 
three of this switch to 32 this now that
way<00:04:12.280> there<00:04:12.520> is<00:04:12.640> a<00:04:12.670> completed<00:04:13.300> control<00:04:13.750> circuit

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
way there is a completed control circuit

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.430 
way there is a completed control circuit
and<00:04:14.710> now<00:04:14.860> when<00:04:15.040> I<00:04:15.070> turn<00:04:15.190> this<00:04:15.640> on<00:04:16.230> pull<00:04:17.230> this

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
and now when I turn this on pull this

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.970 
and now when I turn this on pull this
out<00:04:17.739> push<00:04:18.700> this<00:04:18.940> button<00:04:19.239> it<00:04:19.900> should<00:04:20.590> come<00:04:20.799> on

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
out push this button it should come on

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.660 
out push this button it should come on
like<00:04:21.220> so<00:04:21.549> motor<00:04:22.150> to<00:04:22.480> when<00:04:22.720> I<00:04:22.810> go<00:04:23.050> on<00:04:23.550> it'll<00:04:24.550> come

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
like so motor to when I go on it'll come

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.660 
like so motor to when I go on it'll come
on<00:04:24.910> but<00:04:25.300> when<00:04:25.450> I<00:04:25.480> turn<00:04:25.750> that<00:04:25.990> off<00:04:26.260> it<00:04:27.160> all<00:04:27.310> shuts

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
on but when I turn that off it all shuts

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.670 
on but when I turn that off it all shuts
off<00:04:27.880> see<00:04:28.150> one<00:04:28.660> or<00:04:28.780> two<00:04:28.960> ain't<00:04:29.230> supposed<00:04:29.530> to

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
off see one or two ain't supposed to

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.030 
off see one or two ain't supposed to
work<00:04:29.830> and<00:04:30.400> less<00:04:30.580> motor<00:04:30.880> run<00:04:31.240> is<00:04:31.840> run<00:04:32.230> to<00:04:32.800> turn

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
work and less motor run is run to turn

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.830 
work and less motor run is run to turn
it<00:04:33.190> all<00:04:33.310> off<00:04:33.340> we<00:04:34.090> hit<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.300> emergency<00:04:34.360> stop

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
it all off we hit the emergency stop

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.010 
it all off we hit the emergency stop
there's<00:04:35.740> how<00:04:35.890> you<00:04:35.950> wire<00:04:36.370> a<00:04:36.730> to<00:04:37.270> motor<00:04:37.540> starts

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
there's how you wire a to motor starts

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.140 
there's how you wire a to motor starts
top<00:04:38.290> motor<00:04:38.620> to<00:04:38.860> will<00:04:39.100> not<00:04:39.250> run<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.760> less<00:04:39.880> motor

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
top motor to will not run and less motor

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.470 
top motor to will not run and less motor
one<00:04:40.420> is<00:04:40.570> running<00:04:40.930> thank<00:04:41.290> you
