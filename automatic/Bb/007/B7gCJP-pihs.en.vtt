00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.060
 before beginning to dress first 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.090
 the first thing that is done is to put the altar 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.520
 and adapt is made up of all the 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.250
 images that give us that style not 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.020
 put things in bed also it 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.309
 style that there are no women in the room 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.309
 where one is dressing 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.140
 then this name fajilla 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.900
 and 2 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.340
 scissors 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.710
 the needle 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:00.090
 I have soreness I have everything because 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.110
 you are wearing 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.110
 I know there is a button 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.250
 Now I started to dress with insurance 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.040
 leotard that is this white part is the 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.190
 meshes that go down then follow the 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.770
 stockings these pink socks are put 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.220
 the stockings with a garter that holds them 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.290
 so that they do not fall after that already 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.260
 comes in to assemble the satchel that is 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.990
 put on the satchel and upload it 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.689
 be well adjusted 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.159
 After that, you have to tie up 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.469
 males that 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.890
 when it is the most emblematic at the time 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:48.210
 to dress and take the males is 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:51.450
 symbol that the celebration is already under way and 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.240
 also successful after that already we 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.789
 We put the shoes on the slippers 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.119
 that I knew are always black with a 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.119
 monkey 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.860
 put on the shirt adjust 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:16.160
 later it is to put on the bowtie and 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.280
 bow ties so a tie a little more 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.190
 thin and make a normal knot already 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.930
 after that what we do is 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.030
 to put on the fajilla a fajilla is a 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.400
 ornament that goes a little bit above the 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.650
 waist after that and what we have 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.720
 is to put on the vest vest this one 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.140
 we put it and later already 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.270
 expose the jacket or the jacket 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.459
 because the symbol of putting on the jacket is 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.940
 who puts it to you is that he wishes you luck 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.940
 this afternoon 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.510
 practically all the tournaments we 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.510
 we personally meet before 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.160
 and we put it on as I said beginning 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.970
 always on the right side in this case 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.130
 the right arm 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:13.550
 after that, what we did was 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.790
 put the added the added in this 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.980
 case can go to the end of the dress or to the 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.970
 beginning to dress for now because 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.140

 as the symbol of the powers is this 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.330
 symbol that you are a bullfighter 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:42.890
 since we wear it, it makes us 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.460
 feel proud to feel apart 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.850
 Motivated above all excited 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.290

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.250
