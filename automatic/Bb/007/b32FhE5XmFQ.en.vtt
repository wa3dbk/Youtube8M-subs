00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
you can get a screwdriver in go far over

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.440 
you can get a screwdriver in go far over
to<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.800> drivers<00:03:16.370> as<00:03:16.760> far<00:03:17.030> over<00:03:17.239> to<00:03:17.269> the

driver's side as you can go and then

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.880 
driver's side as you can go and then
once<00:03:20.390> you<00:03:20.540> go<00:03:20.750> you're<00:03:21.230> looking<00:03:21.620> for<00:03:21.769> that

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
once you go you're looking for that

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.400 
once you go you're looking for that
little<00:03:22.040> hook<00:03:22.329> so<00:03:23.329> far<00:03:23.690> over<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:23.870> the<00:03:24.079> driver's

so if anything is remotely wrong it

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.170 
so if anything is remotely wrong it
should<00:03:38.840> work<00:03:39.100> and<00:03:40.100> sorry<00:03:40.579> for<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.850> shaky
