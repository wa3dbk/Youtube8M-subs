00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
wait 20 years and have to have to go

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.659 
wait 20 years and have to have to go
through<00:00:31.349> what<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.529> went<00:00:31.619> through<00:00:31.859> but<00:00:32.219> it's<00:00:32.369> one

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
through what I went through but it's one

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.310 
through what I went through but it's one
of<00:00:32.790> those<00:00:32.850> things<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.239> think<00:00:33.300> we're<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:33.870> like

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
of those things I think we're just like

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.920 
of those things I think we're just like
a<00:00:34.350> doctor's<00:00:34.800> visit<00:00:34.829> people<00:00:35.520> put<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.760> aside

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
a doctor's visit people put it aside

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.260 
a doctor's visit people put it aside
becomes<00:00:36.930> not<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.200> important<00:00:37.879> you<00:00:38.879> don't<00:00:39.000> think

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
becomes not so important you don't think

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.610 
becomes not so important you don't think
so<00:00:39.450> in<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.690> grand<00:00:39.899> scheme<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.260> things<00:00:40.469> but

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
so in the grand scheme of things but

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.500 
so in the grand scheme of things but
ultimately<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.579> helped<00:00:41.730> me<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.000> good<00:00:42.360> for

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
ultimately it's helped me the good for

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.819 
ultimately it's helped me the good for
realization<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.320> only<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.680> your

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
realization that you only have your

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.950 
realization that you only have your
health<00:00:44.180> once<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.480> lifetime

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
health once in this lifetime

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.389 
health once in this lifetime
then<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.320> better<00:00:46.440> take<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.800> best<00:00:46.950> use<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.250> it

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
then you better take the best use of it

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.639 
then you better take the best use of it
that<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.789> before<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:48.809> did<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> treatment

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
that you can before we did the treatment

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.240 
being in pain but I I think you have a
tendency<00:03:12.630> when<00:03:12.959> you're<00:03:13.080> in<00:03:13.200> pain<00:03:13.380> just<00:03:14.099> sort

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
tendency when you're in pain just sort

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.849 
tendency when you're in pain just sort
of<00:03:14.370> try<00:03:14.549> and<00:03:14.989> compartmentalize<00:03:15.989> it<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.350> not

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
of try and compartmentalize it and not

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.340 
of try and compartmentalize it and not
really<00:03:17.190> focus<00:03:17.730> in<00:03:17.850> on<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.150> but<00:03:18.299> it's<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:19.170> could

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
really focus in on it but it's you could
