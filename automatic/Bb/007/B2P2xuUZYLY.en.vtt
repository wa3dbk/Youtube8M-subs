00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.309
 merry christmas 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.719
 putting prosperity in its recent 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.630
 conversation with the user we twist 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.970
 touched the topic in the comments Kiev knife 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.640
 home-made work usually work and 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.529
 all things that you have all things 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.539
 sold and speak openly certain 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.330
 values and so valuable with money not 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.510
 express and today I offer your 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.640
 attention to a similar thing which 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.940
 belongs to my whom that is 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.879
 happy owner and who i'm at 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.420
 this plan envy white envy so 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.610
 today we have a short sword on the review 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:50.149
 french short sword parish style 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.390
 Sample 1831 1870s 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.670
 short tactical and technical 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.649
 characteristics blade length 48 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.510
 centimeters 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:04.739
 made of steel handle made of 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:08.310
 bronze planted casting screen weight to without 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:12.510
 sheath one kilogram one kilogram 100 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.490
 gram somewhere so our similar blades 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.750
 were in service with the French troops 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.820
 even before 1831 but then they were 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.110
 left on violations 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.259
 up until 1870 similar clinic 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.390
 were also in service 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.229
 this is a separate soldier weapon and stood 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.840
 in service 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.079
 Not only the French army but also as 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.780
 army of the russian army of british and even 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.270
 confederation away confederates 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.979
 think of a goal to moderate nevertheless 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.649
 clinics have 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.009
 all these armies have some differences 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.720
 which we now stop 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.090
 It means why I decided that all the same 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.110
 we have a blade of French origin 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.850
 We note that England actively traded 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.579
 weapons in those days and delivered 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.380
 similar weapons like this in different 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:10.770
 countries of the world means stop 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.480
 the first thing we see and on the garda see 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.909
 marking 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:19.220
 the year 1869 and the stamp 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:22.940
 Carrillo in my opinion represents of 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.260
 self laurels and chests like exploding 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.090
 bombs that is 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.360
 stylized of course that is it says 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.989
 about the fact that he was armed with some 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.879
 Grenadiers or artillery further we 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:42.140
 we have the form of the letter spelled f 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:43.879
 latin and now we stop why 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.920
 all the same, I decided that this sword 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:51.019
 French means British swords have 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.799
 the exact same handle is absolutely 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.450
 the mushroom handle is a prominent pommel 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.750
 cross proud 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.660
 had 1 third party for. were neither 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:06.890
 double edged and real 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:11.810
 somewhere in 1855 that is the design 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.310
 the blade was made like a son down 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.200
 almost from the butt 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.989
 one-sided for. here we see 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.609
 typical gladius that gladius 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:25.730
 who loved the roman army why this 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:28.310
 the blade is not American means in 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.780
 American novelties notch on the handle 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:37.160
 here we see concentric rings 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:40.849
 Such are the American plan as a notch 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.680
 were prepared in the form of a bowl times not 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:46.040
 blade design was slightly different 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.730
 so that went double house somewhere up to one 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.590
 thirds of 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.690
 Barbie went further alone he was so 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.980
 way we come to that as we 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.840
 see again these shoes and 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:03.220
 labeling there and what just this one 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:05.299
 French blade but interesting moment 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.849
 delving into the study of this blade 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.500
 we also see here for him the form of baku 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:15.319
 mi-8 but here we see the typical 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.980
 Russian letter without a dot so you can 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.959
 say what 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.829
 Lenok that was French production 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.600
 but was still in service 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:27.710
 Russian army and most likely this and 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:31.570
 due to the fact that these blades like 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.460
 sort of a short sword of them here of this era 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.280
 are frequent for finding in Polissya 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.169
 the region of Ukraine is also talking 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.540
 one with one person he confirmed then 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.070
 that he, too , once found similar 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.380
 short swordsmen very bad 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.070
 preserved 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:52.039
 a hilt and he also meant 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.340
 identified to museum staff as 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:59.139
 short ball 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:03.100
 French parish artillery and here 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:08.030
 that's all what I wanted 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:11.330
 boast blade noble surprised 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.789
 of course saying how it survived to 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.910
 of our times all the same 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:19.310
 150 almost years have passed was found by chance 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:22.550
 2 the barn was hidden under the roof 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.830
 built somewhere in 1905 that is how 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:29.380
 he got 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:32.150
 30 before where and how remains a mystery 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.970
 maybe the guys who have something else 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.860
 some information 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.080
 As for this clinic, it can 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:43.039
 somehow clarify all the same to some 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.700
 unit subject to this blade here in 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.130
 this period 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:50.930
 and so that it can be like this 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:54.289
 restore once again as they say glad 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:56.930
 for Kumar anyway its never 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:02.900
 will give even a birthday even 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:04.570
 new year so here it is our story in 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.470
 metal 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.470
 thank you very much everyone bye
