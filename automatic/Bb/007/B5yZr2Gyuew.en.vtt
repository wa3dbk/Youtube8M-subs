loss of reflection what are the loss of
a<00:00:09.870> fraction<00:00:10.410> first<00:00:11.220> you<00:00:11.490> have<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:20.900> so<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.579> light

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:23.579 
a fraction first you have to so a light

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.960 
a fraction first you have to so a light
ray<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:24.029> incident<00:00:24.360> on<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.470> black<00:00:26.099> gets

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
ray is incident on this black gets

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.970 
ray is incident on this black gets
deflected<00:00:27.560> so<00:00:28.560> let<00:00:29.310> us<00:00:29.340> discuss<00:00:29.880> about<00:00:30.329> the

deflected so let us discuss about the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.009 
deflected so let us discuss about the
refraction<00:00:32.780> instead<00:00:33.890> normal<00:00:34.890> what<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.190> normal

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
refraction instead normal what is normal

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:46.330 
refraction instead normal what is normal
this<00:00:37.019> is<00:00:37.289> normal<00:00:37.949> normal<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:42.260> this<00:00:43.260> point

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.120 

in<00:00:46.580> light<00:00:47.180> ray<00:00:47.600> incident<00:00:48.500> on<00:00:49.280> this<00:00:50.890> this<00:00:51.890> is<00:00:52.100> a

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.130 
in light ray incident on this this is a

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.640 
in light ray incident on this this is a
light<00:00:52.550> ray<00:00:52.910> incident<00:00:53.780> arm<00:00:54.530> on<00:00:55.100> this<00:00:55.970> Piazza

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
light ray incident arm on this Piazza

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:10.080 
light ray incident arm on this Piazza
this<00:00:57.650> is

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.910 

Lightwave<00:01:11.090> instead<00:01:11.780> on<00:01:12.020> this<00:01:13.270> surface<00:01:14.920> then

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
Lightwave instead on this surface then

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:29.410 
Lightwave instead on this surface then
it<00:01:16.280> gets<00:01:17.270> refracted<00:01:27.100> so<00:01:28.100> what<00:01:28.550> is<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:29.000> angle

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
it gets refracted so what is the angle

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.830 
it gets refracted so what is the angle
of<00:01:29.540> incidence<00:01:29.869> here<00:01:31.150> sees<00:01:33.640> incidence<00:01:34.840> and

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
of incidence here sees incidence and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.650 
of incidence here sees incidence and
this<00:01:36.229> is<00:01:36.440> angle<00:01:37.280> of<00:01:37.399> refraction<00:01:39.130> so<00:01:40.420> if<00:01:41.420> we

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
this is angle of refraction so if we

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.910 
this is angle of refraction so if we
knew<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:42.170> tightest<00:01:42.800> with<00:01:43.460> this<00:01:44.360> this

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
knew the tightest with this this

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.440 
knew the tightest with this this
component<00:01:47.560> is<00:01:48.560> normal

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.090 

particular<00:01:52.450> line<00:01:52.660> is<00:01:52.810> for<00:01:53.080> normal<00:01:53.620> this<00:01:53.920> is

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
particular line is for normal this is

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.970 
particular line is for normal this is
incident<00:01:54.820> today

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
incident today

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.890 
incident today
this<00:01:57.980> is<00:01:58.480> refracted<00:01:59.480> ray<00:01:59.750> what<00:02:00.290> is<00:02:00.440> this

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
this is refracted ray what is this

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.870 
this is refracted ray what is this
refracted<00:02:02.900> ray<00:02:04.600> next<00:02:05.600> this<00:02:05.990> is<00:02:06.490> point<00:02:07.490> of

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
refracted ray next this is point of

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.190 
refracted ray next this is point of
incidence

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
incidence

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.030 
incidence
this<00:02:10.190> is<00:02:10.430> point<00:02:11.090> of<00:02:11.450> incidence

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
this is point of incidence

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.089 
this is point of incidence
so<00:02:14.879> what<00:02:15.360> is<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.689> first<00:02:15.870> law<00:02:16.349> of<00:02:16.379> refraction

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
so what is the first law of refraction

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.339 
so what is the first law of refraction
it<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:18.920> what<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.220> first<00:02:20.459> one<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:22.200> this

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
it is what is the first one so in this

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.660 
it is what is the first one so in this
diffraction<00:02:22.939> the<00:02:23.939> instant<00:02:24.599> ray<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.670> the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
diffraction the instant ray and the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.240 
diffraction the instant ray and the
refracted<00:02:27.480> ray<00:02:27.629> and<00:02:29.030> normal<00:02:30.030> all<00:02:30.739> lie<00:02:31.739> in<00:02:32.040> the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250

refracted ray and normal all lie in the
same<00:02:32.549> plane

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
same plane

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.780 
same plane
what<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.440> first

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.540 

incidentally

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.790 

respectively

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.240 

normally<00:02:45.120> these<00:02:46.120> three<00:02:46.630> are<00:02:46.990> laying<00:02:47.800> in<00:02:48.069> the

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
normally these three are laying in the

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.960 
normally these three are laying in the
same<00:02:48.610> plane

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
same plane

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.470 
same plane
they<00:02:51.600> point<00:02:51.960> of<00:02:52.230> incidence<00:02:52.820> this<00:02:53.820> point<00:02:54.180> of

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
they point of incidence this point of

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.980 
they point of incidence this point of
incidence<00:02:54.870> okay<00:02:55.590> so<00:02:56.010> these<00:02:56.280> three<00:02:56.700> are<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:57.600> the

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
incidence okay so these three are in the

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.150 
incidence okay so these three are in the
same<00:02:58.440> plane<00:02:58.950> okay<00:02:59.910> this<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:00.450> first<00:03:00.660> love

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
same plane okay this is the first love

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.850 
same plane okay this is the first love
next<00:03:02.160> what<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.360> second<00:03:03.900> law<00:03:04.880> now

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
next what is the second law now

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.930 
next what is the second law now
construct<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:08.160> circle<00:03:08.190> with<00:03:09.590> any<00:03:10.590> radius<00:03:11.400> in

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
construct a circle with any radius in

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.510 
construct a circle with any radius in
the<00:03:12.210> center<00:03:12.570> of<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.900> point<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.530> incidence

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.320 

it<00:03:17.060> cuts<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:19.630> instantly<00:03:20.630> and<00:03:20.960> refracted<00:03:21.920> ray

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
it cuts the instantly and refracted ray

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.960 
it cuts the instantly and refracted ray
so<00:03:23.330> what<00:03:24.230> is<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.530> circle<00:03:24.980> it<00:03:25.490> is<00:03:25.640> constructed

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
so what is the circle it is constructed

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:33.540 
so what is the circle it is constructed
this<00:03:28.690> is<00:03:28.900> a<00:03:28.930> circle<00:03:29.560> okay<00:03:31.080> any<00:03:32.080> radius<00:03:32.590> this<00:03:33.490> is

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
this is a circle okay any radius this is

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.960 
this is a circle okay any radius this is
a<00:03:33.700> radius<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:34.300> this<00:03:34.540> circle<00:03:34.960> and<00:03:35.910> this<00:03:36.910> circle

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
a radius of this circle and this circle

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.640 
a radius of this circle and this circle
is<00:03:37.660> cuts<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.410> incident<00:03:38.890> ray<00:03:39.130> here<00:03:39.580> and

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
is cuts the incident ray here and

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.900 
is cuts the incident ray here and
refracted<00:03:41.650> ray<00:03:42.420> here<00:03:43.420> okay<00:03:44.050> so<00:03:44.920> what<00:03:45.700> is<00:03:45.820> the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
refracted ray here okay so what is the

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.940 
refracted ray here okay so what is the
second<00:03:46.240> law<00:03:46.390> main<00:03:46.660> point<00:03:46.990> what<00:03:47.320> is<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.590> second

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
second law main point what is the second

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.080 
second law main point what is the second
layer<00:03:48.100> if<00:03:48.970> you're<00:03:49.210> dry<00:03:49.600> is<00:03:50.730> perpendicular<00:03:52.290> if

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
layer if you're dry is perpendicular if

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:02.360 
layer if you're dry is perpendicular if
you<00:03:55.090> die<00:03:55.920> perpendicular<00:03:56.920> from<00:03:57.250> these<00:03:57.870> points

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.920 

and<00:04:03.630> from<00:04:04.630> this<00:04:04.870> point

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
and from this point

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.650 
and from this point
this<00:04:07.560> is<00:04:07.709> perpendicular<00:04:08.129> to<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.700> normal<00:04:08.730> okay

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
this is perpendicular to the normal okay

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.369 
this is perpendicular to the normal okay
so<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.680> ratio<00:04:11.190> of<00:04:11.220> these<00:04:11.879> two<00:04:12.379> perpendiculars

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
so the ratio of these two perpendiculars

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:20.689 
so the ratio of these two perpendiculars
is<00:04:14.090> constant<00:04:16.790> it<00:04:17.790> is<00:04:18.919> what<00:04:19.919> is<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.190> second<00:04:20.579> law

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
is constant it is what is the second law

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.379 
is constant it is what is the second law
here<00:04:21.650> ratio<00:04:22.650> of<00:04:22.770> perpendicular<00:04:23.280> distance<00:04:24.180> in

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
here ratio of perpendicular distance in
