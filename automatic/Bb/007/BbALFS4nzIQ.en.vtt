so the emek there is really the future

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.939 
so the emek there is really the future
of<00:00:29.460> PC<00:00:29.820> control<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> mouse<00:00:31.320> first

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
of PC control and it is a mouse first

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.319 
of PC control and it is a mouse first
and<00:00:32.160> foremost<00:00:32.340> but<00:00:32.669> unlike<00:00:32.940> any<00:00:33.149> other

logitech<00:00:49.920> has<00:00:50.370> actually<00:00:50.730> used<00:00:50.879> some<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
logitech has actually used some of the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.939 
logitech has actually used some of the
technology<00:00:51.750> from<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.320> aerospace<00:00:52.920> industry

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
technology from the aerospace industry

can<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.910> tell<00:00:54.059> me<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> little<00:00:54.239> bit<00:00:54.420> more<00:00:54.570> about

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
can you tell me a little bit more about

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.350 
can you tell me a little bit more about
that<00:00:54.899> absolutely<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.039> what<00:00:56.579> logitech<00:00:57.059> did<00:00:57.239> is

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
that absolutely so what logitech did is

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.209 
that absolutely so what logitech did is
really<00:00:57.539> take<00:00:57.960> technology<00:00:58.379> that's<00:00:58.770> used<00:00:58.859> in

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
really take technology that's used in

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.520 
really take technology that's used in
autopilot<00:00:59.820> systems<00:01:00.390> stability<00:01:01.350> control

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530

systems for cars as well as technology
that<00:01:04.379> nASA<00:01:04.650> has<00:01:04.860> used<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.700> build<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.060> into<00:01:06.180> this

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
that nASA has used to build it into this

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.539 
that nASA has used to build it into this
mouse<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.439> sounds<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.010> funny<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.310> say<00:01:08.520> but

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
mouse and it sounds so funny to say but

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.649 
mouse and it sounds so funny to say but
it<00:01:08.820> actually<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.390> rocket<00:01:09.869> science<00:01:10.040> okay<00:01:11.659> why

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
it actually is rocket science okay why

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.510 
it actually is rocket science okay why
would<00:01:12.869> we<00:01:13.020> need<00:01:13.170> rocket<00:01:13.439> science<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.340> mouse

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
would we need rocket science in a mouse

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.670 
would we need rocket science in a mouse
where<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> aha<00:01:15.570> moment<00:01:15.600> comes<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.530> where

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
where the aha moment comes in and where

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.200 
where the aha moment comes in and where
the<00:01:16.799> rocket<00:01:17.130> science<00:01:17.430> really<00:01:17.580> comes<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.060> is

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the rocket science really comes in is

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.359 
the rocket science really comes in is
when<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.750> lift<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.200> Mouse<00:01:19.439> off<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
desktop and you can tell even if I just

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.920 
desktop and you can tell even if I just
grab<00:01:23.100> grab<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.729> clock<00:01:23.939> I'm<00:01:24.330> not<00:01:24.689> even

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
grab grab the clock I'm not even

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.620 
grab grab the clock I'm not even
pointing<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.380> at<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.890> pc<00:01:26.310> i<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.970> turn<00:01:27.450> it

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
pointing it at the pc i can turn it

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.569 
pointing it at the pc i can turn it
upside<00:01:27.930> down<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.409> still<00:01:28.770> knows<00:01:29.100> which<00:01:29.340> way<00:01:29.520> is

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
upside down it still knows which way is

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.789 
upside down it still knows which way is
up<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:30.030> activities<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:30.930> navigating<00:01:31.409> photos

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
up in activities like navigating photos

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.230 
up in activities like navigating photos
but<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.040> really<00:01:32.189> does<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.520> for<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.090> from

but it really does is for you from

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.850 
but it really does is for you from
having<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.570> walk<00:01:33.780> over<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> desktop<00:01:34.619> and

know share those pictures and it's a

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.130 
know share those pictures and it's a
much<00:01:38.549> more<00:01:38.729> convenient<00:01:39.119> experience<00:01:39.900> than

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
much more convenient experience than

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.560 
much more convenient experience than
