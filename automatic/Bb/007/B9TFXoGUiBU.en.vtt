00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.070
 first of all we verify that they have 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.720
 ejected all capsules from the 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.720
 coffee maker and empty your tray 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.480
 we take out the water tank and 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.340
 we check that it is full in case 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.590
 otherwise we fill it leaving space 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.390
 for the product below 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.220
 we introduce all the content of a 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.790
 about scarel coffee machine cleaner and 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.330
 inside 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.330
 i 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.649
 and 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.910
 now we have the coffee machine ready 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.800
 to start the cleaning process only 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.520
 we have to place a large glass and give it 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.520
 to the start button 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.820
 to 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.340
 right away we'll see how dirty the 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.000
 water we will repeat this operation until 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.740
 completely empty the water from the tank 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.950
 We will check that each time the water 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.049
 it comes out cleaner 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.820
 finally we will repeat the process 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.560
 filling the tank with water only 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.020
 to rinse the entire circuit of the 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.560
 coffee maker 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.560
 Y 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.049
 Once completed this process and 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.750
 we have the machine ready to prepare 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.320
 a delicious coffee 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.320

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.990
