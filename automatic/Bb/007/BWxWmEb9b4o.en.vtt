00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 hello everyone with you archa today if you 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.290
 mod he how to choose 4 barriers in the very 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:13.080
 beginning passage cave 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.450
 immaculate not so we have four 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.949
 buttons naturally i like any 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.470
 normal person seeing four buttons 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.180
 at the very beginning he put all of them upon them 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.980
 characters 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.869
 means nothing happened after that 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.019
 I began to throw all the junk that 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.929
 stood next to these four buttons too 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.770
 saw no effect after that i 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.530
 already started thinking and looking for something 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:41.100
 what can really help me 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.980
 open her barriers and so I ran here 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.550
 here and clicking on alt saw here 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.010
 an interesting barrel on which is applied 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.379
 the emblem of the immaculate nothing to do i 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:59.520
 decided her to kick the buttons that is what 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:04.229
 closer to me not to be far 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.220
 well and oddly enough i heard a click and 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.540
 I saw that one barrier was removed 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.720
 but after that I understood what was needed 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.700
 probably throw on these buttons that something 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.530
 which is somehow related to these immaculate 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:23.759
 or something on what is their emblem 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.619
 so I went on and going up 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.960
 this one 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:33.570
 fragmented only nichke told the book 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:36.600
 Immaculate take a book and throw it here 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.960
 on this one that's just a tiny fee 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.960
 lichku 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:51.030
 second click 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:53.520
 the second barrier is removed and by the way I want to say 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.770
 what is not necessary to see exactly this 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.420
 book if you have a valid book 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.330
 immaculate 1 or 3 in inventory earlier 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.830
 maybe you do not give found them too 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.200
 you can safely put it on this 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.170
 button but only on this one if you put 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.840
 on the other nothing will happen the same 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:18.590
 as with a barrel, this barrel only works 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.590
 on this button and so we go on 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:32.250
 we go all the same broken 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:37.340
 the stairs up here here here 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:40.740
 a little button to press 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:48.300
 before this something dolov opened here 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:50.330
 the door we can go in here 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.430
 we have a bucket of water 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.870
 again click on eh you see it on 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.700
 which made 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:04.230
 the emblem of the immaculate we grab this bucket and 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:07.160
 go here exactly to this place on 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.160
 the other is not a ride 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:23.430
 and put it 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:29.460
 3 click click on 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:31.500
 barriers and there was only one battle left but what 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:36.570
 I personally did not find anything else 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:39.420
 what can somehow have a connection with these 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:45.570
 immaculate nothing with the emblem of the immaculate 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:48.630
 but as it turned out the fourth button can 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.850
 unlock just by putting one here 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.010
 of these here 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:57.470
 healthy you on it these three 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.470
 and is broken down or is this a whole 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.550
 actually what is the logic in person 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.600
 i don't understand any characters and 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.570
 emblems blameless on these waters 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:16.110
 maybe i missed some document 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:21.210
 or do not know the book in which there are hints 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:25.290
 on the fact that you need to put these barrels 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:28.410
 It is on this button I do not know but in 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.480
 overall for this somehow thought of the method 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.840
 speck maybe say this somehow 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.960
 explained, but I personally do not have special logic 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.780
 I see, too, to put on this button 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.310
 a barrel without any vaz 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.650
 without any identifiable 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.970
 immaculate signs oh well the main thing 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:53.910
 that we opened 4 barriers and now we can 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:56.970
 pass on the test of immaculate on 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.070
