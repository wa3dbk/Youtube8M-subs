00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.440
 hello how about my name is not unique to me 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.190
 sucre and today I come with some delicious 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.020
 french toast or french toast how 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.750
 French toast is made after 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.660
 very easy French toast 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.869
 they use sandwich bread well the 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.820
 integral or else the white bread and that 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:36.430
 let's do then then we have 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:41.310
 egg and the egg we beat 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.310
 with half a cup of milk 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.500
 the french toast a lot of people the 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.050
 uses for dessert but there are also other 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.460
 people who eat it for breakfast 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.460
 then we put some sugar 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.190
 there are people who can put you 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.700
 vanilla or cinnamon powder we mix it 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.210
 well that is the milk the sugar and the egg 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.830
 whole and our slices we had 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.260
 we can chop them if they want in 2 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.660
 We passed them back and forth through our 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.320
 mix in the meantime they will fry in 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.820
 oil and it happens then like this as 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.280
 they are watching we pass them back and forth 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.170
 When our oil is hot, not 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.260
 they have to let them immerse a lot 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.390
 time because I moisturizes much I 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.580
 I try to drain the while I oil 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.710
 it's heating up and then we fry them 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.150
 after frying them then we put them 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.980
 to drain on absorbent paper 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.230
 It is very important that the oil is 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.970
 hot but not too much for that 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.470
 We are not going to let burning 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.320
 then frying on our toast 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.420
 French you can leave them whole but 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.370
 I think more beautiful are left if we 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.380
 we applied the 2 the pact was going 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.150
 to do as I told them as peaches 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.070
 to the wine when they are golden 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.170
 we flip can put the coasts with 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.320
 different fruits with a sweet serves the 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.210
 raisins can be put with chopped strawberry 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.160
 and melts in the strawberry jam with 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.640
 a little wine so that it will 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.020
 they can also put with whipped cream and 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.310
 even with water what is very 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.190
 important that they are golden on one side 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.290
 to pass it to flip the when 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.750
 they are already drained very well and 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.150
 we take them out we put them here on paper 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.330
 absorbent to drain the fat and 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.030
 They are a very friendly and easy recipe 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.420
 prepare the whole as I said is not 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.370
 submerge a lot of time the bread these are going to 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.590
 be comprehensive but roundtrip 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.150
 because if I do not break my bread and now 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.150
 let's go then fry 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.570
 meanwhile then I'm going to ride 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.790
 make an ice cream I put my wine a cup 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.860
 of wine with sugar and a few sprigs of 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.370
 cinnamon I'm going to make my peaches 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.860
 wine 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.560
 to then cover my foreheads tous the 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.560
 we drain well 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.959
 that we have here we have then a 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.050
 cup of red wine two tablespoons 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.900
 sugar and a cinnamon stick my 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.480
 peaches 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.579
 I'm going to do 1 - with this the wine also 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.220
 can make us with fresh peaches 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.980
 He peels them well, they do have to 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.930
 boil a while to soften it because 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.420
 They are harder than those that come in a can 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.970
 and we put them then to cook for 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.060
 that thickens my sauce as we go then 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.150
 to serve our plate 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:33.310
 we have then our franz tost 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.310
 let's put a brunette 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.840
 and the white bread 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.670
 and the brown peace like a fan 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:53.820
