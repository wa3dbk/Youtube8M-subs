00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.010
 hello everyone I hope you are very well 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.719
 eating well all the video 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.610
 well let's see an attack with everything 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.610
 wizards and the attack has already started here 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.710
 see, start a whole front on the side 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.619
 right begins to clean up this whole area 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.410
 on the upper right side it no longer has 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.540
 no enemy defense and then start 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.790
 make their way the wizards clean up 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.280
 fast because as we already know they have 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.620
 much attack and down the bottom 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.720
 left is already releasing more magicians and 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.210
 we are seeing that he is leaving by 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.219
 easy side that is the free percentage 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.350
 which is are all the buildings that 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.379
 we have the magician outside as we already know 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.660
 has more life than an archer but 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.149
 comparison as it stands three 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.789
 shots of a tower of archers a 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.859
 mortar cannon holds more and then in 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.140
 that moment that is holding more like 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.929
 the magician I already mentioned is very strong 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.239
 Well, it is cleaning the 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.520
 simple magicians made 40 percent 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.130
 already accompanied the kings that are a good 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.380
 level level 22 the king level 20 the queen 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.850
 you can achieve the percent here 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.570
 there was still a bit of percentage 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.520
 outside 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.840
 and so to make this attack I think 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.190
 that to make this attack we have to 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.130
 look for villages that have a percentage 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.170
 outside because if it 's inside the magician it's 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.970
 strong but will not stand to be 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.880
 shooting walls first and then and 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.380
 that are populated by mines by 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.600
 camps by the huts of 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.400
 builders all those constructions 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.590
 which are free percentage and see here 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.930
 already achieved a star and then little more 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.540
 manages to do with the kings as they enter 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.030
 the defenses of in action pretty good 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.390
 the attack and see without any spell without 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.630
 no help from clan castle 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.450
 simply 60 magicians 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.430
 and his two kings who are already considered 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.100
 of high level level 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.079
 22 the king of level 20 the queen then 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.600
 well let's make this attack to see 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.880
 How are we doing and why are we going to 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.679
 bring what are 60 magicians that are the 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.079
 that fit in the camp exactly 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:09.330
 as he was carrying 60 magicians 60 magicians in 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.340
 armaments here we see them but we 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.050
 we're going to lead in clan castle 68 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.880
 I know it's a bit of difference but 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.130
 we're going to see how we va 4 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.050
 freezing a ray trying to use them 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.390
 let's see if it's true that we can 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.239
 make a good attack we carry the king and 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.830
 come on the queen as I mentioned we're going to 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.290
 find a village that has a percentage 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.060
 outside and that the defenses are not so 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.519
 near the buildings that we make 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.400
 our good this village see the walls 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.950
 they are protecting the defenses well 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.079
 along with the constructions so it's 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.819
 It's a bit difficult to approach 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.290
 the defenses are out although it would be 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.780
 good to destroy them and then destroy 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.760
 all constructions but we are not going to 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.860
 try to find where they come from outside 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.330
 it's like he did it because having 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.820
 inside it's going to be a bit more difficult 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.620
 magicians are a slow unit but in 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.570
 together we are seeing that they are quite 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.310
 destructive so you have to learn to 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.640
 use them well the same in attacks that 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.550
 they are golems wizards witches are a key 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.860
 or they are very essential because as I have 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.020
 said are quite powerful 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.910
 the thing is to be able to put them in the moment 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.640
 exact and behind a golem because 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.230
 he also has very little life and so what 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.930
 they can kill fast but if we put them 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.580
 in a good place they can make a great 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.560
 difference as we are going to try to do it 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.930
 to us destroying the 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.750
 constructions and well I think not 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.520
 I find no village with everything outside 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.010
 It is difficult because many know that there is 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.830
 people who wear bows and all that goes 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.709
 using like 50% like me to 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.870
 make free percentage but there must be 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.550
 the one they have some 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.860
 constructions outside 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.390
 however, we will not pay so much attention to 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.610
 the resources because I do not think I have 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.620
 the stores outside so the first 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.910
 village that has many buildings outside 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.960
 we are going to attack her and have I believe that 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.460
 we are going to attack her if she has 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.870
 many buildings are outside the 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.090
 outside the walls some if you have us 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.920
 in and I think to count them 50% 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.710
 let's see if he has anything in the castle 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.930
 of the clan because archers are coming out 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.630
 witches magicians that I did not expect so much 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.100
 I carry the lightning but because the new ones do not 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.620
 they're going to die so let's have it 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.269
 kill with the magicians ministers here we go 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.549
 to bring a little more attention to the 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.280
 witches that come together and here just 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.830
 the ray because they see how they were destroyed 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.350
 pretty good there are times I do not throw it 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.270
 well and they are not destroyed now yes and 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.120
 let's go the great enemy I think this 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.800
 it's going to be a parenthesis because in the 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.290
 repetition that we saw in had not used 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.720
 ray no spell no castle 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:42.220
 clan but in the repetition there was no 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.569
 kings there were almost 23 enemies let go 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.460
 all magicians because no 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:50.270
 begins to have complications we are going to 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.009
 drop a freeze and 38% 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.919
 let's try I think that another 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:56.569
 freezing over here 42 percent I think 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.099
 that outside there was only 40 per 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:00.379
 we have to get a little more 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.149
 as he had done with his kings and 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:04.189
 we get to 48 percent that is not 

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:05.749
 nothing bad and we're going to have to drop 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:07.669
 kings because here they will kill 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:10.339
 all the magicians that tower hell together 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:12.409
 with the tower of mortar wizards because 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:14.569
 I did not do anything wrong to do it with only 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:17.240
 wizards here we're just going to use a little bit the 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:19.099
 help from that of the kings to steal a 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.129
 little is also good that they 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:24.139
 mentioned we're going to use his power here 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:26.029
 to steal here in the warehouse and the king 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.189
 I think we're going to drop it here 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:30.619
 up so that he steals us just a little 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:33.229
 of resources I think we did it quite 

00:05:30.619 --> 00:05:35.479
 well, it was not bad at all, I hope 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:38.029
 that you liked, we'll see you until 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:41.529
 next video leave in the comments 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:41.529
 what do you think of this way of attacking
