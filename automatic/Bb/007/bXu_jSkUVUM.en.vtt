 my name is alexander george job 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.699
 editor of the quote.ru portal 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:16.070
 today we will talk to you and that kim ok then 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.630
 that Kiev is one of the most important 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.019
 anyway camera exactly 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.210
 he lets stills

 fix the camera for example with all 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.339
 desire not excerpts 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.399
 today we look at what are the main types 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:29.119
 what's assets 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.349
 represented in the modern market 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.420
 their simplest is the smallest 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.910
 pocket tripod for compact cameras 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.560
 height and hard exceeds 10 15 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.550
 centimeters construction can 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.500
 legs can vary greatly as 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.670
 folding 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.700
 so flexible 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.530
 their biggest advantage 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.060
 compactness 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.460
 if 100 200 grams tripod does not take much 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.980
 Places in your pocket or photo bag

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.040
 kostitsyn landed what 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.720
 either form the heaviest hand in hand with 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.720
 this state of affairs 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.780
 no less comfortable is flexible such 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.810
 such as giving points 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.520
 such articles are published in different 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.520
 stiffness and different size happens when 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.590
 Kapakov and for mirrors 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.180
 what article can you put on 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.850
 land and maybe 15 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.850
 any field 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.939
 but such articles are small 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.099
 to position the camera at eye level 

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:36.609
 need to find the appropriate 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:37.780
 form 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:38.729
 now let's get acquainted 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.729
 directly dry winds what to do 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.040
 They differ greatly in price. 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.270
 so on the material of manufacture and weight 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.520
 the harder 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.520
 the theme of the forces should not be that peak 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.460
 usually large manufacturers 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.020
 indicate load capacity 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.470
 asset documentation 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.290
 the cheaper the tripod the more about it 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.139
 plastic products 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.249
 pay less reliable than metal 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:13.499
 so professional 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.619
 planted made of metal has 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:17.579
 heavy weight and massive 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.309
 there are also carbon fiber 

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:20.829
 models that are much more expensive 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.579
 metal counterparts but at the same time 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.239
 has less weight 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.810
 usually professional 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.529
 tripod model has the ability 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:30.639
 installations by changing heads often 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.590
 sold without it at all that the photographer himself 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.060
 could pick the most suitable 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.439
 chapter model 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.819
 there are rows of goals equipped with screws 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.359
 to rotate the camera 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.359
 in three different planes 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:48.519
 note this model is equipped 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.089
 level 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:51.899
 in order for the camera to be set 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:54.939
 in strictly horizontal 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:56.709
 another variety is so 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.779
 called fat head 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:00.849
 yesterday the big world is fixed by one 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.709
 bandage with loosening allows you to tilt 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.129
 camera of different directions 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:07.919
 this is the most operational work 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.239
 no heads 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.230
 Well, as well as goals adapted 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.079
 specifically for shooting video 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:15.879
 main feature 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.719
 is smooth edge movement 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.719
 without jerks 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.469
 some models have features 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:45.049
 return the main bar 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.620
 such that cues will be especially useful for 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.349
 macro lovers since 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.969
 allows you to install cameras 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.969
 close proximity to the ground 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:59.979
 we divide the family worth highlighting 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:02.809
 a similar pattern so called on the field 

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:04.789
 applied and food reporting 

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:07.549
 shooting when grown up for erroneous 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.839
 just no time 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:11.469
 other than professional ones 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:13.749
 heavy bulky models 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:15.779
 there are more simple 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:17.319
 they are lighter compact 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:18.629
 least cooperative 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:21.629
 work 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.419
 somoni finds when shooting style 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.830
 lens if you shoot a single point for a long time 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.669
 Moscow allows you not to strain once again 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.379
 hands hold heavy camera and 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:35.389
 lens 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:36.669
 besides, he avoids 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.160
 child noticing kaka tripod 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.499
 we save up left the field for shifts heads 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:44.919
 So having decided on a specific model 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.079
 it remains to check whether the store is suitable 

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:50.110
 you specific article height 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.100
