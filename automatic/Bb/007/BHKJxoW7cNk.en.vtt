00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
and but this is a for generation this is

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.010 
and but this is a for generation this is
first<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.410> third<00:02:41.220> generation<00:02:42.020> env3

the<00:04:12.690> last<00:04:12.900> day<00:04:13.200> Gengar<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:14.130> this<00:04:14.370> is

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
the last day Gengar and this is

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.630 
the last day Gengar and this is
extremely<00:04:16.260> powerful<00:04:16.650> it's<00:04:17.250> it's<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.430> lot<00:04:17.549> of

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
extremely powerful it's it's a lot of

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.849 
extremely powerful it's it's a lot of
special<00:04:17.940> attack<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:18.540> I<00:04:19.320> think<00:04:19.530> this<00:04:19.620> inner

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
special attack and I think this inner

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.940 
special attack and I think this inner
take<00:04:20.040> two<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.790> least<00:04:21.330> when<00:04:21.540> they<00:04:21.720> get<00:04:22.680> stabbed

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
take two is least when they get stabbed

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.180 
take two is least when they get stabbed
with<00:04:22.979> /<00:04:23.490> bombed<00:04:23.760> by<00:04:23.880> shadow<00:04:24.120> ball

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
with / bombed by shadow ball

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.910 
with / bombed by shadow ball
so<00:04:25.940> it's<00:04:26.330> a<00:04:26.540> very<00:04:26.570> powerful<00:04:27.080> pokémon<00:04:27.500> and

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
so it's a very powerful pokémon and

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.910 
so it's a very powerful pokémon and
detestable<00:04:28.400> it<00:04:28.910> has<00:04:29.150> the<00:04:29.410> Chester<00:04:30.410> Barrett<00:04:30.770> a

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
detestable it has the Chester Barrett a

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.710 
detestable it has the Chester Barrett a

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
chase if we turn to sleep it will wake

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.340 
chase if we turn to sleep it will wake
