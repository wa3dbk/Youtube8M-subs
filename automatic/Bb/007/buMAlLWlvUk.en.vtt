00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.000
 welcome to a new video tutorial my 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.670
 name is txomin if I wanted to introduce you 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.889
 a different way to create our 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.590
 our own special effects 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.619
 it's very easy to download it from 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.619
 Internet 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.220
 brushes that make our 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.070
 our work when creating photo 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.960
 compositions but I think it is also 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.000
 quite interesting to be able to create 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.730
 our own special effects and 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.220
 what better than photoshop to be able 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.710
 to play and to be able to play them 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.470
 our jobs I would like to show you a 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.170
 way to create flashes of light and if you 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.920
 you stay with me next or I teach it 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.920
 that here on my channel 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.300
 The first thing we are going to do is open a 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.040
 new file come new file and 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:14.620
 let's give a dimension is to our 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:18.479
 canvas of 1600 x 1200 pixels with 72 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.979
 inch feet these are these measurements are 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.630
 relative I wanted to give you these measures 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:27.280
 but to simply do the effect 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.750
 you can obviously use 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.840
 the measures with which you go to 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:36.030
 work on your photo composition and 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.619
 each one will contribute the ones that at the time 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.660
 need this is just like a 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.490
 example what we see the next thing that 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.620
 let's do is let's fill 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.260
 our canvas 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.780
 from the icon of the paint bucket and you 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.120
 let's give a color once we have 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.910
 created our fund with jota control 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.000
 let's double our layer and we're going to 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.340
 create our special effect in this 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.160
 case as I said earlier a 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.490
 series of flashes of different sizes 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.200
 for our photos compositions 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.140
 then once we have done we have 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.220
 copied in our layer the following 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.220
 I would go 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.780
 to filter 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.020
 play 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:28.040
 flash we 're going to go to 105 prime 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.850
 millimeters we will give a shine 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.850
 approximately 130 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.790
 we would position ourselves more or less in the 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.439
 center 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.439
 to be able to work much better 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.910
 what would we do ok once we have this 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.150
 this flash the following the following 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.440
 step to perform would be to go to filter 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:57.400
 blur blur cause no longer 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:01.740
 and we're going to give you about 25 out of 25 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:06.420
 and 30 I will give you about 30,000 cels 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:10.440
 valid and we would create this blur 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.650
 with the control keys to select and 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.989
 masters and positioning ourselves in what is the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.050
 height the percentage of the height of 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.510
 Our selection 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:24.910
 we would change it 100%, we would pass it to 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:27.650
 3% and we would have something like this we validate 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.110
 and then 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.750
 in fusion mode we would change it to 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.720
 linear overexposure once 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.090
 we have the first beam of light created us 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.579
 would this effect we can improve 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.290
 creating many more rays of light with 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.989
 against aj in this case what we would do 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.840
 would duplicate that control layer t for 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.599
 select and position ourselves with the 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.580
 cursor what we should do is 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.350
 give 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.110
 a little turn that we see ok 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.880
 we would do the same function as 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.250
 before control t 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.270
 we turn again we can even go 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:08.290
 varying the size by pressing the keys 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:10.900
 shift + alt what we would do would be 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.980
 resize equally 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.030
 then we will give you different 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.610
 sizes to create more realism to 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.040
 our flash to not have to 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:25.450
 vary so much the size 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.970
 from our light rays we can go 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.650
 to previous layers that already have the 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:35.890
 measure and re-perform control j 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:39.870
 and the same control t to select and 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.870
 we would turn again 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:48.490
 and so on 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.490
 control j control 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.780
 we come back 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:56.650
 and position ourselves 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:00.100
 we come back again with the shift + keys 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.980
 alt and from a corner we would throw to 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.000
 create 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.000
 different sizes 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.460
 and once we more or less did 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.729
 our flashes is as simple as 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.099
 go to the first layer keep the 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:24.780
 Shift key pressed select the 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:26.669
 last and with control g create a group 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.930
 Once you have made the group 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:32.280
 simply with selection control 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.280
 we would do all the rays of light 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.539
 with the same combination of keys 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:41.150
 we would go down again to increase or 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:43.340
 decrease its size according to what 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.430
 we would like 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.710
 this would be a practical way to create 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:52.370
 our own special effects without 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.960
 have to resort to the brushes that 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.590
 they come by default and we can 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.780
 find easily on the internet is 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.550
 a way to create your own 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.740
 special effects 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.860
 we can go resizing we validate 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.500
 even positioning it 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.979
 so we're leaving now 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.830
 to the bottom and we mark again control j 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:18.950
 we create a copy of our fund and 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:22.640
 we would go to filter 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:26.550
 and interpret flash and this time 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:29.390
 we would change to the prime 35 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.390
 we would put him 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:34.850
 a more or less position 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.190
 we go down a little bit to the intensity more or 

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.190
 less than one hundred percent 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:46.570
 the same 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.570
 marÃ­n we would do and then our group 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.900
 we could in the middle and it would be a way 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.520
 control we want you to turn depends 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.590
 of the rays that we have 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.390
 placed in our flash 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.470
 we would position ourselves in one way or another 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:07.060
 according to the result and something like that would remain 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:11.020
 obviously we are talking about creating 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:13.420
 certain flashes for different 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.940
 photocomposition is good this has been my 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.910
 video tutorial station and technique I hope 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:21.730
 that you have learned one more technique 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:23.940
 we see in a next video tutorial up 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.940
 soon
