00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.259
 Hello dear friends, this is already 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.190
 sixth and video from the heading 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:14.940
 but the club and in this part we will consider 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:18.869
 a very interesting recycling plant why 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.090
 he is interesting right now he will find out 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.710
 very useful on the server so you 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.439
 it will be interesting this one hundred percent 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.019
 first I would like to tell you about 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:34.079
 The principle of operation of this plant means 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.960
 everything is arranged on our 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.579
 wonderful pumps miss ida arrow 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.070
 collects the water that is under it 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.260
 and make infinite source we 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.399
 make an endless work process 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.000
 from the factory means a pump 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.670
 justified water after that he gives out 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.420
 water near the compressor compressor and in 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.260
 turn 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.500
 this water is treated and turned into 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.280
 snowflake 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.110
 these snowflakes pop out sorting 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.229
 which we are very well known from 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.390
 previous releases and then they you 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.220
 slowly park neurotic he 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.500
 gets to the chest 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.479
 where then did they get 2 compressor 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.630
 compressor 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.280
 recycling them bled so you can 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.850
 notice 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:34.090
 drinks their utilizer 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.320
 processes this ice then it is required 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.320
 such here. 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:50.530
 well went 9 glass terms that means a 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:53.649
 everything straightens you probably noticed 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:58.030
 that two built here are the same 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:02:00.009
 plant at a glance but for that 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.399
 completely wrong in fact they yes they 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:07.000
 are the same but in fact I'm totally 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:10.299
 Different means than plus here first 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.390
 factory first factory has a very high 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:15.820
 coefficient of performance is very 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.709
 low energy consumption but at the same time 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:23.300
 a lot of resources are obtained but there is 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:27.440
 one fat minus which 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.500
 does not allow to mention this 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:34.010
 I would say so time is expensive 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.590
 you can do it yourself 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.410
 little snowflakes crawling well of course but with 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.710
 two sides it turns out a lot 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:47.840
 ultimately but nevertheless all here 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.610
 these here are how to say so compressor 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.940
 not very slow and therefore 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.580
 time is becoming this 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.960
 problem with time is expensive i decided i 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:03.640
 this factory but I donated time 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:07.850
 acquired the problem of energy problem 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:11.660
 because energy saving in general 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.510
 no this plant very much 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.090
 produces resources for there I will be bent 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.300
 bury there at a period of a minute an hour 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.210
 but consumes a lot of energy you 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.750
 themselves noticed that there is a developed 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:29.660
 see 10 echoes and 5 more chips installed 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.360
 with each compressor 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.110
 still installed on the 6th rather body 2 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:39.650
 transformer module transformer and 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.000
 two energy saver modules therefore 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.130
 here is this plant to create very, very 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.410
 problematic that is if you have little 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.250
 resources then you him for nothing not 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.400
 build 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:56.360
 well not to mention this factory 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.610
 here is purely much more sorting 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.170
 machines but sorting machines think 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.730
 easy to craft so no 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:08.740
 problems and yes I forgot to tell you about them 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.740
 common plus these plants 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.850
 expand to infinity i mean i 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.290
 built the first three floors 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.239
 noticing the sequence you can 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.580
 continue to build in the same way then 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.030
 there is for example copying the first floor you 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:27.430
 build like this did 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.040
 Generally here is the first second plant that 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:34.390
 copying the first floor to infinity you 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:37.060
 get an infinitely big factory and more 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.630
 if you play my crafton do you 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.230
 the secret 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:46.650
 nobody you can this factory 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:49.720
 build infinitely infinitely large and 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.020
 you are not banned for this because 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.760
 restrictions on the compressor and on 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.840
 filler pumps sorting machine 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:03.670
 pneumatic tubes there is then 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:06.310
 there is an opportunity i have you 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:09.280
 just I told you this 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.160
 build a huge huge factory 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.040
 soup and phase it is not banned and at the same time you 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.890
 you will have so much matter 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:20.740
 that not just matter all raw materials that 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:26.100
 this is all very serious blowjob to you that 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:29.250
 200th veshek yes yes that's what you 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:32.220
 Now I think I'm tuvi including 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.410
 so 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.950
 hidden from admins systems under the ground 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:41.290
 such are the huge plants and 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:44.140
 restore how to say so your 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:47.910
 320 hashig who once banned us 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:52.410
 install on minecraft by project 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:55.090
 on this sweet note, I will probably finish 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.670
 I ask you to put a like under this 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.550
 video subscribe to my channel ask 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:02.860
 questions if something is not clear to you and yes 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.600
 by the way this card will be downloading you 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.940
 you can download it calmly 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.580
 unpack and view these plants 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.270
 to copy them to the server 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:17.310
 example or something else 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.940
 thanks for watching and until next 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.940
 release bye
