so<00:02:04.969> if<00:02:05.209> I<00:02:05.389> were<00:02:05.569> to<00:02:05.630> shoot<00:02:06.079> a<00:02:06.259> portal<00:02:06.590> let's<00:02:06.799> say

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
so if I were to shoot a portal let's say

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.999 
so if I were to shoot a portal let's say
over<00:02:07.459> here<00:02:07.759> on<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:08.330> beach<00:02:08.509> okay<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:09.649> then<00:02:09.979> I

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
over here on the beach okay and then I

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.640 
over here on the beach okay and then I
was<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.399> shoot<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.940> opposite<00:02:11.900> portal<00:02:12.260> right

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
was to shoot the opposite portal right

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.350 
was to shoot the opposite portal right
here<00:02:13.069> what<00:02:13.520> do<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.790> think<00:02:14.030> is<00:02:14.150> going<00:02:14.270> to

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
here what do you think is going to

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.330 
here what do you think is going to
happen<00:02:14.420> when<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:14.840> jump<00:02:15.170> into<00:02:15.380> this<00:02:15.770> portal<00:02:16.220> of

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
happen when I jump into this portal of

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.449 
happen when I jump into this portal of
course<00:02:16.819> I'm<00:02:17.030> gonna<00:02:17.270> end<00:02:17.480> up<00:02:17.660> out<00:02:17.840> well<00:02:18.260> on<00:02:18.950> the

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
course I'm gonna end up out well on the

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.250 
course I'm gonna end up out well on the
other<00:02:19.579> beach<00:02:19.970> if<00:02:20.269> I<00:02:20.420> don't<00:02:20.629> land<00:02:20.840> back<00:02:21.019> in<00:02:21.049> the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
other beach if I don't land back in the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.199 
other beach if I don't land back in the
portal<00:02:21.590> I'm<00:02:21.829> on<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.189> other<00:02:22.310> beach<00:02:22.519> now<00:02:22.819> over

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
portal I'm on the other beach now over

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.000 
portal I'm on the other beach now over
there<00:02:23.390> is<00:02:23.510> where<00:02:23.659> I<00:02:23.720> shop

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
there is where I shop

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.649 
there is where I shop
the<00:02:25.129> portal<00:02:25.489> and<00:02:25.670> over<00:02:26.000> here<00:02:26.269> is<00:02:26.420> where<00:02:26.569> I

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
the portal and over here is where I

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.420 
the portal and over here is where I
ended<00:02:26.930> up<00:02:27.049> this<00:02:27.530> is<00:02:27.680> pretty<00:02:27.830> cool<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.250> adds

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
ended up this is pretty cool it adds

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.699 
ended up this is pretty cool it adds
that<00:02:28.640> little<00:02:28.700> bit<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.120> teleportation<00:02:30.079> I<00:02:30.409> have

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
that little bit of teleportation I have

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.949 
that little bit of teleportation I have
no<00:02:30.920> idea<00:02:30.950> how<00:02:31.370> they<00:02:31.819> got<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:32.390> coding<00:02:32.780> into

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
no idea how they got the coding into

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.960 
no idea how they got the coding into
this<00:02:33.079> game<00:02:33.349> but<00:02:33.950> that's<00:02:34.220> what<00:02:34.430> makes<00:02:34.459> portal

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
this game but that's what makes portal

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.119 
this game but that's what makes portal
such<00:02:35.150> a<00:02:35.180> cool<00:02:35.480> game<00:02:35.689> obviously<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.620> graphics

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
such a cool game obviously the graphics

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.520 
such a cool game obviously the graphics
aren't<00:02:37.400> there<00:02:37.879> but<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.510> fact<00:02:38.689> they<00:02:39.019> can<00:02:39.230> still

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
aren't there but the fact they can still

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.380 
aren't there but the fact they can still
do<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:39.980> physics<00:02:40.400> part<00:02:40.700> of<00:02:40.819> it<00:02:40.909> and<00:02:41.060> you

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
do the physics part of it and you

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.479 
do the physics part of it and you
actually<00:02:41.569> get<00:02:41.900> a<00:02:41.930> speed<00:02:42.290> boost<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:42.739> if<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.340> were

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
actually get a speed boost so if I were

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.880 
actually get a speed boost so if I were
to<00:02:43.549> put<00:02:43.790> both<00:02:44.239> portals<00:02:44.690> side-by-side<00:02:45.620> and

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
to put both portals side-by-side and

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.880 
to put both portals side-by-side and
stand<00:02:46.400> in<00:02:46.579> this<00:02:46.760> one<00:02:47.030> slowly<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:48.049> slowly<00:02:48.349> I'm

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
stand in this one slowly and slowly I'm

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.559 
stand in this one slowly and slowly I'm
going<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.340> get<00:02:49.459> more<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:49.819> more<00:02:49.879> speed<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:50.299> I'm

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
going to get more and more speed and I'm

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.809 
going to get more and more speed and I'm
going<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.750> go<00:02:50.870> higher<00:02:51.079> up<00:02:51.109> in<00:02:51.409> the<00:02:51.440> air<00:02:51.650> like<00:02:52.310> so

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
going to go higher up in the air like so

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.000 
going to go higher up in the air like so
so<00:02:53.209> let's<00:02:53.359> do<00:02:53.540> that<00:02:53.690> real<00:02:53.900> quick<00:02:53.959> and<00:02:54.349> as<00:02:54.859> you

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
so let's do that real quick and as you

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.979 
so let's do that real quick and as you
can<00:02:55.159> see<00:02:55.189> i'm<00:02:55.579> shifting<00:02:56.090> from<00:02:56.450> Portal<00:02:56.900> to

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
can see i'm shifting from Portal to

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.349 
can see i'm shifting from Portal to
portal<00:02:57.260> at<00:02:57.440> any<00:02:57.769> time<00:02:58.069> I<00:02:58.099> can<00:02:58.310> actually<00:02:58.579> change

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
portal at any time I can actually change

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.720 
portal at any time I can actually change
portals<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.170> boom<00:03:00.650> now<00:03:01.010> I'm<00:03:01.159> going<00:03:01.370> from<00:03:01.579> there

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
portals so boom now I'm going from there

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.369 
portals so boom now I'm going from there
to<00:03:01.879> there<00:03:02.060> now<00:03:02.569> I'm<00:03:02.720> going<00:03:02.900> from<00:03:03.049> there<00:03:03.230> to

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
to there now I'm going from there to

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:04.839 
to there now I'm going from there to
there<00:03:03.590> now<00:03:04.010> I'm<00:03:04.099> going<00:03:04.340> from<00:03:04.430> there<00:03:04.609> to<00:03:04.730> there

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
there now I'm going from there to there

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.059 
there now I'm going from there to there
and<00:03:05.060> let's<00:03:05.209> see<00:03:05.329> if<00:03:05.420> we<00:03:05.480> could<00:03:05.629> do<00:03:05.720> it<00:03:05.840> oh<00:03:06.069> yes

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
and let's see if we could do it oh yes

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.520 
and let's see if we could do it oh yes
now<00:03:07.340> we're<00:03:07.519> up<00:03:07.549> here<00:03:07.940> all<00:03:08.180> of<00:03:08.239> a<00:03:08.599> sudden<00:03:08.930> we<00:03:09.319> are

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
now we're up here all of a sudden we are

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.649 
now we're up here all of a sudden we are
at<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.920> completely<00:03:10.430> different<00:03:10.970> part<00:03:11.299> of<00:03:11.480> the

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:11.659 
at a completely different part of the

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.920 
at a completely different part of the
map<00:03:11.930> in<00:03:12.200> let's<00:03:12.709> oh<00:03:12.940> yes<00:03:13.940> now<00:03:14.329> we<00:03:14.359> just<00:03:14.720> shot

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
map in let's oh yes now we just shot

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.839 
map in let's oh yes now we just shot
from<00:03:15.409> there<00:03:15.620> as<00:03:15.859> you<00:03:16.310> can<00:03:16.430> see<00:03:16.579> you<00:03:16.670> can

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
from there as you can see you can

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.250 
from there as you can see you can
manipulate<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.420> portals<00:03:17.720> in<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.079> many

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
manipulate the portals in so many

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.960 
manipulate the portals in so many
different<00:03:18.500> ways<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:19.159> it's<00:03:19.459> pretty<00:03:19.670> cool

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
different ways and it's pretty cool

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.330 
different ways and it's pretty cool
because<00:03:20.030> I<00:03:20.540> mean<00:03:20.750> you<00:03:21.170> can<00:03:21.379> use<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:21.739> portal<00:03:22.129> to

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
because I mean you can use the portal to

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.970 
because I mean you can use the portal to
maybe<00:03:22.970> let's<00:03:23.329> say<00:03:23.450> your<00:03:23.989> house<00:03:24.230> is<00:03:24.260> over<00:03:24.950> there

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
maybe let's say your house is over there

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.599 
maybe let's say your house is over there
and<00:03:25.670> you're<00:03:26.450> over<00:03:26.690> here<00:03:27.319> or<00:03:27.560> you're<00:03:28.069> trying<00:03:28.280> to

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
and you're over here or you're trying to

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.449 
and you're over here or you're trying to
get<00:03:28.819> up<00:03:29.030> here<00:03:29.810> and<00:03:29.959> you're<00:03:30.349> down<00:03:30.379> here<00:03:31.010> you

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
get up here and you're down here you

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.789 
get up here and you're down here you
could<00:03:31.639> just<00:03:31.790> go<00:03:32.239> into<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.569> portal<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.079> you

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
could just go into the portal and you

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.500 
could just go into the portal and you
can<00:03:33.949> use<00:03:34.099> it<00:03:34.250> in<00:03:34.370> all<00:03:34.699> sorts<00:03:34.910> of<00:03:35.060> ways<00:03:35.180> like<00:03:35.359> I

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
can use it in all sorts of ways like I

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.390 
can use it in all sorts of ways like I
said<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:36.109> just<00:03:36.319> manipulate<00:03:36.799> the<00:03:36.949> game<00:03:37.160> and

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
said to just manipulate the game and

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.650 
said to just manipulate the game and
kind<00:03:37.609> of<00:03:37.669> make<00:03:37.819> everything<00:03:38.120> a<00:03:38.329> little<00:03:38.449> bit

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
kind of make everything a little bit

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.569 
kind of make everything a little bit
more<00:03:38.780> fast-paced<00:03:39.290> now<00:03:39.949> this<00:03:40.099> is<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.280> most

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
more fast-paced now this is the most

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.309 
more fast-paced now this is the most
interesting<00:03:41.120> part<00:03:41.329> about<00:03:41.419> it<00:03:41.720> obviously

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
interesting part about it obviously

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.960 
interesting part about it obviously
there's<00:03:42.470> a<00:03:42.560> lot<00:03:42.620> more<00:03:42.739> fun<00:03:43.220> things<00:03:43.459> you<00:03:43.669> can<00:03:43.699> do

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
there's a lot more fun things you can do

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.909 
there's a lot more fun things you can do
make<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.510> portal<00:03:44.989> right<00:03:45.049> here<00:03:45.650> oh<00:03:45.799> no<00:03:46.310> oh<00:03:46.519> gosh

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
make a portal right here oh no oh gosh

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.069 
make a portal right here oh no oh gosh
over<00:03:48.919> here<00:03:49.160> is<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.370> good<00:03:49.669> spot<00:03:50.000> I<00:03:50.060> think<00:03:50.209> to<00:03:50.930> get

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
over here is a good spot I think to get

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.189 
over here is a good spot I think to get
him<00:03:51.319> stuck<00:03:51.889> in<00:03:51.919> an<00:03:52.489> infinite<00:03:52.699> loop<00:03:53.120> of<00:03:53.750> portal

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
him stuck in an infinite loop of portal

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.619 
him stuck in an infinite loop of portal
okay<00:03:54.709> yep<00:03:55.069> that<00:03:55.639> doesn't<00:03:55.970> really<00:03:56.000> give<00:03:56.389> the

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
okay yep that doesn't really give the

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.509 
okay yep that doesn't really give the
justice<00:03:57.169> that<00:03:57.199> I<00:03:57.379> want<00:03:57.769> let's<00:03:58.010> let's<00:03:58.220> go<00:03:58.400> ahead

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
justice that I want let's let's go ahead

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.150 
justice that I want let's let's go ahead
but<00:03:59.120> then<00:03:59.329> that<00:03:59.359> one<00:03:59.810> real<00:03:59.959> quick<00:03:59.989> oh<00:04:00.379> god<00:04:00.889> I'm

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
but then that one real quick oh god I'm

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.000 
but then that one real quick oh god I'm
stuck<00:04:01.489> okay<00:04:01.669> so<00:04:02.419> let's<00:04:03.079> see<00:04:03.290> if<00:04:03.410> we<00:04:03.530> can<00:04:03.680> get<00:04:03.829> a

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
stuck okay so let's see if we can get a

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.619 
stuck okay so let's see if we can get a
better<00:04:04.040> area<00:04:04.579> you<00:04:04.849> know<00:04:04.970> what<00:04:05.120> I'll<00:04:05.299> just<00:04:05.480> go

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
better area you know what I'll just go

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.180 
better area you know what I'll just go
ahead<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:05.840> dig<00:04:06.319> straight<00:04:06.590> down<00:04:06.680> since<00:04:07.099> I'm

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
ahead and dig straight down since I'm

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.069 
ahead and dig straight down since I'm
already<00:04:07.430> in<00:04:07.639> creative<00:04:08.180> mode<00:04:08.209> and<00:04:08.750> I'll<00:04:08.930> show

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
already in creative mode and I'll show

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.129 
already in creative mode and I'll show
you<00:04:09.109> guys<00:04:09.379> just<00:04:10.250> how<00:04:10.459> fast<00:04:10.730> we<00:04:11.359> can<00:04:11.599> get<00:04:11.720> going

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
you guys just how fast we can get going

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:14.830 
you guys just how fast we can get going
and<00:04:12.319> also<00:04:12.739> then<00:04:13.190> we<00:04:13.549> can<00:04:13.760> push<00:04:13.970> a<00:04:14.150> zombie<00:04:14.629> into

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
and also then we can push a zombie into

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.629 
and also then we can push a zombie into
here<00:04:15.079> and<00:04:15.169> maybe<00:04:15.620> get<00:04:15.889> him<00:04:16.010> trapped<00:04:16.400> in<00:04:16.549> an

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
here and maybe get him trapped in an

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.189 
here and maybe get him trapped in an
infinite<00:04:16.909> loop<00:04:17.090> that<00:04:17.449> he<00:04:17.479> can<00:04:17.720> never<00:04:17.870> get<00:04:18.079> out

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
infinite loop that he can never get out

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.279 
infinite loop that he can never get out
of<00:04:18.380> sounds<00:04:19.370> pretty<00:04:19.760> sick<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.449> twisted<00:04:20.659> um<00:04:21.109> it

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
of sounds pretty sick and twisted um it

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.399 
of sounds pretty sick and twisted um it
awesome<00:04:22.250> Oh<00:04:22.490> as<00:04:23.389> you<00:04:23.479> can<00:04:23.659> see<00:04:23.840> I'm<00:04:24.110> just<00:04:24.199> gonna

awesome Oh as you can see I'm just gonna

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:26.830 
awesome Oh as you can see I'm just gonna
keep<00:04:24.650> falling<00:04:25.130> and<00:04:25.220> I<00:04:25.880> missed<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.510> portal

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
keep falling and I missed the portal

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.779 
keep falling and I missed the portal
there<00:04:27.260> we<00:04:27.380> go<00:04:27.530> but<00:04:28.039> you're<00:04:28.250> gonna<00:04:28.340> keep<00:04:28.580> on

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
there we go but you're gonna keep on

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.490 
there we go but you're gonna keep on
falling<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.479> that<00:04:29.510> thing's<00:04:30.080> gonna<00:04:30.229> keep

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
falling and that thing's gonna keep

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.100 
falling and that thing's gonna keep
spinning<00:04:30.949> until<00:04:31.130> I<00:04:31.520> guess<00:04:31.940> a<00:04:32.210> couple<00:04:32.720> times

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
spinning until I guess a couple times

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.230 
spinning until I guess a couple times
but<00:04:33.500> yeah<00:04:33.979> we're<00:04:34.219> going<00:04:34.430> pretty<00:04:34.669> quick<00:04:34.969> here

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
but yeah we're going pretty quick here

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.510 
but yeah we're going pretty quick here
let's<00:04:35.539> see<00:04:35.659> if<00:04:35.719> we<00:04:35.810> can<00:04:35.930> get<00:04:35.990> a<00:04:36.050> zombie<00:04:36.560> stuck

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
let's see if we can get a zombie stuck

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.400 
let's see if we can get a zombie stuck
alright<00:04:37.669> we'll<00:04:37.789> go<00:04:37.819> there<00:04:38.210> and<00:04:38.479> will<00:04:38.960> actually

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
alright we'll go there and will actually

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.200 
alright we'll go there and will actually
use<00:04:39.440> two<00:04:39.979> different<00:04:40.009> kinds<00:04:40.639> of<00:04:40.729> portals<00:04:41.060> so

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
use two different kinds of portals so

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.939 
use two different kinds of portals so
we'll<00:04:41.389> go<00:04:41.569> there<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:41.990> there<00:04:42.139> and<00:04:42.379> then<00:04:42.830> we'll

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
we'll go there and there and then we'll

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:48.219 
we'll go there and there and then we'll
go<00:04:43.069> there<00:04:43.550> and<00:04:44.560> there<00:04:45.560> so<00:04:46.370> now<00:04:47.060> let's<00:04:47.870> spawn<00:04:48.169> a

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
go there and there so now let's spawn a

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.920 
go there and there so now let's spawn a
zombie<00:04:48.830> out<00:04:48.979> god<00:04:49.280> don't<00:04:49.909> do<00:04:50.060> this<00:04:50.180> to<00:04:50.360> me<00:04:50.389> don't

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
infinite loop of free falling oh that's

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.790 
infinite loop of free falling oh that's
just<00:05:11.960> great<00:05:12.080> let's<00:05:13.069> see<00:05:14.380> he<00:05:15.380> looks<00:05:15.590> like<00:05:15.680> he's
