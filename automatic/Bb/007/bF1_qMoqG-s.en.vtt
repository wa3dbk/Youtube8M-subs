00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.589
 after a few years of absence from the shelves he is about to return to ours 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:23.369
 f1 monitor 2010 with a change of developer codemasters inversion 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.630
 multiplatform on PC playstation 3 and xbox 3 60 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.210
 the english developer 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.500
 just put the focus above all on the authenticity of the race not only 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.450
 intended as opel corsa suv on the track but above all on the world surrounding the 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.290
 therefore, it pays great attention to the engineering development of life 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.879
 of the car to the relationship with the media that can to foment or even 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.430
 bring down that the pilot who above all as it is right that it is a great one 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.320
 beware of a great focus on the physics of the car that can be 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.500
 comfortably on foot without aid but above all extremely simulative if 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.470
 we want to try the see divx breeze to drive a car of formula 1 e 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.030
 when he is driving in the wet, there is none for anyone 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.200
 graphically the game presents itself very well the engine of bertone 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.130
 obviously revised and corrected group of very high speed direction 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.240
 thanks also to you for an effect of roma with miller effect 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.600
 which is especially noticeable on crap 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.560
 beats tour are well done that there are so many reflection effects 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.560
 surrounding environment surrounding 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.439
 it's very riba polygonal polar level is right 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.550
 the game more than me seems so much to be really on the right track notcom has 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.520
 said before it is not just a question of running but actually sharing the life of 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.050
 a driver therefore throughout the race weekend but above all 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.340
 the strategy worked well together with the engineers and above all 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.140
 feel spent on agent looking a little 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.890
 a more advantageous contract for next year
