comment section below and if it's good

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.049 
comment section below and if it's good
enough<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.320> will<00:00:37.500> choose<00:00:38.039> it<00:00:38.219> for<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.789> next

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.299

video<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.350> first<00:00:40.379> idea<00:00:40.710> comes<00:00:41.219> from

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
video so the first idea comes from

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.430 
video so the first idea comes from
Austin<00:00:41.879> Scott<00:00:42.210> Lee<00:00:42.449> says<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.719> think<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.199> car

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
Austin Scott Lee says I think the car

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.649 
Austin Scott Lee says I think the car
crashes<00:00:43.859> should<00:00:44.100> be<00:00:44.280> more<00:00:44.489> realistic<00:00:45.300> if

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:45.659 
crashes should be more realistic if

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.169 
crashes should be more realistic if
you've<00:00:45.809> ever<00:00:46.050> watched<00:00:46.469> beaming<00:00:47.249> Drive<00:00:47.609> that

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:48.179 
you've ever watched beaming Drive that

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.149 
you've ever watched beaming Drive that
is<00:00:48.300> how<00:00:48.449> it<00:00:48.600> should<00:00:48.629> be<00:00:49.109> online<00:00:49.379> players<00:00:49.920> can

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
is how it should be online players can

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:52.750 
is how it should be online players can
also<00:00:50.399> have<00:00:50.850> jobs<00:00:51.569> as<00:00:51.809> cops<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.409> paramedics

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
also have jobs as cops and paramedics

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.329 
also have jobs as cops and paramedics
etc<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:53.940> this<00:00:54.329> case<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:55.079> serious<00:00:55.710> accident

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
etc in this case of a serious accident

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:58.639 
etc in this case of a serious accident
so<00:00:56.609> I<00:00:56.819> think<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.659> awesome<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.170> believe<00:00:58.469> I

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
so I think this is awesome I believe I

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.099 
so I think this is awesome I believe I
can't<00:00:58.979> remember<00:00:59.159> if<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.399> was<00:00:59.429> GTA<00:00:59.940> 5<00:01:00.239> or<00:01:00.809> if<00:01:00.989> it

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
can't remember if it was GTA 5 or if it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.959 
can't remember if it was GTA 5 or if it
was<00:01:01.199> another<00:01:01.440> game<00:01:01.679> maybe<00:01:01.949> GTA<00:01:02.370> 4<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:02.729> there

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
was another game maybe GTA 4 but there

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.070 
was another game maybe GTA 4 but there
was<00:01:03.059> an<00:01:03.210> actual<00:01:03.420> mods

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
was an actual mods

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.750 
was an actual mods
that<00:01:04.409> actually<00:01:04.769> made<00:01:04.949> crashes<00:01:05.519> more

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
that actually made crashes more

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.940 
that actually made crashes more
realistic<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:07.110> looks<00:01:07.260> really<00:01:07.470> good<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.890> I

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
realistic and it looks really good and I

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.260 
realistic and it looks really good and I
think<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.460> something<00:01:08.670> they<00:01:08.909> could<00:01:09.090> make

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
think this is something they could make

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.209 
think this is something they could make
happen<00:01:09.690> in<00:01:09.870> the<00:01:09.990> next-gen<00:01:10.560> versions<00:01:11.009> of<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:11.219 
happen in the next-gen versions of the

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:13.190 
happen in the next-gen versions of the
current<00:01:11.490> gen<00:01:11.640> versions<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.180> GTA<00:01:12.600> 5<00:01:12.899> on<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
current gen versions of GTA 5 on the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.260 
current gen versions of GTA 5 on the
Xbox<00:01:13.619> one<00:01:13.829> and<00:01:14.009> the<00:01:14.219> PlayStation<00:01:14.490> 4<00:01:14.939> where

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
Xbox one and the PlayStation 4 where

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.730 
Xbox one and the PlayStation 4 where
they<00:01:15.360> could<00:01:15.509> make<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.810> crashes<00:01:16.200> look<00:01:16.439> more

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
they could make the crashes look more

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.770 
they could make the crashes look more
realistic<00:01:17.130> whereas<00:01:17.700> if<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.149> actually<00:01:18.299> crash

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
realistic whereas if you actually crash

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.300 
realistic whereas if you actually crash
into<00:01:19.079> a<00:01:19.110> wall<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.710> little<00:01:19.920> bit<00:01:20.070> maybe

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
into a wall just a little bit maybe

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.160 
into a wall just a little bit maybe
you'll<00:01:20.490> get<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.670> dent<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.180> your<00:01:21.210> car<00:01:21.570> or<00:01:21.899> your

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
you'll get a dent in your car or your

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.109 
you'll get a dent in your car or your
window<00:01:22.619> screen<00:01:22.920> or<00:01:23.100> your<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> marker<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.000> what

we call the side mirrors will actually
get<00:01:26.100> knocked<00:01:26.369> off<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:27.149> making<00:01:27.450> your<00:01:27.539> crashes

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
them to be able to be destroyed so I

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.990 
them to be able to be destroyed so I
think<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.259> would<00:02:10.410> be<00:02:10.440> awesome<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.039> GTA<00:02:11.730> san

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
think this would be awesome in GTA san

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.490 
think this would be awesome in GTA san
andreas<00:02:12.030> we<00:02:12.510> could<00:02:12.660> actually<00:02:12.780> hijack<00:02:13.140> the

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
andreas we could actually hijack the

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.530 
andreas we could actually hijack the
train<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:13.920> drive<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.849> I<00:02:14.879> thought<00:02:15.269> that<00:02:15.300> was

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
train and drive that I thought that was

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.509 
train and drive that I thought that was
awesome<00:02:15.690> why<00:02:16.050> we<00:02:16.230> can't<00:02:16.440> have<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:16.739> in<00:02:16.920> GTA<00:02:17.280> 5

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
awesome why we can't have this in GTA 5

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:18.910 
awesome why we can't have this in GTA 5
again<00:02:17.909> I<00:02:17.940> don't<00:02:18.090> know<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.480> think

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
again I don't know I think

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.800 
again I don't know I think
something<00:02:19.340> easy<00:02:19.550> to<00:02:19.700> do<00:02:19.910> because<00:02:20.270> we<00:02:20.510> can<00:02:20.660> only

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
something easy to do because we can only

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.360 
something easy to do because we can only
go<00:02:20.990> forward<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:21.590> backwards<00:02:22.040> there's<00:02:22.220> not

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
go forward and backwards there's not

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.080 
go forward and backwards there's not
much<00:02:22.520> to<00:02:22.760> it

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
much to it

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.729 
much to it
so<00:02:23.390> hopefully<00:02:23.599> they<00:02:23.840> can<00:02:23.989> add<00:02:24.140> this<00:02:24.319> into<00:02:24.590> the

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
so hopefully they can add this into the

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.100 
so hopefully they can add this into the
next-gen<00:02:25.250> versions<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:25.880> also<00:02:26.270> have<00:02:26.720> them<00:02:26.930> to

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
next-gen versions and also have them to

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.360 
next-gen versions and also have them to
be<00:02:27.200> able<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.440> be<00:02:27.620> destroyed<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:28.220> I<00:02:28.250> think

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
be able to be destroyed so I think

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.490 
be able to be destroyed so I think
putting<00:02:29.030> some<00:02:29.270> c4<00:02:29.510> sticky<00:02:30.080> bumps<00:02:30.319> on<00:02:30.410> the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
putting some c4 sticky bumps on the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.530 
putting some c4 sticky bumps on the
truck<00:02:30.739> making<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.520> train<00:02:31.760> get<00:02:31.910> derailed<00:02:32.270> I

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
truck making the train get derailed I

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.640 
truck making the train get derailed I
think<00:02:32.900> that<00:02:32.989> would<00:02:33.080> be<00:02:33.110> awesome<00:02:33.410> that<00:02:33.530> could

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
think that would be awesome that could

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.590 
think that would be awesome that could
probably<00:02:33.770> make<00:02:34.010> some<00:02:34.190> good<00:02:34.370> GTA<00:02:34.819> 5<00:02:35.120> movies

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
probably make some good GTA 5 movies

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.570 
probably make some good GTA 5 movies

we've<00:02:44.630> got<00:02:44.950> gta5<00:02:45.950> for<00:02:46.190> me<00:02:46.280> is<00:02:46.489> too<00:02:46.940> realistic

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
sure what it was actually called but if

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.450 
sure what it was actually called but if
they<00:04:35.169> could<00:04:35.319> add<00:04:35.500> that<00:04:35.710> into<00:04:35.919> US<00:04:36.159> Centers

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460

customs for the gang to the DLC that

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.790 
customs for the gang to the DLC that
would<00:04:38.259> be<00:04:38.349> awesome

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
would be awesome

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.279 
would be awesome
and<00:04:39.060> also<00:04:40.060> some<00:04:40.300> other<00:04:40.419> stuff<00:04:40.780> is<00:04:40.960> having<00:04:41.199> the

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
and also some other stuff is having the

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.110 
and also some other stuff is having the
ability<00:04:41.500> to<00:04:41.740> tell<00:04:42.099> your<00:04:42.310> gun<00:04:42.580> on<00:04:42.729> the<00:04:42.879> side

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
ability to tell your gun on the side

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.850 
ability to tell your gun on the side
again<00:04:43.270> like<00:04:43.569> gangsters<00:04:44.050> do<00:04:44.199> I<00:04:44.409> don't<00:04:44.740> know<00:04:44.800> if

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
again like gangsters do I don't know if

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.439 
again like gangsters do I don't know if
that<00:04:45.069> they<00:04:45.370> could<00:04:45.580> do<00:04:45.759> that<00:04:45.789> maybe<00:04:46.120> in<00:04:46.330> the

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
that they could do that maybe in the

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.240 
that they could do that maybe in the
next-gen<00:04:46.840> versions<00:04:47.289> but<00:04:47.710> I<00:04:47.740> think<00:04:48.039> that<00:04:48.159> have

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
next-gen versions but I think that have

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.830 
next-gen versions but I think that have
it<00:04:48.340> all<00:04:48.460> be<00:04:48.699> awesome<00:04:49.150> so<00:04:49.180> that's<00:04:49.449> it<00:04:49.659> for<00:04:49.750> this
