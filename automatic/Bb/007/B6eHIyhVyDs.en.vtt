00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.770
 so hello in this video too 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.500
 Genetic engineering is about the 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.800
 pcr that the abbreviation for polymerase 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.690
 chain reaction the polymerase is a 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.130
 Enzyme which dna can copy 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.820
 chain reaction means it is always so 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.560
 and applied again and again 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.410
 The goal of this procedure, it is therefore 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.260
 finally dna or dna fragments too 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.279
 multiply to multiply 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.240
 to make it better later 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.100
 can analyze 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.630
 background, for example, at one 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.520
 crime finds somewhere dna traces 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.210
 blood traces 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.100
 then there are, as a rule, only individual 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.320
 maybe DNA fragments in it very little 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.399
 dna that you could not study so 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.390
 you have to multiply that 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.480
 so you can find out who this 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.730
 Maybe dna is assigned and then 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.399
 if necessary , convict the offender 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.280
 but also in others in other respects 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.110
 For example, if you now the dna 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.780
 sequence then wants to analyze 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.010
 one holds many many dna fragments and 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.229
 You can do that with this one 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.930
 Here, therefore, the increase of 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.560
 dna the way it works is ultimately 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.020
 it one 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.970
 as I said a one chain-reaction 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.000
 procedure which I always picks up but 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:30.060
 which runs three steps like that 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:35.250
 step number one the dna you 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:40.799
 that's the rio will be at 95 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:47.640
 Grad celsius melted into her 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:49.110
 severely single decomposed and that is what I have 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.360
 now for example found that lasts 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.180
 about two minutes so right now 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.079
 even after a time overview has 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:04.020
 so the first step 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:06.270
 the second step will be here now 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.470
 sample cooled so I have here now 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:17.310
 again the one after the severely strict 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:20.280
 so cool to 50 degrees celsius and 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:28.470
 In addition, here you have to 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:33.230
 other color add primer 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.820
 which then each at the ends of the 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.730
 have to put the single string two 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.780
 So different types are namely 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.730
 also over two different colors 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.730
 to make it clear that way 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.550
 because we have other bases here 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.230
 sequence on this page too 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.750
 complement from then we need 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.510
 correspondingly complementary dreams like that 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.880
 So therefore the prices to cool itself 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.260
 store but you have to be relatively quick 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.850
 then cool it down when you feel it slow 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.230
 cools down too attach 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.320
 circumvent this double strict again 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.930
 50 degrees I have found there 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.200
 and supposedly you can do that in one and a half 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:16.220
 Minutes create therefore subordinate 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.900
 here as I said the primer than 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.380
 next as third and last step 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.940
 Now you make the following one loves to 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:30.230
 So first of all it will be all 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:33.400
 again striker there it is heated again 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.400
 to 70 degrees 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:45.280
 here are the prices and now we give 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:52.450
 Add as the lane not yet take 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.450
 a polymerase that is the so-called 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:02.570
 Polymerase Tack is the abbreviation or 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.980
 is derived from a heat-loving 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.090
 Bacteria therma aqua ticos is the 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.450
 scientific name of the bacterium 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.540
 and this bacterium lives in hot 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.280
 water sources and accordingly 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.169
 these enzymes are also in the 70th 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.419
 grad still work great and 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.419
 who are these polymerase molecules sitting 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:26.570
 Of course here now the great and 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.200
 synthesize the missing second 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.180
 strand 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:36.830
 Of course you can only do that when I am 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:40.669
 So before also nucleotides into the medium 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:45.550
 have given then attach here 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:51.250
 and then here is the second strand 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:54.520
 synonymous yes synthesized to how long it takes 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.500
 I do not believe that exact number 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.480
 Did not find out if we did that 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.430
 depending on the length of the DNA fragments 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.720
 Imagine short fragments 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.990
 can be filled up faster than 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:11.260
 long fragments I found there 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:16.420
 that is, for every 500 nucleotides so 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.560
 base pair 30 seconds needed there must 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.990
 You can estimate how big the 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.050
 But fragments are so if we are now 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.970
 just say generous, we say 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.730
 because here's three and a half summers 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:31.630
 six and a half minutes then we would have 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:34.090
 at least 3500 base pairs would then be the 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.430
 ten minutes for a run so in 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:40.690
 ten minutes I would have from a dna 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.280
 made two dna strands and what 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.780
 one does now one is leaves one this one 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.910
 process again run from the front 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.460
 So again increase temperature to 95 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.550
 grad the double strict ones dissolve 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.860
 again great for nucleotide tact 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.460
 Polymerase company after one 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:03.250
 second pass instead of 24 and so on 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:09.130
 after the next pass 816 and so on 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:12.300
 continue dna fragments and you can 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:14.070
 then let's see that we are here again 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:20.950
 split off 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:24.040
 So 20 to 50 passes depending on how 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:27.160
 many dna you need and then you have 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:29.590
 already a lot after 20 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.960
 go through if every run ten 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.280
 minutes take the 200 minutes that are 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:38.560
 a little over three hours 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:41.890
 If you had a million dna strands after 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:46.360
 21 out of two million and so on 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:49.510
 50 passes is a number 10 is high 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.850
 not 13 14 so there you have a lot 

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.710
 many dna strands depending on how much 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.850
 you need it more often at the moment 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.210
 run through 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:01.050
 that is basically the principle now 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:03.509
 and finally, for example, there is a concept 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:06.090
 for you again to look up in the 

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:09.000
 germersheim realized that his device 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:11.639
 what exactly these three functions 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.840
 one after the other processes automatically and 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:17.970
 then thermo starts again from the beginning 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.560
 grashei dresses from the cycle and heat 

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:23.520
 because here are different temperatures 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.919
 So that would be needed 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.080
 understood again to research 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:32.180
 to look there is still missing 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.180
 to be able to make a better picture about it 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.150
 but basically that is that 

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.800
 Perhaps important too 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.840
 keep in mind that these numbers are like them here 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:42.690
 are only approximate values 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.849
 so if you look 195 x 7 90 or 

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:47.490
 92 degrees then two minutes are three 

00:07:44.849 --> 00:07:49.770
 minutes two and a half yes but I think 

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:52.620
 You should cling to that here 

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:54.090
 Just pay as an example but then 

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.310
 you get a certain feeling for it 

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:58.830
 and I also think in a klausur or 

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:00.599
 so it does not matter if 695 or 94 

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.729
 degrees are or two minutes or 

00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:05.460
 two and a half is crucial only that 

00:08:02.729 --> 00:08:08.070
 that does not expire at ten degrees and also 

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:10.860
 not a pass anyway 20 

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:13.770
 lasts for hours and simply guided 

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:16.250
 Well, that's about it and currently you 

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.250
 in there again
