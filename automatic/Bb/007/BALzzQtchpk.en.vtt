now<00:00:02.470> there<00:00:02.620> is<00:00:02.710> one<00:00:02.740> example<00:00:03.070> of<00:00:03.489> something

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:04.029 
now there is one example of something

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:05.460 
now there is one example of something
that<00:00:04.210> when<00:00:04.480> you<00:00:04.600> see<00:00:04.810> it<00:00:04.900> you<00:00:05.020> can<00:00:05.140> immediately

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:05.470 
that when you see it you can immediately

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.110 
that when you see it you can immediately
see<00:00:05.920> how<00:00:05.950> to<00:00:06.100> factor<00:00:06.310> it<00:00:06.580> and<00:00:06.670> I<00:00:06.730> want<00:00:06.910> to<00:00:06.970> tell

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.120 
see how to factor it and I want to tell

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.160 
see how to factor it and I want to tell
you<00:00:07.210> about<00:00:07.270> it<00:00:07.450> right<00:00:07.480> now<00:00:07.600> because<00:00:07.870> this<00:00:08.019> one

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.170 
you about it right now because this one

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.259 
you about it right now because this one
is<00:00:08.290> just<00:00:08.469> so<00:00:08.620> great<00:00:08.980> that<00:00:09.340> you<00:00:09.549> see<00:00:09.790> it<00:00:09.880> tuned

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:10.269 
is just so great that you see it tuned

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:12.119 
is just so great that you see it tuned
you<00:00:10.480> got<00:00:10.629> to<00:00:10.749> use<00:00:10.870> it<00:00:10.900> and<00:00:11.169> that<00:00:11.740> is<00:00:11.799> if<00:00:12.039> you

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:12.129 
you got to use it and that is if you

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.009 
you got to use it and that is if you
have<00:00:12.249> the<00:00:12.400> difference<00:00:12.940> of<00:00:13.209> two<00:00:13.990> perfect

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
have the difference of two perfect

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.740 
have the difference of two perfect
squares<00:00:14.849> let<00:00:15.849> me<00:00:15.909> show<00:00:16.059> it<00:00:16.090> to<00:00:16.240> you<00:00:16.330> first<00:00:16.510> in

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 
squares let me show it to you first in

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.120 
squares let me show it to you first in
general<00:00:17.080> then<00:00:17.230> I<00:00:17.289> look<00:00:17.410> at<00:00:17.500> some<00:00:17.650> specifics

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
general then I look at some specifics

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.429 
general then I look at some specifics
and<00:00:18.220> you<00:00:18.310> can<00:00:18.400> see<00:00:18.550> how<00:00:18.640> it<00:00:18.730> goes<00:00:19.259> suppose<00:00:20.259> I

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
and you can see how it goes suppose I

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.980 
and you can see how it goes suppose I
have<00:00:20.590> a<00:00:20.769> squared<00:00:21.359> minus<00:00:22.359> B<00:00:22.900> squared<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:25.750> kind

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
have a squared minus B squared this kind

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.509 
have a squared minus B squared this kind
of<00:00:26.050> animal<00:00:26.289> can<00:00:26.500> always<00:00:26.769> be<00:00:26.919> factored<00:00:27.339> into

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 
of animal can always be factored into

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.019 
of animal can always be factored into
two<00:00:27.759> factors<00:00:28.029> in<00:00:28.240> a<00:00:28.480> very<00:00:28.779> very<00:00:29.050> easy<00:00:29.109> way

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
two factors in a very very easy way

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.550 
two factors in a very very easy way
let's<00:00:31.029> try<00:00:31.210> to<00:00:31.269> do<00:00:31.419> it<00:00:31.599> and<00:00:31.779> see<00:00:32.349> what<00:00:32.470> the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560 
let's try to do it and see what the

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.720 
let's try to do it and see what the
factors<00:00:32.829> are<00:00:32.950> and<00:00:33.190> see<00:00:33.340> that<00:00:33.490> it's<00:00:33.610> always

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
factors are and see that it's always

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.850 
factors are and see that it's always
going<00:00:33.850> to<00:00:33.940> work<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.900> a<00:00:34.930> squared<00:00:35.440> okay<00:00:35.740> I'm

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
going to work the a squared okay I'm

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.450 
going to work the a squared okay I'm
going<00:00:35.980> to<00:00:36.040> try<00:00:36.190> a<00:00:36.220> a<00:00:37.500> now<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:38.860> negative<00:00:39.040> sign

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
going to try a a now the negative sign

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.830 
going to try a a now the negative sign
tells<00:00:39.880> me<00:00:40.090> that<00:00:40.240> these<00:00:40.360> are<00:00:40.420> going<00:00:40.600> to<00:00:40.660> have

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
tells me that these are going to have

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.750 
tells me that these are going to have
opposite<00:00:41.590> signs<00:00:41.860> here<00:00:42.130> because<00:00:42.310> the<00:00:42.400> product

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
opposite signs here because the product

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.340 
opposite signs here because the product
has<00:00:42.880> to<00:00:42.910> be<00:00:43.030> negative<00:00:43.420> and<00:00:43.510> again<00:00:43.990> since<00:00:44.200> these

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
has to be negative and again since these

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.560 
has to be negative and again since these
are<00:00:44.500> the<00:00:44.560> same<00:00:44.950> I<00:00:45.280> can<00:00:45.820> put<00:00:46.120> them<00:00:46.240> any<00:00:46.390> way<00:00:46.540> I

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
are the same I can put them any way I

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.870 
are the same I can put them any way I
want<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:49.290> the<00:00:50.290> the<00:00:50.980> end<00:00:51.130> result<00:00:51.520> the<00:00:51.760> end

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
want and the the end result the end

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.430 
want and the the end result the end
product<00:00:52.240> has<00:00:52.360> to<00:00:52.390> be<00:00:52.540> a<00:00:52.630> minus<00:00:52.960> B<00:00:53.140> squared

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
product has to be a minus B squared

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.430 
product has to be a minus B squared
slightly<00:00:53.740> put<00:00:53.860> it<00:00:53.950> B<00:00:54.010> in<00:00:54.130> a<00:00:54.190> B<00:00:54.310> in<00:00:54.430> here<00:00:55.440> and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
slightly put it B in a B in here and

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.200 
slightly put it B in a B in here and
let's<00:00:57.040> check<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:57.520> see<00:00:57.610> what<00:00:57.730> happens<00:00:58.030> a

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
let's check and see what happens a

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.790 
let's check and see what happens a
squared<00:00:58.780> plus<00:00:59.650> a<00:00:59.860> B<00:01:00.300> minus<00:01:01.300> a<00:01:01.450> B<00:01:01.780> note<00:01:02.560> those

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
squared plus a B minus a B note those

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.859 
squared plus a B minus a B note those
middle<00:01:03.130> terms<00:01:03.310> annihilate<00:01:03.820> themselves<00:01:04.000> and<00:01:04.509> I

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
middle terms annihilate themselves and I

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.470 
middle terms annihilate themselves and I
am<00:01:04.989> left<00:01:05.199> with<00:01:05.290> just<00:01:05.530> a<00:01:05.680> minus<00:01:06.040> B<00:01:06.220> squared<00:01:06.580> so

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
am left with just a minus B squared so

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.210 
am left with just a minus B squared so
in<00:01:07.570> fact<00:01:07.750> this<00:01:07.960> is<00:01:08.020> the<00:01:08.290> way<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.440> always<00:01:08.950> factor

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
in fact this is the way to always factor

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.500 
in fact this is the way to always factor
the<00:01:09.550> difference<00:01:09.700> of<00:01:10.770> two<00:01:11.770> perfect<00:01:11.800> squares

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
the difference of two perfect squares

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.360 
the difference of two perfect squares
it's<00:01:13.510> great<00:01:13.810> so<00:01:14.290> whenever<00:01:14.440> you<00:01:14.680> see<00:01:14.710> the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
it's great so whenever you see the

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.060 
it's great so whenever you see the
difference<00:01:15.790> of<00:01:15.880> two<00:01:15.970> perfect<00:01:16.000> squares<00:01:17.070> it's

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
difference of two perfect squares it's

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.660 
difference of two perfect squares it's

look<00:01:19.030> x<00:01:19.750> squared<00:01:20.760> minus<00:01:21.760> four<00:01:22.360> notice<00:01:23.230> that's

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
look x squared minus four notice that's

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.870 
look x squared minus four notice that's
the<00:01:23.470> difference<00:01:24.010> of<00:01:24.159> two<00:01:24.370> perfect<00:01:24.400> squares

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
the difference of two perfect squares

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.840 
the difference of two perfect squares
namely<00:01:25.570> x<00:01:26.070> squared<00:01:27.070> and<00:01:27.310> 2<00:01:28.230> squared<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.729> what

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
namely x squared and 2 squared so what

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.149 
namely x squared and 2 squared so what
this<00:01:30.940> equals<00:01:31.240> is<00:01:31.479> X<00:01:31.930> plus<00:01:32.740> two<00:01:33.720> X<00:01:34.720> minus<00:01:35.200> two<00:01:35.740> I

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
this equals is X plus two X minus two I

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.460 
this equals is X plus two X minus two I

check x squared 2x minus 2x cancel minus
four<00:01:42.790> now<00:01:43.600> a<00:01:43.630> great<00:01:44.050> mistake<00:01:44.350> by<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.530> way

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
four now a great mistake by the way

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.770 
four now a great mistake by the way
would<00:01:45.400> be<00:01:45.549> to<00:01:45.670> put<00:01:45.880> a<00:01:45.909> plus<00:01:46.240> 4<00:01:46.540> and<00:01:46.690> a<00:01:46.750> minus

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
would be to put a plus 4 and a minus

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.180 
would be to put a plus 4 and a minus
four<00:01:47.260> here<00:01:47.530> getting<00:01:47.920> a<00:01:47.950> little<00:01:48.040> bit

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
four here getting a little bit

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.410 
four here getting a little bit
over-ambitious<00:01:48.370> but<00:01:48.790> remember<00:01:49.060> you<00:01:49.180> have<00:01:49.299> to

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
over-ambitious but remember you have to

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.810 
over-ambitious but remember you have to
put<00:01:49.570> in<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:50.170> actual<00:01:50.350> values<00:01:50.710> whose<00:01:51.220> products

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
it's going to lend itself nicely to this

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.200 
it's going to lend itself nicely to this
method<00:01:59.970> but<00:02:00.970> it<00:02:01.119> will<00:02:01.530> 16<00:02:02.530> x<00:02:02.950> squared<00:02:03.070> minus<00:02:03.820> 81

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
method but it will 16 x squared minus 81

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.800 
method but it will 16 x squared minus 81
Y<00:02:05.140> to<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.470> fourth<00:02:06.299> maybe<00:02:07.299> doesn't<00:02:07.600> look<00:02:07.690> like

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
Y to the fourth maybe doesn't look like

fact if it's easy for easier for you you

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:15.780 
fact if it's easy for easier for you you
might<00:02:15.310> want<00:02:15.430> actually

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
might want actually

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.449 
might want actually
those<00:02:16.150> perfect<00:02:16.510> squares<00:02:17.099> this<00:02:18.099> is<00:02:18.250> going<00:02:18.400> to

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
those perfect squares this is going to

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.459 
those perfect squares this is going to
be<00:02:18.549> something<00:02:18.879> squared<00:02:19.870> what<00:02:20.230> would<00:02:20.349> it<00:02:20.439> be

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:20.469 
be something squared what would it be

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.130 
be something squared what would it be
well<00:02:20.950> here<00:02:21.159> I<00:02:21.189> need<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.430> four<00:02:21.819> and<00:02:22.000> here<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:22.930> need

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
well here I need a four and here I need

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.550 
well here I need a four and here I need
an<00:02:23.230> X<00:02:23.549> notice<00:02:24.549> that<00:02:24.730> 4x<00:02:25.030> squared<00:02:25.569> is<00:02:25.780> 16x

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
an X notice that 4x squared is 16x

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.289 
an X notice that 4x squared is 16x
squared

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
squared

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.849 
squared
-<00:02:28.409> now<00:02:29.409> what<00:02:29.590> kind<00:02:29.769> of<00:02:29.859> square<00:02:30.219> is<00:02:30.370> this<00:02:30.519> thing

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
- now what kind of square is this thing

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.759 
- now what kind of square is this thing
well<00:02:32.859> that<00:02:33.340> would<00:02:33.430> be<00:02:33.489> nine<00:02:33.790> squared

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
well that would be nine squared

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.349 
well that would be nine squared
multiplied<00:02:35.769> by<00:02:35.920> y<00:02:37.200> squared<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:39.120> notice<00:02:40.120> that

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
multiplied by y squared and notice that

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.240 
multiplied by y squared and notice that
if<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.569> actually<00:02:40.840> square<00:02:41.470> this<00:02:41.680> thing<00:02:41.920> I<00:02:42.099> get

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
if you actually square this thing I get

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.089 
if you actually square this thing I get
an<00:02:42.400> 81<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.750> Y<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.079> fourth<00:02:44.349> so<00:02:44.769> this<00:02:44.920> really

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
an 81 and Y to the fourth so this really

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.379 
an 81 and Y to the fourth so this really
is<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.400> difference<00:02:45.549> of<00:02:45.909> two<00:02:46.030> perfect<00:02:46.060> squares

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:46.389 
is the difference of two perfect squares

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.420 
is the difference of two perfect squares
and<00:02:46.780> these<00:02:47.230> are<00:02:47.439> the<00:02:47.530> values<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.980> are<00:02:48.280> going

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
and these are the values that are going

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.819 
and these are the values that are going
to<00:02:48.519> appear<00:02:48.909> inside<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:50.019> the<00:02:50.349> factorization

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829 
to appear inside the the factorization

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.339 
to appear inside the the factorization
so<00:02:51.519> in<00:02:51.639> fact<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.909> factorization<00:02:52.299> would<00:02:53.170> look

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
so in fact the factorization would look

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.670 
so in fact the factorization would look
like<00:02:53.500> this<00:02:54.659> it<00:02:55.659> would<00:02:55.840> look<00:02:55.930> like<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.439> first

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
like this it would look like the first

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.800 
like this it would look like the first
term<00:02:57.220> in<00:02:57.519> the<00:02:58.239> square<00:02:58.359> in<00:02:58.780> both<00:02:59.560> places<00:02:59.829> and

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
term in the square in both places and

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.559 
term in the square in both places and
then<00:03:01.810> plus<00:03:02.109> or<00:03:02.439> minus<00:03:03.069> and<00:03:03.340> then<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.329> last

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
then plus or minus and then the last

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.000 
then plus or minus and then the last
term<00:03:04.959> notice<00:03:05.319> I'm<00:03:05.439> just<00:03:05.470> picking<00:03:05.739> off<00:03:05.859> the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
term notice I'm just picking off the

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.349 
term notice I'm just picking off the
term<00:03:06.159> not<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.400> square<00:03:06.700> part<00:03:06.939> just<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.150> term

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
term not the square part just the term

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:08.520 
term not the square part just the term
now<00:03:07.480> this<00:03:07.599> has<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.750> little<00:03:07.989> square<00:03:08.139> inside<00:03:08.409> of

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
now this has a little square inside of

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.990 
now this has a little square inside of
it<00:03:08.620> remember<00:03:09.099> just<00:03:09.400> thinking<00:03:09.489> about<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.819> as<00:03:09.970> a

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
it remember just thinking about it as a

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.599 
it remember just thinking about it as a
something<00:03:10.450> squared<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:12.959> 9y<00:03:13.959> squared<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:15.489> the

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
something squared so 9y squared and the

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.750 
something squared so 9y squared and the
minus<00:03:15.970> 9y<00:03:16.269> squared<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:18.099> can<00:03:18.250> check<00:03:18.489> again

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
minus 9y squared and you can check again

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.679 
minus 9y squared and you can check again
to<00:03:18.879> make<00:03:19.030> sure<00:03:19.180> that<00:03:19.359> you're<00:03:19.480> on<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.569> right

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:19.689 
to make sure that you're on the right

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:21.240 
to make sure that you're on the right
track<00:03:19.840> multiply<00:03:20.560> this<00:03:20.620> out<00:03:20.799> this<00:03:21.040> would<00:03:21.159> be

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
track multiply this out this would be

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.219 
track multiply this out this would be
16x<00:03:21.849> squared<00:03:21.930> inside<00:03:22.930> term<00:03:23.290> would<00:03:23.709> be<00:03:23.859> 36<00:03:25.229> XY

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:26.229 
16x squared inside term would be 36 XY

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:28.920 
16x squared inside term would be 36 XY
squared<00:03:26.709> but<00:03:27.129> then<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.280> have<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.430> minus<00:03:27.489> 36<00:03:28.479> XY

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
squared but then I have a minus 36 XY

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.539 
squared but then I have a minus 36 XY
squared<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:29.379> they<00:03:29.470> cancel<00:03:29.919> and<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.370> last

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
squared so they cancel and the last

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.819 
squared so they cancel and the last
times<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.879> last<00:03:31.000> is<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.239> minus<00:03:31.569> 81<00:03:32.019> y<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.680> the

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
times the last is a minus 81 y to the

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.500 
times the last is a minus 81 y to the
fourth<00:03:33.099> so<00:03:33.430> in<00:03:33.519> fact<00:03:33.669> this<00:03:34.060> gives<00:03:34.299> me<00:03:34.389> exactly

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
fourth so in fact this gives me exactly

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.390 
fourth so in fact this gives me exactly
this<00:03:34.840> in<00:03:34.959> fact<00:03:35.199> is<00:03:35.290> quite<00:03:35.440> nicely<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:36.069> so

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
this in fact is quite nicely and so

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.270 
this in fact is quite nicely and so
there<00:03:37.060> you<00:03:37.090> have<00:03:37.209> it<00:03:37.419> now<00:03:38.099> you<00:03:39.099> might<00:03:39.250> be

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
there you have it now you might be

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.559 
there you have it now you might be
saying<00:03:39.579> hey<00:03:40.030> this<00:03:40.180> is<00:03:40.299> great

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
saying hey this is great

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.550 
saying hey this is great
does<00:03:41.019> it<00:03:41.139> also<00:03:41.260> work<00:03:41.560> when<00:03:41.709> you<00:03:41.769> have<00:03:41.829> a<00:03:41.919> plus

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
does it also work when you have a plus

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.219 
does it also work when you have a plus
the<00:03:44.560> answer<00:03:44.799> is<00:03:44.919> no<00:03:46.049> sorry

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:47.229 
the answer is no sorry

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:50.219 
the answer is no sorry
but<00:03:47.859> in<00:03:47.949> fact<00:03:48.159> if<00:03:48.340> you<00:03:48.459> have<00:03:48.639> the<00:03:48.879> sum<00:03:49.329> of<00:03:49.659> two

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:50.229 
but in fact if you have the sum of two

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.789 
but in fact if you have the sum of two
perfect<00:03:50.409> squares<00:03:50.669> this<00:03:51.669> kind<00:03:51.909> of<00:03:51.970> method<00:03:52.799> not

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
perfect squares this kind of method not

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.680 
perfect squares this kind of method not
going<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.099> cut<00:03:54.250> it<00:03:54.400> so<00:03:54.790> remember<00:03:55.150> the

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
going to cut it so remember the

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.689 
going to cut it so remember the
difference<00:03:56.109> of<00:03:56.229> two<00:03:56.349> perfect<00:03:56.379> squares<00:03:56.799> happy

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
difference of two perfect squares happy

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.219 
difference of two perfect squares happy
the<00:03:58.419> sum<00:03:58.720> of<00:03:58.900> two<00:03:59.139> perfect<00:03:59.290> squares<00:03:59.970> not<00:04:00.970> good

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:01.229 
the sum of two perfect squares not good

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:03.599 
the sum of two perfect squares not good
anyway<00:04:02.229> I<00:04:02.319> don't<00:04:02.500> leave<00:04:02.769> on<00:04:02.859> negative<00:04:03.159> note<00:04:03.280> so

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
anyway I don't leave on negative note so

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:04.800 
anyway I don't leave on negative note so
let's<00:04:03.760> just<00:04:03.879> recap<00:04:04.030> that<00:04:04.510> when<00:04:04.659> your<00:04:04.750> the

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
let's just recap that when your the

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.909 
let's just recap that when your the
difference<00:04:04.870> two<00:04:05.109> perfect<00:04:05.349> squares<00:04:05.560> they

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919 
difference two perfect squares they

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.099 
difference two perfect squares they
factor<00:04:06.340> with<00:04:06.760> almost<00:04:07.030> no<00:04:07.239> thought<00:04:07.449> at<00:04:07.540> all<00:04:07.629> so

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
factor with almost no thought at all so

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:12.269 
factor with almost no thought at all so
that<00:04:08.349> is<00:04:08.470> a<00:04:08.500> happy<00:04:08.829> day<00:04:09.030> see<00:04:10.030> you<00:04:10.090> soon
