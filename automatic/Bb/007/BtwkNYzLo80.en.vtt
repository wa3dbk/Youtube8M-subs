can see that this quest is level four

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.629 
can see that this quest is level four
and<00:00:12.990> it's<00:00:13.110> lowered<00:00:13.500> itself<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.099> trivial

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
and it's lowered itself to trivial

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.240 
and it's lowered itself to trivial
difficulty<00:00:15.210> for<00:00:15.450> me<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.859> that's<00:00:16.859> because<00:00:17.039> I

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
difficulty for me and that's because I

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.040 
difficulty for me and that's because I
actually<00:00:17.670> skipped<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.390> because<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.690> couldn't

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
actually skipped it because I couldn't

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.140 
actually skipped it because I couldn't
figure<00:00:19.230> out<00:00:19.380> how<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.650> do<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.279> was<00:00:20.730> standing

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
figure out how to do it I was standing

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.620 
figure out how to do it I was standing
here<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.480> what<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.720> thought<00:00:22.020> was<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:23.510> you<00:00:24.510> know

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
here on what I thought was the you know

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.450 
here on what I thought was the you know
quest<00:00:24.990> objective<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.010> couldn't<00:00:26.340> figure

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
quest objective but I couldn't figure

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.400 
quest objective but I couldn't figure
out<00:00:26.580> where<00:00:26.849> these<00:00:27.060> cameras<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.840> safeword

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
out where these cameras and safeword

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.130 
out where these cameras and safeword
that<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.710> was<00:00:28.859> supposed<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.340> be<00:00:29.869> blowing<00:00:30.869> up

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
that I was supposed to be blowing up

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.440 
that I was supposed to be blowing up
however<00:00:32.009> now<00:00:32.309> I've<00:00:32.489> actually<00:00:32.730> figured<00:00:33.239> that

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
however now I've actually figured that

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.479 
however now I've actually figured that
out<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.110> that's<00:00:34.290> why<00:00:34.500> none<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.070> these<00:00:35.250> guys<00:00:35.430> can

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
out so that's why none of these guys can

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.000 
out so that's why none of these guys can
really<00:00:35.940> do<00:00:36.030> too<00:00:36.270> much<00:00:36.390> damage<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.840> me<00:00:37.110> here<00:00:37.440> but

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
really do too much damage to me here but

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.010 
really do too much damage to me here but
you're<00:00:38.160> supposed<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.610> come<00:00:38.879> down<00:00:38.910> here<00:00:39.809> and

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
you're supposed to come down here and

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.889 
you're supposed to come down here and
open<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:42.030> will<00:00:42.270> allow<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.719> get

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
that's why I wasn't getting rid of this

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.750 
that's why I wasn't getting rid of this
crappy<00:02:14.260> shield<00:02:14.709> that<00:02:14.890> I<00:02:14.950> had<00:02:15.220> I'll<00:02:15.459> go<00:02:15.640> ahead

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
it has a huge recharge delay and maybe

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.840

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
was trying to figure out where these

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.630 
was trying to figure out where these
cameras<00:02:57.760> were<00:02:58.080> from<00:02:59.080> up<00:02:59.290> here<00:02:59.709> you<00:03:00.250> know<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.370> was

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640
