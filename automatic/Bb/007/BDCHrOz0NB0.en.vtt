 [Music] 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.980
 then he had a quite training is 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.990
 very technical actually because that 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.710
 I formed a photography school for 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.680
 us and let's say in fact I started to 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.780
 photograph with plate camera 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.300
 as the start I had a plate camera 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.600
 as well 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.280
 stop having a moment 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.070
 let's say that it metabolizes everything 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.430
 I needed to know about the cameras and 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.200
 then as I forgot to forget me in 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.090
 the sense of good that I already have it 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.160
 is how to drive a car, let's say no 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.309
 I think much more our fondness with 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.370
 no camera and I'm not very attached to 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.800
 the things the subjects mean and 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.340
 I'm not very fetishist either 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.170
 let's say really for me the camera is 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.540
 an appliance is very different from 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.580
 that's the rule of ac45 which is a 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.620
 rectangle not exactly not another 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.930
 rectangular exactly like 36 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.970
 let's say I handled a lot of time with 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.000
 the 35 millimeters that is like what else 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:33.160
 looks like the eye in terms of dynamics 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.960
 that has the unit is 601 is this 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.370
 digital this of sanÃ¡ the analog ones 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.880
 exactly 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:44.410
 and good and then two years ago I passed 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.020
 to the 645 family which is like here 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.510
 I found something that synthesizes enough 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.840
 let's say possible to the medium format with 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.240
 the maneuverability of the 35 too 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.180
 has photometer has motor works with 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.960
 tripod changed work sometimes with 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.659
 tripod and sometimes not 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.130
 sometimes in general I'm tending to 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.630
 work with kind of always because 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.869
 I'm making very still images 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.330
 I'm doing a new series with 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.560
 study flashes I'm like some 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.270
 way I know I'm doing some 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.150
 images a bit more try to synthesize 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.190
 a little bit everything I did always in 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.170
 more pretentious images but how many 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.060
 years so you're doing this kind of 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.989
 photograph a still geography of 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:30.440
 good interiors really always the 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.720
 interiors already boyata 20 years ago others 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.430
 saw the same let's say I come from looking for 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.790
 new ways of with new 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.790
 approximations 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:47.190
 this deal to absorb all the 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:49.580
 influences I try to repay myself in a 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.580
 sense 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:03:16.560
 Recycle 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:16.560
 [Music] 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:27.909
 it's very expensive it costs a lot of money 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.700
 this the most expensive is the production as 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:33.400
 expensive is the copy try the scans 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.120
 try the extensions that the whale 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.230
 copy mounted in cintra framing the and 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:50.979
 then do something with that because yes no 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:50.979
