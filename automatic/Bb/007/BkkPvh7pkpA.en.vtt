 the professional cast will provide a 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.670

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.939
 of the basic categories 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:41.460
 It's a new thing for me, it's never me. 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.010
 I had participated in one single but I 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.050
 I think it 's cool because when I was 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.330
 when I was their age I felt 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.710
 need to understand better 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:54.239
 things know things because they are 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.190
 starting in soccer, right? 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.629
 despite being less 16 and 17 years but 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.480
 still did not start to say they did not arrive 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.040
 professional I have been through many 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.860
 things that have passed the questions that 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.619
 80 same questions to him asking if 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.570
 We already thought about stopping suddenly. 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.149
 passes on the head of the boy of 15 years he 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.290
 You think you're feeling a time to stop and 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.440
 He thinks it's something from another world. 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:24.200
 but this is normal happens everyone and 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.200
 Passes, but it was so cool. 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.260
 it was a very very good experience 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.110
 very tasty having gone through that 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.980
 fernando prass has a career 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.770
 exceptional is a very humble guy who 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:48.540
 so for any player it is a 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:52.330
 example in sneakers has a characteristic 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.580
 a very strong personality to assume 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.040
 responsibility in difficult times 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.800

 He has been talking about his career. 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.530
 very nice thing to have lived with 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:11.410

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.990

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.450
 doubts is a very experienced guy in the 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:21.010

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:30.040
