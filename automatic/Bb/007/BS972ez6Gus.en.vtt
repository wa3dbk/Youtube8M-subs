00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.680
 we have approached llodio's watch company to see how it 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.899
 produces glass 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:16.070
 here seven hundred people work and every day there are six hundred 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.070
 tons of glass 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.949
 the process starts in the sand threads 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.949
 and is that the glass is 75% silica sand 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.720
 this sand that the trucks arrive at, even though it will later become glass 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.719
 from the windows of the houses the cars 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.820
 besides winning in Helsinki 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.330
 the video also has other ISO quality components xa 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.330
 mainly 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.790
 larenas in slave village of silos to the production plant 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.440
 through automatic channels 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.830
 in the plant larenas introduces in the oven 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.490
 it is very hot here 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.600
 since to produce glass it is necessary to melt the sand 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.880
 and for this you have to heat the oven until 1500 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.030
 the activity of the furnace is incessant 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.030
 365 days a year and 24 hours a day 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.869
 in August he will be 14 years of work and in that period he has not stopped 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:41.760
 only day 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.760
 and has produced almost three million tons of glass 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.580
 that is, a large pool 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.130
 the heart of the process 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.360
 should potavoz pensament the Spanish bath 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.390
 several streets the huge pool 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.390
 full of melted spain on which we lost the liquid glass 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.490
 glass to be less dense Spanish note about this 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.490
 the relationship between the superficial pensions of both elements 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.099
 produces an opa 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.689
 during the 14 years of the state's life 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:21.369
 the molten glass sheet is incessantly prolonged 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:26.509
 here the roads are fixed and in this sense 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:28.159
 and it is that at a thousand 100 degrees 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.159
 the video is like a chewing gum 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:41.389
 The whole process is automated 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:45.399
 from the control room temperatures and pressures are monitored and 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.399
 also the gas consumption of the furnace 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:52.849
 the glass is separated from the tin 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.849
 It cools out at 600 degrees 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:59.839
 it is already solid 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.629
 Temperature sensors control cooling turbines 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.069
 and these work automatically so that the glass then no problems 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.069
 at 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.379
 once there coast swords and the joy of Spanish dancing 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.209
 we shout to submit it to a process of cooling control 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.049
 the objective of this process is not more than the end user can provide it and 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.049
 transport it in conditions 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.729
 when it is 80 degrees 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.329
 the glass is framed and cut 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.590
 the marking of the video is done with a kind of fake diamond 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:48.389
 what until now has been an endless glass sheet 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.389
 here it is already separated in different parts 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:58.149
 this laser continuously controls the defects that the glass could present 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:01.149
 and it shows on the screen classified by 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:08.049
 the defective parts and separating and recycling my friends from luis bathrobe 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:14.089
 the marks they have left are also eliminated 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:17.089
 Rolls of the oven and edges 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.430
 finally the glass sheets are ready 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.430
 the storage 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.599
 sharpening is usually done by robots 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:35.030
 but when you produce the smallest pieces of glass like and for example 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:38.029
 that work must be done by hand 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.430
 the video is stored 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.430
 and it's ready for delivery in trucks 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.599
 what a few minutes ago was a lot of sand has become a 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:52.639
 bright video 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.780
 that will be a mirror or a window of any car house
