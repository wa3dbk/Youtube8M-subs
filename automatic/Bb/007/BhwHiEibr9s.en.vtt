charger set speed charger it's a smart
charger<00:00:35.040> when<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> battery<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:36.140> charged<00:00:37.140> up

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
charger when the battery is charged up

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.470 
charger when the battery is charged up
to<00:00:37.350> capacity<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:38.190> will<00:00:38.370> stop<00:00:38.969> charging<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
to capacity it will stop charging the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.729 
to capacity it will stop charging the
battery<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.020> won't<00:00:40.170> hurt<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.350> battery

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
battery so it won't hurt the battery

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.389 
battery so it won't hurt the battery
okay<00:00:41.070> on<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.760> inverter<00:00:43.969> cables<00:00:45.410> here<00:00:46.410> we're

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
okay on the inverter cables here we're

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.369 
okay on the inverter cables here we're
going<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.579> go<00:00:47.789> here<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.899> you'll<00:00:48.989> see<00:00:49.140> me<00:00:49.260> do

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
this thing is in water that's okay feel

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.970 
this thing is in water that's okay feel
not<00:02:04.900> that<00:02:05.050> you<00:02:05.170> probably<00:02:05.290> be<00:02:05.590> doing<00:02:05.710> stuff

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
not that you probably be doing stuff

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.700 
not that you probably be doing stuff
within<00:02:06.190> water<00:02:06.490> pump<00:02:07.440> okay

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
within water pump okay

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.100 
within water pump okay
so<00:02:08.920> just<00:02:09.160> read<00:02:09.790> cable<00:02:10.180> read<00:02:10.750> terminal<00:02:11.910> okay

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
so just read cable read terminal okay

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.690 
so just read cable read terminal okay
black<00:02:14.110> it'll<00:02:14.530> be<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.680> tiny<00:02:14.890> little<00:02:15.130> spark<00:02:15.430> here

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
black it'll be a tiny little spark here

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.960 
black it'll be a tiny little spark here
it's<00:02:16.480> okay<00:02:19.980> okay<00:02:20.980> your<00:02:21.160> inverter<00:02:21.490> is<00:02:21.670> ready<00:02:21.850> to

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
it's okay okay your inverter is ready to

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.270 
it's okay okay your inverter is ready to
go<00:02:22.200> right<00:02:23.200> here<00:02:25.470> power<00:02:26.470> switch<00:02:26.800> on<00:02:27.070> the
