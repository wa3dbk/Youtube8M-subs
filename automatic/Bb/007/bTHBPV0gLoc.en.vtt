00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.380
 but go for a little friend 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.320
 sitting here 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.789
 and what do you think I should be you 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.980
 to tell a little bit about him 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.359
 namely in the pet day a lot of fun 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.730
 the video I was about before 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.160
 similarities shared by the children 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.160
 thanks again to you and the questions to 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.439
 house quote i mecht answer the first 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.410
 question is what was your first pet 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.880
 and what is his name 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.770
 my first pet on me that way 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.800
 can remember correctly or our first 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.079
 pet that was a guinea pig and 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.270
 that you ask too late second you have it 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.360
 you wanted or was it a family 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.370
 Wish and I say so I believe it 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.680
 he was the wish of the big one 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.539
 sister but I think we have each other 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.820
 everyone around the family a little bit around 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.920
 the management cares for him he lives the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.859
 or still he already died 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.789
 So about a female and unfortunately 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.339
 already died 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.560
 the question what is your favorite animal and 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.200
 These are definitely miracles fifth 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.900
 Do you have many pets now? 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.140
 how do you think I have one here 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:21.570
 little dog this is my maltese baby 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.000
 So exactly educational wonderland yes and 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.840
 this is a Maltese who is now on 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.009
 first first 2014 became 1 and me 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.579
 I already have him in several 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.360
 shown videos and so he not only has 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.460
 me 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.400
 my friend is our common dog 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.010
 our little darling has his name 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.180
 a special meaning or story 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:48.600
 So where is the second red and that's why 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.630
 he has to start with b so it is 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.830
 just a single maltese and we have 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.910
 For a long time then we have the full 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.940
 great history we have on the internet 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.770
 searched for dog name mb and was there 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.120
 us a very big list a time 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.590
 and there have my and him a friend 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.910
 and then I sat together and the 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.229
 Name so much through one 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.450
 I just went through a bit 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.390
 read aloud education and then we thought 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.940
 even want somehow cool and short 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.860
 before we had the hobbit in the cinema 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.380
 watched with office buildings and somehow 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.690
 We thought then that fits what was yours 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.540
 best funniest experience with him 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.920
 So I think that's my funny 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.750
 experience probably barely 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.500
 he does not hide that long now 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.650
 with family but it's just always 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.570
 the best experience if he is 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.860
 Happy when I come home 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.360
 or when we get up and finally 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.090
 if we come here to the apartment and 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.590
 then you are allowed to go for a walk 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.850
 first not so tired right 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.980
 but we only times a bit 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.140
 they will play by the apartment 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.489
 but it is such a nice experience 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.780
 really unbelievable about one 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.550
 friend when you come home 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.610
 do you have big worries? 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:03.010
 may need to know that some of 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.590
 you have come and there is much more 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.480
 family and when he was at his 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.850
 First holiday on complaints was and he totally 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.530
 crazy in the sand and has played 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.970
 When we got together, we totally got to the sea 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.950
 we drove david 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.930
 and he has a bit of violence as well 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.120
 in the water under the bit in the sand 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.980
 played and there were also too own and 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.740
 he played a bit with him 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.170
 be immensely shaken tomorrow 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.820
 and somehow she wanted something like that 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.770
 just played with it and had it 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.970
 also in a wall 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.030
 that was probably a mistake of 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.110
 we did not know because in the 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.510
 Of course, there are many own 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.760
 he does not tolerate bacteria he does not tolerate 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.810
 totally bad stomach infection 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.880
 gastrointestinal infection and it against really 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.900
 really dirty and just one 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.640
 couple of months 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.890
 Then we had to go to the veterinarian 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.360
 on reprimands and that just the 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.350
 absolute horror and the doctors say so 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.760
 Maybe you will be a day later 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.290
 Maybe that would have come too 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.090
 not done because he just happened to be 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.310
 immune system was still totally weakened 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.840
 and he was so small and yes that was 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.790
 really really bad 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.950
 Would you like more pets? 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.690
 So if I have another pet 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.419
 Buildings would if we still have one 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.669
 second dog simple little compagnon 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.980
 for me but at the moment it does not look 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.690
 then off and 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.460
 the family of my friend then too 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.400
 one more and that's why it's anyway 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.200
 often so we with two dogs too 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.660
 home at least are traveling and 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.670
 is pretty nice but right now 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.280
 I think this little man is enough 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.140
 here you will find the satire of 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.910
 breeder or from the shelter 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.350
 I can actually ask the question badly 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.200
 answer because I think if you are 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.610
 An animal decides to take it 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.980
 that is now a dog or the cat 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.250
 no matter what do you think is first time 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.130
 a good totally great step to each 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.820
 animal would like to have at home and whether now 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.410
 from the animal shelter or from breeders as mach 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.680
 I do not make such big differences then 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:04.140
 In fact brother is big at the carpenter 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.760
 The hands would not have been around 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.620
 taken then would be just inevitable 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.940
 Maybe you call home 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.670
 come from that 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.620
 Of course it's great when animals 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.330
 from the shelter the really bad 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.520
 times behind has been neglected 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.190
 aufpÃ¤ppelt construction at home that 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.600
 It's great that I totally bleed my blood 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.400
 in front 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.080
 but even if you look at animals from 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.940
 Breeder picks I think is just as nice 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.070
 So I can not answer the question 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.470
 answer it you are any 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.870
 Organization joined for 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.640
 Animal welfare directly engage 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.860
 I am not in charge of the organization 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.440
 but I'm totally on the leader and 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.030
 yes if you just when i have more time 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.650
 and energy I would be up 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.350
 each case with it more busy 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.570
 but my friend and me every now and then 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.400
 it's just our local 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.170
 support animal shelter here in the form of 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.790
 Donate if I'm shopping for over 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.120
 I take it occasionally 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.800
 times 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.690
 a bit more and bring that 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.979
 then there and everyone is happy 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.830
 really out of the animal if you are right 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:03.630
 fresh german and was twelve present 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.540
 an animal in your life heart 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:09.060
 So , of course , absolutely wants one 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.910
 become big part in our lives 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.790
 just now with the family and 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.130
 We could just change our life too 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.410
 not my construction site is just like that 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.229
 just a topic that we love so much 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:24.180
 it is again and even if he sometimes 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:25.919
 know the nerves can go is it 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.539
 simply it's just the best 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.820
 decision we could make with 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:32.310
 our dog and our whole family 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:35.220
 is just totally in love with the office 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.050
 So really a real one otherwise 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:45.510
 I hope about you that the video 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:46.830
 I would like a fall too
