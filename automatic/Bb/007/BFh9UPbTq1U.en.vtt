armor<00:00:15.190> now<00:00:15.370> this<00:00:15.639> is<00:00:15.790> the<00:00:15.940> elbow<00:00:16.180> piece<00:00:16.510> that<00:00:16.689> I

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
armor now this is the elbow piece that I

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.330 
armor now this is the elbow piece that I
have<00:00:16.930> here<00:00:17.170> knee<00:00:17.680> armor<00:00:17.950> is<00:00:18.009> going<00:00:18.099> to<00:00:18.220> be

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
have here knee armor is going to be

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.950 
have here knee armor is going to be
essentially<00:00:18.759> the<00:00:18.820> same<00:00:19.000> thing<00:00:19.300> but<00:00:19.509> for<00:00:19.779> your

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
essentially the same thing but for your

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.100 
essentially the same thing but for your
leg<00:00:20.110> now<00:00:20.680> this<00:00:21.099> piece<00:00:21.490> is<00:00:21.790> a<00:00:22.509> little<00:00:22.960> bit

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
leg now this piece is a little bit

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.870 
leg now this piece is a little bit
higher<00:00:23.410> end<00:00:23.439> than<00:00:24.040> what<00:00:24.250> you<00:00:24.369> typically<00:00:24.759> find

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
higher end than what you typically find

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.710 
higher end than what you typically find
in<00:00:25.450> like<00:00:26.200> your<00:00:26.410> average<00:00:26.790> motocross<00:00:27.790> elbow<00:00:28.540> pad

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
in like your average motocross elbow pad

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.690 
in like your average motocross elbow pad
they<00:00:29.380> incorporate<00:00:29.980> some<00:00:30.220> pretty<00:00:30.369> high-end

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.700 
they incorporate some pretty high-end

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.370 
they incorporate some pretty high-end
nice<00:00:31.360> technology<00:00:31.869> into<00:00:32.500> this<00:00:32.649> namely<00:00:33.460> d3o

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
nice technology into this namely d3o

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.210 
nice technology into this namely d3o
intelligent<00:00:35.380> armor<00:00:35.710> now<00:00:35.920> if<00:00:36.010> you're<00:00:36.130> familiar

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
intelligent armor now if you're familiar

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.459 
intelligent armor now if you're familiar
with<00:00:36.489> d3o<00:00:36.969> it's<00:00:37.480> essentially<00:00:37.899> a<00:00:38.050> putty-like

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
with d3o it's essentially a putty-like

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.650 
with d3o it's essentially a putty-like
substance<00:00:39.250> it's<00:00:39.460> very<00:00:39.640> soft<00:00:40.000> and<00:00:40.240> moldable

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
substance it's very soft and moldable

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.170 
substance it's very soft and moldable
that<00:00:41.260> hardens<00:00:41.830> on<00:00:42.070> impact<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:42.730> molecules

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
that hardens on impact the molecules

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.060 
that hardens on impact the molecules
actually<00:00:43.510> line<00:00:43.750> up<00:00:43.780> and<00:00:44.080> it<00:00:44.140> disperses<00:00:44.500> impact

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
actually line up and it disperses impact

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.120 
actually line up and it disperses impact
over<00:00:45.820> a<00:00:45.850> broader<00:00:46.300> area<00:00:46.780> than<00:00:47.230> what<00:00:47.770> a<00:00:47.800> typical

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
over a broader area than what a typical

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.490 
over a broader area than what a typical
just<00:00:48.640> foam<00:00:48.880> padding<00:00:49.390> would<00:00:49.630> and<00:00:49.900> what<00:00:50.350> that

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
just foam padding would and what that

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.140 
just foam padding would and what that
means<00:00:50.710> is<00:00:50.890> that<00:00:50.920> you<00:00:51.430> can<00:00:51.550> take<00:00:51.700> a<00:00:51.730> harder

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
means is that you can take a harder

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.150 
means is that you can take a harder
impact<00:00:52.570> a<00:00:52.720> more<00:00:52.870> direct<00:00:53.200> impact<00:00:53.380> to<00:00:53.770> this<00:00:53.890> and

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
impact a more direct impact to this and

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.190 
impact a more direct impact to this and
it's<00:00:54.250> going<00:00:54.430> to<00:00:54.550> spread<00:00:55.300> the<00:00:55.420> impact<00:00:55.540> over<00:00:56.020> the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
it's going to spread the impact over the

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.040 
it's going to spread the impact over the
largest<00:00:56.620> area<00:00:56.829> possible<00:00:57.060> versus<00:00:58.060> caving<00:00:58.900> in

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
largest area possible versus caving in

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.800 
largest area possible versus caving in
and<00:00:59.440> you<00:00:59.980> know<00:01:00.070> giving<00:01:00.370> you<00:01:00.460> an<00:01:00.520> injury<00:01:00.820> so

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
and you know giving you an injury so

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.720 
and you know giving you an injury so
definitely<00:01:02.590> some<00:01:02.800> high-end<00:01:03.130> material<00:01:03.579> there

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
definitely some high-end material there

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.609 
definitely some high-end material there
it<00:01:03.880> does<00:01:04.059> revert<00:01:04.449> right<00:01:04.689> back<00:01:04.930> to<00:01:05.259> its<00:01:05.409> normal

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
it does revert right back to its normal

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.370 
it does revert right back to its normal
fluid<00:01:06.490> state<00:01:06.820> or<00:01:07.119> a<00:01:07.149> you<00:01:07.630> know<00:01:07.659> soft<00:01:07.990> state

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
fluid state or a you know soft state

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.590 
fluid state or a you know soft state
after<00:01:09.159> the<00:01:09.250> impact<00:01:09.490> occurs<00:01:09.909> so<00:01:10.180> it's<00:01:10.329> not<00:01:10.450> like

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
after the impact occurs so it's not like

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.080 
after the impact occurs so it's not like
a<00:01:10.630> one-hit<00:01:11.049> shot<00:01:11.380> you're<00:01:11.560> done<00:01:11.740> but<00:01:12.670> if<00:01:12.820> you<00:01:12.940> do

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
a one-hit shot you're done but if you do

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.910 
a one-hit shot you're done but if you do
have<00:01:13.300> a<00:01:13.330> hit<00:01:13.600> it's<00:01:13.990> going<00:01:14.260> to<00:01:14.440> remain

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
have a hit it's going to remain

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.410 
have a hit it's going to remain
comfortable<00:01:15.370> on<00:01:15.460> your<00:01:15.580> arm<00:01:15.790> and<00:01:16.000> if<00:01:16.120> you<00:01:16.210> have

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
comfortable on your arm and if you have

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.149 
comfortable on your arm and if you have
a<00:01:16.450> hit<00:01:16.690> it's<00:01:16.870> going<00:01:17.080> to<00:01:17.170> disperse<00:01:17.530> that<00:01:17.680> impact

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
a hit it's going to disperse that impact

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.810 
a hit it's going to disperse that impact
over<00:01:18.790> a<00:01:18.820> larger<00:01:19.180> area<00:01:19.470> now<00:01:20.470> this<00:01:20.890> is<00:01:21.130> a<00:01:21.190> vented

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
over a larger area now this is a vented

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.100 
over a larger area now this is a vented
design<00:01:22.120> you<00:01:22.240> can<00:01:22.390> see<00:01:22.420> that<00:01:22.659> they<00:01:22.780> have<00:01:22.810> some

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
design you can see that they have some

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.630 
design you can see that they have some
openings<00:01:23.530> there<00:01:23.680> to<00:01:23.830> allow<00:01:24.040> some<00:01:24.250> air<00:01:24.430> to<00:01:24.549> flow

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
openings there to allow some air to flow

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.580 
openings there to allow some air to flow
through<00:01:24.760> and<00:01:25.240> then<00:01:25.690> you<00:01:26.049> can<00:01:26.170> see<00:01:26.320> it's<00:01:26.470> a

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
through and then you can see it's a

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.500 
through and then you can see it's a
sleeve<00:01:26.950> style<00:01:27.310> design<00:01:27.670> so<00:01:27.970> you<00:01:28.060> slide<00:01:28.299> your

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
sleeve style design so you slide your

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.969 
sleeve style design so you slide your
arm<00:01:28.659> through<00:01:28.960> I'll<00:01:29.080> put<00:01:29.229> it<00:01:29.320> on<00:01:29.380> a<00:01:29.440> second<00:01:29.890> so

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
arm through I'll put it on a second so

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.390 
arm through I'll put it on a second so
you<00:01:30.010> can<00:01:30.100> see<00:01:30.540> how<00:01:31.540> it<00:01:31.900> fits<00:01:32.260> but<00:01:32.920> it<00:01:33.070> has<00:01:33.220> this

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
you can see how it fits but it has this

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.289 
you can see how it fits but it has this
hydrogen<00:01:34.330> which<00:01:35.170> is<00:01:35.350> lining<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.250> entire<00:01:36.299> back

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
hydrogen which is lining the entire back

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.870 
hydrogen which is lining the entire back
of<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.990> arm<00:01:38.200> now<00:01:38.830> this<00:01:39.159> is<00:01:39.280> actually<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:39.670> same

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
of the arm now this is actually the same

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.609 
of the arm now this is actually the same
type<00:01:40.090> of<00:01:40.270> material<00:01:40.659> that<00:01:40.690> Ikon<00:01:41.080> uses<00:01:41.380> in<00:01:41.500> their

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
type of material that Ikon uses in their

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.649 
type of material that Ikon uses in their
helmets<00:01:42.010> it's<00:01:42.549> basically<00:01:43.030> a<00:01:43.119> moisture

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
helmets it's basically a moisture

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.870 
helmets it's basically a moisture
wicking<00:01:44.040> antibacterial<00:01:45.040> fabric<00:01:45.460> that's

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
wicking antibacterial fabric that's

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.340 
wicking antibacterial fabric that's
going<00:01:46.060> to<00:01:46.240> keep<00:01:46.390> you<00:01:46.540> a<00:01:46.570> lot<00:01:46.810> more<00:01:46.960> comfortable

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
going to keep you a lot more comfortable

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.020 
going to keep you a lot more comfortable
and<00:01:47.619> it's<00:01:47.979> also<00:01:48.070> going<00:01:48.250> to<00:01:48.310> help<00:01:48.460> extend<00:01:48.909> the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
and it's also going to help extend the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
on the ends of it and that means that

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.130 
on the ends of it and that means that
it's<00:02:21.940> not<00:02:21.970> going<00:02:22.150> to<00:02:22.240> be<00:02:22.330> able<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.510> slide<00:02:22.840> out

you<00:02:51.580> know<00:02:51.880> if<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.390> are<00:02:53.220> really<00:02:54.220> tiny<00:02:54.430> you

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
you know if you are really tiny you

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.070 
you know if you are really tiny you

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
might want to go down the size but

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.830 
might want to go down the size but
average<00:02:56.470> guy<00:02:57.100> average<00:02:57.640> arms<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.360> probably

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
average guy average arms you probably

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.620 
average guy average arms you probably
want<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.140> go<00:02:59.290> with<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.650> larger<00:03:00.070> size<00:03:00.630> because

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
want to go with the larger size because

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.840 
want to go with the larger size because
this<00:03:02.320> is<00:03:02.560> you<00:03:03.040> know<00:03:03.130> you<00:03:03.220> probably<00:03:03.400> want<00:03:03.730> it

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
this is you know you probably want it

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.120 
this is you know you probably want it
much<00:03:04.000> tighter<00:03:04.269> than<00:03:04.390> this<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:04.930> like<00:03:05.800> I<00:03:05.890> said<00:03:05.950> I

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
much tighter than this and like I said I

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.890 
much tighter than this and like I said I
don't<00:03:06.250> have<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.519> largest<00:03:07.030> arms<00:03:07.390> but<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:07.810> can

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
don't have the largest arms but you can

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.830 
don't have the largest arms but you can
see<00:03:08.019> it's<00:03:08.200> a<00:03:08.290> free-floating<00:03:08.769> design<00:03:09.250> so<00:03:09.850> I<00:03:10.239> can

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
see it's a free-floating design so I can

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.990 
see it's a free-floating design so I can
move<00:03:10.989> around<00:03:11.230> and<00:03:11.620> it's<00:03:12.040> fairly<00:03:12.250> low<00:03:12.519> profile

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
move around and it's fairly low profile

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.240 
move around and it's fairly low profile
so<00:03:13.269> under<00:03:13.630> most<00:03:13.840> jackets<00:03:14.110> if<00:03:14.890> you're<00:03:15.040> riding
