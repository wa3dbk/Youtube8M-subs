00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.410
 lightweight building systems 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.389
 gypsum sheet materials long ago 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.360
 gained popularity around the world 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.370
 company snk band hyprock being a global 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.500
 lightweight plaster leader 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.539
 construction systems for almost a hundred 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.720
 years makes every effort to make 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.359
 their designs are lighter durable 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.699
 and easy to install metal 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.500
 the profile is giprok ultra one of the main 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.929
 elements of gypsum building systems 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 hyprok is the result of joint 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.850
 work snk ben and English company x 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.219
 for the developer unique technologies 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.739
 metal processing ultra steel 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.570
 this technology not only transforms 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.480
 the appearance of the metal profile 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.700
 but also endows him with a number of additional 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.280
 advantages above all technology 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.350
 ultra steel makes profile gyrok ultra 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.489
 much stronger than usual 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.070
 metal profile 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.260
 similar thickness due to the shape 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.239
 surface profileib rock ultra 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.329
 fastened together according to the principle 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.610
 spike groove which allows in many cases 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.830
 completely abandon their extra 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.580
 fixing with each other with screws or 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.580
 cutter a 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.600
 one of the problems with fixing plaster 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.420
 sheet materials to metal 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.000
 skeleton is something that is self tapping 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.909
 the screw fails to screw into the shelf 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.240
 profile special shape of the surface of the profile 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.399
 hyproc ultra solves this problem with 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.890
 one side of the screw tip not 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:37.020
 slides on the shelf and screw easily 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.020
 wrapped even in the hem with 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.579
 other side cover technological 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.490
 holes in the profile giprok ultra 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.170
 is stiffener not allowing 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.149
 profile shelves sag when 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.149
 self-tapping screws 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.830
 one of the most important indicators for 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.140
 metal profile used in 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.950
 light building systems ability 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.099
 hold 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.750
 wavy self-tapping screw 

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:09.929
 the surface of the profile is gyrok ultra 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.190
 creates a harpoon effect 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.130
 pulling strength increases 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.410
 so and breakdown strength of self-tapping 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.019
 wood screws 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.310
 metal profile giprok ultra 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:24.299
 tomorrow light construction 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.299
 constructions
