steps feeds that now if you bought stock

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.539 
steps feeds that now if you bought stock
options<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:12.030> probably<00:00:12.599> have<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.860> stack<00:00:14.250> mat

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
options you probably have a stack mat

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.620 
options you probably have a stack mat
and<00:00:15.440> staff<00:00:16.440> at<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.650> time<00:00:17.150> you<00:00:18.150> don't<00:00:18.330> that's

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
and staff at that time you don't that's

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.330 
and staff at that time you don't that's
okay<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:19.289> really<00:00:19.710> don't<00:00:19.890> need<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.100> tie

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
okay you really don't need to tie

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.370 
okay you really don't need to tie
yourself<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:21.080> cops<00:00:22.080> but<00:00:23.010> anyway<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.640> so<00:00:24.420> I'm

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
yourself to cops but anyway this so I'm

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.500 
yourself to cops but anyway this so I'm
doing<00:00:25.970> several<00:00:26.970> videos<00:00:27.330> showing<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.960> how<00:00:28.230> to

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
doing several videos showing you how to

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.840 
doing several videos showing you how to
do<00:00:30.510> speed<00:00:30.869> stacking<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.369> first<00:00:32.640> of

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
do speed stacking this is the first of

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.180 
do speed stacking this is the first of
them<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.239> first<00:00:33.570> thing<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.079> learned<00:00:34.770> and

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
them is the first thing you learned and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.780 
them is the first thing you learned and
it's<00:00:35.520> how<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:35.969> stacks<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.690> tubs<00:00:36.930> now<00:00:37.790> I'm

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
it's how the stacks and tubs now I'm

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.590 
it's how the stacks and tubs now I'm
going<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.059> do<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.300> because<00:00:39.629> I'm<00:00:39.899> right-handed

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
going to do it because I'm right-handed

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.260 
going to do it because I'm right-handed
person<00:00:42.600> feel<00:00:43.559> left-handed<00:00:44.219> you're<00:00:44.940> probably

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
person feel left-handed you're probably

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.510 
person feel left-handed you're probably
going<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.750> do<00:00:46.110> what<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.250> probably

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
going to have to do what you probably

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.729 
going to have to do what you probably
normally<00:00:48.450> do<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.050> reverse<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
normally do and it's reverse the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.470 
normally do and it's reverse the
instructions<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.550> are<00:00:50.579> given<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.180> and

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
instructions that are given to you and

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.100 
instructions that are given to you and
so<00:00:52.399> you<00:00:53.399> take<00:00:53.640> your<00:00:53.850> dominant<00:00:54.390> hands<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:54.989> me

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
so you take your dominant hands for me

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.700 
so you take your dominant hands for me
it's<00:00:55.260> one<00:00:55.469> right<00:00:55.760> so<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:56.910> says<00:00:57.559> pick<00:00:58.559> up

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
it's one right so it just says pick up

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.200 
it's one right so it just says pick up
the<00:00:58.859> top<00:00:59.039> and<00:01:00.379> put<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.710> side<00:01:01.879> how'd<00:01:02.879> you

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the top and put it to the side how'd you

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.030 
the top and put it to the side how'd you
doing<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:04.080> head<00:01:04.320> should<00:01:04.439> be<00:01:04.500> coming<00:01:04.949> in

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
doing this this head should be coming in

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.210 
doing this this head should be coming in
and<00:01:05.330> picking<00:01:06.330> up<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.750> couple<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.380> putting

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
and picking up that couple and putting

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:17.539 
and picking up that couple and putting
it<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.430> top<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:16.140> once<00:01:16.439> again<00:01:16.590> pick<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.159> up<00:01:17.280> pick

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
it on top so once again pick it up pick

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.539 
it on top so once again pick it up pick
the<00:01:18.479> other<00:01:18.659> top<00:01:18.960> up<00:01:19.140> put<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.619> down<00:01:19.799> put<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.490> down

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
the other top up put it down put it down

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.260 
the other top up put it down put it down
and<00:01:21.140> now<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.549> disassemble<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:24.080> you<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.560> I

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
and now to disassemble it you just I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.710 
and now to disassemble it you just I
would<00:01:27.270> know<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:28.009> chop<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.189> down<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.820> again

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
would know is that chop it down so again

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.660 
would know is that chop it down so again
you<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:30.900> kind<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.829> shove<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.189> over<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.460> side

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
you just kind of shove it over the side

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.569 
you just kind of shove it over the side
and<00:01:32.729> down<00:01:33.150> pick<00:01:33.960> up<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.229> show<00:01:34.439> pop<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:37.579> and

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
and down pick up the show pop it on and

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.429 
and down pick up the show pop it on and
that<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.420> how<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.829> do<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:41.100> three<00:01:41.610> stack<00:01:41.939> and

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
that is how to do a three stack and

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.280 
that is how to do a three stack and
disassemble<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.560> three<00:01:43.740> snack<00:01:44.390> now<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:46.079> time

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
disassemble the three snack now to time

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.920 
disassemble the three snack now to time
yourself<00:01:46.409> just<00:01:46.920> put<00:01:47.070> your<00:01:47.159> hands<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:50.930> you

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
yourself just put your hands on you

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.899 
yourself just put your hands on you
should<00:01:52.170> be<00:01:52.350> able<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.740> do<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.040> in<00:01:53.960> two<00:01:54.960> seconds

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
should be able to do it in two seconds

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.660 
should be able to do it in two seconds
one<00:01:56.909> second<00:01:57.390> two<00:01:57.540> seconds<00:01:58.280> someone<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.490> that

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
one second two seconds someone in that

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.610 
one second two seconds someone in that
area<00:02:01.790> so<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:03.530> is<00:02:04.530> how<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.100> city<00:02:05.340> staff
