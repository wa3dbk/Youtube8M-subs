00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.519
 install the keyboard on the 92 the samsung 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.459
 galaxy no autos on your device 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.640
 samsung galaxy s3 to do this 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:22.270
 possible we need that session together and 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.660
 which is called radio nodes the floor 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.690
 keyboard dots and good to do 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.750
 first of all 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:36.670
 we need our dash a dvd s 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:39.129
 everything since they give and my case that no 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.280
 they have to make it run stock has a 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:47.760
 they have to make a rom based on this 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.760
 how is this rom that is an omega versus 34 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.870
 otherwise that rom that keyboard does not 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.989
 it's going to work and it's going to ruin your 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.870
 good device if you do not know how to use 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.420
 a light must be I will explain in a 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.040
 new video good if wrong triangles 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.040
 let's go to the recovery mode 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:15.090
 for the turns has that function is 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.940
 Power volume button to the volume above 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.950
 son but all the rice of the s 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.950
 they have to have that function included 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.670
 good at times and I go to style is 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:39.340
 install for medical 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.340
 georges and dedicate and we look for the file 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.540
 in season 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.540
 these 12 hayward 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.510
 we give you 10 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.020
 Luis Garisto reduces this grade and already 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.890
 we will have to have the keyboard of the 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.890
 two installed 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.429
 if you want to learn how to use that 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:11.850
 dimension or others that find 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:14.590
 available I will show you in another video 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.420
 for another video 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.680
 in another video I will show you how to do 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.680
 this step is very simple 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.760
 in that 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.760
 now let's write a text 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.120
 good as we can see we already have 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.160
 keyboard on the two with the numbers 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.380
 above the keyboard we have to go to 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.390
 symbols or nothing will always be 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:50.989
 static there and it's a very good very 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.600
 good very a key bridge for the use 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.190
 most optimized diary and all what 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.020
 I recommend 100% 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.870
 remember because to look like this 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.810
 keyboard if the keyboard has to have 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.940
