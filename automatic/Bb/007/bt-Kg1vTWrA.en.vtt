been painted to look like a rustic
already<00:01:59.360> and<00:02:00.679> this<00:02:01.679> is<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.979> people<00:02:02.250> who

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
already and this is the people who

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.380 
already and this is the people who
station<00:02:02.789> between<00:02:03.030> Dumbo<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.140> teacups

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.270 

and<00:02:11.260> I<00:02:11.350> thought<00:02:11.560> we'd<00:02:11.680> get<00:02:11.770> another<00:02:11.890> vantage

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
and I thought we'd get another vantage

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.699 
and I thought we'd get another vantage
point<00:02:12.730> here<00:02:12.940> in<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.120> moment<00:02:13.300> by<00:02:13.600> going<00:02:13.930> over<00:02:14.230> who

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
point here in a moment by going over who

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:25.320 
point here in a moment by going over who
wore<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.860> much<00:02:24.069> being<00:02:24.280> done<00:02:24.490> and<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.819> can't<00:02:25.180> wait

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
wore so much being done and I can't wait

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.090 
wore so much being done and I can't wait
to<00:02:25.360> see<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:25.690> inside<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:26.709> it's<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:26.980> much

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
to see the inside and it's so much

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.940 
to see the inside and it's so much
deeper<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.850> chasm<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.390> I'm<00:02:28.630> fine

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
deeper of a chasm that I'm fine

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.860
