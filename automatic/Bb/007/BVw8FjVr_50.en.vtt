00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880
 and so hello everyone with you again milker and I 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.190
 decided to switch to mods and versions 1.4.5 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:14.370
 well, because there are so many more 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.379
 than on 12 and 5 and it seems to me that this 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.449
 version much more refined than 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.160
 earlier and so here today we will have 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.439
 a little villainous mod which to me 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.850
 really liked just talking 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.189
 quite seriously i'm a big lover 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.869
 magic there rp dubs I like it here 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.680
 and the current mod give us a chance 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.750
 become necromancers so here to start us 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.890
 need 1 bone dust for what 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.290
 you ask yes what should be 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.940
 normal bone dust will make her 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.350
 We get in the middle of the bone needle and 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.360
 now sorry for not sleeping cow just 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.320
 downloaded some mod on animals 1000 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.680
 because now pancakes 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.699
 suffer this same here zombyak need 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.920
 beat a bone needle but you will need 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.729
 bone glo only if you have 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.049
 have empty bottles if you have 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.390
 empty bottles then nothing can 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.700
 fear 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.409
 it is useful here but I filled for some reason 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.380
 a lot of threads do not know what a joke 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.799
 measures a glitch of some kind of thread and a sense of needle 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.750
 so here if you have it in inventory 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.240
 time to start bubbles upon impact 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.549
 Astana bone and angry they will 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.549
 blood is good for us 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.470
 close to the zombies probably do so 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.829
