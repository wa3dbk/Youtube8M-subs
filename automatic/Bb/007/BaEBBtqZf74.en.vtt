bobby<00:00:54.579> pins<00:00:54.670> I<00:00:55.150> think<00:00:55.629> you'll<00:00:55.780> need<00:00:55.930> more<00:00:56.140> than

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
bobby pins I think you'll need more than

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.729 
bobby pins I think you'll need more than
that<00:00:56.350> so<00:00:56.890> make<00:00:57.340> sure<00:00:57.370> they'd<00:00:57.670> have<00:00:57.790> enough<00:00:58.739> to

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
that so make sure they'd have enough to

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.060 
that so make sure they'd have enough to
start<00:00:59.800> this<00:01:00.129> I'm<00:01:00.489> gonna<00:01:00.910> grab<00:01:01.510> my<00:01:01.540> hair<00:01:02.050> I<00:01:02.320> put

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.990 
start this I'm gonna grab my hair I put
on<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:03.730> side<00:01:03.970> I<00:01:04.300> like<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:04.960> bread<00:01:05.229> on<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.410> side

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
on the side I like the bread on the side

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.390 
on the side I like the bread on the side
so<00:01:07.000> then<00:01:07.509> i'm<00:01:07.960> going<00:01:08.259> to<00:01:08.380> divide<00:01:08.530> my<00:01:09.009> hair<00:01:09.130> into

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
so then i'm going to divide my hair into

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.090 
so then i'm going to divide my hair into
sections<00:01:10.229> equal<00:01:11.229> sections<00:01:11.650> at<00:01:11.920> least<00:01:12.460> try<00:01:12.729> to

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
sections equal sections at least try to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.070 
sections equal sections at least try to
so<00:01:15.100> once<00:01:15.790> you<00:01:16.000> have<00:01:16.210> two<00:01:16.390> sections<00:01:16.900> such<00:01:17.050> as

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
so once you have two sections such as

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.590 
so once you have two sections such as
wanna<00:01:17.590> braid<00:01:18.310> it<00:01:18.550> all<00:01:18.899> the<00:01:19.899> way<00:01:20.050> them<00:01:20.320> and<00:01:21.600> use

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
wanna braid it all the way them and use

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.670 
wanna braid it all the way them and use
our<00:01:22.860> elastic<00:01:23.860> pan<00:01:24.070> too<00:01:24.759> tied<00:01:25.030> it<00:01:25.240> so<00:01:25.630> okay<00:01:26.320> it's

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680
