way<00:00:56.239> what<00:00:57.239> ultimately<00:00:57.629> gets<00:00:57.930> decided<00:00:58.289> it's

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
way what ultimately gets decided it's

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.340 
way what ultimately gets decided it's
hard<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.579> say<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.120> there<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> difference<00:01:01.140> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
hard to say and there is a difference to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.139 
hard to say and there is a difference to
when<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.649> US<00:01:01.890> Patent<00:01:02.219> Office<00:01:02.340> takes<00:01:02.730> away<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
when the US Patent Office takes away the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.460 
when the US Patent Office takes away the
registration<00:01:03.840> there's<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.080> difference

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
registration there's a difference

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.950 
registration there's a difference
between<00:01:04.530> ownership<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.240> trademark<00:01:06.270> and

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
between ownership of the trademark and

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.230 
between ownership of the trademark and
registration<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.890> trademark<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.670> that's

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
registration of the trademark so that's

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.399 
registration of the trademark so that's
going<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.510> be<00:01:09.570> something<00:01:09.810> that's<00:01:10.020> going<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.320> be

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
going to be something that's going to be
