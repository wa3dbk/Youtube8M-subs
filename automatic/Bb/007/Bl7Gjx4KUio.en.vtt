00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:16.640
 if you do not place seven headquarters tests left its works though 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.749
 I recommend jalaf to put it tato

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.089
 I accept occupation 

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:54.029
 and finally 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:56.999
 your date of birth 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:03:59.999

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:05.109
 the day 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.259
 and finally 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:09.819
 and important this 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.419
 remember so they can see what your data is true 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.419
 and also for them to know what you are of legal age 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.000
 and finally last minor patch 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.009
 maybe it can not be an account in pt I recommend 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.009
 in using data maybe from someone in your family 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:31.419
 there is a trustworthy family that has corn for eight years and that x wants both 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.529
 Private parts 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:35.099
 your data to create an alex pella account 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.099
 from the jack you then ohlmex so it's like that 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.919
 and the nextel medel team 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.349
 I meditated 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.349
 where are we going to use alert and remember that the pri 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:48.370
 percent and also allows 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.809
 in the multiple metrological omel principal 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:56.059
 by the way and you repeat of motu merino you can go wrong with a password that are 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:58.360
 much more than six characters 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.330
 and of repeats 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.830
 I pass your password so you do not go wrong in this 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.389
 that they have therefore the pin is important because the pin 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.629
 to effect a transaction to conform sale through the aspect 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:14.389
 you are going to ask for a pin and that gives you greater security who can be 4 8 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.259
 digits can be just numbers 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.160
 or you decide what you want but I remember as much passion as the pin 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:22.050
 they scored a safe place 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.050
 because if you get lost already 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:28.139
 complicates the subject a bit 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.270
 percent since you can ask for peace bulletin but percent through 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.490

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.949

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.240
 i 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.720
 finally add the terms of the show because it has been a 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.360
 singular product 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.360
