that when I plugged it in for a first
time<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.629> other<00:00:39.750> day<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.899> was<00:00:40.110> really

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.220 

so<00:00:52.770> I'll<00:00:52.860> start<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.610> phase<00:00:53.790> 90<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
so I'll start with the phase 90 and the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.030 
so I'll start with the phase 90 and the
knob<00:00:55.490> for<00:00:56.490> speed<00:00:57.290> set<00:00:58.290> at<00:00:58.410> about<00:00:58.530> nine<00:00:58.890> o'clock

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
and this just gives kind of that kind of

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.040 
and this just gives kind of that kind of
swirling<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.700> filter<00:01:03.150> sleep<00:01:03.420> sound<00:01:03.750> that

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
swirling like filter sleep sound that

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.930

finally I want to bring the speed knob

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.710 
finally I want to bring the speed knob
up<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.720> almost<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.470> maximum<00:03:20.680> setting<00:03:21.630> kind<00:03:22.630> of

up to almost the maximum setting kind of

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.199 
up to almost the maximum setting kind of
use<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.989> uniboob<00:03:23.260> as<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.530> more<00:03:24.010> unique<00:03:24.310> kind<00:03:25.180> of

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
use the uniboob as a more unique kind of

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:31.470 
use the uniboob as a more unique kind of
fast<00:03:25.870> effect<00:03:28.859> and<00:03:29.859> just<00:03:29.889> demo<00:03:30.579> it<00:03:30.760> at<00:03:31.269> that

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
fast effect and just demo it at that

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.690 
fast effect and just demo it at that
setting<00:03:31.780> obviously<00:03:32.530> a<00:03:32.560> much<00:03:32.739> more<00:03:33.280> pronounced

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
setting obviously a much more pronounced

00:03:33.700 --> 00:04:17.490 
setting obviously a much more pronounced
kind<00:03:34.209> of<00:03:34.299> effect

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.280 

so<00:04:18.500> overall<00:04:18.680> this<00:04:19.010> is<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.220> really<00:04:19.760> cool<00:04:19.970> mod

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
so overall this is a really cool mod

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.390 
so overall this is a really cool mod
really<00:04:21.290> just<00:04:21.530> completely<00:04:21.739> changes<00:04:22.310> the

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
really just completely changes the

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.430 
really just completely changes the
effect<00:04:22.790> from<00:04:22.910> a<00:04:23.060> phaser<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.990> the<00:04:24.080> unified

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
effect from a phaser to the unified

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.320 
effect from a phaser to the unified
sound<00:04:24.800> so<00:04:25.520> I<00:04:25.580> highly<00:04:25.790> recommend<00:04:25.850> if<00:04:26.240> you've

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
sound so I highly recommend if you've

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.510 
sound so I highly recommend if you've
got<00:04:26.480> an<00:04:26.600> extra<00:04:26.930> phase<00:04:27.110> 90s<00:04:27.530> sitting<00:04:27.740> around<00:04:27.950> or

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
got an extra phase 90s sitting around or

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.770 
got an extra phase 90s sitting around or
if<00:04:28.580> you're<00:04:28.730> just<00:04:28.910> really<00:04:29.090> into<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.480> unified

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
if you're just really into the unified

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.130 
if you're just really into the unified
sound<00:04:30.280> send<00:04:31.280> your<00:04:31.400> pedal<00:04:31.700> unto<00:04:31.880> Johnny<00:04:32.150> and
