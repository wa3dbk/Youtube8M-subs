here<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.930> on<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.290> one<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:41.000> just<00:00:42.000> keep<00:00:42.180> in

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
here and on that one and just keep in

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.049 
here and on that one and just keep in
mind<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.770> this<00:00:43.770> clutch<00:00:44.100> pack<00:00:44.340> right<00:00:44.579> here

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
mind that this clutch pack right here

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.400 
mind that this clutch pack right here
this<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.219> overdrive<00:00:47.219> direct<00:00:47.840> so<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.260> way

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
this is the overdrive direct so the way

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.380 
this is the overdrive direct so the way
this<00:00:49.649> thing<00:00:49.860> works<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.789> goes<00:00:51.030> here<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
this thing works this goes here in the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.439 
this thing works this goes here in the
override<00:00:51.780> section<00:00:54.199> it's<00:00:55.199> normally<00:00:55.770> held<00:00:56.039> by<00:00:56.280> a

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
override section it's normally held by a

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.119 
override section it's normally held by a
600-pound<00:00:57.449> spring<00:00:57.989> inside<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.800> overdrive

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
600-pound spring inside the overdrive

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.160 
600-pound spring inside the overdrive
section<00:00:59.460> here<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:01.489> these<00:01:02.489> are<00:01:02.730> applied<00:01:03.359> from

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
section here and these are applied from

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.460 
section here and these are applied from
first<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:05.159> third<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.820> they<00:01:06.630> release<00:01:07.110> in

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
first to third and they release in

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.950 
first to third and they release in
overdrive<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.820> way<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.150> works<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.720> that

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
overdrive and the way that works is that

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.910 
overdrive and the way that works is that
uh<00:01:10.970> whenever<00:01:11.970> overdrive<00:01:12.630> applies<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.790> pushes

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
uh whenever overdrive applies it pushes

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.149 
uh whenever overdrive applies it pushes
against<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.070> spring<00:01:18.229> to<00:01:19.229> do<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> three-four

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
against this spring to do a three-four

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.499 
against this spring to do a three-four
up<00:01:20.340> shift<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.880> releases<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:22.049> frictions<00:01:22.860> and

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
up shift it releases this frictions and

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.730 
up shift it releases this frictions and
it<00:01:24.509> applies<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.500> Oak<00:01:26.040> Drive<00:01:26.250> brake<00:01:26.640> frictions

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
it applies the Oak Drive brake frictions

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.649 
it applies the Oak Drive brake frictions
now<00:01:28.740> there's<00:01:29.040> being<00:01:29.220> an<00:01:29.430> issue<00:01:29.579> here<00:01:30.180> I've

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
now there's being an issue here I've

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.450 
now there's being an issue here I've
seen<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.409> snapping<00:01:32.009> sometimes

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
seen that the snapping sometimes

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.179 
seen that the snapping sometimes
completely<00:01:32.909> pops<00:01:33.329> off<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.439> will<00:01:34.619> have<00:01:34.829> no

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
completely pops off and you will have no

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.719 
completely pops off and you will have no
reverse<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:37.200> have<00:01:37.650> some<00:01:37.920> issues<00:01:38.520> of

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
reverse and you have some issues of

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.630 
reverse and you have some issues of
shifting<00:01:39.210> as<00:01:39.329> well<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.950> will<00:01:41.100> find<00:01:41.400> it

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
shifting as well and you will find it

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.450 
shifting as well and you will find it
the<00:01:41.820> pieces<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.390> snap<00:01:42.659> ring<00:01:43.280> on<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
the pieces of the snap ring on the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.039 
the pieces of the snap ring on the
bottom<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.850> pan<00:01:45.890> or<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.950> will<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:48.049> don't

bottom of the pan or I will I don't

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.160 
bottom of the pan or I will I don't
think<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.619> will<00:01:49.799> have<00:01:50.040> enough<00:01:50.340> time<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:51.170> to

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
think I will have enough time for to

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.380 
think I will have enough time for to

what<00:02:30.599> that<00:02:30.930> will<00:02:31.230> cause<00:02:32.900> now<00:02:33.900> we<00:02:34.170> walk<00:02:34.379> over

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
what that will cause now we walk over

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.770 
what that will cause now we walk over
here<00:02:34.860> onto<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:35.280> bench<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.819> have<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:36.150> case

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
here onto this bench I have the case

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.360 
here onto this bench I have the case
already<00:02:37.049> they're<00:02:37.440> already<00:02:37.739> washed<00:02:38.069> up

temperature will come back to you and

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.319 
temperature will come back to you and
you're<00:03:35.489> gonna<00:03:35.609> just<00:03:35.880> going<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.060> end<00:03:36.180> up

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
you're gonna just going to end up

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.199 
you're gonna just going to end up
replacing<00:03:37.069> this<00:03:38.069> one<00:03:38.340> here<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.880> governor

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.409 
pressure sensor or transducer it is very
common<00:03:43.380> that<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.709> fails<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:44.940> will<00:03:45.120> see

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
common that it fails and you will see

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.780 
common that it fails and you will see
this<00:03:45.660> one<00:03:46.019> the<00:03:46.380> late<00:03:46.620> model<00:03:46.889> want<00:03:47.280> plastic

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
this one the late model want plastic

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.280 
this one the late model want plastic
like<00:03:47.970> this<00:03:49.069> fill<00:03:50.069> more<00:03:50.340> regular<00:03:50.910> than<00:03:51.290> the

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
like this fill more regular than the

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:57.199 
like this fill more regular than the
earlier<00:03:52.680> model<00:03:55.129> we<00:03:56.129> want<00:03:56.340> over<00:03:56.459> here<00:03:56.790> and<00:03:57.060> we

section will be this the transmission

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.229 
section will be this the transmission
itself<00:04:07.049> and<00:04:07.379> then<00:04:08.069> you<00:04:08.099> have<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.370> bushing<00:04:08.940> kit

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
itself and then you have a bushing kit

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.240 
itself and then you have a bushing kit
just<00:04:09.690> for<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.079> overdrive<00:04:10.500> section<00:04:10.739> itself

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
just for the overdrive section itself

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.460 
just for the overdrive section itself
which<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.120> overdrive<00:04:12.480> section<00:04:12.660> goes<00:04:13.049> inside

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
being a four by four I mean the old dry

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.469 
being a four by four I mean the old dry
section<00:04:19.590> is<00:04:19.859> kind<00:04:20.099> of<00:04:20.190> cut<00:04:20.549> short<00:04:20.880> but<00:04:21.239> on<00:04:21.390> the

this<00:04:30.240> one<00:04:30.390> has<00:04:30.540> a<00:04:30.570> real<00:04:30.840> short<00:04:31.170> one<00:04:31.350> let's<00:04:31.560> walk

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
this one has a real short one let's walk

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.330 
this one has a real short one let's walk
over<00:04:31.800> here<00:04:32.690> as<00:04:33.690> you<00:04:34.470> see<00:04:34.860> right<00:04:35.070> there

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
over here as you see right there

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.510 
over here as you see right there
this<00:04:36.030> right<00:04:36.270> here<00:04:36.540> gets<00:04:36.960> blind<00:04:37.410> into<00:04:38.130> the

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
this right here gets blind into the

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.840 
this right here gets blind into the
transfer<00:04:39.330> case<00:04:39.480> itself<00:04:40.190> so<00:04:41.190> there<00:04:41.340> we<00:04:41.460> have<00:04:41.640> it

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
transfer case itself so there we have it

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.340 
transfer case itself so there we have it
I<00:04:42.000> don't<00:04:42.510> think<00:04:42.660> I'm<00:04:42.750> going<00:04:42.840> to<00:04:42.930> have<00:04:43.050> enough

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
I don't think I'm going to have enough

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.790
