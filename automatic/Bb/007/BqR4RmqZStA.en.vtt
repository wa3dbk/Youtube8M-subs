open<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.159> one<00:02:02.340> first<00:02:02.450> looks<00:02:03.450> like<00:02:03.600> they<00:02:03.719> have

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
open this one first looks like they have

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.240 
open this one first looks like they have
duct<00:02:04.110> tape<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:04.710> going<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.860> be<00:02:04.950> hard<00:02:05.130> to

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
duct tape so it's going to be hard to

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.950 
duct tape so it's going to be hard to
rip<00:02:05.549> through<00:02:05.729> duct<00:02:06.030> tape<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.570> do<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.840> my

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960
