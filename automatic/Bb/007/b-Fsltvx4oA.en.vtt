00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.269
 there is a rule not written in hollywood in 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.029
 which each time coincide in 

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:10.219
 poster two thematic films 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:13.099
 practically equal we had 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:16.039
 time two robin hood was that of kenny 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:19.310
 corner and another that the protagonist does not 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:23.000
 I remember who he was but he did not have 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.520
 success also coincided in billboard two 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.140
 animation movies about insects 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:33.679
 dig ants and disney bugs or 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.679
 we also had two imminent impacts 

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:40.850
 of meteorites in the ground nadal and for 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:43.820
 attract the husband and recently good 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.180
 he had also been turning over and dante's 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.580
 peak 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.150
 where erupting volcanoes and 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.610
 we have recently had two attacks 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.540
 terrorists to the casablanca assault to the 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:03.629
 power and objective the white house then 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:07.200
 well this will continue like this and next thing 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.710
 that we are going to have is going to be two hercules 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.640
 the mythological god with God means me 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.420
 gave human and let's watch two movies 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.969
 about this character one will be 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.610
 starring dwayne johnson more 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:25.979
 known as the rock and directed by 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.530
 brett grander the director of the trilogy 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.319
 from the tip to tell you some 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.469
 movies and the other is the one that does not arrive 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:38.159
 Well, I think at the end of this month that 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:40.979
 is run by renny harlin who 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.700
 previously he was a director at least 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.400
 of the unsuccessful guarantee of yours are the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.400
 crystal jungle 2 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.970
 maximum risk of steps or memory 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.490
 lethal but that of a time here then the 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.310
 uncle does not give us foot with ball and in fact 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.700
 his films were not released in theaters 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.650
 to change with these hercules that do not 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.380
 I remember what the legend says 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.590
 the beginning of the legend or something like that and 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.110
 is starring the twilight 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.880
 kellan lutz that looks like they're 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.190
 Engaged in Hollywood to make it a 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:24.000
 movie star that also comes out in the 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.600
 mercenaries 3 and co-starring 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.410
 scott adkins that was the bad guy that 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.320
 accompanied bands in mercenaries 2 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.590
 and also comes out in the movie lee ann 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.380
 mack as it's called they call me trail that 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.200
 it does not sound like anything but it's the actor that 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.100
 replaced the protagonist of the series 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.990
 spartacus the trailer of this version of 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.220
 Hercules then the truth that I do not 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.800
 he paints nothing well I think he's a doll and 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:01.110
 it seems a mix between the series before 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:05.370
 mentioned to spartacus and the 300 movie 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:09.470
 a mix between epic and halfway 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.470
 between the aviator 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.940
 A little bit seems like they wanted to give it a 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:21.400
 touch breaststroke and real and just makes it very 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.790
 adventurous and a little without elements 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.090
 fanciful but suddenly there in the middle 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.450
 take the culÃ©s and get a lightning and so with 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.450
 the sword 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:37.140
 a ghostly and the truth of the 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:40.750
 film painted the medium budget 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.300
 pulling low in statements the 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.120
 Director Renny Harlin was boasting 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.420
 of having shot the movie in about 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.160
 studies of bulgaria by far less 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.440
 of what the movie would have cost 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.230
 in hollywood said that of having shot 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.250
 this same movie in the studio of 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.990
 hollywood 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.040
 the budget would have amounted to 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.380
 350 million or something like that anyway I do not know 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.870
 what will have been spent on any film 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.940
 that are in the production company in charge of 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.280
 of the movie also responsible for the 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.890
 franchise of the mercenaries but to me 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.330
 the truth is the film does not paint me very 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.040
 well this recent premiere in the usa and 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.960
 well, he has not got the number one 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.290
 at the box office has been number four and 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.740
 with figures that do not 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.620
 and even if you like the twilight part 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.440
 of the rubiales this one as well yes that 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:39.230
 will be happy to go see it or fan 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:42.090
 tag kings or a roll of funk tacos and 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:44.670
 development and I leave the link of the Caribbean 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.800
 down here and anything that is 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.320
 happen then the happy 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.850
 I like what you see on the channel see 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.650
 all the videos stopped before 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.820
 news hunters to be at 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.820
 last until later
