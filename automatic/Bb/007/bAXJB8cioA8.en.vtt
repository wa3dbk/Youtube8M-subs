00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.450
 hello today we are going to make a guitar 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.979
 Spanish acoustic for this we have taken 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.690
 Template goals 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.880
 we have printed it and cut it 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.490
 once we have trimmed what 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.750
 let's do is pass it to cardboard let's 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.720
 to make two outstanding and one of a strip 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.420
 fine long 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.250
 and here we have the two done what 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.800
 let's do with the final strip we're going 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.160
 to give mobility moving the and with the 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.160
 hand 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:38.030
 and now what are we going to do 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.579
 take it off by the side silhouette 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.829
 guitar 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.850
 we're hitting the edge giving you all the 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.850
 guitar shape 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.160
 and we are talking about it little by little 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.160
 the shape 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.400
 if we still need more here so 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:01.740
 that we make that we cut another piece and 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.740
 then we hit it when we need it 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.450
 do not have here what you do, you are 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.210
 here glue and the only thing that then the 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.640
 we are hitting 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.440
 following the shape of the guitar 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.450
 once we have all the edge 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.550
 stuck what we're going to do is take 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.820
 silicone over here a glue what 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.670
 that you have and we are going to hit it 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.500
 so little by little giving it the shape of 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.240
 our guitar and we'll have some 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.790
 guitars 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.210
 for we have stuck with guitar 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.210
 paperboard 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.690
 we are totally glued to the guitar 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.910
 whole and now what we're going to do is 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.830
 with tail we are going to queue and with 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.420
 paper that we have broken into pieces 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.030
 we are going to put them on top 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.340
 and with the brush we will help each other and 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.880
 take work where needed 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.530
 put queue and now what we 're going to do 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.960
 is that we have put some cuts like 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.969
 you see so we can move it a lot 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.280
 we better line him up around here 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:07.200
 and we already pay everything 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.990
 we have made cuts everywhere for 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.700
 that we can move the paper with more 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.840
 ease 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:19.170
 Well, we have our guitar dry 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.150
 and this was a stone as you see clearly 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.300
 what we are going to do is the little hole that 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.010
 take the guitar here or this is more 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.810
 or less done by eye but let's see what 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.810
 I wanted to cut it too you can trace it 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.879
 or with those of a glue wastes 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.209
 would help to make round will almost be 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:39.140
 easier and now with a knife what 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.140
 let's put a little 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.440
 and we are going to do little by little the 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.060
 Round shape 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.130
 we have already cut it and now what 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.250
 we're going to do is paint it the color that 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.620
 you want but will be already painting gold 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.349
 now you can paint more 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.280
 even here or here it will be colored 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:02.650
 dark brown then we have our 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.540
 painted guitar 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.120
 I painted it golden brown so that 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.420
 it looked more clear and here the edge with 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.310
 dark brown 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.640
 and here, as you can see, we have done it 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:18.420
 round on the edge on the edge here 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.530
 here we have also made it the edge 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.050
 behind 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.340
 for what we are doing is a seal 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:30.100
 that we have done on a sheet I 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.840
 I'm running the stamp's internet 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.790
 alhambra to make it look like the guitar 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.489
 Is real 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.730
 that this is the original and now what 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:44.180
 I'm going to do is pass it to a pen and 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.540
 So paint that red so that it's 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.430
 the closest thing 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.159
 Well, we have our stamp done 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.359
 look at what original has stayed and now 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.189
 what we are going to do is throw a 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:57.760
 little glue on the bottom we fold it 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:04:00.659
 so we passed it and we already put it and what 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.659
 we stick down 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.799
 let's put the guitar string 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.989
 for this we are going to need two pieces 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.180
 so cardboard what we've done what 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.910
 we cut and we painted 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.380
 dark brown and now let's do the 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.840
 knots 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.840
 to put our guitar string 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:37.000
 the knot is made and it gets into the cardboard and 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.000
 now it hits 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.770
 when we have the ropes like this in this 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.080
 I'm going to put three we put them in 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.020
 the little hole and we hit it and up here 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.210
 with the west kid we paste them like that 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.139
 also the ones to put like you 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.150
 you want 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.370
 we call but the one below and now what 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.349
 we do are tighten the strings to 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.770
 put the other and what we do for 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.770
 over 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.370
 and now this what we have left over what 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.900
 let's cut here 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.199
 Now what we are going to do is with a 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:21.340
 stick and with white paint we are going to 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:23.610
 wet and let's do a few dots like 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.610
 here 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:30.919
 and now two here 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:48.370
 and we have our guitar finished 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:51.370
 what to see what cool we have been left 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.370
