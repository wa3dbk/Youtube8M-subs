00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.849
 hey people here i mean little 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.650
 Do not call yourself next 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.240
 Presentation and must for the euro truck 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.800
 simulator 2 welcome 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.609
 I present you this fashion idea 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.560
 a motor of real like here in the game 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.249
 makes and I will first the 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:31.789
 Change that makes the fashion yes enumerate 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:33.860
 and then would have to watch a little bit 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.989
 whether we there already that here one or the other 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.210
 in the fashion show can see and 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.590
 then i start with the changes we 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.690
 stay here for a short time 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.510
 may be users but maybe again 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:48.080
 to start driving as I said so 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.400
 the first change is that the trucks and 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.170
 vehicles now with one 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.290
 drive more realistic speed 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.970
 at truck so that now maximum 88 km / h 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.220
 drive but definitely drive now 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.990
 faster than without the mode without the 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.820
 always use the 70 km h on the 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.100
 highway driven and in real time the 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.229
 truck I usually 80 km h on the 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.659
 highway and drive through the fashion 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.750
 then stop at 8 I am 88 km h in the 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.360
 turn it is like that now too 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.290
 the k trucks turn each other on the 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.800
 Overhauling highways and that is still the case 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.460
 that at least so understood that yet 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.800
 the proportion of k trucks and cars increased 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.470
 has been 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.909
 So that now more cars and trucks on 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.080
 the streets are on the way 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.440
 then the fuel prices were still 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.979
 adapted so made more realistic 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:46.159
 additional vehicles like the kia 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:48.770
 they were unlocked and one 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.990
 Traffic day was added then 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.930
 there's a sixth point and that 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.080
 I name the car park 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.240
 understand this now too 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.530
 Trucks and cars in the parking lot is 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.850
 also that they also go on it 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.619
 and relationships and pickups in the 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.129
 parking then stop on 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.599
 but if that's right, that's it 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.960
 at the parking lots at the gas stations 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.090
 or if only 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.010
 chakuza fact is that you go there 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.160
 and stand in the parking lot and 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.690
 not only to the disease and then 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.000
 as a third point it is still so 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.910
 Now all the vehicles in the game 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.800
 available have been unlocked 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.540
 and that's all the changes 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.610
 it has been some changes and 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.590
 that really makes the whole thing over again 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.720
 a lot more realistic and look now 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.240
 Let's go see a truck somewhere 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.590
 because we can best meet 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.030
 now look first then whether the 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.220
 drive really fast over there 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.140
 some on the way or will we come 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.990
 par excellence , brand was slow bit 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.520
 straight ahead maybe someday 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:53.910
 we can catch up with this bad now 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.610
 if now 80 58 80 km h drive because we 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.520
 yes drive normal and there it is 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.380
 a bit complicated but delayed 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.630
 beet with a lot of traffic but here 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.770
 nothing is going on at all , of course 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.270
 welcome 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.970
 Altrich about it we can still pictures 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.420
 vacation then the rider then happy 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.880
 can then switch to the other one 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.420
 some start comparison still 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.620
 some truck carries then I am times 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.750
 we can try it 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.730
 he could slow down from behind 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.160
 maybe someday and someday 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:34.730
 then yes then overtake the 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:38.550
 One another's lawyer here 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:42.500
 deal is bad about that had ford 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.500
 a weight training as a transporter 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.690
 others we can do badly now 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.200
 We can then look again most 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.390
 until the car park, wait for a truck 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.680
 plant with the parking lot in beginnings 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.420
 really so far the money on the 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.570
 parcours pass them or whether something 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.480
 So, other things happen that I stop there 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.250
 Where trucks can park their car 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.860
 go down there on the 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.300
 parquet order the first name already 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:16.940
 truck to see how fast it drives 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:17.690
 Reinhold is not yet nominated for that 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.000
 definitely something 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.650
 drive faster in any case monument 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.680
 over 80 the flag will be two 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.330
 attacking is more forward 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.360
 maybe one more holding one 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.430
 But first time to bring in or 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.440
 comes the radar 90 may maximum 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.490
 drive 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.750
 well that's pretty fast 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.090
 on the way but definitely faster 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.270
 as per head it is definitely 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:44.630
 faster on the way than he does without the courage 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.370
 to 80 km / h yes that perfect 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.230
 isolated 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.400
 yes, you realize responsibility for 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.360
 every case faster 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.250
 two would have you 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.969
 had been slow but that was 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:01.530
 now around the 80 km / h elements market 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:03.479
 80 inserts right next to the point but 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.259
 sometimes he drives around 80 km / h 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.400
 can 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:09.780
 Annika trucks here 88 mm already here 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.539
 I notice there is speed in it 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.550
 and yes we the distance is greater 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:19.439
 the truck so he still drives 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:23.580
 I go faster than 80 km / h 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:26.009
 So it should be pretty fast 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.960
 over six after sure than between 80 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.849
 and 85, who drives here now 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.430
 macke vision a guest here faster 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.199
 On the way you can already see that 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.360
 and now pretty good because it 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:40.550
 totally weird if then the other trucks 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.449
 or 70 mph drive that may sometimes 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.550
 much more realistic so of it 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.389
 to take over parking I think so 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.240
 that we are here now 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:51.650
 such parking can only depart the 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.650
 put another new day 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.389
 now can overtake again about 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:01.070
 Of course, look bad and the 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.790
 11 All vehicles in all countries 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.990
 unlocked 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:10.760
 because now we can not 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:13.460
 also bad nachwieck in the 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.620
 August again or in too many I have 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:22.460
 never seen how to stroll 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:24.830
 I've never seen him here with me he is 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.300
 I think we have two new ones 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.500
 winning has characterized a vacancy 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.280
 for example, for example 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.340
 probably or if so 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.770
 in the first level 5 or so very accurate 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.419
 do not check all the cars here 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.520
 on the road no idea 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:41.780
 but just like that and then you have 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.789
 but then if you have the motorcycle 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.530
 then everybody stops then 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:47.479
 different car types york streets 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.100
 return well 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:50.389
 there it was already with the mode 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.180
 I can do fashion here on everyone 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:55.220
 case only recommend country game number 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.599
 want to have more realistic 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.289
 for you is that the truck I now 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:59.289
 times faster on the go 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:05.210
 you are not in one at all 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.950
 every minute a truck or here in the game 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.810
 such a one if one does not have the mode 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.970
 It's actually as good as that 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.639
 every minute you overtake a truck here 

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:16.340
 and experience more realistic 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:18.380
 speeds and such and it is whole 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.910
 beautiful and definitely can only 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.130
 recommend to have real normal 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.840
 but there were many other great 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.800
 changes with the realistic ones 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.160
 reject 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.419
 and yes, I'm curious maybe 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.740
 next one of you what parking 

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:31.849
 approaches then it means I might come 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.889
 I would write in the comments 

00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:34.849
 definitely makes it happen and the 

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:36.320
 Otherwise , in any case many more 

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:38.180
 good things added i can do that 

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.320
 courage in any case only recommend and 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.639
 download against pouring the description 

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.300
 many spectators and skin times 

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:43.300
 meant alone
