something and this is what I've done now

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.349 
something and this is what I've done now
this<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:22.010> what<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.039> would<00:00:23.160> call<00:00:23.490> probably<00:00:24.029> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
this is what I would call probably the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.980 
this is what I would call probably the
mean<00:00:24.600> baby<00:00:24.990> of<00:00:25.230> Excalibur<00:00:26.449> because<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.779> is

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
mean baby of Excalibur because this is

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.389 
mean baby of Excalibur because this is
small<00:00:28.429> but<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.269> lot<00:00:30.689> thicker<00:00:31.189> and<00:00:32.189> I

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
small but this is a lot thicker and I

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.720 
small but this is a lot thicker and I
had<00:00:32.700> beef<00:00:33.000> here<00:00:33.390> it's<00:00:34.140> also<00:00:34.380> done<00:00:34.800> made<00:00:35.430> from

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
had beef here it's also done made from

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.619 
had beef here it's also done made from
the<00:00:35.910> thicker<00:00:36.450> steel<00:00:37.100> this<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.579> thought<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.480> it

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
the thicker steel this I thought that it

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.200 
the thicker steel this I thought that it
was<00:00:39.899> 3<00:00:40.710> inch<00:00:40.920> wide<00:00:41.250> but<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.550> i<00:00:41.760> think<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.090> was

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
was 3 inch wide but it i think it was

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.110 
was 3 inch wide but it i think it was
two<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.629> half<00:00:42.809> inch<00:00:43.079> white<00:00:43.640> stuck<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
two and a half inch white stuck in the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.209 
two and a half inch white stuck in the
height<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.660> steel<00:00:46.160> here<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:48.170> death<00:00:49.219> let

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
height of the steel here and death let

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.000 
height of the steel here and death let
me<00:00:50.520> do<00:00:50.760> really<00:00:51.629> nice<00:00:51.809> contouring<00:00:52.350> even<00:00:52.860> on

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
me do really nice contouring even on

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.010 
me do really nice contouring even on
18-inch<00:00:53.670> played<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.239> whole<00:00:54.360> thing<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.750> 18

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
18-inch played the whole thing is 18

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.069 
18-inch played the whole thing is 18
inch<00:00:55.170> long<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.250> because<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.180> was<00:00:57.300> wider<00:00:57.600> steel

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
inch long so because it was wider steel

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.290 
inch long so because it was wider steel
i<00:00:58.379> was<00:00:58.800> able<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.219> do<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.579> whole<00:00:59.760> night<00:01:00.090> and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
i was able to do the whole night and

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.950 
i was able to do the whole night and
rounding<00:01:00.719> off<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.379> whole<00:01:01.559> thing<00:01:02.359> it's<00:01:03.359> 38

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
rounding off the whole thing it's 38

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.520 
rounding off the whole thing it's 38
stick<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.640> see<00:01:05.729> guys<00:01:06.320> this<00:01:07.320> is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.410 
stick so just so you see guys this is
regular<00:01:07.710> sharpie<00:01:08.460> right<00:01:08.700> check<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.630> out<00:01:11.420> it's

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
regular sharpie right check it out it's

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.460 
regular sharpie right check it out it's
the<00:01:13.350> Sharpie<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.070> pretty<00:01:14.580> much<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.470> same

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
the Sharpie is pretty much the same

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
the Sharpie is pretty much the same
exact<00:01:17.100> width<00:01:17.900> thickness<00:01:19.220> you<00:01:20.220> know<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
exact width thickness you know the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.130 
exact width thickness you know the
diameter<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.180> sharp<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.630> pretty<00:01:22.020> much<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
diameter of the sharp is pretty much the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.340 
diameter of the sharp is pretty much the
same<00:01:22.439> exact<00:01:22.830> thickness<00:01:23.009> as<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.810> grab<00:01:25.320> a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
same exact thickness as this so grab a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.890 
same exact thickness as this so grab a
sharpie<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.950> check<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.790> out<00:01:26.880> that's<00:01:27.299> how<00:01:27.390> take

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
sharpie and check it out that's how take

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.789 
sharpie and check it out that's how take
it<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.979> insane<00:01:30.020> gonna<00:01:31.020> go<00:01:31.200> for<00:01:31.439> hike<00:01:31.590> on

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
it it is insane gonna go for hike on

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.210 
it it is insane gonna go for hike on
legs<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.549> all<00:01:32.729> 12<00:01:33.180> steel<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.860> because

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
legs is that all 12 steel and because

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.359 
legs is that all 12 steel and because
it's<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.610> thick<00:01:35.939> i<00:01:36.409> will<00:01:37.409> go<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:37.770> high<00:01:37.890> convex

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
it's so thick i will go for high convex

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.429 
it's so thick i will go for high convex
i'm<00:01:38.579> still<00:01:38.909> gonna<00:01:39.090> have<00:01:39.270> plenty<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.750> mass<00:01:40.110> up

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
i'm still gonna have plenty of mass up

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.630 
i'm still gonna have plenty of mass up
front<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:41.009> still<00:01:41.189> going<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.369> be<00:01:41.430> nice<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
front it's still going to be nice and

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.490 
front it's still going to be nice and
heavy<00:01:41.909> right<00:01:42.270> now<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.720> still<00:01:42.930> over<00:01:43.079> 2<00:01:43.320> pounds

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
heavy right now it's still over 2 pounds

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.060 
heavy right now it's still over 2 pounds
my<00:01:43.890> scale<00:01:44.220> doesn't<00:01:44.430> pick<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.700> up<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:46.070> but

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
my scale doesn't pick it up so it's but

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.880 
my scale doesn't pick it up so it's but
again<00:01:47.520> because<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.420> big<00:01:48.659> handle<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.680> is

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
again because the big handle this is

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.340 
again because the big handle this is
smaller<00:01:50.280> than<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.579> Excalibur<00:01:51.329> by<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.930> same

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
smaller than on Excalibur by the same

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.889 
smaller than on Excalibur by the same
concept<00:01:53.070> except<00:01:53.460> with<00:01:53.579> one<00:01:53.610> difference<00:01:53.899> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
concept except with one difference the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.920 
concept except with one difference the
front<00:01:55.320> little<00:01:56.009> curve<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.939> shorter<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.719> one

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
front little curve is shorter is one

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.020 
front little curve is shorter is one
thing<00:01:58.170> shorter<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:59.430> when<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.640> grabbed<00:02:00.000> it

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
thing shorter so when I grabbed it

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.889 
thing shorter so when I grabbed it
actually<00:02:01.100> my<00:02:02.100> pinky<00:02:02.759> comes<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.360> end<00:02:03.780> here

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
actually my pinky comes on the end here

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.139 
actually my pinky comes on the end here
and<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:05.189> was<00:02:05.310> going<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.579> fit<00:02:05.759> probably<00:02:06.090> even

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
and it was going to fit probably even

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.660 
and it was going to fit probably even
better<00:02:06.299> on<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> bigger<00:02:06.960> hand<00:02:07.229> my<00:02:07.920> pinky<00:02:08.429> comes

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
better on the bigger hand my pinky comes

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.940 
better on the bigger hand my pinky comes
on<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.940> back<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.929> front<00:02:10.379> finger<00:02:10.679> child

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950

little<00:02:15.720> bump<00:02:15.959> is<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:16.379> small<00:02:16.739> that<00:02:16.799> it<00:02:17.010> should

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
little bump is so small that it should

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.710 
little bump is so small that it should

I'm going to do hand and probably these

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.610 
I'm going to do hand and probably these

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
know just really there I might as well

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.270 
know just really there I might as well
do<00:02:51.569> it<00:02:51.599> and<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.019> will<00:02:52.170> give<00:02:52.409> me<00:02:52.440> if<00:02:52.739> I<00:02:52.829> change<00:02:53.129> my

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
do it and it will give me if I change my

do it and it will give me if I change my
mind<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.639> will<00:02:53.790> give<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.060> more<00:02:54.090> options<00:02:54.299> in

the<00:02:55.590> future<00:02:56.069> lago<00:02:56.940> probably<00:02:57.420> here<00:02:57.920> now<00:02:58.920> I<00:02:59.340> had

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
the future lago probably here now I had

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.699 
the future lago probably here now I had
to<00:02:59.819> leave<00:03:00.269> this<00:03:00.510> a<00:03:00.569> lot<00:03:00.989> thicker<00:03:01.349> than<00:03:01.590> I

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
to leave this a lot thicker than I

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.410 
to leave this a lot thicker than I
normally<00:03:01.769> do<00:03:02.250> because<00:03:02.459> I'm<00:03:02.700> just<00:03:02.879> too<00:03:03.030> worried

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
normally do because I'm just too worried

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.530 
normally do because I'm just too worried
about<00:03:03.599> warping<00:03:04.590> because<00:03:05.129> 01<00:03:05.519> is<00:03:05.760> all<00:03:06.030> old

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
about warping because 01 is all old

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.399 
about warping because 01 is all old
quench<00:03:07.200> oil<00:03:07.829> quench<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:09.150> like<00:03:09.780> all<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.109> steel

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
quench oil quench and like all the steel

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.860 
quench oil quench and like all the steel
I've<00:03:10.950> used<00:03:11.430> before<00:03:11.730> they<00:03:12.030> were<00:03:12.299> all<00:03:12.569> air

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
I've used before they were all air

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.860 
I've used before they were all air
hardening<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.650> there's<00:03:14.099> a<00:03:14.190> lot<00:03:14.879> less<00:03:15.209> risk<00:03:15.599> of

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
hardening and there's a lot less risk of

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.809 
hardening and there's a lot less risk of
warping<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:17.459> quench<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.419> I<00:03:18.480> did<00:03:18.810> leave<00:03:19.049> this

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
warping the quench so I did leave this

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.640 
warping the quench so I did leave this
significantly<00:03:20.819> thicker<00:03:21.180> which<00:03:22.049> will<00:03:22.319> mean<00:03:22.590> a

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
significantly thicker which will mean a

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.939 
significantly thicker which will mean a
lot<00:03:22.919> more<00:03:23.370> work<00:03:23.639> after<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.120> heat<00:03:24.269> treat<00:03:24.540> and

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:24.949 
lot more work after the heat treat and

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.740 
lot more work after the heat treat and
this<00:03:25.949> was<00:03:26.129> insane<00:03:26.459> amount<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.819> work<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.419> took

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
this was insane amount of work it took

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.699 
this was insane amount of work it took
me<00:03:27.959> like<00:03:28.109> eight<00:03:28.379> belts<00:03:29.090> for<00:03:30.139> older<00:03:31.139> used<00:03:31.349> ones

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
me like eight belts for older used ones

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.589 
me like eight belts for older used ones
little<00:03:32.069> used<00:03:32.250> ones<00:03:32.549> I<00:03:32.849> just<00:03:33.120> killed<00:03:33.389> them<00:03:33.540> and

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
little used ones I just killed them and

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.990 
little used ones I just killed them and
I<00:03:33.900> think<00:03:33.959> three<00:03:34.349> or<00:03:34.379> four<00:03:34.799> brand-new<00:03:35.430> wants<00:03:35.819> a

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
I think three or four brand-new wants a

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.559 
I think three or four brand-new wants a
lot<00:03:36.720> of<00:03:36.900> work<00:03:37.139> what<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:38.069> lot<00:03:38.459> more<00:03:38.790> even<00:03:39.449> though

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
lot of work what a lot more even though

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.530 
lot of work what a lot more even though
it<00:03:39.599> is<00:03:39.750> smaller<00:03:40.290> this<00:03:41.040> was<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.400> lot<00:03:41.940> more<00:03:42.239> work

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
it is smaller this was a lot more work

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.420 
it is smaller this was a lot more work
than<00:03:42.780> when<00:03:42.959> I<00:03:42.989> did<00:03:43.230> Excalibur's<00:03:44.010> before

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
than when I did Excalibur's before

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.960 
than when I did Excalibur's before
because<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.540> might<00:03:45.750> not<00:03:45.780> think<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:46.500> but<00:03:46.970> that

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
because you might not think so but that

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.099 
because you might not think so but that
difference<00:03:48.599> of<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.579> 9<00:03:50.579> 30<00:03:50.970> seconds<00:03:51.750> which<00:03:52.079> is

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
difference of the 9 30 seconds which is

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.610 
difference of the 9 30 seconds which is
this<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.980> even<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.340> first<00:03:53.609> excalibur<00:03:54.269> was

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
this and even the first excalibur was

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.490 
this and even the first excalibur was
that<00:03:55.620> is<00:03:55.949> a<00:03:56.359> quite<00:03:57.359> a<00:03:57.389> lot<00:03:57.720> of<00:03:57.930> difference<00:03:58.349> in

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
that is a quite a lot of difference in

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.490 
that is a quite a lot of difference in
the<00:03:58.650> work<00:03:59.000> now<00:04:00.000> this<00:04:00.299> I<00:04:00.599> was<00:04:00.780> actually<00:04:00.959> able<00:04:01.290> to

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
the work now this I was actually able to

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.710 
the work now this I was actually able to
cut<00:04:01.859> with<00:04:02.069> my<00:04:02.220> band<00:04:02.459> saw<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:03.060> band<00:04:03.239> so<00:04:03.419> I<00:04:03.449> have

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
cut with my band saw the band so I have

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.589

oh say it's gonna need a very thin very
very<00:05:33.900> thin<00:05:34.200> handle<00:05:34.590> scales<00:05:34.830> so<00:05:35.310> it<00:05:35.460> won't

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
very thin handle scales so it won't

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.210 
very thin handle scales so it won't
leave<00:05:35.850> me<00:05:36.030> much<00:05:36.240> space<00:05:36.600> for<00:05:37.010> running<00:05:38.010> over<00:05:38.100> the

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
leave me much space for running over the

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.170 
leave me much space for running over the
handle<00:05:38.669> actually<00:05:39.390> there<00:05:39.510> is<00:05:39.540> so<00:05:39.870> thick<00:05:40.260> that

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
handle actually there is so thick that

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.330 
handle actually there is so thick that
it<00:05:42.180> would<00:05:42.660> be<00:05:42.870> confidentially<00:05:43.800> comfortable

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
it would be confidentially comfortable

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.159 
it would be confidentially comfortable
even<00:05:44.580> if<00:05:44.700> I<00:05:44.790> would<00:05:45.000> just<00:05:45.270> round<00:05:45.510> of<00:05:45.720> the<00:05:45.840> metal

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
even if I would just round of the metal

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.680 
even if I would just round of the metal
itself<00:05:46.400> which<00:05:47.400> is<00:05:47.430> insane<00:05:47.910> no<00:05:48.150> I<00:05:48.330> could<00:05:48.570> never

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
itself which is insane no I could never

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.290 
itself which is insane no I could never
do<00:05:48.930> that<00:05:48.960> but<00:05:49.380> it<00:05:49.980> so<00:05:50.280> take<00:05:50.520> that<00:05:50.580> it<00:05:50.850> would

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
do that but it so take that it would

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.800 
do that but it so take that it would
actually<00:05:51.950> it<00:05:52.950> would<00:05:53.310> make<00:05:53.550> for<00:05:53.580> this<00:05:54.180> handle

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
actually it would make for this handle

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.150 
actually it would make for this handle
and<00:05:56.090> even<00:05:57.090> know<00:05:57.180> anything<00:05:57.360> guys<00:05:58.100> I'm<00:05:59.100> very

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160
