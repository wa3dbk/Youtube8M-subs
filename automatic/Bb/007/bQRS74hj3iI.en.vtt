 hello youtube friends today I bring you my 

00:00:02.749 --> 00:00:07.040
 first video tutorial is not equal 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.990
 history I have the solution for a 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.250
 very common problem to people who 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.140
 they have the cope of windows 7 which we 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.700
 a message appears at the bottom of 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.850
 our screen that tells us what 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.850
 following 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.000
 in 27 combinations I experienced saying 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.610
 this problem is the solution 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.219
 we open our web browser 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.730
 and we copy the following link 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.730
 leave it in the description of the video 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.840
 let's go to the download page 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.040
 [Music] 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.040
 we wait for the 44 seconds that they ask us 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.430
 well once she in terms 44 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.570
 seconds of waiting we will have this 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.939
 normal download window we will click 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.659
 and when she when we have already 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.259
 downloaded we will have a rar file 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.259
 like this field 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.210
 this file will give you right click and 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.510
 extract here 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.310
 once we have extracted 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.700
 the rar file will have a folder left 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.700
 like this one 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.090

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.990

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.170

 good will be loading 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.630
 they opened a window which to me 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:05.420
 it seems like reversing and reversing because 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.960
 I have it installed but you will get it 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.960

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.930
 apply you will click and 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:18.730
 it will automatically be installed 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.859
 once you have finished the 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.469
 installation automatically 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:25.900
 will restart when it has restarted 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:30.060

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:34.620
