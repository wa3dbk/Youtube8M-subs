you can do it breaking yeah yeah Ramone
was<00:02:31.360> telling<00:02:31.660> me<00:02:31.720> about<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:31.959> earlier<00:02:32.230> when

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
was telling me about that earlier when

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.660 
was telling me about that earlier when
you<00:02:32.530> learn<00:02:32.680> how<00:02:32.739> to<00:02:32.830> tie<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.100> right<00:02:33.340> after<00:02:33.580> you

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
you learn how to tie the right after you

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.160 
you learn how to tie the right after you
hit<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.820> six<00:02:34.090> eight<00:02:34.209> feet<00:02:34.330> on<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.540> ground<00:02:34.720> keep

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
hit a six eight feet on the ground keep

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.750 
hit a six eight feet on the ground keep
doing<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:35.769> can<00:02:36.010> guess<00:02:36.190> you<00:02:36.400> could<00:02:36.550> do<00:02:36.670> it

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
doing it you can guess you could do it

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.520 
doing it you can guess you could do it
again<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.330> it'll<00:02:37.480> be<00:02:37.690> everything<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.230> sets

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
again and it'll be everything that sets

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.229 
again and it'll be everything that sets
hand<00:02:38.709> of<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:38.890> gun<00:02:39.100> yeah<00:02:39.550> so<00:02:39.880> when<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.060> get

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
hand of a gun yeah so when you get

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.850 
hand of a gun yeah so when you get
someone<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.630> point<00:02:40.810> where<00:02:40.959> 660<00:02:41.410> breaks<00:02:41.680> to

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
someone to the point where 660 breaks to

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.350 
someone to the point where 660 breaks to
me<00:02:41.950> they<00:02:42.220> just<00:02:42.250> have<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:42.700> stand<00:02:42.910> up<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.180> take

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
me they just have to stand up and take

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.560 
me they just have to stand up and take
it<00:02:44.459> like<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.550> do<00:02:45.670> stand<00:02:45.940> up<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.209> take<00:02:46.300> it<00:02:46.360> or

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
it like you do stand up and take it or

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.900 
it like you do stand up and take it or
usually<00:02:46.840> like<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.920> don't<00:02:48.250> see<00:02:48.550> what<00:02:48.670> this<00:02:48.760> he

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
yeah you would think that but a lot of

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.960 
yeah you would think that but a lot of
times<00:02:57.530> you're<00:02:57.830> on<00:02:57.950> stage<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.490> the<00:02:58.580> pressures

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
times you're on stage and the pressures

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.150 
times you're on stage and the pressures
on<00:02:59.120> your<00:02:59.570> mind<00:02:59.840> is<00:03:00.110> just<00:03:00.320> sewing<00:03:00.680> tuned<00:03:00.920> on

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
on your mind is just sewing tuned on

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.040 
on your mind is just sewing tuned on
what<00:03:01.430> you<00:03:01.580> have<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.970> do<00:03:02.150> within<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.480> match<00:03:02.660> I

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
what you have to do within the match I

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.720 
what you have to do within the match I
understand<00:03:03.590> thinking<00:03:04.040> about<00:03:04.160> that<00:03:04.400> between

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
understand thinking about that between

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.940 
understand thinking about that between
90<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.270> think<00:03:05.660> that<00:03:06.020> one<00:03:06.290> thing<00:03:06.530> is<00:03:06.560> something

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
90 I think that one thing is something

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.190 
90 I think that one thing is something
he<00:03:07.070> needs<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:07.550> win<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.910> match<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.570> free<00:03:08.930> rein

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
he needs to win the match is free rein

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.480 
he needs to win the match is free rein
to<00:03:09.230> move<00:03:09.620> yes

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490
