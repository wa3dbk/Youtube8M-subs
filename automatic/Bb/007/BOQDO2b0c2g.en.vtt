00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.279
 hello how are you enjoying the best and 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.600
 when I bring them two mods and good 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.310
 you will wonder what this is 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.320
 the two mods and good old ones 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.450
 subscribers will already know that because I 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.910
 I used to make two bikes for a good video 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.650
 if the mod were simple and so and so 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.300
 Well, I practically stopped doing that 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.190
 due to time and all that but good 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.440
 now decided for this occasion 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.930
 bring him two bikes again because then 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.390
 I have two simple mods that are good 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.190
 if I would recommend them a lot and not 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.870
 wants to make a video for each motorcycle already 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.090
 that are too simple good not so 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.980
 simple but good is worth it 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.140
 teach the two modes in the same video 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.600
 not then it's good mechanics 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.640
 the two bikes if you think it's a good idea 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.260
 continue with these the two modes with 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.230
 the very simple ones in a video and everything 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.480
 this leave your like for to demonstrate 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.729
 that they like this and well that I 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.530
 can look for simple mods and upload them in 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.790
 a good video the first way that 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.470
 we have is the 'show' norwich 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.030
 the two are virtually mode of laughter 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.740
 my 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.540
 that is the creator of the way that does not 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.490
 would be creative for everything to work 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.350
 perfect and as you can see here we have 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.080
 practically what would be the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.770
 normal spanair that is from the pig this is 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.299
 for nothing else, they are little fingers 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.979
 and well what we can do now 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.310
 with this mode is to right click and 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.799
 power is to put what we want 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.330
 we simply have to select what 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.490
 you sell in the way we want 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.170
 appear let's say spiders we 're going 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.990
 night so they can appear 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.580
 obviously it should not appear 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.550
 let's see if the lighting allows 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.320
 that the spider appears 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.640
 in espanyol as you can see now in 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.590
 Instead of being the pig it is now 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.170
 spider and that we can do with all 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.820
 modes there it is and our first 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.370
 spider we can put that appear 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.230
 giants 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.940
 but I do not know if in this space so 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.110
 reduced a giant can appear 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.710
 we can also make it appear 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.240
 under dragon I think this one of the dragon 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.550
 it has to appear in the very flat area 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.620
 since I appeared in a super world 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.480
 I do not think that here in this little corner 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.400
 can appear but good practically 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.260
 is that not just being able to scan 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.450
 everyone up to the winner we can expose 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.210
 we can expose all the modes that 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.560
 We want this this is best for 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.260
 adventure maps for people who 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.080
 create adventure maps or a survival or 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.030
 anything this is the best that is 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.890
 100% recommended because in addition to that 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.570
 You can then put the musts you want 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.040
 that appear in a certain place 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.550
 you can also disable spam is 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.230
 let's say you put a le vert it itches the 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.790
 lever and now it simply 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.320
 Deactivate Spanish as you can see already 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.300
 is deactivated they will no longer appear 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.820
 the magma that now everything must be 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.560
 perfect then that 's perfect for 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.330
 the maps because let's say there's a 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.890
 valley a pressure plate you step on it and 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.930
 by stepping on the active pauner and already 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.370
 begin to appear mods there is no 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.900
 many things that can be done with 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.390
 this mode for adventure maps 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.490
 we can also do it with circuits 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.620
 in this way many circuits 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.390
 it works just like you can see then 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.460
 Well, we can do a lot of things there 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.260
 with this and well well yes I recommend 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.850
 this way the truth then we have what 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.680
 would be the book leader that 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.260
 we are you have asked me to 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.870
 several videos that what is the mod 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.450
 that he used for craft eos since he already 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.100
 that any way you aim and that you add 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.050
 characters like the mocri tours that 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.030
 you have to make new skulls like 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.520
 some new modes that add materials 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.900
 new new swords and all that and that 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.240
 you do not know how to make them craft eos 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.280
 you just install this mod 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.870
 kraft that makes the book that comes here and 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.730
 right click and all costs go 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.530
 to come as you can see to capture the 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.890
 Recipe book that is practically the 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.860
 book you need a normal and exact book 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.200
 saying then octopus ink and 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.750
 automatically this is the first 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.940
 page then to the right with with 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.120
 the little arrows we can simply go 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.910
 seeing all all the characters 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.720
 perfectly and the expenses of all 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.910
 mods are simply going to be placed 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.160
 on the last page that is to say this is the 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.570
 first page we go to a space 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.880
 to the back that practically 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.700
 I would go back to the last page and here 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.870
 after the boom milk 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.340
 here they would begin to place the new 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.410
 craft eos of the mods that you 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.930
 install or so then if it works 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.420
 a lot for then for all the craft eos 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.250
 since many times we get confused and what 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.050
 it's better that it 's in the game then you 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.550
 you can go walking in the mine and if it is 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.650
 a craft of flying you open it and now 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.180
 you continue then there is no need to 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.910
 do nothing but bring your book 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.270
 no and well basically these are both 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:45.030
 mods the truth is they are very good and the 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.790
 Creator of the mods is the same root 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.380
 ugam and since well I think that 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.000
 It's pretty good, I hope you 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.770
 have liked these two modes ensure is 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.350
 support the idea of the two modes 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.840
 again to see if yes you can 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.400
 progress this series and well this has 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.800
 been everything let's see how they are installed 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.629
 these these mods and they like 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.800
 and it's good to say I sing the first thing that 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:06.330
 we have to do to install these 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.069
 modes is to enter because they are left 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.900
 description of the risga you put me 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:12.599
 entering we will lower it as you can see 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.919
 to say mod loader 1.4 point 5 or the 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:16.139
 version that you can install this 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.699
 mod and we're just going to give it in 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.080
 download direct pack will download 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.030
 automatically as you can see it 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.789
 download a mod loader you can also 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.860
 give a play download to support the 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.990
 creator of the mod since by the networks in 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.610
 the page that you can support the 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.340
 creators of the mods and then there they go up 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.080
 your links too and well let's go down 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.930
 until you find what would come 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.219
 being our pauner week as 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.139
 can see here we are equally 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:42.240
 download direct download aspa and as 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.560
 you want and the 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.060
 spanair wii now simply you 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.740
 We keep going down until we find the 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.990
 bookmark as you can see here is 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.210
 we do exactly the same download 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.370
 they direct the spray and ready and are 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.229
 the three bikes now downloaded the 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.509
 we have to bring to the desk to 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:59.969
 to be able to install everything better and therefore not 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:01.650
 we stir up or get confused and 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:03.400
 ready we're just going to start by 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.410
 2% app 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.020
 is percent with I'm fighting here 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.000
 percent and for users of some xp 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.620
 here it gives them seems to run already 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.360
 they put percent pp is percent us 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.590
 we go to the folder the roaming we go 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.660
 to the main point folder that was the 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.360
 bean minecraft folder right click to 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.560
 open with windows art chivers the folder 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.539
 well we can close it now 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.960
 we need and here you see that founded far 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:26.860
 we select goal and eliminate if 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.990
 make sure you delete that folder called 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.300
 goal and pnv because if they do not eliminate him then 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.320
 they will grow minecraft and if from a 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.479
 principle is not that folder 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.160
 simply ignored in this step and good 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.350
 Now, let's continue as you can see me as 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.419
 of model is to put u and the end I received 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:42.220
 book from making our order 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:44.110
 installation then we open load modes 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.340
 the first one and we select all the 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.139
 files that nothing between the posts to 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.370
 minecraft hard point preferably in 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.139
 the bottom part and here day can be 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.010
 put into a folder we will accept and 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:53.020
 ready 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.789
 we move the motor since it is installed 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.530
 correctly now we open the broadsword 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:58.840
 erwin we do the same thing we select 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.430
 everything happened to accept and was 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.780
 installed the broadsword are we move it 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.880
 we opened we received book and we do 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.380
 exactly the same practically nothing 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.950
 more is to copy the files of the 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.510
 minecraft dot jar 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.460
 and everything must be perfect too 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.020
 eliminate goal and pnv and you should not 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.300
 of having any kind of crash me all
