Sutra: How to curl your hair with a sutra
magnetic flat iron.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:43.980
divide your hair into two sections.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.309
clip up the top half.

00:00:51.309 --> 00:01:03.040
take of flat piece of hair 2" wide.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:41.430
flip the iron 360 degrees toward the top.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.880
guide the iron down slowly through your hair
in a downward angle.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.880
keep the hair tightly sealed between the plates
for the entire motion.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.607
for a tighter curl start the flip closer to
the root, or take smaller pieces of hair.

00:01:50.607 --> 00:01:52.770
for a wavy look, start the curl half way through.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.320
For a curlier look, glide the iron slowly.
