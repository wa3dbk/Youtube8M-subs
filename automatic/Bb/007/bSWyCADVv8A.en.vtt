00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
here the lens itself is curved and what

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.780 
here the lens itself is curved and what
that<00:00:42.079> does<00:00:42.320> is<00:00:42.350> create<00:00:42.890> sort<00:00:43.100> of<00:00:43.160> a<00:00:43.250> distortion

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790 
that does is create sort of a distortion

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.860 
that does is create sort of a distortion

180 degree field of view it's a it's 180
s<00:00:49.760> actually<00:00:50.120> like<00:00:50.239> 175<00:00:51.199> but<00:00:52.129> what<00:00:52.699> it<00:00:52.820> does<00:00:53.000> do

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
s actually like 175 but what it does do

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.329 
s actually like 175 but what it does do
is<00:00:53.239> give<00:00:53.629> you<00:00:53.839> just<00:00:54.199> these<00:00:54.350> huge<00:00:54.710> panoramas

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
is give you just these huge panoramas

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.040 
is give you just these huge panoramas
but<00:00:56.150> that's<00:00:56.329> not<00:00:56.480> what<00:00:56.659> a<00:00:56.690> lot<00:00:56.839> of<00:00:56.930> people

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
but that's not what a lot of people

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.469 
but that's not what a lot of people
using<00:00:57.320> for<00:00:57.710> extreme<00:00:58.550> sports<00:00:58.579> photography<00:00:59.420> is

00:00:59.469 --> 00:00:59.479 
using for extreme sports photography is

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:00.820 
using for extreme sports photography is
probably<00:00:59.750> one<00:00:59.900> of<00:00:59.930> the<00:01:00.049> single<00:01:00.260> most<00:01:00.439> common

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
probably one of the single most common

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.679 
probably one of the single most common
applications<00:01:01.369> for<00:01:01.519> this<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:02.059> as<00:01:02.269> soon<00:01:02.449> as<00:01:02.600> you

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:02.689 
applications for this and as soon as you

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:04.090 
applications for this and as soon as you
see<00:01:02.900> the<00:01:03.080> effect<00:01:03.379> you'll<00:01:03.589> really<00:01:03.799> be<00:01:03.860> able<00:01:03.979> to

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
see the effect you'll really be able to

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.770 
see the effect you'll really be able to
recognize<00:01:04.489> it<00:01:04.820> from<00:01:04.970> such<00:01:05.390> things<00:01:05.600> as

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
recognize it from such things as

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.590 
recognize it from such things as
skateboard<00:01:06.260> videos<00:01:06.650> snowboarding<00:01:07.430> videos

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
skateboard videos snowboarding videos

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.609 
skateboard videos snowboarding videos

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
scene now this is the lens with really

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.550 
scene now this is the lens with really
good<00:01:13.430> build<00:01:13.670> quality<00:01:13.759> the<00:01:14.689> focal<00:01:15.049> gears<00:01:15.290> work

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
good build quality the focal gears work

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.620 
good build quality the focal gears work
really<00:01:15.860> well<00:01:15.979> they're<00:01:16.520> very<00:01:16.549> smooth<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:17.330> so

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
really well they're very smooth and so

goes up to 15 n which means you can get

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.069 
goes up to 15 n which means you can get
a<00:01:25.880> little<00:01:26.210> more<00:01:26.450> like<00:01:26.630> additional

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
a little more like additional

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:28.899 
a little more like additional
photography<00:01:27.229> but<00:01:28.189> the<00:01:28.310> thing<00:01:28.340> is<00:01:28.490> still<00:01:28.790> going

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
photography but the thing is still going

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.760 
photography but the thing is still going
to<00:01:28.970> be<00:01:29.030> very<00:01:29.270> distorted<00:01:29.750> but<00:01:30.350> it's<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.560> kind

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
to be very distorted but it's the kind

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.560

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
distortion that will bring an edge to a

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.190 
distortion that will bring an edge to a
certain<00:01:34.460> type<00:01:34.610> of<00:01:34.640> video<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:35.840> if<00:01:36.050> you're
