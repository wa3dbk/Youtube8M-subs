00:00:09.687 --> 00:00:11.684
 - What the city can do for its citizens 

00:00:11.684 --> 00:00:13.751
 What is outside the boundary 

00:00:13.751 --> 00:00:17.030
 It has been exaggeratedly exaggerated. 

00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:21.382
 - Move it fast! 

00:00:21.382 --> 00:00:23.055
 Move, quickly! 

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:24.022
 - As you know, 

00:00:24.022 --> 00:00:26.576
 What made such an exaggeration 

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:30.051
 These are manipulated facts. 

00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:32.137
 - Good job. 

00:00:32.137 --> 00:00:33.504
 - Through it 

00:00:33.504 --> 00:00:36.155
 It is trying to pollute the hearts of all our citizens. 

00:00:36.915 --> 00:00:39.743
 Do not ignore, energize ... 

00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:41.689
 - Citizen, please stop on the spot. 

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:43.933
 The marshal will be coming soon. 

00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.535
 Thank you for your cooperation. 

00:00:51.425 --> 00:00:53.503
 citizen. I now violated the command myself. 

00:00:53.503 --> 00:00:54.456
 Stop right now! 

00:00:58.454 --> 00:00:59.189
 - I started running away. 

00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:12.131
 - Headquarters, 10-13 in pursuit. 

00:01:27.832 --> 00:01:29.309
 - Hey, stop! 

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:31.084
 - I'll go back to the tower. 

00:01:35.476 --> 00:01:36.852
 - We need support. 

00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:06.455
 - Air support is in progress. 

00:02:06.455 --> 00:02:07.800
 - Not required. 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.699
 - To die outside the city. 

00:02:11.452 --> 00:02:16.452
 It is just a bait running from our noses. 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.966
 The city is ... 

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:21.403
 - End simulation. 

00:02:21.403 --> 00:02:23.371
 Turning off hologram power. 

00:02:43.425 --> 00:02:45.832
 - No! then no! 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:47.116
 - too late! 

00:02:47.116 --> 00:02:48.335
 I already turned it off!
