00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
can see this power by Intel y7 processor

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.240 
can see this power by Intel y7 processor
it<00:00:31.650> also<00:00:31.800> has<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.309> gtx<00:00:33.290> 970m<00:00:34.290> graphics<00:00:34.410> card<00:00:35.100> in

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
it also has a gtx 970m graphics card in

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.060 
it also has a gtx 970m graphics card in
there<00:00:35.480> speakers<00:00:36.480> developed<00:00:36.989> by<00:00:37.079> yamaha<00:00:37.829> and

there speakers developed by yamaha and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.970 
there speakers developed by yamaha and
this<00:00:39.000> thing<00:00:39.210> really<00:00:39.360> packs<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:40.170> good<00:00:40.410> punch<00:00:40.770> in

this thing really packs a good punch in
there<00:00:41.250> for<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:41.850> you've<00:00:41.969> got<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.450> lot<00:00:42.930> of

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
there for it so you've got a lot of

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.020 
there for it so you've got a lot of
graphical<00:00:43.440> capabilities<00:00:43.649> here<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
graphical capabilities here in the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.020 
graphical capabilities here in the
system<00:00:45.539> again<00:00:45.840> it's<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> 27-inch<00:00:46.590> only<00:00:46.920> one<00:00:47.129> you

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
system again it's a 27-inch only one you

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.420 
system again it's a 27-inch only one you
can<00:00:48.180> see<00:00:48.390> how<00:00:48.539> smooth<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.890> basically<00:00:50.039> if

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
can see how smooth it is so basically if

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.990 
can see how smooth it is so basically if
you're<00:00:50.550> looking<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:51.530> that<00:00:52.530> gaming<00:00:53.129> PC<00:00:53.699> that

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
you're looking for that gaming PC that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.959 
you're looking for that gaming PC that
really<00:00:54.539> gives<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.989> something<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:56.399> little

extra<00:00:57.090> in<00:00:57.539> terms<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.899> an<00:00:58.020> all-in-one<00:00:58.260> and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
extra in terms of an all-in-one and

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.319 
extra in terms of an all-in-one and
especially<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.340> know<00:00:59.460> space<00:00:59.789> savings<00:01:00.210> and
