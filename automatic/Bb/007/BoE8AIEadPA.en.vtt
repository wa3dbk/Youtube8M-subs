00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420
 by 10 m youtube subscribers today 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.740
 samsung made his big conference anpact 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.940
 2015 where they showed their two big 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.969
 devices the samsung galaxy s 6 and the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.820
 s 6 age in this video I'm going to talk to you 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.710
 of the conference specifically from 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.180
 these two devices we go with a logo 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.180
 and let's start with the video 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.240
 sad guys the conference started to 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.980
 eleven thirty now chicago us 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.960
 gabriel and I were live I'm going to 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.510
 leave the full conference down here 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.980
 we were retransmitting and also 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.290
 they were giving on youtube I 'm going to 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.970
 leave my conference and that of samsung 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.680
 here below in case you want to see 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.989
 but the conference really that was 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.000
 very interesting, I say it 's the best 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.739
 conference that samsung has had of 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.080
 all blood times always 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.000
 I had a complaint some discomfort but that 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.250
 it was already because of what happened in those 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.649
 conferences this went straight to the point 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.649
 the cio came out and said let's give him this 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:05.810
 this and showed the two devices both 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:08.149
 the galaxy s 6 as the s 6 edge and me 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.100
 loved these two devices are the 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.410
 I say watch the livestream so that you 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.840
 see how excited I was finally 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:18.229
 a device two devices 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.590
 aluminum in the galaxy line ok in the 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.960
 galaxy s line that 6 are now 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.039
 aluminum and in the back in the 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.700
 front part in the back 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:30.560
 they have glass or a design very very 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.370
 premium that I'll explain later 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.320
 what is lost 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.690
 of what you earn with this design a 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.690
 premium glass gorilla glass by 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.630
 certain number 4 is much more resistant 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.910
 than the previous crystal versions 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.090
 in front glass behind what gives them a 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.860
 feel a lot but much more premium to 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.530
 this device guys after 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.030
 they kept talking about the colors of that 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.250
 is going to come comes in gold color blue 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.290
 white black sapphire something very interesting 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.430
 is that the colors change depends on the 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.580
 light and it depends how you see the 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.790
 device for example the gold changed 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.490
 like gold to platini an equal so 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.210
 the dress that the dress that was blue and 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.430
 Golden 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.380
 also change it color so depends the 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.390
 light that he is giving after that 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.550
 they continued talking about the advantages and 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.130
 functions that bring introduced what 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.060
 is samsung pay which is a mobile system 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.400
 of payment that will work with the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.070
 fingerprints similar to what it is 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.020
 the app but much better because this one 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.790
 has another integrated system that makes it 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.160
 work not only with the 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.890
 nfc devices 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.960
 but with any site that takes 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.730
 credit card and they explained a 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.950
 little is a company that samsung 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.990
 had bought that helps you have this 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.030
 technology so wherever you 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.950
 can pay with your credit card 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.500
 visa or mastercard or american expres 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.030
 you will also be able to pay with these two 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.680
 devices both devices will have 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.860
 a 5.1-inch screen with 571 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.330
 pixels per inch guys that's ultra 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.360
 hd the big difference of these 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.420
 devices is simple the screen one 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.090
 is the one that has the screen have like 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.430
 curve on both sides now different from what 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.320
 that was the note and the galaxy s 6 has the 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.970
 same screen that we used to see 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.290
 that is the big difference of these 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.960
 devices says that the battery has 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.970
 a small difference but that's not what 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.160
 they mentioned what they did mention is the 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.510
 advantages of the new battery that has 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.810
 one is that it is charged so 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.660
 wireless and another one is that with 10 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.390
 Load minutes can give you 64 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.730
 Charging hours 4 hours of very use 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.050
 interesting in that part they explained a 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.640
 little what is the wireless charger 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.370
 of how it's going to work 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.920
 and they also said good battery 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.900
 They did not say how much Miriam Pérez is 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.959
 but it is said that it is 2 thousand 500 thousand 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.650
 amps is less than the battery that 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.240
 I had the galaxy s 5 which was 2800 but 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.780
 they said that thanks to the processor that 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.940
 has that by the way is 64bit now 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.520
 will be much more efficient in the 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.440
 saving and battery consumption now 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.440
 You will save more battery because 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.870
 it also has the chips are 14 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.650
 nanometers so that they have an idea in 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:21.160
 the apoel processor at 7 had 28 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:26.800
 bone chips were the 28 - nanometer 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:30.460
 from a8 are to 728 those of 8 20 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.610
 nanometers and this one from samsung is going to 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.830
 have the 14-nanometer chips in the 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.070
 RAM memory is still 3 gigabytes 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.890
 but instead of being ddr3 it is now ddr4 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.930
 much more efficient there is another change 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.290
 also in the capabilities now 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.560
 we will have 32 gb and 64 devices 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.040
 gb 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:54.590
 28 gigabytes without the ability to be 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.900
 expandable as we used to see that 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.740
 as it says gabriel is a cost a price 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.360
 to pay for this design change that 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.520
 now it's not plastic so it's like a 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:09.470
 bit harder to have memory 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:12.200
 expandable xosé to we have now 32 64 and 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.450
 128 prices have not yet given 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.550
 but I also want not on screen the 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.500
 I will leave the article here below more 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.050
 updated from what is rumored to be 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.660
 will be the prices of these devices 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.900
 in both cameras we saw also improves the 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.389
 camera has an aperture of 1.9 or 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.150
 that now has a better situation in 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:34.280
 low light will look much better 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.030
 photos made a comparison of 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.700
 iphone 6 plus and the galaxy s 6 and it was seen 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.560
 the big difference of how the 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.889
 photos due to the opening that now 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.710
 since 1.9 is still 16 megapixels 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:51.680
 but I have already explained to you that it is not 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.199
 so necessary so many megapixels 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.190
 has a focus that is faster now 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:59.870
 is 0.7 seconds to take a picture and 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.240
 also that he has something that I have to 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:05.030
 expect to have it to be able to explain 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.789
 what does it do to approach the objects in 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.490
 movement also that you manage to focus 

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:12.650
 that I want to see it I want to have it already for 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.990
 to be able to explain here the front camera 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.360
 was the one that got the most improvements because 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.150
 now it has the same opening as the 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.070
 rear camera 1.9 that is going to take 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.880
 photos in low light will take it 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:28.280
 perfect and it has 5 megapixels says that 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.960
 the megapixels are bigger and 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.360
 also that is the first camera 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.030
 front that has hdr has the 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.789
 hdr technology excellent guys from 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:40.190
 true that I liked it there in so much to the 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:42.229
 camera as we saw in it we are 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.539
 discussing in the same show when I 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:46.370
 we are seeing we are there is a while 

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:49.190
 discussing and what people wanted 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.900
 know what was lost because of this 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.699
 design I already mentioned some so that what 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.280
 I will mention in the list we will not have 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:56.720
 removable batteries we will not have the 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.400
 back is not going to be able to remove 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.080
 we will not be able to expand 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.729
 memory and another one of the disadvantages that 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.610
 we're going to have is that the device does not 

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:07.850
 It will be water resistant as it was the s 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.830
 4 and 5 s this because of the great design 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.930
 but if you ask me I prefer 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.090
 that crystal design ahead in 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.970
 glass from behind and metal or 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:19.039
 aluminum around the 

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.690
 disadvantages that I'm not having to 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:23.720
 you think that tell me here below 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:26.539
 tell me also that you think about the show 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:29.000
 full of whether you liked it or not another of the 

00:07:26.539 --> 00:07:31.580
 things that they mentioned was also send 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.690
 the headset that can work with both 

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:37.580
 the s6 that with the s6 age ok goes to 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.780
 work with both I'm going to 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.630
 buy I will buy the two 

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:44.449
 devices here are going to have the their 

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.460
 boxes and their respective comparisons the 

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:48.500
 Departure date is for April 10 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.479
 so we have to wait a bit 

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.510
 guys tell me what you think of 

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:55.160
 these two devices and the event of 

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.570
 samsung if you liked it, I did not travel 

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.460
 study until here I hope that I have 

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.380
 liked it if he liked it as always a 

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.000
 Manito up and subscribe be like that 

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:04.280
 televise every time we are live 

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.900
 that we have a new video and it says 

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.310
 what I'm doing with just 

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.790
 subscribe and forget the video up 

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:10.400
 here 

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:12.080
 marciano foam if it is the section we are going to 

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.639
 show you the new filtered images 

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.639
 of the new false ones
