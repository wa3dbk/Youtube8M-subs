00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:44.250 
bottom pulls up the flipper mechanism
same<00:02:38.739> on<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:38.980> other<00:02:39.040> side<00:02:40.260> but<00:02:41.260> yeah<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:43.750> when

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
same on the other side but yeah so when

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.479 
same on the other side but yeah so when
you<00:02:44.410> lose<00:02:44.680> like<00:02:46.019> it's<00:02:47.019> kind<00:02:47.230> of<00:02:47.349> like<00:02:47.709> I<00:02:48.040> tried

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
you lose like it's kind of like I tried

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:49.949 
you lose like it's kind of like I tried
to<00:02:48.610> explain<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.209> but<00:02:49.390> when<00:02:49.599> you<00:02:49.720> lose

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
to explain to you but when you lose

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.890 
to explain to you but when you lose
it'll<00:02:50.260> roll<00:02:50.500> down<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:52.000> if<00:02:52.510> there'll<00:02:52.750> be<00:02:52.780> a

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
it'll roll down and if there'll be a

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.800 
it'll roll down and if there'll be a
tiny<00:02:53.200> ramp<00:02:53.640> like<00:02:54.640> a<00:02:54.670> row<00:02:55.060> gonna<00:02:55.480> be<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:55.660> high

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
tiny ramp like a row gonna be a high

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.259 
tiny ramp like a row gonna be a high
ramp<00:02:56.110> it'll<00:02:56.950> roll<00:02:57.190> in<00:02:58.560> there<00:02:59.560> and<00:03:00.489> gravity

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
ramp it'll roll in there and gravity

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.880 
ramp it'll roll in there and gravity
will<00:03:01.480> be<00:03:01.660> coming<00:03:01.959> that<00:03:02.140> way<00:03:02.319> so<00:03:02.380> it's<00:03:02.769> not

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
will be coming that way so it's not

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.190 
will be coming that way so it's not
gonna<00:03:03.069> be<00:03:03.250> like<00:03:03.400> this<00:03:03.610> but<00:03:04.480> when<00:03:04.630> you<00:03:04.750> pull<00:03:05.049> it

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
gonna be like this but when you pull it

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.690 
gonna be like this but when you pull it
back<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:06.730> gravity<00:03:07.269> will<00:03:07.540> make<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:08.040> bolt<00:03:09.040> into

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
back the gravity will make it bolt into

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.860 
back the gravity will make it bolt into
there<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:11.380> then<00:03:11.530> when<00:03:11.769> you<00:03:11.860> shoot<00:03:12.190> it<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.870> will

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
there so then when you shoot it it will

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.440 
there so then when you shoot it it will
go<00:03:14.079> up<00:03:14.560> through<00:03:15.099> this<00:03:15.280> ramp<00:03:15.700> built<00:03:16.030> onto<00:03:16.269> the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
go up through this ramp built onto the

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.150 
go up through this ramp built onto the
wall<00:03:17.430> well<00:03:18.430> shoot<00:03:18.670> up<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:20.590> it's<00:03:20.859> supposed<00:03:21.100> to

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
wall well shoot up and it's supposed to

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.530 
wall well shoot up and it's supposed to
go<00:03:21.310> into<00:03:21.489> here<00:03:21.639> but<00:03:21.670> remember<00:03:21.850> gravity's

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
go into here but remember gravity's

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
go into here but remember gravity's
coming<00:03:22.840> this<00:03:22.989> way<00:03:23.139> so<00:03:23.200> I<00:03:23.500> can't<00:03:23.829> just<00:03:24.010> fall<00:03:24.250> in

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
coming this way so I can't just fall in

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.129 
coming this way so I can't just fall in
so<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.620> don't<00:03:27.010> know<00:03:27.130> what<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.370> do<00:03:27.609> yet<00:03:28.049> if<00:03:29.049> you

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
so I don't know what to do yet if you

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.370 
so I don't know what to do yet if you
have<00:03:29.230> any<00:03:29.380> suggestions<00:03:30.340> then<00:03:30.940> post<00:03:31.870> a<00:03:31.959> comment

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
have any suggestions then post a comment

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.660 
have any suggestions then post a comment
