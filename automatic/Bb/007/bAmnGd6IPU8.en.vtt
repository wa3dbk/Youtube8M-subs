literally<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.270> played<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> ton<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.960> ramus

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
literally I played a ton of ramus

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.039 
literally I played a ton of ramus
because<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.949> thought<00:01:02.129> he<00:01:02.280> was<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> blast<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.910> play

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
because I thought he was a blast to play

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:05.060 
because I thought he was a blast to play
this<00:01:04.049> didn't<00:01:04.350> go<00:01:04.470> over<00:01:04.650> too<00:01:04.769> well<00:01:04.799> though

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
this didn't go over too well though

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.039 
this didn't go over too well though
because<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.820> didn't<00:01:06.180> really<00:01:06.330> know<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.659> much

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
because I didn't really know that much

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.780 
because I didn't really know that much
about<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.470> game<00:01:07.680> because<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.040> played<00:01:08.310> casually

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
about the game because I played casually

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.830 
about the game because I played casually
and<00:01:09.150> for<00:01:09.330> fun

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and for fun

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.070

I dropped below 1250 which was bronze I

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.929 
I dropped below 1250 which was bronze I
think<00:01:13.320> at<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.500> time<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.220> went<00:01:14.520> as<00:01:14.640> far<00:01:14.880> down

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
think at the time and went as far down

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.810 
think at the time and went as far down
as<00:01:15.259> around<00:01:16.259> 800<00:01:17.100> yield<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.670> did<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> seasoning

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
as around 800 yield I did the seasoning

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.899 
as around 800 yield I did the seasoning
1120<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.150> was<00:01:21.810> pretty<00:01:22.140> close<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.439> bronze<00:01:22.860> but<00:01:23.700> I

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
1120 I was pretty close to bronze but I

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:33.560 
1120 I was pretty close to bronze but I
was<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.479> far<00:01:30.320> I<00:01:31.320> mean<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.250> lot<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.670> advancements

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570
