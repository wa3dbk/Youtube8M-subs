00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
just sort of works fine we have there

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.210 
just sort of works fine we have there
the<00:00:18.060> snap<00:00:18.480> functionality<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.619> Xbox<00:00:20.010> one

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
the snap functionality on the Xbox one

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.120 
the snap functionality on the Xbox one
there<00:00:20.689> any<00:00:21.689> app<00:00:21.960> can<00:00:22.230> be<00:00:22.320> accessed<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:22.949> this

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
there any app can be accessed in this

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.429 
there any app can be accessed in this
mode<00:00:23.430> running<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.359> parallel<00:00:24.570> with<00:00:25.019> either<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
mode running in parallel with either the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.210 
mode running in parallel with either the
TV<00:00:25.859> feed<00:00:26.220> or<00:00:26.550> game<00:00:26.849> play<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:28.220> essentially

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
TV feed or game play and essentially

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.339 
TV feed or game play and essentially
anything<00:00:29.730> that's<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.060> green<00:00:30.300> text<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> voice

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
anything that's in green text is a voice

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.670 
anything that's in green text is a voice
command<00:00:31.730> so<00:00:32.730> we're<00:00:33.600> actually<00:00:33.780> using<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
command so we're actually using the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.459 
command so we're actually using the
interface<00:00:35.430> fully<00:00:36.210> via<00:00:36.570> voice<00:00:36.870> while<00:00:37.260> our

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
interface fully via voice while our

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.920 
interface fully via voice while our
hands<00:00:37.739> are<00:00:37.860> busy<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.969> PlayStation<00:00:39.899> 4

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
hands are busy with the PlayStation 4

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
and yeah works fine we're using 1080p

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.240 
and yeah works fine we're using 1080p
here<00:00:44.780> but<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.110> actually<00:00:46.530> tried<00:00:46.800> pretty

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
here but we have actually tried pretty

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.610 
here but we have actually tried pretty
much<00:00:47.340> every<00:00:47.940> type<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.180> HDMI<00:00:48.899> output<00:00:49.350> 480p<00:00:49.980> 720p

much every type of HDMI output 480p 720p

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.470 
much every type of HDMI output 480p 720p

1080i 1080p 50 Hertz 60 Hertz and in all
cases<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.989> Xbox<00:00:58.559> one<00:00:58.800> works<00:00:59.250> well<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.699> getting

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
cases the Xbox one works well in getting

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.689 
cases the Xbox one works well in getting
the<00:01:00.090> image<00:01:00.239> up<00:01:00.539> there<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.960> no<00:01:01.920> issues<00:01:02.190> at<00:01:02.460> all

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
the image up there and no issues at all

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.399 
the image up there and no issues at all
there<00:01:03.570> were<00:01:03.690> some<00:01:04.080> indications<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:06.409> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
there were some indications that the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.410 
there were some indications that the
machine<00:01:07.710> would<00:01:07.860> be<00:01:07.890> 4k<00:01:08.220> ready<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.090> we<00:01:09.210> hooked

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
machine would be 4k ready so we hooked

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.200 
machine would be 4k ready so we hooked
up<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.750> PC<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.470> gave<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> whirl<00:01:11.640> but<00:01:11.970> no

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
up the PC and gave that a whirl but no

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.760 
up the PC and gave that a whirl but no
dice<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:12.720> not<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.350> be<00:01:13.439> working

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
dice it's not going to be working

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.700 
dice it's not going to be working
anytime<00:01:14.400> soon<00:01:15.270> was<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.720> current<00:01:16.380> firmware

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
anytime soon was the current firmware

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.030 
anytime soon was the current firmware
maybe<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> future<00:01:18.320> yeah<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.590> display

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
maybe in the future yeah and the display

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.340 
maybe in the future yeah and the display
properties<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.030> PC<00:01:21.420> also<00:01:21.630> indicate<00:01:22.200> that

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
properties on the PC also indicate that

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.740 
properties on the PC also indicate that
1080p<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.369> top<00:01:23.580> end<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.090> HDMI<00:01:24.509> input

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
1080p is the top end of the HDMI input

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.280 
1080p is the top end of the HDMI input
on<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.470> Xbox<00:01:25.860> one<00:01:26.119> but<00:01:27.119> other<00:01:27.450> than<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.810> yeah

on the Xbox one but other than that yeah
pretty<00:01:28.650> much

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950

easy<00:01:29.460> going<00:01:29.909> all<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.270> way<00:01:30.390> through<00:01:32.090> now<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
easy going all the way through now the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.510 
easy going all the way through now the
question<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.900> course<00:01:33.930> are<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.070> likely<00:01:35.310> to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
question is of course are you likely to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.350 
question is of course are you likely to
be<00:01:35.850> using<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.350> day<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.740> day<00:01:37.860> basis<00:01:38.490> well

should<00:01:45.960> be<00:01:46.110> using<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:46.560> not<00:01:47.040> really<00:01:47.399> a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
should be using it for not really a

should be using it for not really a
games<00:01:47.700> console<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.960> issue<00:01:49.110> here<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:49.649> all

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
games console and the issue here is all

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.450 
games console and the issue here is all
about<00:01:50.100> latency<00:01:51.229> all<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.740> processing

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
about latency all of that processing

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.280 
about latency all of that processing
that<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.820> Xbox<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:54.479> needs<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.930> do<00:01:55.049> on<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
that the Xbox one needs to do on the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.679 
that the Xbox one needs to do on the
input<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.829> get<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.100> into<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
input to get it into the

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.600 
input to get it into the
picture-in-picture<00:01:57.689> display<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
picture-in-picture display to the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.660 
picture-in-picture display to the
interlace<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.210> resize<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.290> takes<00:02:01.530> time<00:02:01.860> not<00:02:02.640> a

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
interlace to resize it takes time not a

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.850 
interlace to resize it takes time not a
massive<00:02:03.240> amount<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.719> time<00:02:03.960> but<00:02:04.200> enough<00:02:04.619> to

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
massive amount of time but enough to

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.980 
massive amount of time but enough to
make<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.399> response<00:02:06.180> from<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.570> controller

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
make the response from the controller

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.180 
make the response from the controller
field<00:02:07.380> dead<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:09.349> it<00:02:10.349> really<00:02:10.679> kills<00:02:10.950> the
