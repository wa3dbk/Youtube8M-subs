mentioning is in addition to all the
explosion<00:00:12.680> and<00:00:12.830> data<00:00:13.010> and<00:00:13.219> sensors<00:00:13.670> is

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
explosion and data and sensors is

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.820 
explosion and data and sensors is
actually<00:00:14.360> a<00:00:14.420> transition<00:00:15.020> of<00:00:15.139> business<00:00:15.440> models

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
actually a transition of business models

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.010 
actually a transition of business models
because<00:00:16.460> of<00:00:16.609> legislation<00:00:17.270> things<00:00:17.510> like<00:00:17.660> ACA

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
because of legislation things like ACA

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.350 
because of legislation things like ACA
across<00:00:18.410> the<00:00:18.560> healthcare<00:00:18.920> system<00:00:19.280> so<00:00:19.460> this<00:00:20.300> is

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
across the healthcare system so this is

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.570 
across the healthcare system so this is
something<00:00:20.690> we<00:00:21.050> hear<00:00:21.350> all<00:00:21.620> the<00:00:21.920> time<00:00:22.100> at<00:00:22.310> ginger

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
something we hear all the time at ginger

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.190 
something we hear all the time at ginger
aisle<00:00:22.730> which<00:00:22.940> is<00:00:23.090> off<00:00:23.300> my<00:00:23.630> thousands<00:00:24.110> of

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.200 
aisle which is off my thousands of

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.260 
aisle which is off my thousands of
patients<00:00:24.380> how<00:00:25.190> do<00:00:25.250> I<00:00:25.430> know<00:00:25.550> which<00:00:26.000> of<00:00:26.030> them

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
patients how do I know which of them

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.370 
patients how do I know which of them
need<00:00:26.510> help<00:00:26.750> right<00:00:26.960> now

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
need help right now

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.400 
need help right now
and<00:00:27.560> the<00:00:28.400> reason<00:00:28.820> this<00:00:28.940> is<00:00:29.119> hard<00:00:29.480> is<00:00:29.750> in<00:00:30.140> the

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
and the reason this is hard is in the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.529 
and the reason this is hard is in the
traditional<00:00:30.890> healthcare<00:00:31.220> system<00:00:31.640> even<00:00:32.360> for

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:32.539 
traditional healthcare system even for

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:34.569 
traditional healthcare system even for
the<00:00:32.629> high-cost<00:00:33.170> Hylas<00:00:33.860> patients<00:00:34.460> the

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
the high-cost Hylas patients the

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:35.979 
the high-cost Hylas patients the
interaction<00:00:35.090> with<00:00:35.210> your<00:00:35.329> doctor<00:00:35.810> is

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
interaction with your doctor is

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.770 
interaction with your doctor is
basically<00:00:36.370> episodic<00:00:37.370> which<00:00:38.120> means<00:00:38.390> even<00:00:38.690> if

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
basically episodic which means even if

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.090 
basically episodic which means even if
you're<00:00:38.900> costing<00:00:39.230> thousands<00:00:39.680> or<00:00:39.800> dollars<00:00:40.040> a

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
in the blanks we tell you how your

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.930 
in the blanks we tell you how your
patients<00:00:48.320> are<00:00:48.410> doing<00:00:48.620> every<00:00:49.070> day<00:00:49.100> every<00:00:49.760> week

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
patients are doing every day every week

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.270 
patients are doing every day every week
with<00:00:50.420> much<00:00:50.720> more<00:00:50.989> data<00:00:51.200> than<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:51.920> healthcare

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
with much more data than the healthcare

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.010 
with much more data than the healthcare
system<00:00:52.579> is<00:00:52.670> used<00:00:52.880> to<00:00:53.030> working<00:00:53.329> with<00:00:53.360> so<00:00:53.930> you

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
system is used to working with so you

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.049 
system is used to working with so you
can<00:00:54.170> intervene<00:00:54.620> at<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.920> right<00:00:55.070> time<00:00:55.309> and<00:00:55.520> not

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
can intervene at the right time and not

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.000 
can intervene at the right time and not
only<00:00:56.239> get<00:00:56.510> better<00:00:56.750> clinical<00:00:57.020> outcomes<00:00:57.649> but

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
only get better clinical outcomes but

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.530 
only get better clinical outcomes but
also<00:00:58.250> increase<00:00:58.760> efficiency<00:00:59.329> in<00:00:59.360> the<00:00:59.510> system

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
also increase efficiency in the system

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.479 
also increase efficiency in the system
and<00:00:59.989> say<00:01:00.140> help<00:01:00.350> everybody<00:01:00.620> save<00:01:01.010> money<00:01:01.309> in<00:01:01.430> the

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
and say help everybody save money in the

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.319 
and say help everybody save money in the
system<00:01:01.899> so<00:01:02.899> how<00:01:03.079> do<00:01:03.140> we<00:01:03.260> do<00:01:03.469> that<00:01:03.850> it<00:01:04.850> turns<00:01:05.030> out

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
system so how do we do that it turns out

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:07.209 
system so how do we do that it turns out
there's<00:01:05.630> four<00:01:05.899> billion<00:01:06.229> of<00:01:06.439> these<00:01:06.560> devices<00:01:06.889> on

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:07.219 
there's four billion of these devices on

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:09.099 
there's four billion of these devices on
the<00:01:07.310> planet<00:01:07.639> and<00:01:07.759> they're<00:01:08.359> incredibly

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:09.109 
the planet and they're incredibly

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:11.859 
the planet and they're incredibly
powerful<00:01:09.459> diaries<00:01:10.459> of<00:01:10.579> a<00:01:10.789> life<00:01:10.969> they<00:01:11.689> have

here<00:01:49.009> is<00:01:49.099> the<00:01:49.219> kind<00:01:49.429> of<00:01:49.549> data<00:01:49.729> we<00:01:49.909> collect

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
here is the kind of data we collect

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.629 
here is the kind of data we collect
hundreds<00:01:51.319> of<00:01:51.469> features<00:01:51.829> that<00:01:51.859> capture<00:01:52.520> these

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:52.639 
hundreds of features that capture these

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:55.989 
hundreds of features that capture these
micro<00:01:53.149> behaviors<00:01:53.719> about<00:01:54.469> your<00:01:54.649> life<00:01:54.829> and<00:01:55.130> I'll

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:55.999 
micro behaviors about your life and I'll

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:57.940 
micro behaviors about your life and I'll
give<00:01:56.240> you<00:01:56.299> a<00:01:56.359> simple<00:01:56.659> example<00:01:56.840> of<00:01:57.409> how<00:01:57.619> we<00:01:57.679> go

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
give you a simple example of how we go

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.129 
give you a simple example of how we go
from<00:01:58.099> that<00:01:58.159> raw<00:01:58.489> data<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:59.419> actual<00:01:59.899> clinical

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:00.139 
from that raw data to actual clinical

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:02.440 
from that raw data to actual clinical
outcomes<00:02:00.739> so<00:02:01.249> if<00:02:01.399> you<00:02:01.489> think<00:02:01.639> of<00:02:01.789> the<00:02:01.909> clinical

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
outcomes so if you think of the clinical

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.719 
outcomes so if you think of the clinical
definition<00:02:02.989> of<00:02:03.109> depression<00:02:03.679> it's<00:02:04.159> basically

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
definition of depression it's basically

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.609 
definition of depression it's basically
some<00:02:05.060> of<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.179> markers<00:02:05.569> are<00:02:05.719> you<00:02:06.049> isolate

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
some of the markers are you isolate
