behind the brand what makes the brand so
special<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.570> think<00:01:45.870> that<00:01:45.960> there's<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.200> lot<00:01:46.410> of

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
special I think that there's a lot of

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.750 
special I think that there's a lot of
great<00:01:46.680> work<00:01:46.710> being<00:01:47.040> done<00:01:47.160> in<00:01:47.370> the<00:01:47.430> industry

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
right now and it's going to continue to

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.820 
right now and it's going to continue to
evolve<00:01:50.490> but<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.270> think<00:01:51.930> Brandon<00:01:52.260> entertainment

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830
