 February 14 is approaching 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.589
 valentine day of love of lovers 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.510
 and the sordid ones that no longer want 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.250
 fall in love more never basic gifts 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.590
 to please consumerism in this 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.859
 February 14 poems framed balloons 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.050
 of helium roses chocolates regalame 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.000

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.789
 chocolates to the store try not to die 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.980
 in the attempt 'buried by boxes of 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.160
 condoms going out to dinner outings to the park 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.810
 movies many spent money 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.410
 as God sends many messages of 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.850
 little hearts movies to see this day 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.460

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.070
 dragged 'friends with benefits' this 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.050
 is a bit of an attempt in these days of 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.940
 summer to cut the veins during 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.559
 the movie 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.010
 It's a little cute and we're going down 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.010
 the kitsch 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.010
 widely 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.720
 in played against whom what exists is 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.540
 that the show of this kind of 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.520
 beyonce I've seen better after 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.289
 of lugo like a touchdown like this 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.270
 incredible from there the light went and 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.280
 basically that was the most important thing of 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.259
 the whole event as relevant as the 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.320
 match of the Mexican national team against 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.479
 jamaica two rude and those cases 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.939
 Who played the Mexican national team 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.310
 not because every time I'm less interested 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.140
 these things we try everything with an idea 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.610
 apparently too addicted to 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.259
 facebook then to lower your level of 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.110
 addiction decided to make her sign a 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:43.659
 contract where I would pay you 200 dollars and 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.610
 I stopped using this social network for 5 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.439
 months now in details who knows if the 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.179
 hold my girl I was asked to 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.950
 stop using twitter for five 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.290
 months and honestly I think I would charge 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.690
 a little more endurance 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.170
 the countries with the worst access to broadband 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.370
 this is new, it turns out that the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.230
 precision for cooperation and 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.520
 economic development a study was made 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.500
 where he published the countries that were 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.990
 associated with this organization and it was 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.790
 accommodating according to the access that 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.560
 they have each of them to the band in 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.290
 last place was in Mexico in the place 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.340
 number 34 thank you for participating so 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.410
 interesting is that here we have the 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.490
 richest man in the world and he does not have 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:25.630
 absolutely nothing to do with internet 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.630
 communications or anything of this 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.599
 someone was bored by life 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:36.120
 weird and good to have fun decided 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:38.040

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.900
 former presidents of the us and good will know 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.670
 God as he did but who got into 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.430
 private family files and it was for 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.500
 go publishing emails photos very things 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.569
 Family personal exercise 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.189
 call gucci fer and all the photos that 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.439
 published them put watermark their 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.480
 name I do not understand what is fun 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.489
 of doing these things at least 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.159
 I would have charged for the photos not in order 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.819
 there are people who only want to see the world 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:04.859
 burn sir dan rush garde wants to see 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.909
 also the world burn but another 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.510
 way 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.980
 baby that is happening to me 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.680
 this gentleman is planning to launch a 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.810
 clothing line very curious and started already 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.700
 throwing a dress this dress has 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.790
 a very particular characteristic is 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.230
 black color yes but when the person 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.780
 excites or gets excited becomes 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.870
 transparent and so he plans to do all the 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.370
 rest of the clothes and then baby everything and 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.980
 to see how he does it is supposed that the 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.130
 level of excitation measures it according to 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.710
 the heartbeat then imagine 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.260
 if an athlete puts on those clothes or 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.230
 go and I would never wear clothes like this 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.210
 to an appointment for example you would use it 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.130
 when he estimated but not least 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.630
 I already know that several days have already passed over 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.040
 the tragedy that happened here in the city 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.200
 from mexico in the pemex building where 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.460
 They died about 37 people the 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.740
 media said that the best thing was a 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.690
 attack that was negligence others 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.220
 media said that Pemex already knew the 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.360
 problems that there were gas leaks in 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.010
 the building to this day I think that 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.090
 There are many doubts in the air 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.430
 now the head of government of the district 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.140
 The federal government assured that the surrounding 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.750
 where the explosion occurred there is no 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.310
 no type of gas leak and that area 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.620
 is quite safe and it is expected that 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.730
 relatives of the victims because they are 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.260
 compensated that at least they can 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.520
 receive support from me personally 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.680
 It seems like a pretty event 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.630
 tragic and then we cross everything so that 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.670
 this kind of thing does not happen again 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.470
 mexico spirit this has been all for the 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.300

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.040
