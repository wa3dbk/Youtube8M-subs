00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.299
 Hi everyone, how are you? I'm here one more. 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.500
 instead ask a controversial question you 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.500
 deep squat yes or no 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.920
 so the answer so whenever 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.869
 speak of squatting as a pattern 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.199
 of human movement 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.630
 It was made to feel so full 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:33.079
 until you are squatting 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:36.360
 now we are talking about weight load 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.210
 movement dysfunctions and the functions of 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.890
 patterns of movement the response is 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.309
 It depends 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.129
 each individual has his or her 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.399
 movement each individual along the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.590
 Life, he's going to say it like that. 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.510
 deteriorating this pattern of movement 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.980
 with some imperfections some 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.719
 asymmetries 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.149
 so there is the care to first know 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.820
 if that individual has the standards 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:11.119
 for elevated there yes it has a merit 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.119
 he deserves to be loaded to squat 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.439
 on my side here the glaucous professor he 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.720
 will help me in this attempt to 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.090
 exploitation to explore a little better 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.670
 that I want to talk about 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.830
 relation to the movement patterns then 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.780
 from the bottom up if we have 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.170
 all the particular functions of 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.170
 ankle knee back of comic 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.680
 thoracic spine humeral scapula 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:41.250
 numeral and serves lime preserved in 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.500
 mobility and stability 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.229
 perfect deep wrapping with 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.840
 certainty if any of these functions 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:55.430
 modified or imperfect 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.680
 The answer is that we will evaluate each fund 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.560
 so we see this basic has arrived 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.259
 so please do a squatting of the 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.780
 way you know further away from the 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.790
 Sun 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.910
 now forward and keep a high torso 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:16.780
 and crouch like pond as favor crouch 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:18.940
 everything is in the most natural way that you 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.700
 get arm up because people 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:26.280
 you can see the articulation of the 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.280
 mineral water and the return to africa 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:38.210
 bill example yes deep squatting 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.490
 You 're probably heavy 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:45.710
 surely he already has competence to 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:47.840
 so he has been able to run him 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.410
 the clean movement without compensation 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.330
 none without joint dysfunction 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.060
 more Felipe 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.540
 how can I get better I can 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.130
 teach my student let's say so is 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.580
 teach the student to be in the position of 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:08.150
 squatting to stay in the position of 100% 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:11.600
 squat rate plus or minus 50 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.000
 centimeters depending on when and how 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.670
 be good or bad 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.670
 your student in the case of glaucoma an 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.010
 box of 50 cm that will be a good option 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.630
 so let's start first of all 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.739
 Face to face with me to the camera. 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.620
 you to whom I provide insight into the 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.950
 hip to hip drive for 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.970
 behind the hip flexion back more 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.920
 or less 20 centimeters away from the carton 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.690
 upright posture looking forward 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.890
 as he projects the 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:48.890
 hip back and down vertically 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.100
 he will extend his arms with a weight 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.470
 a slight overload for now to 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.320
 that gives sustainability sustainability 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.660
 in his body balance to 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.489
 maintaining the balance so I asked 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.590
 so he feels projecting hip 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:08.810
 stretch out your arms and touch 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:11.840
 hip rose once more from the hip 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:15.980
 rose sat down remains underneath 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:19.310
 block now the straight column both on the line 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.859
 both the vertical horizontal line all 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:25.010
 the cable girdles there were all 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:29.229
 waist to unstable column 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.710
 the neck in the cervical rose to i 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.900
 order 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.300
 but the initial question was squatting 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.570
 deep yes or no the answer always 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.030
 yes since the particular functions 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.310
 are preserved and the answer is 'no' 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.090
 provided that regular functions do not 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.080
 preserved and it's up to you 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.810
 physical education professional 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.210
 professional movement to improve this 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.950
 pattern of your student uÃ§Ã¡ 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.170
 We thank you once again for the 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.140
 available to you and we are watching
