exercises the number one factor that
must<00:00:09.210> be<00:00:09.300> considered<00:00:09.950> you<00:00:10.950> must<00:00:11.160> have<00:00:11.340> the

must be considered you must have the

must be considered you must have the
correct<00:00:11.670> exercise<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.509> once<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.750> have<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
correct exercise and once you have the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.140 
correct exercise and once you have the
correct<00:00:13.170> exercise<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:13.860> you're<00:00:14.009> using<00:00:14.280> then

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
correct exercise that you're using then

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.550 
correct exercise that you're using then
you<00:00:15.330> begin<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.750> juggle<00:00:16.289> intensity<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.460> volume

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
you begin to juggle intensity and volume

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.590 
you begin to juggle intensity and volume
so<00:00:19.560> volume<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.580> intensity<00:00:20.730> should<00:00:21.270> not<00:00:21.420> be<00:00:21.570> a

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
so volume and intensity should not be a

changed now they use both volume and
