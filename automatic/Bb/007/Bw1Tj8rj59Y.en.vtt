00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.680
 so welcome for this gta boxing that 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.049
 just released so number 5 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.659
 finally finally after four years or again 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.920
 to wait I do not know anymore so we're going 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.250
 immediately go to unpacking the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.510
 box 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.960
 so what's in the box 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.299
 mathieu precisely then you have to know 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.799
 that gta 5 is prohibited to those under 18 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.150
 at least advisors since 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.939
 it's still a game 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.659
 violent let's move on to the contents of the box 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.179
 in the box we find so good 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.359
 it is obviously also a 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:34.579
 small booklet cine grand theft auto file 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:36.819
 in which we find the essential 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:40.369
 commands from the controller is not it 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:44.000
 since obviously the key 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.189
 triangle so corresponds to the key and 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.969
 well the triangle key following the small 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:52.759
 manual thank you very much sony and rockstar 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:54.969
 then something else besides the little booklet 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.429
 and the cd we also have a map 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:01.189
 card that unfolds in about four 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:03.069
 in five parts I think maybe even 4 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.880
 that's how you can see 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:07.490
 2 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.890
 the plan is pretty big enough actually 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.900
 would even say more practical than a plan of 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:17.330
 paris here in the box you can 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.340
 also have or not have a small 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.620
 slip on which is written a code 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.989
 this code is to enter the game there you 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.920
 will give access to airships 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.930
 atomic 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.269
 it's a little extra ziz taste 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.870
 which will delight the youngest 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:35.390

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.099
 more crazy about sensations not strong I 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.200
 think this big thing of slow enough fm 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.760

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.760
 during this smart installation 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:13.790

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:15.790
