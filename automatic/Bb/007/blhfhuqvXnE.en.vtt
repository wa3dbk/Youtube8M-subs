00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello everybody here is tutorials and disgust more 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.470
 a tutorial for you 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.139
 Today I'm going to teach you how to increase 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.570
 your computer's ram memory. 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.139
 performance with the pen drive card 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.430
 memory with a device inserted with 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.840
 flash memory 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.100
 Good, it's very simple, you'll connect the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.970
 your pendrive 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.970
 I'm already logged in here which is 8 gb 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.130
 I'll show how much is the mother of 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.210
 memory I have here I have 3g 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.730
 only on my computer for those who have 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.170
 coition givers up there is no need 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.190
 for those who have enough memory as 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:53.850
 18 and so on there is no need 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:56.449
 to do this you will have my 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.449
 computer, right? 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:06.009
 right click up there in 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:08.790
 properties that goes here the grid search 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.790
 wait 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.280
 here you can put wearing and stinky one 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.440
 device you select 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.750
 exactly is the amount of memory that 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.180
 do you want 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.750
 understood for you to know how much is a 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.310
 game where it comes when I'm a thousand and one 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.940
 for you to have a sense of how much 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.860
 is here he uses four alloy has no way 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.759
 he use more than this system 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.780
 It only works so I'll dedicate and judge 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.630
 positive the red bull be because I go 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.860
 use it just like I just used it to 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.319
 to help my computer perform 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.319
 even though it does apply 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.850
 he is configuring his cluster 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.030
 after that if you check here already 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.979
 changed of you was totally free 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:10.230
 now only has three beams and 44 free 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:13.720
 Just remembering you can not use 8 gigs 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:19.120
 this is the maximum size it uses 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:24.660
 you can place other 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.660
 memory to help 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.850
 I'll write it right after that, and then 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.910
 ready 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.530
 the system gets much faster with 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.020
 sure you can see enough 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.180
 difference 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.270
 Well, that's it, any little thing, if your 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.560
 gave just to speed up once you click 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.110
 on the right button 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.640
 put in format and put to 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:01.390
 format in ntfs as it is formatted in 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.370
 fat32 but can put in another and places 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.739
 to use may be giving this error for 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.450
 cause the staff is there 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.519
 I stayed in order to enroll in the 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.440
 my channel a liquid and liked 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.440
 I was leaving until the next
