in class and take-home case studies is

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.670 
in class and take-home case studies is
really<00:00:56.579> what<00:00:57.059> drives<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.660> aha<00:00:58.020> moment<00:00:58.500> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
really what drives the aha moment and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.090 
really what drives the aha moment and
the<00:00:59.070> learning<00:00:59.340> from<00:01:00.059> our<00:01:00.210> students<00:01:01.100> I've

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the learning from our students I've

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.560

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.060 
through the lean certification course
and<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:05.970> lean<00:01:06.150> logistics<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.799> was<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
and the lean logistics and that was the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.580 
and the lean logistics and that was the
first<00:01:08.280> rate<00:01:08.610> education<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.600> really<00:01:10.350> helped

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
first rate education that really helped

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.130 
first rate education that really helped
myself<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:11.310> my<00:01:11.640> career<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.479> one<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.930> tools

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
myself in my career and one of the tools

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.590 
myself in my career and one of the tools
that<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.470> was<00:01:13.740> lacking<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.549> was<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.180> Six<00:01:15.420> Sigma

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
that I was lacking in was the Six Sigma

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.200 
that I was lacking in was the Six Sigma
piece<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.549> was<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.700> part<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.090> my

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
piece of it so it was just part of my

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.320 
piece of it so it was just part of my
personal<00:01:18.600> development<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.350> take<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:20.250> Six<00:01:21.150> Sigma

dedication a commitment to solving the
problem<00:01:45.730> and<00:01:45.940> I<00:01:46.240> think<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:46.570> greenbelts<00:01:47.080> have

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 
problem and I think the greenbelts have

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.830 
problem and I think the greenbelts have
enough<00:01:47.530> skills<00:01:48.460> enough<00:01:48.970> of<00:01:49.150> structure<00:01:49.630> that

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
enough skills enough of structure that

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.630 
enough skills enough of structure that
they're<00:01:50.290> able<00:01:50.500> to<00:01:50.650> do<00:01:50.860> this<00:01:50.890> for<00:01:51.280> a<00:01:51.340> wide

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
they're able to do this for a wide

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.490 
they're able to do this for a wide
variety<00:01:51.910> of<00:01:52.240> problems<00:01:52.960> in<00:01:53.290> different
