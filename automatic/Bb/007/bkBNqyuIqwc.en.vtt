00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
use it to line my lash line so that

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.390 
use it to line my lash line so that

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
works as well one small downside to this

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.550 
works as well one small downside to this
NYX<00:02:12.700> eyebrow<00:02:12.910> kit<00:02:13.240> is<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.420> it's<00:02:13.690> too<00:02:13.960> big<00:02:13.990> and

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
NYX eyebrow kit is that it's too big and

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.980 
NYX eyebrow kit is that it's too big and
it<00:02:15.130> won't<00:02:15.370> fit<00:02:15.580> my<00:02:15.790> makeup<00:02:16.150> bag<00:02:16.360> so<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:16.720> usually

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
it won't fit my makeup bag so I usually

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.410 
it won't fit my makeup bag so I usually
just<00:02:17.260> put<00:02:17.560> this<00:02:17.709> in<00:02:17.920> my<00:02:18.100> bag<00:02:18.310> separate<00:02:19.150> from<00:02:19.330> my

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
just put this in my bag separate from my

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.270 
just put this in my bag separate from my
makeup<00:02:19.720> bag<00:02:19.840> because<00:02:20.140> it's<00:02:20.260> really<00:02:20.470> bulky<00:02:21.040> and

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
makeup bag because it's really bulky and

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.400 
makeup bag because it's really bulky and
I<00:02:21.760> also<00:02:21.970> do<00:02:22.180> not<00:02:22.209> use<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.600> stencils<00:02:23.080> because

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
I also do not use the stencils because

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.930 
I also do not use the stencils because
I'm<00:02:23.560> not<00:02:23.709> really<00:02:23.890> used<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.340> using<00:02:24.550> stencils

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940
