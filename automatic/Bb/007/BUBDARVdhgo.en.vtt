knifed<00:04:41.740> but<00:04:42.040> I<00:04:42.070> always<00:04:42.370> think<00:04:42.639> you<00:04:42.760> know<00:04:42.880> what

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.550 
knifed but I always think you know what
if<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.389> knife<00:04:43.540> were<00:04:43.690> was<00:04:43.810> using<00:04:44.050> a<00:04:44.139> gun<00:04:44.350> he'd

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
if the knife were was using a gun he'd

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.500 
if the knife were was using a gun he'd
probably<00:04:44.740> be<00:04:44.979> getting<00:04:45.070> more<00:04:45.220> kills<00:04:45.610> so<00:04:45.910> can't

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
probably be getting more kills so can't

putting himself at a disadvantage it's a

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:51.780 
putting himself at a disadvantage it's a
similar<00:04:50.530> situation<00:04:51.040> with<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.220> sniper<00:04:51.490> right
