00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.349 
graphics I'm pleased with it with as far
as<00:03:35.540> gameplay<00:03:35.810> but<00:03:36.760> if<00:03:37.760> I<00:03:37.910> had<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.150> pick<00:03:38.180> one

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359 
as gameplay but if I had to pick one

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.030 
as gameplay but if I had to pick one
thing<00:03:38.810> it<00:03:39.109> would<00:03:39.230> be<00:03:39.350> that<00:03:39.530> I<00:03:39.709> think<00:03:39.920> it's

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
really pretty for given the time frame

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.530 
really pretty for given the time frame
maybe<00:03:43.100> not<00:03:43.280> a<00:03:43.310> lot<00:03:43.400> but<00:03:43.639> ever<00:03:43.790> been<00:03:43.910> protests

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.750 
maybe not a lot but ever been protests
about<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.620> game<00:03:45.799> some<00:03:46.069> soldiers<00:03:46.489> coming<00:03:46.670> back

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
about the game some soldiers coming back

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.470 
about the game some soldiers coming back
from<00:03:46.910> the<00:03:47.120> war<00:03:47.590> any<00:03:48.590> comment<00:03:49.040> on<00:03:49.100> that<00:03:49.160> or<00:03:49.519> well

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
from the war any comment on that or well

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.569 
from the war any comment on that or well
I<00:03:50.510> think<00:03:50.690> that<00:03:51.049> when<00:03:51.230> this<00:03:51.350> when<00:03:51.739> we've<00:03:52.340> had<00:03:52.549> a

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
I think that when this when we've had a

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.039 
I think that when this when we've had a
number<00:03:52.850> of<00:03:53.000> soldiers<00:03:53.269> actually<00:03:53.600> play<00:03:54.019> the

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
number of soldiers actually play the

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.050 
number of soldiers actually play the
game<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:54.620> we<00:03:55.010> think<00:03:55.220> that<00:03:55.340> when<00:03:55.609> when

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
game and we think that when when

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.110 
game and we think that when when
soldiers<00:03:56.450> actually<00:03:56.690> do<00:03:57.489> get<00:03:58.489> some<00:03:58.670> hands-on

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
soldiers actually do get some hands-on

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.970 
soldiers actually do get some hands-on
with<00:03:59.359> it<00:03:59.569> that<00:03:59.989> they'll<00:04:00.170> see<00:04:00.350> that<00:04:00.530> it's<00:04:00.709> it's

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
with it that they'll see that it's it's

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.370 
with it that they'll see that it's it's
respectful<00:04:01.670> it's<00:04:02.090> it's<00:04:02.389> in<00:04:02.690> no<00:04:02.870> way<00:04:03.019> intended

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
respectful it's it's in no way intended

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.890 
respectful it's it's in no way intended
to<00:04:03.739> diminish<00:04:04.160> what<00:04:04.880> are<00:04:05.030> what<00:04:05.269> our<00:04:05.299> soldiers

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
to diminish what are what our soldiers

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.620 
to diminish what are what our soldiers
have<00:04:06.380> have<00:04:07.190> accomplished<00:04:07.850> and<00:04:08.060> continue<00:04:08.600> to

have have accomplished and continue to

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.300 
have have accomplished and continue to
accomplish<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.500> game<00:04:09.680> is<00:04:09.829> all<00:04:10.010> about

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
accomplish the game is all about

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.630 
accomplish the game is all about
not<00:04:12.120> necessarily<00:04:12.630> any<00:04:12.930> given<00:04:13.709> conflict<00:04:14.370> that

not necessarily any given conflict that

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.970 
not necessarily any given conflict that

worried that we're in currently or in in

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.440 
worried that we're in currently or in in
the<00:04:17.070> future<00:04:17.400> it's<00:04:17.669> more<00:04:17.970> about<00:04:18.180> the
