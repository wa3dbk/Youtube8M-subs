00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 good guys before you start with the 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.560
 video a couple of little things first that 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.120
 all that is I will be up very late 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.919
 then a like I would appreciate it if you 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.599
 like the video and the second thing is that I'm 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.820
 doing a draw for twitter of the game 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.960
 that you want that is win if you go to 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.660
 game that you want you have one 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.279
 description will draw and the link to 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.750
 tweet which you have to retweet and 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.699
 follow the company you are organizing 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.680
 the draw is worth it so the guys are going 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.500
 with the model this time we are going to play with 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.289
 the mp 11 goliat is a model that is that 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.539
 it is very I do not know about that which is bipolar 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.949
 or kills two bullets or does not kill we're going to 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.630
 see explains a little bit this is for 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.309
 russia because it is a weapon is a submachine gun 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.070
 which good because it has a damage 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.649
 incredible but at long distances is a 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.329
 catarrh and sometimes you need enough 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.670
 bullets to kill the enemy the truth is 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.440
 that by far does not work for much but 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.450
 good is I do not know is a weight a weapon that you 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.340
 leave a little sold not now you are going to see 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.320
 the video because I really have one 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.170
 departure which is expresses perfectly 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.120
 how is the Gordian mp11 that you can 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.710
 be killing the sack or you may be 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.320
 based all the time so we left already 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.539
 the revision of the model there you have all 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.840
 the weapon data and we go with the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.840
 gameplay 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.190
 to people as you are welcome I do not know 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.480
 why do I introduce myself yes surely 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.780
 done the model review so 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.400
 this year we go with the mp 11 goliath go 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.500
 to see this is a quite adequate map 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.230
 for this weapon there are not many alleys 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.640
 houses and so on and it's not a very map 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.800
 big let's say let's see if 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.450
 we raped people here to see first 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.310
 that everything we are going to have a little in mind 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.760
 where are they because I do not see them 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:51.750
 eleven 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:55.110
 my mother is perfect 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.060
 Well surely I have already said the 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.100
 keys of this weapon but good I repeat it 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.230
 is not weapons to spray therefore 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.270
 we should be more good here 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:07.280
 not for these buildings and such and such 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.280
 move a fence a lot and one 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:15.630
 my mother this is a care 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.630
 and later on 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.010
 Jesus 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.080
 well I see I was bloodthirsty already 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.129
 God come with resentment towards me come 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.129
 with resentment towards me I think that 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.260
 this tree is a cheto guys but good 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.189
 for long distances is a car 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.930
 then you have to be very careful 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:38.629
 ok but that's up we're going to 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.430
 climb it just killed us bus 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.200
 goes a little the gao and talking about the gao 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.940
 I have a nefarious connection now 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.950
 I know what is happening that suddenly I 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.360
 they go great and then since then nothing 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.810
 it kills so much the time because it does not hit or 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.109
 a bullet I have one behind you has gone up 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.900
 so it's perfect 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.739
 let's see is he has me very tasting or 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.739
 here they have it 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.140
 perfect if we do not get the warm that we 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.110
 it is very little we do not remove the guard 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.760
 well and is no longer red and also goes to 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.240
 times in jump and more than double jump is 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.920
 not 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.070
 ok we have little left to warner 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.440
 ruthless weapon worth vale calm this 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.000
 here 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.760
 you 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.320
 I did not grab the drone dude I think with 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.980
 that already had the guard binimelÂ·lÃ  stolen 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.099
 the damned throne 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.780
 flew carefully calmly that this weapon 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.940
 it is a real object be this weapon 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.110
 I loved her and she just touched me by opening 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.360
 supplies surely those that you have 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.799
 seen opening them supplies that 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.400
 you have because the channel two days ago 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.540
 I went up one since you saw it I do not get in line 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.000
 goliat and he turned me 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.750
 had crossed had already crossed the 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.210
 corner made me a little crazy 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.950
 so nothing to say that I already have 30 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.260
 washed supplies again we will take 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.030
 about 34 days to upload them and they have 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.740
 touched very elegant things so 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.760
 well you have seen all the bullets that 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:06.150
 used right now to kill my uncle 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.670
 easy show was doing a 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:13.019
 show that flipas killed with very 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.760
 elegant so comment to see if what 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.510
 three or four days you see why 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.329
 because that is flippant what 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.120
 that touches me 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.789
 lol, my mother, my uncle , the peephole goes 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.889
 Sometimes I'm still not used to the command 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:30.500
 from xbox one things like they are still me 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.080
 It costs a lot to aim not to point as in 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.229
 the present as in the ps3 of ps3 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.039
 is my little ones the command with which I have 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:41.210
 played more hours and more years not here not 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:45.160
 OK, perfect 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.160
 or enemies 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.400
 we'll see 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:53.659
 those times the mothers have seen me 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:54.979
 that there have been some that have killed them 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.620
 two bullets also have to mention that they 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.749
 they are useful to the head but it has 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.550
 a lot of damage but one if it is not a weapon that 

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:03.770
 say boom is a cucumber 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.569
 It costs a lot to kill with this weapon but 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.009
 It's very good for Russia who likes it 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:09.009
 rosear this one threw down here 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:12.999
 I'm going to do 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.380
 and he is going to make the elections 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.380
 previous 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.360
 my mother what a pitiful thing I tried to climb to 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.360
 the top part 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.080
 right now dead and those guys if you 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.360
 like the n7 of modern warfare 3 this is 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.670
 more or less a variant is not the same 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.860
 not the same because the mp7 was a cheto 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:43.060
 no and like the acr for me they were 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.710
 two weapons that my mother knows the hacr was 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.230
 more cheat that yes that I will not deny 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.640
 but the mp7 was godmother was a little toy 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.640
 who killed from any distance 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.200
 You see, for example, uncle, I gave him a thousand 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.010
 bullets and has not died uncle has not died 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.320
 words when I'm going to start dying 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:04.280
 others 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:06.650
 for everything recharged it takes a lot of 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.750
 charge has very few bullets that's another 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.580
 defect of this weapon that has been 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.390
 forgotten to say you have very little 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.280
 bullets 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.710
 has 32 bullets and race that as if 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.180
 I was giving away money to us 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.100
 plants very fast and you run out of bullets 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.690
 casting milk is therefore a weapon 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:25.610
 well as with extended chargers 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:28.010
 can not be extended is that 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.180
 I've honestly played very little with 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.160
 this weapon or also to all 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.160
 accessories was not there 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.890
 unlocked but 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.210
 i will try to unblock i will try 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.820
 unlock what is the charger 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:45.320
 expanded and the scope to put it a 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.070
 little bit better to try to bring you a 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.070
 gameplay 

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:52.089
 it can not be the rest I have not killed it 

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:55.389
 because Uncle mom has killed me all the 

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:57.249
 turret or he gives 25 haymarket so 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:58.929
 less in the chest and one in the head and 

00:06:57.249 --> 00:07:01.119
 it kills the other dress this is what 

00:06:58.929 --> 00:07:03.209
 flipo led five shots in the 

00:07:01.119 --> 00:07:06.699
 chest and age in the head and 

00:07:03.209 --> 00:07:09.639
 unfortunate then nothing guys 24 10 is not 

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:11.319
 none the result so extravagant 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:14.019
 we are in colloquial for which better 

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:15.279
 do not ask for more so there are left guys I hope 

00:07:14.019 --> 00:07:17.439
 that you liked this game we are going to 

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:19.449
 see the little hands he has taken from me because 

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:21.519
 It has taken me a ruthless as you see 

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:23.319
 study prestige number 9 level 44 

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:25.059
 I took advantage of this weekend that 

00:07:23.319 --> 00:07:26.709
 there were double points so you can 

00:07:25.059 --> 00:07:28.089
 know if it came already and give me the oxiden 

00:07:26.709 --> 00:07:30.549
 is at least to raise levels not 

00:07:28.089 --> 00:07:33.099
 let's see I have here 

00:07:30.549 --> 00:07:35.110
 supplies to open already and here we have 

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:36.339
 streak of 10 weapons and that nothing guys 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.169
 I hope you liked it we'll see you 

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:40.110
 next video a like I would appreciate it from 

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:44.789
 true of heart and with the soul 

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:44.789
 subscribe if you are not and goodbye 

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:51.350
 something very simple, there will be no buttons 

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.810
 to activate the traps like any 

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.280
 another map so do not worry 

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.370
 I've done a lot of information like that 

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.370
 knock
