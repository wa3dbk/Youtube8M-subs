00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680 

I<00:00:03.830> think<00:00:04.830> there's<00:00:04.980> going<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.220> be<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.339> lot<00:00:05.580> of

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:05.690

not my work cut out for me it's always

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.390 
not my work cut out for me it's always
difficult<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.320> change<00:00:10.469> environments<00:00:11.219> let

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
difficult to change environments let

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.390 
difficult to change environments let
alone<00:00:11.580> team's<00:00:11.910> personalities<00:00:12.900> personnel<00:00:13.410> and

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
alone team's personalities personnel and

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.799 
alone team's personalities personnel and
I<00:00:14.460> don't<00:00:14.670> discredit<00:00:14.969> what<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.389> challenge

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
I don't discredit what a challenge

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.150 
I don't discredit what a challenge
that's<00:00:15.990> going<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.199> be<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.590> how<00:00:16.680> much<00:00:16.800> work<00:00:17.010> I

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
that's going to be and how much work I

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.160 
that's going to be and how much work I
have<00:00:17.190> ahead<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.520> me<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:18.029> us<00:00:18.330> collectively<00:00:18.779> but

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
I think it's also going to be a really

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.470 
I think it's also going to be a really
worthwhile<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.230> rewarding<00:00:22.740> challenge<00:00:23.480> and

with everybody you know i think the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.590 
with everybody you know i think the
great<00:00:54.420> thing<00:00:54.449> about<00:00:55.820> the<00:00:56.820> pick-and-roll<00:00:57.329> is

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
great thing about the pick-and-roll is

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.560 
great thing about the pick-and-roll is
that<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.640> five-man<00:00:59.640> set<00:01:00.030> even<00:01:00.359> though<00:01:00.449> we

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
that it's a five-man set even though we

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.150 
that it's a five-man set even though we
call<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.960> two-man<00:01:01.289> game<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.710> know<00:01:01.859> dating

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
call it a two-man game you know dating

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.039 
call it a two-man game you know dating
because<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.969> defense<00:01:03.329> has<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.539> use<00:01:03.750> all<00:01:03.899> five

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
because the defense has to use all five

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.929 
because the defense has to use all five
guys<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.530> stop<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.129> not<00:01:05.280> most<00:01:05.489> difficult

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
guys to stop it it's not most difficult

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.630 
guys to stop it it's not most difficult
play<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.119> stop<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.630> basketball<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.520> when<00:01:08.520> they

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
play to stop in basketball and when they

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.510 
play to stop in basketball and when they
choose<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.750> garnet<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.260> way<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:11.100> know<00:01:11.220> we<00:01:11.369> can

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
choose to garnet one way you know we can

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.370 
choose to garnet one way you know we can
make<00:01:11.580> them<00:01:11.850> pay<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.180> somewhere<00:01:12.510> else<00:01:12.540> so<00:01:12.900> it

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
make them pay it somewhere else so it

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.219 
make them pay it somewhere else so it
hopefully<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> situation<00:01:15.119> where<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:16.140> know

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
hopefully is a situation where you know

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.039 
hopefully is a situation where you know
the<00:01:16.350> Lakers<00:01:17.090> can<00:01:18.090> continue<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.600> play<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.960> way

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
the Lakers can continue to play the way

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.830 
the Lakers can continue to play the way
they've<00:01:19.229> been<00:01:19.380> playing<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.360> perhaps<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.659> can

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
they've been playing and perhaps I can

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.940 
they've been playing and perhaps I can
bring<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.320> know<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.450> new<00:01:24.450> angle<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.740> team

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
bring you know a new angle to the team

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.890 
bring you know a new angle to the team
as<00:01:26.159> far<00:01:26.340> as<00:01:26.430> running<00:01:26.640> pick<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.030> rolls<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.570> you

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
as far as running pick and rolls to you

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.330 
as far as running pick and rolls to you
know<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.080> add<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> offense<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.070> make<00:01:29.220> us

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
know to add to the offense and make us

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.859 
know to add to the offense and make us
more<00:01:29.520> difficult<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.060> guard<00:01:30.240> take<00:01:30.600> pressure

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
more difficult to guard take pressure

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.580 
more difficult to guard take pressure
off<00:01:30.990> Kobe<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.740> big<00:01:31.950> guys<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:33.810> know<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.990> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
off Kobe and the big guys you know to to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.530 
off Kobe and the big guys you know to to
make<00:01:34.740> plays<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.070> make<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> game<00:01:36.299> a<00:01:36.329> little

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
make plays and make the game a little

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.179 
make plays and make the game a little
easier<00:01:36.930> for<00:01:37.079> everybody<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.770> think<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
easier for everybody but I think the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.370 
easier for everybody but I think the
beauty<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:39.020> you<00:01:40.020> know<00:01:40.170> when

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
beauty of it is that you know when

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.039 
beauty of it is that you know when
you're<00:01:40.500> running<00:01:40.710> pick<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.130> rolls<00:01:42.049> everyone

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
you're running pick and rolls everyone

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.569 
you're running pick and rolls everyone
just<00:01:43.350> by<00:01:43.560> being<00:01:43.890> on<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.130> floor<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.460> their

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579
