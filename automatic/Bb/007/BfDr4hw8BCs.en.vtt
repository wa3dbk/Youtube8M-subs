knight archetype against wind-up so this

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.379 
knight archetype against wind-up so this
probably<00:00:10.440> wasn't<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.710> best<00:00:10.880> way<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:11.940> test<00:00:12.179> it

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
probably wasn't the best way to test it

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.320 
probably wasn't the best way to test it
because<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.840> be<00:00:12.929> fair<00:00:13.139> no<00:00:13.500> one<00:00:13.650> likes<00:00:14.179> still<00:00:15.179> in

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
because to be fair no one likes still in

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.910 
because to be fair no one likes still in
my<00:00:15.450> opinion<00:00:15.660> on<00:00:15.900> complete<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.410> this<00:00:16.740> was<00:00:16.890> a

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
my opinion on complete and this was a

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.429 
my opinion on complete and this was a
full<00:00:17.279> wind<00:00:17.520> up<00:00:17.640> deck<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.050> opened<00:00:19.050> rather

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
full wind up deck and opened rather

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.660 
full wind up deck and opened rather
broke<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> moment<00:00:20.310> they<00:00:20.369> hit<00:00:20.490> factory

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
broke and the moment they hit factory

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.029 
broke and the moment they hit factory
you've<00:00:21.510> pretty<00:00:21.840> much<00:00:21.930> lost<00:00:22.289> because<00:00:22.619> any<00:00:22.830> deck

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
you've pretty much lost because any deck

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.759 
you've pretty much lost because any deck
they<00:00:23.160> can<00:00:23.279> get<00:00:23.369> advantage<00:00:23.670> over<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.769> going

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
they can get advantage over you is going

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.800 
they can get advantage over you is going
to<00:00:25.830> be<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> problematic<00:00:26.430> for<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:26.880> deck<00:00:27.060> so

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
to be a problematic for this deck so

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.599

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.730 
he's going to of course open with rabbit
and<00:00:29.730> factory<00:00:30.029> which<00:00:30.660> instantly<00:00:31.140> puts<00:00:31.410> me<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.710> a

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
and factory which instantly puts me in a

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.299 
and factory which instantly puts me in a
kind<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.460> awkward<00:00:32.579> position<00:00:33.829> so<00:00:34.829> I'm<00:00:35.100> going<00:00:35.130> to

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
kind of awkward position so I'm going to

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.160 
kind of awkward position so I'm going to
end<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.520> he's<00:00:35.790> gonna<00:00:35.910> say<00:00:36.300> one<00:00:36.630> more<00:00:36.809> back<00:00:36.989> row
