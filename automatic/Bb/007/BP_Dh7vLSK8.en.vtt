that I pay for it and that that is
really<00:02:49.670> really<00:02:49.700> nice<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:51.440> way<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:51.650> did

really really nice and the way you did
out<00:02:52.100> with<00:02:52.400> that<00:02:52.609> is<00:02:52.850> you're<00:02:52.970> going<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.150> use<00:02:53.390> wax

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
out with that is you're going to use wax

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.539 
out with that is you're going to use wax
paper<00:02:54.019> the<00:02:54.290> only<00:02:54.440> thing<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.769> takes<00:02:54.950> about<00:02:55.190> 10

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
paper the only thing it takes about 10

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.699 
paper the only thing it takes about 10
minutes<00:02:55.579> for<00:02:56.060> that<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.359> heat<00:02:56.630> where<00:02:57.560> this

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
minutes for that to heat where this

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.690 
minutes for that to heat where this
takes<00:02:58.010> about<00:02:58.280> 20<00:02:58.790> seconds<00:02:59.359> on<00:02:59.859> I<00:03:00.859> usually<00:03:01.459> keep

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
takes about 20 seconds on I usually keep

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:09.039 
takes about 20 seconds on I usually keep
the<00:03:01.959> lid<00:03:02.959> on<00:03:04.359> the<00:03:05.359> shadow<00:03:07.600> just<00:03:08.600> so<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:08.750> have

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
the lid on the shadow just so I have

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.020 
the lid on the shadow just so I have
something<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.530> hold<00:03:09.709> by<00:03:10.130> it<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.519> that<00:03:10.790> the

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
something to hold by it and that the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.770 
something to hold by it and that the
thing<00:03:11.299> that<00:03:11.329> you'll<00:03:11.630> notice<00:03:11.660> is<00:03:13.660> depending<00:03:14.660> on

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
thing that you'll notice is depending on

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.130 
thing that you'll notice is depending on
how<00:03:15.230> you<00:03:15.290> have<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:16.010> shadow<00:03:16.880> angled<00:03:17.480> there'll

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
how you have the shadow angled there'll

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.520 
how you have the shadow angled there'll
be<00:03:18.170> a<00:03:18.319> separation<00:03:19.010> on<00:03:19.489> the<00:03:19.670> opposite<00:03:20.150> side

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
be a separation on the opposite side

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.410 
be a separation on the opposite side
meaning<00:03:21.530> that<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:21.950> glue<00:03:22.250> is<00:03:22.549> loosening<00:03:23.269> and

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
meaning that the glue is loosening and

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.380 
meaning that the glue is loosening and
the<00:03:24.019> pan<00:03:24.350> is<00:03:24.590> slipping<00:03:25.100> down<00:03:25.370> so<00:03:26.180> that<00:03:26.209> the

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
the pan is slipping down so that the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.110 
the pan is slipping down so that the
opposite<00:03:26.930> side<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:28.160> can<00:03:28.340> actually<00:03:28.519> see<00:03:28.790> the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
opposite side you can actually see the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.000 
opposite side you can actually see the
pan<00:03:29.390> move<00:03:29.690> so<00:03:29.930> I<00:03:29.989> know<00:03:30.109> that<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.530> pan<00:03:30.799> is<00:03:30.829> ready

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
pan move so I know that the pan is ready

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:42.160 
pan move so I know that the pan is ready
to<00:03:31.549> move<00:03:31.819> now<00:03:32.810> i<00:03:32.840> have<00:03:37.690> i<00:03:40.600> have<00:03:41.600> a<00:03:41.840> special

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
to move now i have i have a special

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.640 
to move now i have i have a special
piece<00:03:42.560> of<00:03:42.590> paper<00:03:43.069> that<00:03:43.489> i<00:03:43.609> put<00:03:43.850> on<00:03:43.880> my<00:03:44.000> table

it is i'm working on i'll put that on

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.909 
it is i'm working on i'll put that on
there<00:03:56.419> so<00:03:56.600> it<00:03:56.690> doesn't<00:03:56.989> make<00:03:57.079> a<00:03:57.139> mark<00:03:57.440> on<00:03:57.620> my

bottom now if I had a pallet already
ready<00:04:28.850> I<00:04:29.230> could<00:04:30.230> actually<00:04:30.410> utilize<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.460> glue

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
ready I could actually utilize the glue

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.000 
ready I could actually utilize the glue
that's<00:04:31.760> on<00:04:32.300> here<00:04:32.720> and<00:04:32.930> stick<00:04:33.500> it<00:04:33.530> right<00:04:33.680> into

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
that's on here and stick it right into

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.430 
that's on here and stick it right into
the<00:04:34.250> palette<00:04:34.700> just<00:04:35.000> like<00:04:35.150> that<00:04:35.360> impress<00:04:36.020> and

the palette just like that impress and

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.700 
the palette just like that impress and
let<00:04:37.400> that<00:04:37.610> harden<00:04:38.090> again<00:04:38.210> and<00:04:38.720> that<00:04:39.530> will

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
let that harden again and that will

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.210 
let that harden again and that will
reset<00:04:40.250> itself<00:04:40.330> into<00:04:41.330> that<00:04:41.510> pallet<00:04:42.040> however<00:04:43.040> I

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
reset itself into that pallet however I

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.210 
reset itself into that pallet however I
don't<00:04:43.640> have<00:04:43.910> a<00:04:43.940> pallet<00:04:44.480> available<00:04:44.990> so<00:04:45.920> the<00:04:46.040> one

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.310 
don't want any this is flammable
flammable<00:05:08.360> we<00:05:08.570> don't<00:05:08.750> want<00:05:08.870> to<00:05:08.930> cause<00:05:09.290> any

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
flammable we don't want to cause any

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.640 
flammable we don't want to cause any
fires<00:05:10.060> dip<00:05:11.060> them<00:05:11.240> on<00:05:11.330> a<00:05:11.360> cotton<00:05:11.750> ball<00:05:12.020> just

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
fires dip them on a cotton ball just

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.920 
fires dip them on a cotton ball just
like<00:05:12.710> that<00:05:13.010> and<00:05:13.310> then<00:05:14.180> I'm<00:05:14.390> going<00:05:14.510> to<00:05:14.540> go<00:05:14.690> right

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
like that and then I'm going to go right

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:21.839 
like that and then I'm going to go right
over<00:05:14.990> that<00:05:15.470> glue

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:38.220 

and<00:05:22.059> the<00:05:22.929> alcohol<00:05:23.169> will<00:05:23.889> dissolve<00:05:24.339> that<00:05:24.669> glue

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.890 

so<00:05:39.040> there's<00:05:40.000> a<00:05:40.090> couple<00:05:40.270> of<00:05:40.450> different<00:05:40.690> things

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
so there's a couple of different things

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.310 
so there's a couple of different things
that<00:05:41.050> you<00:05:41.110> can<00:05:41.200> do<00:05:41.500> at<00:05:41.620> this<00:05:41.770> point<00:05:43.140> you<00:05:44.140> can

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
that you can do at this point you can

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.440 
that you can do at this point you can
put<00:05:44.530> a<00:05:44.560> magnet<00:05:45.100> on<00:05:45.250> it<00:05:45.310> if<00:05:45.610> you<00:05:45.970> wanted<00:05:46.300> to

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
put a magnet on it if you wanted to

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.020 
put a magnet on it if you wanted to
magnetize<00:05:47.110> your<00:05:47.470> shadow<00:05:47.770> but<00:05:48.640> when<00:05:48.760> you<00:05:48.820> put

I had a palette that that would go into
ready<00:06:13.860> let's<00:06:14.860> just<00:06:15.010> say<00:06:15.370> that<00:06:15.400> this<00:06:15.730> would<00:06:15.970> be

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
ready let's just say that this would be

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.240 
ready let's just say that this would be
a<00:06:16.420> ready<00:06:16.870> palette<00:06:17.320> this<00:06:17.500> is<00:06:17.680> the<00:06:17.860> color<00:06:18.100> that

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
a ready palette this is the color that

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.250 
a ready palette this is the color that
we<00:06:18.460> just<00:06:18.640> did<00:06:18.940> that<00:06:18.970> I<00:06:19.180> said<00:06:19.450> already<00:06:19.630> had<00:06:19.930> a

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
we just did that I said already had a

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.760 
we just did that I said already had a
copy<00:06:21.130> of<00:06:21.280> it<00:06:21.690> so<00:06:22.690> let's<00:06:22.900> just<00:06:23.170> say<00:06:23.320> this<00:06:23.500> wasn't

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
copy of it so let's just say this wasn't

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.910 
copy of it so let's just say this wasn't
in<00:06:24.070> here<00:06:24.430> I<00:06:24.580> could<00:06:24.910> hot<00:06:25.150> glue<00:06:25.570> this<00:06:25.900> right<00:06:26.650> in

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:26.920 
in here I could hot glue this right in

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.610 
in here I could hot glue this right in
there<00:06:27.790> just<00:06:28.240> like<00:06:28.420> that<00:06:28.480> and<00:06:29.880> I<00:06:31.350> would<00:06:32.350> take

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
there just like that and I would take

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.970

till I made the label and I would have a

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.740 
till I made the label and I would have a
correlating<00:06:45.460> with<00:06:45.490> wherever<00:06:45.880> this<00:06:46.180> sat<00:06:46.510> in

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750 
correlating with wherever this sat in

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.160 
correlating with wherever this sat in
the<00:06:46.840> palette<00:06:47.290> so<00:06:48.280> if<00:06:48.640> this<00:06:48.910> was<00:06:49.270> second<00:06:49.990> from

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.170 
the palette so if this was second from

the palette so if this was second from
the<00:06:50.200> bottom<00:06:50.410> this<00:06:50.950> is<00:06:51.100> going<00:06:51.220> to<00:06:51.280> be<00:06:51.430> second

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
the bottom this is going to be second
