it's got the mini USB 2 full USB and
let's<00:00:17.609> do<00:00:17.789> some<00:00:18.029> tests<00:00:18.480> on<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.810> Nexus<00:00:19.170> 10<00:00:19.199> to

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
let's do some tests on the Nexus 10 to

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.540 
let's do some tests on the Nexus 10 to
see<00:00:19.770> what<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.010> allows<00:00:20.250> us<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.520> do<00:00:22.160> so<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> few

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
see what it allows us to do so a few

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.589 
to ps3 controller to the Nexus 10 via
bluetooth<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.880> know<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.240> was<00:00:30.359> kind<00:00:30.539> of

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
bluetooth and you know it was kind of

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.420 
bluetooth and you know it was kind of
complicated<00:00:30.810> they<00:00:31.289> needed<00:00:31.619> route<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.309> it

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
complicated they needed route and it

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.610

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
the on-the-go cable basically sorts that

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.229 
the on-the-go cable basically sorts that
out<00:00:37.079> completely<00:00:37.559> if<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:37.950> just<00:00:38.219> plug<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.730> your

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
out completely if you just plug in your

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.549 
out completely if you just plug in your
controller<00:00:40.280> to<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:42.270> tablet<00:00:42.840> via<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.170> cable

controller to the tablet via the cable
you<00:00:44.250> can<00:00:44.280> see<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.820> press<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.149> button<00:00:45.180> get

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
you can see if I press the button get

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.060 
you can see if I press the button get
rid<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.110> I'll<00:00:46.320> explain<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:46.950> a

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
rid of that I'll explain that in a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.580 
rid of that I'll explain that in a
minute<00:00:47.539> get<00:00:48.539> rid<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> button<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.320> see

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
minute get rid of the button you can see

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.490 
minute get rid of the button you can see
it<00:00:50.309> just<00:00:50.489> works<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.420> didn't<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.110> install

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
it just works I didn't have to install

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.220 
it just works I didn't have to install
anything<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.579> sixaxis<00:00:54.120> control<00:00:54.719> app<00:00:54.899> isn't

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
anything that sixaxis control app isn't

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.310 
anything that sixaxis control app isn't
running<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:56.190> isn't<00:00:56.520> in<00:00:56.640> my<00:00:56.789> memory<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.960> just

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
running it isn't in my memory it just

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.680 
running it isn't in my memory it just
works<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.949> it's<00:00:59.550> fantastic<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.510> know<00:01:00.539> it

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
works and it's fantastic you know it

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.510 
works and it's fantastic you know it
doesn't<00:01:00.870> need<00:01:01.020> root<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.590> work<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.250> if<00:01:02.370> you're

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
doesn't need root to work so if you're

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.039 
doesn't need root to work so if you're
unrooted<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.149> can<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.420> plug<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.809> go

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
unrooted you can just plug it in and go

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.679 
unrooted you can just plug it in and go
it<00:01:05.040> will<00:01:05.280> obviously<00:01:05.400> work<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.060> games<00:01:06.299> I'm<00:01:06.570> not

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
it will obviously work in games I'm not

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.789 
it will obviously work in games I'm not
going<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.900> show<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.229> now<00:01:07.380> but<00:01:07.560> as<00:01:07.680> long

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
most people want to see however is USB

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.920 
most people want to see however is USB
storage<00:01:25.860> does<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.610> work<00:01:26.850> with<00:01:27.210> USB<00:01:27.509> storage

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
storage does it work with USB storage

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.530 
storage does it work with USB storage
and<00:01:28.650> I've<00:01:28.829> got<00:01:29.040> here<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.430> 40<00:01:29.970> year<00:01:30.090> white<00:01:30.240> USB

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
and I've got here a 40 year white USB

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.690 
and I've got here a 40 year white USB
stick<00:01:30.990> pretty<00:01:31.320> standard<00:01:31.740> obviously<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.549> can

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
stick pretty standard obviously you can

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.340 
stick pretty standard obviously you can
get<00:01:32.850> massive<00:01:33.240> ones<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.750> these<00:01:33.869> now<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.110> can

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
get massive ones of these now you can

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.039 
get massive ones of these now you can
get<00:01:34.500> like<00:01:34.680> 128<00:01:35.610> gigabyte<00:01:36.030> ones<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.540> if<00:01:36.900> it

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
get like 128 gigabyte ones and if it

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.030 
get like 128 gigabyte ones and if it
works<00:01:37.320> it'd<00:01:37.650> be<00:01:37.740> great

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
works it'd be great

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.980 
works it'd be great
so<00:01:38.610> let<00:01:38.850> me<00:01:38.880> plug<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.479> show<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.720> what

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
so let me plug it in and show you what

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.289 
so let me plug it in and show you what
it<00:01:40.049> does<00:01:43.460> ok<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.579> we'll<00:01:44.700> plug<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.270> just

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
it does ok so we'll plug it in and just

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.450 
it does ok so we'll plug it in and just
ignore<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.840> pop-up<00:01:46.409> for<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.680> second<00:01:47.130> because
