hello I'm Ben from Cambridge Audio and

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.710 
hello I'm Ben from Cambridge Audio and
I'm<00:00:02.129> here<00:00:02.399> at<00:00:02.550> Crutchfield<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:03.240> talk<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.570> you

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
I'm here at Crutchfield to talk to you

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.920 
I'm here at Crutchfield to talk to you
about<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:04.080> new<00:00:04.230> 851<00:00:05.069> c-dac<00:00:05.940> CD<00:00:06.720> player

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
about the new 851 c-dac CD player

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.190 
about the new 851 c-dac CD player
preamplifier<00:00:07.830> so<00:00:08.639> as<00:00:08.910> mentioned<00:00:09.690> in<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:09.990> name

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
preamplifier so as mentioned in the name

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.140 
preamplifier so as mentioned in the name
the<00:00:11.269> 851<00:00:12.269> C<00:00:12.480> is<00:00:12.660> not<00:00:13.049> just<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.860> CD<00:00:14.190> player<00:00:14.219> it's

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
the 851 C is not just a CD player it's

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.570 
the 851 C is not just a CD player it's
an<00:00:15.389> actual<00:00:15.660> fact<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.230> best<00:00:16.529> DAC<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.460> we've

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
an actual fact the best DAC that we've

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.439 
an actual fact the best DAC that we've
ever<00:00:17.910> made<00:00:18.529> so<00:00:19.529> inside<00:00:19.890> here<00:00:19.920> we<00:00:20.340> run<00:00:20.609> our<00:00:20.880> ATF

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
ever made so inside here we run our ATF

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.259 
ever made so inside here we run our ATF
audio<00:00:21.960> up<00:00:22.140> sampling<00:00:22.650> technology<00:00:23.060> so<00:00:24.060> we<00:00:24.180> up

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
audio up sampling technology so we up

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.939 
audio up sampling technology so we up
sample<00:00:24.660> all<00:00:24.869> audio<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.439> 24-bit<00:00:26.510> 384<00:00:27.510> kilohertz

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
sample all audio to 24-bit 384 kilohertz

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.519 
sample all audio to 24-bit 384 kilohertz
and<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.310> use<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:30.000> our<00:00:30.150> unique<00:00:30.480> ATF<00:00:31.109> up

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
and we use that in our unique ATF up

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.310 
and we use that in our unique ATF up
sampling<00:00:32.099> by<00:00:32.940> running<00:00:33.120> our<00:00:33.360> ATF<00:00:33.719> up<00:00:33.840> sampling

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
sampling by running our ATF up sampling

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.229 
sampling by running our ATF up sampling
system<00:00:34.710> now<00:00:35.250> that's<00:00:35.430> where<00:00:35.640> we<00:00:35.730> take<00:00:35.880> an<00:00:36.000> audio

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
system now that's where we take an audio

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.090 
system now that's where we take an audio
signal<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.930> real<00:00:37.200> time<00:00:37.500> we<00:00:37.770> apply<00:00:38.070> a

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
signal and in real time we apply a

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.670 
signal and in real time we apply a
polynomial<00:00:38.969> curve<00:00:39.239> fitting<00:00:39.719> algorithm<00:00:40.530> to

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
polynomial curve fitting algorithm to

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.410 
polynomial curve fitting algorithm to
that<00:00:40.800> audio<00:00:41.070> signal<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.640> it's<00:00:42.120> from<00:00:42.270> that

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
that audio signal and it's from that

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.869 
that audio signal and it's from that
curve<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.469> we<00:00:43.680> take<00:00:43.950> our<00:00:44.160> sampled<00:00:44.850> points

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
curve that we take our sampled points

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.590 
curve that we take our sampled points
and<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:45.989> do<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.370> 384<00:00:47.370> thousand<00:00:47.969> times<00:00:48.180> every

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
and we do that 384 thousand times every

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.130 
and we do that 384 thousand times every
second

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
second

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.350 
second
so<00:00:49.710> once<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:50.010> have<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.190> high-quality<00:00:50.579> up

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
so once we have that high-quality up

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.990 
so once we have that high-quality up
sampled<00:00:52.050> digital<00:00:52.800> signal<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.610> then<00:00:53.760> have<00:00:53.910> to

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
sampled digital signal we then have to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.389 
sampled digital signal we then have to
treat<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.239> nicely<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.440> here<00:00:55.649> we<00:00:55.770> have<00:00:55.949> twin

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
treat it nicely so in here we have twin

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.549 
treat it nicely so in here we have twin
analog<00:00:57.149> devices<00:00:57.570> Dax

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
analog devices Dax

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.139 
analog devices Dax
now<00:00:58.920> analog<00:00:59.280> devices<00:00:59.550> are<00:00:59.879> like<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
now analog devices are like the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.779 
now analog devices are like the
rolls-royce<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.379> DAC<00:01:01.530> world<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.070> we<00:01:02.640> use

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
rolls-royce of the DAC world and we use

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.640 
rolls-royce of the DAC world and we use
two<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.090> them<00:01:03.390> one<00:01:03.660> per<00:01:03.899> channel<00:01:04.170> left<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
two of them one per channel left and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.929 
two of them one per channel left and
right<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> left<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.790> right

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
right so that the left and the right

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.719 
right so that the left and the right
channels<00:01:06.330> are<00:01:06.479> processed<00:01:06.960> separately<00:01:07.729> to

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
channels are processed separately to

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.520 
channels are processed separately to
give<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.030> best<00:01:09.360> possible<00:01:09.630> soundstage

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
give you the best possible soundstage

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.590 
give you the best possible soundstage
stereo<00:01:11.070> imaging<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.640> sound<00:01:11.909> quality<00:01:12.060> from

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
stereo imaging and sound quality from

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.109 
stereo imaging and sound quality from
whatever<00:01:12.840> your<00:01:13.159> your<00:01:14.159> digital<00:01:14.549> whatever<00:01:14.970> your

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
whatever your your digital whatever your

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.219 
whatever your your digital whatever your
signal<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:16.250> so<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.549> couple<00:01:17.850> of

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
signal is so have a couple of

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.780 
signal is so have a couple of
traditional<00:01:19.229> digital<00:01:19.439> inputs<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> back

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
traditional digital inputs on the back

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.140 
traditional digital inputs on the back
so<00:01:20.970> have<00:01:21.119> s/pdif<00:01:21.509> Toslink<00:01:22.170> digital<00:01:22.650> inputs<00:01:23.150> so

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
so have s/pdif Toslink digital inputs so

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.980 
so have s/pdif Toslink digital inputs so
I<00:01:24.180> can<00:01:24.330> connect<00:01:24.600> up<00:01:24.780> digital<00:01:25.740> sources<00:01:26.220> such<00:01:26.549> as

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
I can connect up digital sources such as

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.710 
I can connect up digital sources such as
