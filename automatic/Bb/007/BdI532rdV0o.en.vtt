00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
back real equal we've got these try

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.639 
back real equal we've got these try
statues<00:00:53.670> here<00:00:54.090> provide<00:00:54.840> cover<00:00:55.140> there<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.590> a

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
statues here provide cover there and a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.380 
statues here provide cover there and a
smaller<00:00:56.039> version<00:00:56.309> over<00:00:56.699> here<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> fusion

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
smaller version over here with a fusion

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.540 
smaller version over here with a fusion
coil<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.780> middle<00:00:58.050> again<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.309> don't<00:00:59.430> want

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
coil in the middle again you don't want

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.510 
coil in the middle again you don't want
too<00:00:59.879> much<00:01:00.530> too<00:01:01.530> much<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.859> hide<00:01:02.070> behind<00:01:02.280> that

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
too much too much to hide behind that

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.060 
too much too much to hide behind that
defeats<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.000> point<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.660> turret<00:01:03.979> but<00:01:04.979> you

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
defeats the point of the turret but you

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.620 
defeats the point of the turret but you
do<00:01:05.250> have<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.489> little<00:01:05.820> bit<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.210> work<00:01:06.360> with

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
do have a little bit to work with

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.940 
do have a little bit to work with
basically<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.439> going<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.650> be<00:01:07.710> trying<00:01:07.920> to

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
basically this is going to be trying to

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.039 
basically this is going to be trying to
distract<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.490> turret<00:01:08.820> once<00:01:09.390> he<00:01:09.510> already<00:01:09.630> has

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
distract the turret once he already has

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.649 
distract the turret once he already has
it<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:10.590> rushing<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.490> failing<00:01:12.390> many

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
it and just rushing it in failing many

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.000 
it and just rushing it in failing many
times<00:01:12.900> before<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.260> can<00:01:13.439> take<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.710> over<00:01:13.890> again

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
times before you can take it over again

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
really the main entrance to the base

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.620 
really the main entrance to the base
here's<00:01:25.470> our<00:01:25.740> Marvel<00:01:26.189> space<00:01:26.430> okay<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.420> main

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
those respawn but yeah this is basically

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.449

it<00:03:47.250> it's<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.390> recreation<00:03:49.290> of<00:03:49.410> ascension<00:03:50.040> not

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
it it's the recreation of ascension not

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.940 
it it's the recreation of ascension not
necessarily<00:03:51.330> the<00:03:51.480> whole<00:03:51.660> map<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:52.170> just<00:03:52.680> wanted

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
necessarily the whole map I just wanted

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.470 
necessarily the whole map I just wanted
to<00:03:52.980> recreate<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.640> tower<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.940> feel<00:03:57.450> of

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
to recreate the tower and the feel of

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.300 
to recreate the tower and the feel of
the<00:03:57.810> game<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:58.320> this<00:03:58.500> is<00:03:58.650> in<00:03:58.769> a<00:03:58.830> full<00:03:59.070> map

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
the game so this is in a full map

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.060 
the game so this is in a full map
recreation<00:03:59.970> but<00:04:00.209> this<00:04:01.019> is<00:04:01.170> my<00:04:01.320> take<00:04:01.560> on<00:04:01.769> it<00:04:01.830> for

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
recreation but this is my take on it for

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.509 
recreation but this is my take on it for
halo<00:04:02.370> 3<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:02.880> plays<00:04:03.600> really<00:04:03.810> well<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.320> I<00:04:05.250> hope

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
halo 3 I plays really well and I hope

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.360 
halo 3 I plays really well and I hope
you'll<00:04:05.910> enjoy<00:04:06.030> it<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.870> game<00:04:07.110> type<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:08.070> start

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
you'll enjoy it the game type you start

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.420 
you'll enjoy it the game type you start
with<00:04:08.459> shotguns<00:04:09.470> nothing<00:04:10.470> else<00:04:10.590> on<00:04:10.769> the<00:04:10.860> map<00:04:11.070> so

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
with shotguns nothing else on the map so

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.270 
with shotguns nothing else on the map so
basically<00:04:12.090> control<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.080> tower<00:04:13.290> that's<00:04:14.130> why

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
basically control the tower that's why

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.240 
basically control the tower that's why
it's<00:04:14.430> called<00:04:14.459> tower<00:04:14.910> power<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.260> that's<00:04:16.979> it

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
it's called tower power and that's it

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.729 
it's called tower power and that's it
for<00:04:17.430> this<00:04:17.520> map
