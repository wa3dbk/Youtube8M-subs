00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.460
 green business men's magazine and 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.850
 companies that take care of the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.540
 planet 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.620
 nathalie crossed on bfm business 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.780
 France is still the third 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.820
 global consumer of pesticides but 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.139
 regulations evolve in this area 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.449
 we will talk about it in a moment 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.340
 laboratory already limits the inputs 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.080
 it is bio wines from France to 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.789
 blua hello director's gifts 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.650
 general of old lab debates you 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.689
 design manufacture distribute 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.820
 natural solutions we will understand this 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.510
 which is natural to all then you 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.250
 say yourself 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.780
 obviously the regulations evolve on 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.190
 will talk about it but eventually you would be 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.149
 came a few years ago 10 years ago 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.250
 would not have had the same impact 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.540
 now there is a real evolution and 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.950
 a need to turn to 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.390
 more natural solutions for 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.500
 agriculture but also for the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.670
 gardener because we will see him 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.440
 also work for individuals 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.640
 actually I think the sector 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.829
 farmer becomes aware that he is coming 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.539
 in a stalemate 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.430
 the end consumer also does 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.899
 pressure to have a traceability and 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.940
 safety and security 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.350
 food that makes that is a real 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.390
 need to evolve on 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.520
 more natural solutions that guarantee 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.629
 this food security and that goes 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.189
 actually in the treatment of 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.150
 crops and in the diet of 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.159
 animals in relation to the problems 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.869
 antimicrobial resistance I was talking about 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.189
 of pesticides in introduction you 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.659
 how do you see in relation to this 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.670
 market still like a like a 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.590
 complement even though there is still a 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.900
 legislation also it has evolved I believe 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.460
 that from 1 January 2022 will be 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.080
 prohibited on mission the market the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.060
 rescue use also products 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.710
 phytosanitary for non-use 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.860
 professional also so for a use 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.860
 Not professional 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.229
 it's one of the biggest polluters the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.520
 regulations evolves it turns out that 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.380
 before coming here i was in brussels 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.659
 because the discussions are going on 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.670
 currently on the accreditation one is 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.140
 seeing that actually the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.939
 discussions are going on with different 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.200
 speakers 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.390
 whether scientists are 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.040
 so the European Union but also all 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.500
 the years all the representatives of 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.909
 conventional industry is what 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.470
 regulation is going in the right direction I 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.469
 tell you after the day I was passing 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.820
 in brussels i'm not sure 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.780
 no we position in any case as 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.609
 an adjunct to treatments 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.140
 we help anti phytosanitary 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:05.579
 pesticides we think it takes a 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.009
 reasoned use a use 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.470
 that goes in the right direction with a good 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.879
 use ie curative virtues and 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.519
 not position itself as a complement 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.840
 of these phytosanitary treatments and it 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.549
 we need exactly one hour 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.540
 pardon fermentation adapted since at 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.640
 Right now we have the choice 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.010
 in the treatment of crops be 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.180
 fertilizers either pesticides and 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.769
 is a middle way that concerns our 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.540
 products and which can not 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.799
 position ourselves right now 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.209
 if still cashed matter of 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.890
 pesticides we hear more and more 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.780
 speak we say be careful our children are 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.370
 exposed in agricultural zone sa there is a 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.599
 question if you felt worried more 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.890
 in larger and especially for 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.140
 consumers actually 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.239
 actually the stake and sanitary 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.370
 the issue the repercussions are total 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.190
 even if we extrapolate it goes to the 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.640
 social security the desert impact 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.290
 sanitary 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.610
 so actually there is a real 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.700
 movement that is set up one is 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.870
 different actors putting pressure 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.390
 from there in there is a real take of 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.069
 consciousness also series worship hours on 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.290
 the health of their children on health 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.840
 of their employees and their health had 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.150
 also so we see that listened to there 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.209
 that things are changing 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.500
 actually we as a society 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.720
 innovative we would like it to advance 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.519
 a little faster but we do our 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.620
 merry way and then it's 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.269
 supernatural just 7 ckoi for example 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.190
 to understand how you too 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.590
 develop all these products offer you 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.730
 for vegetable animal productions 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.720
 so we can not know how to do is 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.160
 based 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.180
 adou know how to make the formulation 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.500
 that is, we work on 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.970
 natural substances we will work 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.330
 on vegetable matter based on 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.030
 plants 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.510
 so our business lies in 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.860
 extraction of these substances 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.000
 natural from dry plants 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.920
 is also the name of the formulation of 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.680
 these substances together because they are 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.150
 mixture to get a product but 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.860
 also the process of extraction of 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.390
 natural substances and so we 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.380
 let's go play through his products that 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.880
 whether in the animal or in the plant 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.500
 what are we going to call in a way for the 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.100
 popularize the human level on 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.300
 antioxidants 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.310
 that is, we will manage everything that 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.540
 is oxidative stress we're going to handle on and 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.100
 work on the immunity of the plant 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.950
 or animal to work upstream 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.360
 the goal being what's pressing at the beginning of 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.740
 animal life at the beginning of the life of the 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.050
 plant make sure that the system 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.090
 immune of the plant either to its 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.680
 maximum potential and accompany it all 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.570
 throughout his life started a business 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.980
 in full development you 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.510
 know a success also to 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.510
 the international and that must be said if 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.870
 it turns out we're waiting so we created 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.150
 society in 2005 now we have 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.820
 started our exports in 2008 to 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.980
 Poland on cabbage crops 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.260
 could more accurate and actually 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.610
 we feed fine benefit from a 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.960
 extremely positive word of mouth 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.200
 because here this year we start 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.830
 Algeria exports in canada 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.210
 by the way on youtube step 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.930
 commercial so we can go 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.630
 we are a technology 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.860
 actually that's proven and we 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.960
 has also a subsidiary in Morocco since 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.460
 2010 since wholesale market level 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.660
 vegetable crops that export 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.000
 towards the European Union of which they 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.530
 open problematic of residues for 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.400
 enter the European market for 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:02.610
 Moroccan cultures and so we export 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.490
 our know-how as and when 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.810
 also hungary in germany a lot 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.180
 it's good here you develop yourself 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.070
 have recently inaugurated the 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.570
 third extension your premises as well 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.160
 because you are in a growth 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.360
 constant frank had also stéphane the 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.440
 foll the thousand farmers who 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.090
 were present 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.460
 we had the chance and the honor of 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.600
 the star of having stéphane the foll that is 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.920
 come on so there would be another new 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.980
 extension so it makes a new 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.030
 production building who who 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.830
 accompanies the growth of society 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.710
 growth in volumes that are 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.200
 realized and it's true that it was a 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.510
 chance that of the way since we have 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.730
 a minister who is really in favor 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.400
 of this type of solution that is prone 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.330
 agroecology for a crop 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.710
 ecologically profitable 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.760
 there is this plan also eco-cities we talk about 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.770
 regulation is still in 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.370
 cinema we use a mind is a 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.050
 goal 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.310
 the goal of 50% reduction of 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.150
 Phytosanitary treatments on the horizon 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.770
 2018 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.630
 is it going to be held I do not know 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.210
 not but good on good to set 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.850
 goals 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:05.670
 good in all by allowing to achieve this 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.200
 level there without problem and we 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.790
 let's go with that plan and then 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.780
 this market quite new I think 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.670
 this is the last year of 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.960
 amateur gardeners osséja banks them 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.150
 professionals if you are in the process of 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.830
 propose would we have heard of 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.400
 develop so we developed replicated 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:24.360
 our technology for the gardener 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.669
 amateur all the complexity of this 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.860
 market actually resides in the act 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:30.630
 purchase since on products that 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.520
 are technical since in a market 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.919
 we support the agricultural 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:37.919
 advice recommendations we know that 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:40.169
 in supermarket the act of purchase is 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:41.190
 different since we are in a radius 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:42.770
 do not necessarily have suitable advice 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.580
 so it's up to us to make sure 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.840
 work on a global communication 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.430
 that we are defining a 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.010
 pedagogy strategy to explain 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.600
 the interest of these products there in life 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.520
 everyday including when we say 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.030

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.270

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:59.880
 that's exactly what you know as 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:02.400

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.570
 field and we have a real will with 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.970

 work in there year poured towards 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.919
 this notion what is needed 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.900
 realize that we are working on 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:11.400
 products that are the only company 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.960
 with a guarantee of no 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.240
 toxicity these to treat them 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.240
 in the presence of the children of the animals 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.530
 does not harm the fauna and flora and we 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.640
 will just prevent everything 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.810
