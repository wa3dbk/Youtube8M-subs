it<00:01:01.530> looks<00:01:02.070> very<00:01:02.309> nice<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.730> becomes<00:01:02.970> easier<00:01:03.360> as

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:25.520 

the<00:01:17.400> leaders<00:01:17.670> literally<00:01:17.910> have<00:01:24.230> further<00:01:25.230> like

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
the leaders literally have further like

Concord<00:01:26.100> has<00:01:26.540> how<00:01:27.540> do<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.810> actually<00:01:27.990> see<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
Concord has how do you actually see the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.020 
Concord has how do you actually see the
future<00:01:28.860> for<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.160> airplane<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.790> next

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
future for this airplane of the next

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.600 
future for this airplane of the next
engine<00:01:30.650> well<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.770> future<00:01:32.160> I<00:01:32.190> think<00:01:32.280> is

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
engine well the future I think is

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.410 
engine well the future I think is
assured<00:01:33.470> certainly<00:01:34.470> 10<00:01:34.830> years<00:01:35.180> more<00:01:36.180> than

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
assured certainly 10 years more than

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.180 
assured certainly 10 years more than
likely<00:01:36.660> to<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.080> end<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.380> century<00:01:37.590> John<00:01:38.010> is

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
likely to the end of the century John is

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.540 
likely to the end of the century John is
getting<00:01:39.150> better<00:01:39.510> and<00:01:39.690> better<00:01:39.750> all<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.080> time

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
getting better and better all the time

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.770 
getting better and better all the time
say<00:01:41.550> if<00:01:41.610> you're<00:01:41.760> making<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.150> look<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.510> easy

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
say if you're making it look so easy

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.930 
say if you're making it look so easy
that<00:01:43.350> you're<00:01:43.530> really<00:01:43.980> making<00:01:44.310> me<00:01:44.340> itch<00:01:44.550> to<00:01:44.790> get

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
that you're really making me itch to get

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.550 
that you're really making me itch to get
my<00:01:45.120> hands<00:01:45.510> on<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.720> controls<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.380> think<00:01:46.500> I

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
my hands on the controls do you think I

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.470 
my hands on the controls do you think I
could<00:01:46.710> just<00:01:46.830> have<00:01:46.980> a<00:01:47.010> little<00:01:47.970> girl<00:01:48.150> flying
