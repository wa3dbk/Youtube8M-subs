00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.400
 I do not wake up on an alarm clock because 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.119

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.210

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.350
 Links to my social network have descriptions 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.150
 I wear my favorite socks and I love 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.220
 the tanks are not for me just uncomfortable and in 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.580
 Generally, I get up and start refueling 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.580
 bed 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.059
 after I made the bed I 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.059
 go to the bathroom 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.570
 I make myself a tail and start cleaning 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.570
 teeth and wash 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.520
 Well 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.420
 for breakfast I love either porridge or minus 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.999
 whether these porridge is very easy to brew them 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.270
 no need to say but today Iâ€™m all 

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:40.009
 decided to choose muesli 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.350
 I fill a small amount of local 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.810
 container and they are pretty nourishing therefore 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.719
 I am just giving to put the kettle 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.740
 I pour the already boiled water into the carafe and 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.659
 and 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.579
 it is better not to boil the same water 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.380
 several times just such water can 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:58.069
 kidney stones 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.759
 which is very, very bad fill if 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.289
 boiling water and close the container lid 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:07.939
 still for breakfast i like to do myself 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:10.160
 green tea love complemented breakfast 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.120
 various fruits and today I decided 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.120
 cut yourself a melon 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.930
 while thoughts make me go to the room 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.930
 and a little tidying up 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.709
 but 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.810
 after i took a little bit i 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.810
 I try to read a little 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.650
 and after that I will leave my food on the table 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:00.209
 and start to eat breakfast clear on tv 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.209
 and I go back to the social network 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:45.080
 and so my makeup 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.750
 and first I use the balm from with for 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.940
 moisturizing their stupid as 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.190
 concealer and i use cream from exactly 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.349
 and it turns out very light weightless 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.709
 coating which is perfect on 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.709
 summer 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.799
 using eyebrow brush i 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.500
 comb your eyebrows and thereby 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.200
 tidy i'm not using any 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.140
 helium eye shadow and eyebrow pencils 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.060
 I just do not need it for 6 brushes I 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.330
 I put blush on my counters 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.460
 blush from rimmel to zero 20 mm shades and 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.730
 these blush give very very beautiful 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.730
 radiance 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.650
 I'm still a little bit on our dark 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.160
 blush from pupa 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.250
 i just give my skin a little live 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.850
 shade and my skin is very harmful therefore 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:53.400
 I somehow make it more lively and at the end 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.370
 I just put my favorite mascara on 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.310
 Meybellin is my most favorite from 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.290
