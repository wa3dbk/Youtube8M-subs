00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:42.289
 the beauty guys made the audio will give 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:44.180
 hear right but now there are 5 and 6 already 

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:48.170
 it is completely dark that on the street 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.420
 people are in autumn and temperature 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.449
 falling enough right now to change the 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.790
 four degrees to king and I wanted to show 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:59.659
 a little bit for you a little bit of the 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.500
 traffic on the street as it is in the 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:05.860
 rush 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.860
 the staff leaving work then 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.140
 you can see that there is not much traffic 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.119
 this is an area that is quite a transit 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.280
 in fact but still very little 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.630
 right I think over the question of the 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.939
 personnel who comply with the 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:29.860
 buses can see that it is 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:35.320
 completely empty and traffic flows 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:38.459
 right here in geek to thomas writing is a 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.539
 street leading to dengue center 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.540
 It's very quiet. 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.550
 traffic is fine 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.950
 very quiet even enough people 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.370
 Coming home by bike. 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.630
 now passing here in front of the 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.830
 guinness factory 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.720
 I think I will not give to see right 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.400
 also dark 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.460
 there on the front is that building 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:05.550
 also illuminated the guinness 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:08.040
 and then you know a little of my 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:15.290
 routine when he came to walk home each 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:15.290
 15 minutes walk and that's what it said
