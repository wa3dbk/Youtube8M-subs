 and with the youtube people as they were 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.379
 I hope you are very good this Friday 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.969
 I 'm going to tell you to play this song 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:16.010
 Leon Garcia who is called I'm going to 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:17.420
 lose that the can is leaving fernandez 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.150
 but right now he's taking it out with hash 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.760
 so then let's start 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.369
 ok let's start with the first verse 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.779
 that nothing to use a bonnet fret 3 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.490
 good in Leonel's version uses the 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.220
 capo here if you want to play the one in 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.829
 Alejandro only remove the capo and what 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.079
 they play normal, but it's good 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.399
 version carries the bonnet on the fret 3 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.399
 and we start with a greater 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.790
 after a minor 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.489
 If you do not want to donate a little, put the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.790
 seventh here in fret 6 other 3 from 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.790
 the capo 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.510
 then we go to a king 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.220
 and then we go to a greater 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.220
 and in this way 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.220
 I repeat nothing 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.520
 that only goes on those three 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.350
 chords strumming once it 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.510
 I explain would be in this way one towards 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.470
 down and then down up up down 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.470
 and it repeats 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.120
 it's very simple 1 down and then 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.120
 two combinations from bottom to top 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.689
 the 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.280

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.819
 then we go to a greater being 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.030

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.440

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.930
 and we go back to what we no longer know 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.869
 they repeat exactly the same, there is only one 

00:04:55.619 --> 00:05:01.319
 different part that is the solo guitar 

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:04.639
