00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.830
 He talks to his mother friend Nintendo Lee 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.960
 I want to take the opportunity that 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.720
 I have today to be able to interact with 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.110

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.680

 to thousands of people like you 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.560
 I have the possibility of having my side 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.670
 a cell phone 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.370
 and I also have the possibility to be able 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.050
 enjoy a delicious cup of 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.050
 and today I want to share with you 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:55.160
 and next to this delicious cup of coffee and 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.770
 this spring day that accompanies us 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.340
 the subject that I have prepared and that I want 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.460
 share this this mind 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.400
 they are alone seeing us alone 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.580
 being in company 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.930
 yes I know that many of you in some 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.480
 moment of your inspiration 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:18.330
 they feel that they have a partner 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.330
 but that likewise the sensation 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.800
 breathe 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.620
 a metaphor that can resemble 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.520
 this situation and on this issue that today 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.520
 I share 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.880
 that simply does not let her 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.250
 enjoy the sun's rays that the 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.670
 lets enjoy the rays of inah that 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.670
 they have it 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.509
 a situation and a promotion 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.200
 very sad to have a partner by your side 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.740
 but equally feel alone 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.289
 and it also looks a little like for example 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.600
 a patient that at some point I had 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.970
 who told me that in a moment 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.240
 determined of his life 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.640
 she was fired from her job and she 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.930
 when he returned home he thought 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.810
 find at his side a person who 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.000
 support giving her the love and the water that 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:22.630
 It sank 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:26.290
 but a couple that was coming was looking 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.870
 come because you are not a person interest 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.180
 you are not a person who deserves a 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.780
 I work like people 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:38.790
 that is just living as the 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.790
 enemy as the movie is just 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.530
 why not 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.709
 and what he does is the sidewalk of the car 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.700
 over and a little bit of self love each 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.580
 who can have believe me you are done 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.220
 for sacred and every day you must 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.390
 thank you because you are the best thing that has 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.700
 happened 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.819
 and since you are the best thing that has 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.340
 happened 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.129
 you have every right to have in your 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.400
 life a person who can feed your 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.370
 soul 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.159
 and you will tell me lynn mother how can i do 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.110
 I'm sure that if you could 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:19.700
 interacting with me would tell me how can I 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.040
 free myself from 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.890
 Well, that is precisely the moment 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.129
 precise for you to make the decision 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.160
 timely that you can free your soul 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:33.709
 You can expand your wings and go flying 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.560
 and give you the opportunity to live 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.290
 with yourself to live with yourself 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.330
 to prepare your body and your spirit to 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.420
 that a person can come to your life 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.069
 great you can get the best out of 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.549
 you 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.239
 maybe you should reflect a bit that 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.769
 for a long time he has been bent 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.500
 bent on having a person by your side 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.980
 that simply 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.290
 and do not tell yourself that you do not discover what 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.500
 better than there 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.430
 You are a valuable should you ever be 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.359
 I will forget 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.840
 then starting today leave that 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:16.560
 person with whom you are not happy 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.790
 which you feel is not knowing what 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.600
 best of you 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:25.400
 to be alone 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:29.660
 being in company it is better to be alone 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.759
 because for myself then my dear 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.860
 to myself my dear friend required the 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.259
 way that this path towards 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.139
 happiness came the moment to unfold 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.030
 the wings 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.069
 thank you very much for listening to me 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.950

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.970

 of signs
