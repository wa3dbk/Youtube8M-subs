what I'm trying to demonstrate probably
evolved<00:00:50.120> over<00:00:50.570> a<00:00:50.600> period<00:00:50.720> of<00:00:51.290> time<00:00:51.590> at<00:00:52.460> first<00:00:52.820> I

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
evolved over a period of time at first I

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.030 
evolved over a period of time at first I
wasn't<00:00:53.210> sure<00:00:53.600> I<00:00:53.630> was<00:00:53.960> looking<00:00:54.290> for<00:00:54.530> images

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
wasn't sure I was looking for images

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.690

that<00:00:55.220> might<00:00:55.370> be<00:00:55.580> surreal<00:00:56.120> that<00:00:56.480> might<00:00:56.660> be

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
that might be surreal that might be

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.340 
that might be surreal that might be
pictures<00:00:58.700> that<00:00:58.880> we<00:00:59.000> hadn't<00:00:59.300> seen<00:00:59.480> before<00:00:59.540> and

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
pictures that we hadn't seen before and

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.560 
pictures that we hadn't seen before and
the<00:01:01.010> camera<00:01:01.370> was<00:01:01.520> capable<00:01:01.730> of<00:01:02.059> doing<00:01:02.420> these

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
the camera was capable of doing these

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.079 
the camera was capable of doing these
things<00:01:02.930> if<00:01:03.260> you<00:01:03.440> allow<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.770> reality<00:01:04.520> to<00:01:04.790> help

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
things if you allow the reality to help

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:07.990 
things if you allow the reality to help
you<00:01:05.300> so<00:01:06.080> you<00:01:06.530> didn't<00:01:06.860> manipulate<00:01:07.100> anything

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
you so you didn't manipulate anything

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.170 
you so you didn't manipulate anything
you<00:01:08.270> simply<00:01:08.750> went<00:01:09.619> in<00:01:09.979> front<00:01:10.430> of<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:10.670> lens<00:01:10.880> and

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
you simply went in front of the lens and

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.540 
you simply went in front of the lens and
you<00:01:11.330> saw<00:01:11.600> or<00:01:11.869> what<00:01:12.020> was<00:01:12.200> what<00:01:12.770> did<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.100> camera

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
you saw or what was what did the camera

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.420 
you saw or what was what did the camera
see<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:14.240> camera<00:01:14.479> became<00:01:15.440> my<00:01:15.680> collaborator

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
see so the camera became my collaborator

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:23.230 
see so the camera became my collaborator
for<00:01:16.700> making<00:01:17.030> strange<00:01:17.509> images<00:01:20.140> as<00:01:21.490> I<00:01:22.490> continued

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
for making strange images as I continued

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.499 
for making strange images as I continued
to<00:01:23.360> make<00:01:23.540> them<00:01:23.750> over<00:01:24.610> first<00:01:25.610> ten<00:01:25.910> years<00:01:26.300> it

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
to make them over first ten years it

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.350 
to make them over first ten years it
became<00:01:26.780> clear<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.170> me<00:01:27.440> that<00:01:27.470> I<00:01:27.770> was<00:01:28.250> drawn<00:01:28.820> very

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
became clear to me that I was drawn very

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.160 
became clear to me that I was drawn very
much<00:01:29.660> to<00:01:30.050> the<00:01:30.710> natural<00:01:31.220> backgrounds<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:32.240> I

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
much to the natural backgrounds and I

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.770 
much to the natural backgrounds and I
was<00:01:33.350> also<00:01:33.530> very<00:01:34.040> aware<00:01:34.190> that<00:01:34.640> I<00:01:34.700> I<00:01:35.030> needed<00:01:35.660> to

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
was also very aware that I I needed to

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.139 
was also very aware that I I needed to
be<00:01:35.960> in<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.170> nude<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:37.009> that<00:01:37.160> I<00:01:37.190> could<00:01:37.490> be<00:01:37.759> also

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
be in the nude so that I could be also

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.450 
be in the nude so that I could be also
natural<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:39.680> that<00:01:39.890> there<00:01:40.130> would<00:01:40.310> be<00:01:40.340> a

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
natural so that there would be a

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.520 
natural so that there would be a
connection<00:01:40.850> between<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.660> nudity<00:01:42.140> of<00:01:42.350> the

happened<00:02:54.139> is<00:02:54.200> they<00:02:54.350> realized<00:02:54.829> that<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.310> was

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
happened is they realized that I was

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.370 
happened is they realized that I was
discovering<00:02:56.329> Finland

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
discovering Finland

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.430 
discovering Finland
I<00:02:57.470> was<00:02:58.280> coming<00:02:58.520> back<00:02:58.610> to<00:02:58.880> my<00:02:59.210> homeland<00:02:59.690> because

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
I was coming back to my homeland because

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.370 
I was coming back to my homeland because
I<00:03:00.590> had<00:03:00.710> emigrated<00:03:01.310> as<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:01.730> little<00:03:02.090> boy<00:03:02.240> and<00:03:02.540> so

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
I had emigrated as a little boy and so

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.120 
I had emigrated as a little boy and so
this<00:03:03.560> was<00:03:03.740> my<00:03:03.770> opportunity<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:05.110> express<00:03:06.130> my

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
this was my opportunity to express my

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.460 
this was my opportunity to express my
love<00:03:07.160> for<00:03:07.730> this<00:03:07.850> country<00:03:07.910> of<00:03:08.480> mine<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:09.440> I

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
love for this country of mine and I

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.520 
love for this country of mine and I
think<00:03:09.710> they<00:03:09.950> saw<00:03:10.340> me

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
think they saw me

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.800 
think they saw me
interpreting<00:03:12.530> Finland<00:03:13.490> in<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.180> very<00:03:14.390> unique

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
interpreting Finland in a very unique

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.740 
interpreting Finland in a very unique
way<00:03:15.140> and<00:03:15.610> little<00:03:16.610> by<00:03:16.850> little<00:03:17.120> people<00:03:17.540> came

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
way and little by little people came

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.640 
way and little by little people came
around<00:03:17.960> to<00:03:18.440> that<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:19.010> I<00:03:19.460> sensed<00:03:20.330> it<00:03:20.480> too<00:03:20.650> it

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
around to that and I sensed it too it

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.840 
around to that and I sensed it too it
would<00:03:21.770> have<00:03:21.860> been<00:03:21.980> very<00:03:22.010> difficult<00:03:22.490> to

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
would have been very difficult to

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.970 
would have been very difficult to
continue<00:03:23.300> if<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:24.140> work<00:03:24.320> hadn't<00:03:24.800> been

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
continue if the work hadn't been

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.400 
continue if the work hadn't been
received<00:03:25.490> with<00:03:26.180> with<00:03:26.720> warmth<00:03:27.200> and

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
received with with warmth and

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:35.080 
received with with warmth and
understanding<00:03:28.300> eventually<00:03:29.300> in<00:03:29.450> Finland<00:03:34.090> when

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
understanding eventually in Finland when

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.440 
understanding eventually in Finland when
I'm<00:03:35.240> photographing<00:03:36.220> I<00:03:37.220> go<00:03:37.940> through<00:03:38.150> a<00:03:38.210> process

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
I'm photographing I go through a process

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.360 
I'm photographing I go through a process
of<00:03:38.990> imagination<00:03:40.570> and<00:03:41.570> and<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.920> pleasure<00:03:43.220> of

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
of imagination and and the pleasure of

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.370 
of imagination and and the pleasure of
working<00:03:43.700> this<00:03:44.120> way<00:03:44.390> which<00:03:44.690> adds<00:03:45.020> to<00:03:45.230> the

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
working this way which adds to the

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.550 
working this way which adds to the
continuity<00:03:46.120> that<00:03:47.120> that<00:03:47.510> you<00:03:47.810> never<00:03:48.050> know<00:03:48.290> what

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
continuity that that you never know what

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.880 
continuity that that you never know what
you're<00:03:48.740> going<00:03:48.920> to<00:03:49.100> get<00:03:49.720> was<00:03:50.720> so<00:03:50.930> contagious<00:03:51.380> it

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
you're going to get was so contagious it

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.770 
you're going to get was so contagious it
was<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.160> addictive<00:03:52.610> right<00:03:53.030> from<00:03:53.360> the<00:03:53.510> start

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
was it addictive right from the start

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.770 
was it addictive right from the start
and<00:03:54.310> so<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.370> know<00:03:55.790> that<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.180> camera<00:03:56.330> sees

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
and so you know that the camera sees

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.130 
and so you know that the camera sees
something<00:03:57.440> and<00:03:57.650> no<00:03:58.580> one<00:03:58.850> sees<00:03:59.120> that<00:03:59.150> only<00:04:00.050> the

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
something and no one sees that only the

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.950 
something and no one sees that only the
camera<00:04:00.380> knows<00:04:00.680> what<00:04:01.190> it<00:04:01.310> saw<00:04:01.550> and<00:04:01.910> it<00:04:02.660> becomes

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
camera knows what it saw and it becomes

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.620 
camera knows what it saw and it becomes
the<00:04:03.200> collaborator<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:04.160> so<00:04:04.700> I<00:04:04.940> learned<00:04:05.450> to

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
the collaborator and so I learned to

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.020 
the collaborator and so I learned to
think<00:04:05.810> like<00:04:06.110> a<00:04:06.140> lens<00:04:06.470> I<00:04:06.920> learned<00:04:07.130> to<00:04:07.310> I<00:04:07.550> know

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
think like a lens I learned to I know

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.460 
think like a lens I learned to I know
all<00:04:08.270> the<00:04:08.420> different<00:04:08.750> things<00:04:08.780> that<00:04:09.020> elevenses

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
all the different things that elevenses

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.550 
all the different things that elevenses
but<00:04:10.100> but<00:04:10.580> I<00:04:10.640> also<00:04:10.820> it<00:04:11.150> opens<00:04:11.510> up<00:04:11.690> my<00:04:12.080> mind<00:04:12.410> for

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
but but I also it opens up my mind for

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.750 
but but I also it opens up my mind for
the<00:04:13.490> spontaneous<00:04:15.160> possibilities<00:04:16.160> that

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
the spontaneous possibilities that

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.539 
the spontaneous possibilities that
reality<00:04:17.200> can<00:04:18.200> give<00:04:18.530> me<00:04:18.799> and<00:04:19.010> I'm<00:04:19.280> listening

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
reality can give me and I'm listening

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.420 
reality can give me and I'm listening
for<00:04:19.910> that<00:04:20.330> my<00:04:20.989> thought<00:04:21.320> process<00:04:21.859> has<00:04:22.040> to<00:04:22.280> do

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
for that my thought process has to do

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.960 
for that my thought process has to do
with<00:04:22.730> a<00:04:22.880> kind<00:04:23.150> of<00:04:23.330> what<00:04:23.930> if<00:04:24.170> I<00:04:24.530> did<00:04:25.100> this

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
with a kind of what if I did this

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.780 
with a kind of what if I did this
and<00:04:26.530> sometimes<00:04:27.530> the<00:04:27.710> what<00:04:27.890> if<00:04:28.040> I<00:04:28.190> did<00:04:28.520> this

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
and sometimes the what if I did this

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.320 
and sometimes the what if I did this
means<00:04:29.290> leaning<00:04:30.290> off<00:04:30.470> a<00:04:30.500> canyon<00:04:31.210> knowing<00:04:32.210> that

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
means leaning off a canyon knowing that

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.820 
means leaning off a canyon knowing that
there's<00:04:32.540> a<00:04:32.600> way<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:32.810> do<00:04:33.230> it<00:04:33.260> so<00:04:33.590> that<00:04:33.740> I<00:04:33.770> don't

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
there's a way to do it so that I don't

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.990 
there's a way to do it so that I don't
kill<00:04:34.250> myself

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
kill myself

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.820 
kill myself
so<00:04:35.630> that<00:04:36.080> thought<00:04:36.440> process<00:04:37.070> of<00:04:37.480> what<00:04:38.480> if

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
so that thought process of what if

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.380 
so that thought process of what if
there's<00:04:39.830> a<00:04:39.950> great<00:04:41.650> desire<00:04:42.650> and<00:04:43.210> that's<00:04:44.210> it

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
there's a great desire and that's it

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.810 
there's a great desire and that's it
when<00:04:44.510> the<00:04:44.630> desire<00:04:44.990> gets<00:04:45.350> really<00:04:45.800> great<00:04:46.100> I'll

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
when the desire gets really great I'll

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.149 
when the desire gets really great I'll
do<00:04:47.000> anything<00:04:47.420> to<00:04:47.900> match

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:52.159 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:58.809 

I<00:04:55.360> once<00:04:56.360> took<00:04:56.599> a<00:04:56.749> picture<00:04:57.279> where<00:04:58.279> I<00:04:58.339> went<00:04:58.580> under

00:04:58.809 --> 00:04:58.819 
I once took a picture where I went under

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:02.609 
I once took a picture where I went under
the<00:04:58.969> snow<00:04:59.469> and<00:05:00.469> my<00:05:01.219> face<00:05:01.519> comes<00:05:01.909> up<00:05:02.149> where<00:05:02.389> I

00:05:02.609 --> 00:05:02.619 
the snow and my face comes up where I

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:06.189 
the snow and my face comes up where I
imagine<00:05:03.619> the<00:05:03.769> camera<00:05:04.159> would<00:05:04.339> see<00:05:04.610> it<00:05:04.789> and<00:05:05.199> and

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
imagine the camera would see it and and

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.769 
imagine the camera would see it and and
I<00:05:06.259> have<00:05:06.439> the<00:05:06.759> cable<00:05:07.759> release<00:05:07.999> in<00:05:08.179> my<00:05:08.300> hand<00:05:08.569> and

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:08.779 
I have the cable release in my hand and

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:12.969 
I have the cable release in my hand and
I'm<00:05:08.839> able<00:05:08.989> to<00:05:09.309> take<00:05:10.309> the<00:05:10.489> picture<00:05:10.909> and<00:05:11.679> I<00:05:12.679> look

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
I'm able to take the picture and I look

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.299 
I'm able to take the picture and I look
it<00:05:13.159> you<00:05:13.399> know<00:05:13.550> look<00:05:13.779> astonished<00:05:14.779> and<00:05:15.189> and<00:05:16.189> it's
