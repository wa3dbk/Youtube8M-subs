00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
some basic plyometric movements and what

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.459 
some basic plyometric movements and what
plyometrics<00:00:08.040> are<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.820> pretty<00:00:09.120> much<00:00:09.469> the

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
plyometrics are is pretty much the

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.580 
plyometrics are is pretty much the
body's<00:00:10.800> way<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.450> developing<00:00:12.450> core<00:00:13.110> strength

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590

and<00:00:13.860> agility<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.880> movements<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.630> are<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
and agility and movements that are the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.210 
and agility and movements that are the
foundations<00:00:16.650> for<00:00:17.330> events<00:00:18.330> such<00:00:18.539> as<00:00:18.570> hurdling

lift and movement as well as a
horizontal<00:00:35.040> motion<00:00:35.489> for<00:00:36.059> events<00:00:36.480> like<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
horizontal motion for events like the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.720 
horizontal motion for events like the
100-meter<00:00:37.170> hurdles<00:00:37.620> long<00:00:37.920> jump<00:00:38.280> triple<00:00:38.520> jump

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.030 
100-meter hurdles long jump triple jump
okay<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:40.140> first<00:00:40.320> one<00:00:40.559> we're<00:00:40.649> going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> do

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
okay so the first one we're going to do

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.639 
okay so the first one we're going to do
is<00:00:41.219> called<00:00:41.489> bounding<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.329> what<00:00:42.809> bounding<00:00:43.290> is

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
is called bounding and what bounding is

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.400 
is called bounding and what bounding is
is<00:00:43.920> you're<00:00:44.340> pretty<00:00:44.579> much<00:00:44.820> doing<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:45.930> that

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
is you're pretty much doing just that

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.340 
is you're pretty much doing just that
opposite<00:00:47.129> arm<00:00:47.309> opposite<00:00:47.940> leg<00:00:48.000> action<00:00:48.570> where

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
opposite arm opposite leg action where

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.720 
opposite arm opposite leg action where
you're<00:00:49.440> going<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.620> need<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.800> be<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.460> almost

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
you're going to need to be it's almost

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.580 
you're going to need to be it's almost
like<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.940> leap<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:51.899> you're<00:00:52.020> also<00:00:52.170> trying<00:00:52.500> to

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
like a leap but you're also trying to

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.860 
like a leap but you're also trying to
get<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.800> vertical<00:00:53.309> motion<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.820> well<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.390> then

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
get a vertical motion as well and then

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.560 
get a vertical motion as well and then
we're<00:00:55.379> also<00:00:55.530> going<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.949> do<00:00:56.250> ups<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.149> downs<00:00:57.329> and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
we're also going to do ups and downs and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.720 
we're also going to do ups and downs and
ups<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.870> downs<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.320> simply<00:00:58.680> like<00:00:59.399> if<00:00:59.579> you

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
ups and downs is simply like if you

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.970 
ups and downs is simply like if you
recall<00:01:00.059> there<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.449> skip<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.109> simply<00:01:01.680> like<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.949> a

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
recall there a skip is simply like the a

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.670 
recall there a skip is simply like the a
skip<00:01:02.399> except<00:01:03.120> you're<00:01:03.210> going<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.510> be<00:01:03.719> going<00:01:04.500> up

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
skip except you're going to be going up

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.649 
skip except you're going to be going up
into<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.159> air<00:01:05.339> you're<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.330> have<00:01:06.479> that

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
into the air you're going to have that

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.590 
into the air you're going to have that
arm<00:01:06.900> action<00:01:07.560> bringing<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.280> up<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.330> lift

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
arm action bringing you up in a lift

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.960 
arm action bringing you up in a lift
okay<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.530> when<00:01:10.799> you're<00:01:10.920> doing<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.460> bounding

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
okay so when you're doing the bounding

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.000 
okay so when you're doing the bounding
the<00:01:12.299> first<00:01:12.630> one<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.020> showed<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.290> you're

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
the first one that I showed you you're

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.789 
the first one that I showed you you're
going<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.540> that<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.810> itself<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
going to do that in itself can be a

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.100 
going to do that in itself can be a
workout<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.610> itself<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.540> let's<00:01:18.780> say<00:01:18.900> for

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
workout in itself so let's say for

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.410 
workout in itself so let's say for
example<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.650> have<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> workout<00:01:20.939> regiment

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
example you have a workout regiment

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.480 
example you have a workout regiment
where<00:01:22.049> you're<00:01:22.619> training<00:01:22.890> your<00:01:23.070> athlete

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.609 
can do and then with the ups and downs
you<00:01:50.369> really<00:01:50.909> want<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.180> do<00:01:51.329> about<00:01:51.600> 40<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.439> 50

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
you really want to do about 40 to 50

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.580 
you really want to do about 40 to 50
meters<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.490> up<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.299> back<00:01:54.540> six<00:01:54.899> times<00:01:55.290> and

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
meters of that up and back six times and

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.459 
meters of that up and back six times and
then<00:01:56.340> there's<00:01:56.759> also<00:01:57.000> another<00:01:57.899> set<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.320> PI

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
then there's also another set of PI

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.719 
then there's also another set of PI
metrics<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.130> will<00:01:59.280> show<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
metrics that I will show you on the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.159 
metrics that I will show you on the
stairs<00:02:00.119> after<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.810> exercise<00:02:01.530> here
