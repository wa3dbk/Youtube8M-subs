basically<00:00:13.440> it's<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.789> was<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.299> combination<00:00:15.719> of

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
basically it's it was the combination of

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.700 
basically it's it was the combination of
Patagonia<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.039> time<00:00:17.880> all<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.390> mills<00:00:18.710> working

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
Patagonia and time all the mills working

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.910 
Patagonia and time all the mills working
together<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.670> really<00:00:20.880> create<00:00:21.230> the<00:00:22.230> industry

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
together to really create the industry

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.849 
together to really create the industry
so<00:00:23.509> through<00:00:24.509> all<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.900> developments<00:00:25.740> that

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
so through all the developments that

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.489 
so through all the developments that
took<00:00:25.919> place<00:00:26.310> early<00:00:27.179> early<00:00:27.539> on<00:00:27.570> with<00:00:28.019> Sevilla

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:28.499 
took place early early on with Sevilla

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.279 
took place early early on with Sevilla
and<00:00:29.310> really<00:00:29.999> when<00:00:30.150> we<00:00:30.269> developed<00:00:30.659> polar<00:00:30.989> tech

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
and really when we developed polar tech

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.030 
and really when we developed polar tech
from<00:00:31.529> polar<00:00:31.800> fleece<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.720> looked<00:00:33.720> at

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
from polar fleece and looked at

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.300 
from polar fleece and looked at
technical<00:00:35.040> performance<00:00:35.370> textiles<00:00:36.530> he<00:00:37.530> his

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
technical performance textiles he his

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.250 
technical performance textiles he his
take<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.149> which<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.360> think<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:39.720> true

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
take on it which I think it's true

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.870 
take on it which I think it's true
it's<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.010> two<00:00:41.190> companies<00:00:41.460> together

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880 
it's that the two companies together

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.760 
it's that the two companies together
really<00:00:42.510> created<00:00:43.380> an<00:00:43.500> industry<00:00:43.910> so<00:00:45.620> we<00:00:46.620> were

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
really created an industry so we were

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.650 
really created an industry so we were
out<00:00:46.950> there<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:47.400> the<00:00:47.490> first<00:00:47.790> in<00:00:48.000> Patagonia

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
out there it's the first in Patagonia

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.140 
out there it's the first in Patagonia
you<00:00:48.930> know<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.410> led<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.620> way<00:00:49.740> on<00:00:50.190> creating

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
you know really led the way on creating

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.570 
you know really led the way on creating
a<00:00:51.300> market<00:00:51.840> for<00:00:52.140> performance<00:00:52.830> textile<00:00:53.310> and

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
a market for performance textile and

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.430 
a market for performance textile and
we've<00:00:54.510> provided<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.350> technical<00:00:55.830> solutions<00:00:56.400> I

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
we've provided the technical solutions I

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.650 
we've provided the technical solutions I
like<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.560> talk<00:00:58.710> about<00:00:58.770> when<00:00:59.220> we<00:00:59.400> were<00:00:59.580> a<00:00:59.910> corner

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
like to talk about when we were a corner

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.240 
like to talk about when we were a corner
at<00:01:00.900> that<00:01:01.110> point<00:01:01.380> I<00:01:01.620> think<00:01:02.100> was<00:01:02.600> 1984-85<00:01:04.250> we

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
at that point I think was 1984-85 we

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.440 
at that point I think was 1984-85 we
were<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> little<00:01:05.729> corner<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:07.430> ski<00:01:08.430> show<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
were a little corner of the ski show the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.140 
were a little corner of the ski show the
outdoor<00:01:09.869> group<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:11.040> crunchies<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.880> granola

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
outdoor group with crunchies the granola

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.050 
outdoor group with crunchies the granola
bunch<00:01:12.510> we're<00:01:13.230> in<00:01:13.350> one<00:01:13.560> little<00:01:13.860> corner<00:01:14.190> of<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
bunch we're in one little corner of the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.710 
bunch we're in one little corner of the
ski<00:01:15.390> show<00:01:15.750> we're<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.440> the<00:01:16.530> big

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
ski show we're in the big

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.120 
ski show we're in the big
all<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:18.800> become<00:01:19.220> solomon<00:01:19.910> and<00:01:20.150> k2<00:01:20.930> they<00:01:21.890> had

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
all the become solomon and k2 they had

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.180 
all the become solomon and k2 they had
they<00:01:22.580> dominated<00:01:23.150> the<00:01:23.270> show<00:01:23.710> and<00:01:24.710> I<00:01:24.800> look<00:01:24.980> back

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
they dominated the show and I look back

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.970 
they dominated the show and I look back
20<00:01:25.460> years<00:01:25.640> ago<00:01:26.000> and<00:01:26.960> I<00:01:27.080> realized<00:01:27.560> it<00:01:27.740> in<00:01:27.830> that

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
20 years ago and I realized it in that

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.120 
20 years ago and I realized it in that
20<00:01:28.400> years<00:01:28.900> we<00:01:29.900> have<00:01:29.930> gone<00:01:30.230> from<00:01:30.530> being<00:01:30.740> a

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
20 years we have gone from being a

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.940 
20 years we have gone from being a
little<00:01:31.430> corner<00:01:31.850> of<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.120> ski<00:01:32.480> show<00:01:32.750> to<00:01:33.470> a<00:01:33.500> major

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
little corner of the ski show to a major

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.540 
little corner of the ski show to a major
industry<00:01:34.700> was<00:01:35.450> it<00:01:35.570> just<00:01:35.780> us<00:01:35.960> no<00:01:36.290> but<00:01:36.740> I<00:01:36.920> I<00:01:37.370> would

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
industry was it just us no but I I would

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.000 
industry was it just us no but I I would
say<00:01:37.580> that<00:01:38.000> there<00:01:38.300> are<00:01:38.390> no<00:01:38.510> more<00:01:38.990> prime<00:01:39.320> movers

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
say that there are no more prime movers

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.370 
say that there are no more prime movers
then<00:01:40.520> Polartec<00:01:41.270> that<00:01:41.510> used<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:41.870> be<00:01:41.990> called<00:01:42.200> all

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
then Polartec that used to be called all

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.160 
then Polartec that used to be called all
the<00:01:42.500> mills<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.270> had<00:01:44.270> a<00:01:44.300> go<00:01:44.510> on<00:01:44.540> you<00:01:44.750> putting

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
the mills and had a go on you putting

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.810 
the mills and had a go on you putting
together<00:01:45.320> fabrics<00:01:46.190> that<00:01:46.250> have<00:01:46.370> never<00:01:46.610> been

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
together fabrics that have never been

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.250 
together fabrics that have never been
made<00:01:47.000> to<00:01:47.960> function<00:01:48.460> ways<00:01:49.460> that<00:01:49.880> police<00:01:50.720> never

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
made to function ways that police never

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.670 
made to function ways that police never
did<00:01:54.040> our<00:01:55.390> vision<00:01:56.390> was<00:01:56.600> to<00:01:56.900> create<00:01:56.930> technical

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
did our vision was to create technical

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.570 
did our vision was to create technical
performance<00:01:58.460> fabrics<00:01:59.060> that<00:01:59.330> would<00:02:00.340> enable<00:02:01.340> us

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
performance fabrics that would enable us

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.930 
performance fabrics that would enable us
to<00:02:01.640> offer<00:02:01.970> an<00:02:02.240> alternative<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.990> wool<00:02:03.940> that

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
to offer an alternative to wool that

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.440 
to offer an alternative to wool that
offered<00:02:05.360> similar<00:02:05.890> warmth<00:02:06.890> with<00:02:07.700> less<00:02:08.060> weight

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
offered similar warmth with less weight

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.160 
offered similar warmth with less weight
that<00:02:08.990> was<00:02:09.200> more<00:02:09.500> compatible<00:02:10.780> and<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:11.990> was

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
that was more compatible and that was

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.699 
that was more compatible and that was
basically<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.860> foundation<00:02:13.730> of<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.840> launch

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
basically the foundation of the launch

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.610 
basically the foundation of the launch
point<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.490> Polartec<00:02:17.290> technical<00:02:18.290> performance

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
point of Polartec technical performance

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.670 
point of Polartec technical performance
non<00:02:19.010> pill<00:02:19.280> fleece<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:20.150> that<00:02:20.660> was<00:02:20.840> done<00:02:21.110> with

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
non pill fleece and that was done with

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.130 
non pill fleece and that was done with
Patagonia<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:23.800> since<00:02:24.800> that<00:02:24.980> time<00:02:25.040> our

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
Patagonia and since that time our

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.410 
Patagonia and since that time our
technologies<00:02:27.140> have<00:02:27.880> enabled<00:02:28.880> that<00:02:29.239> our

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
technologies have enabled that our

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.300 
technologies have enabled that our
relationship<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.470> collaboration<00:02:30.620> has

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
relationship and collaboration has

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.500 
relationship and collaboration has
enabled<00:02:31.580> us<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:31.940> manufacture<00:02:33.940> fabrics<00:02:34.940> with

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
enabled us to manufacture fabrics with

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.400 
enabled us to manufacture fabrics with
less<00:02:36.230> weight<00:02:36.530> more<00:02:37.400> compactable<00:02:38.300> equal<00:02:39.140> dry

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
less weight more compactable equal dry

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.759 
less weight more compactable equal dry
times<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:41.360> have<00:02:41.540> superior<00:02:41.959> performance<00:02:42.620> in

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
times that have superior performance in

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.660 
times that have superior performance in
the<00:02:42.890> outdoor

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
the outdoor

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.070 
the outdoor
