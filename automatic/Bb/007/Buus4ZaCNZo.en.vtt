00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.639 

and<00:00:41.760> then<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> next<00:00:42.629> card<00:00:42.929> you<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.170> rotate

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
and then the next card you just rotate

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.979 
and then the next card you just rotate
up<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.010> little<00:00:44.160> bit<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.910> put<00:00:45.179> your<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.750> me

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
up a little bit so you put your for me

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:53.910 
up a little bit so you put your for me
gonna<00:00:46.289> see<00:00:46.559> Minnie<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.170> goes

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.720 

Wow

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.700 

so<00:01:01.300> you<00:01:01.360> can<00:01:01.480> see<00:01:01.660> that<00:01:01.750> rotation<00:01:02.380> there<00:01:02.560> it's

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
so you can see that rotation there it's

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.140 
so you can see that rotation there it's
just<00:01:02.920> kind<00:01:03.130> of<00:01:03.160> a<00:01:03.250> little<00:01:03.490> switch

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.090 

and<00:01:06.300> then<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> next<00:01:07.320> court<00:01:07.620> is<00:01:07.680> gonna<00:01:07.860> be<00:01:07.980> down

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and then the next court is gonna be down

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.510 
and then the next court is gonna be down
here<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.970> you're<00:01:09.120> gonna<00:01:09.240> have<00:01:10.250> any

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:22.780 

d<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:14.570> an<00:01:14.930> f-sharp<00:01:15.229> up<00:01:15.890> here<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:16.790> it's<00:01:21.790> the

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
d and an f-sharp up here so it's the

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.280 
d and an f-sharp up here so it's the
next<00:01:23.030> chord<00:01:23.299> is<00:01:23.390> right<00:01:23.600> here<00:01:23.840> it's<00:01:23.960> like<00:01:24.049> the

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
next chord is right here it's like the

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.050 
next chord is right here it's like the
same<00:01:24.560> as<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:24.920> first<00:01:25.130> one<00:01:25.310> I<00:01:25.430> guess<00:01:26.470> but<00:01:27.759> it's<00:01:28.759> a

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
same as the first one I guess but it's a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.499 
same as the first one I guess but it's a
D<00:01:29.780> instead<00:01:30.110> of<00:01:30.289> an<00:01:30.350> e<00:01:30.500> but<00:01:30.740> soon<00:01:31.039> be<00:01:31.520> Andrea<00:01:32.210> so

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
D instead of an e but soon be Andrea so

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:47.289 
D instead of an e but soon be Andrea so
it<00:01:33.190> many<00:01:34.190> of<00:01:34.340> us<00:01:34.430> do<00:01:34.549> the<00:01:34.640> same<00:01:34.700> thing<00:01:35.060> so

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.359 

and<00:01:47.899> so<00:01:48.079> those<00:01:48.259> are<00:01:48.409> basically<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:48.920> chords

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
and so those are basically the chords

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:50.440 
and so those are basically the chords
and<00:01:49.520> you<00:01:49.609> just<00:01:49.759> play<00:01:49.969> them<00:01:50.179> throughout

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
and you just play them throughout

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.249 
and you just play them throughout
switching<00:01:51.140> on<00:01:52.600> like<00:01:53.600> and<00:01:53.810> you<00:01:53.869> can<00:01:53.990> put<00:01:54.109> like<00:01:54.229> a

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
switching on like and you can put like a

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.039 
switching on like and you can put like a
rhythm<00:01:54.590> with<00:01:54.710> them<00:01:54.890> like<00:01:55.539> so<00:01:56.539> it<00:01:56.869> could<00:01:57.020> be

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
rhythm with them like so it could be

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:05.440 
rhythm with them like so it could be
like

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.109 

somebody<00:02:06.020> I<00:02:06.049> don't<00:02:06.140> know<00:02:06.290> anything<00:02:06.710> and<00:02:07.520> then

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
somebody I don't know anything and then

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:22.780 
somebody I don't know anything and then
the<00:02:08.690> right<00:02:08.869> hand<00:02:09.050> is<00:02:09.200> just<00:02:11.890> so<00:02:12.890> that's<00:02:13.069> a<00:02:13.280> G<00:02:21.790> and

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
the right hand is just so that's a G and

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.320 
the right hand is just so that's a G and
then<00:02:22.940> it's

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.000 

so<00:02:28.330> it's<00:02:28.450> just<00:02:28.600> switching<00:02:29.380> back<00:02:29.530> off<00:02:29.740> between

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
so it's just switching back off between

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.290 
so it's just switching back off between
these<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.430> then<00:02:30.550> you<00:02:30.580> have<00:02:30.730> your<00:02:30.880> little<00:02:31.030> row

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
these and then you have your little row

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.970 
these and then you have your little row
listing<00:02:31.720> at<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.840> end<00:02:32.050> like<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:38.440> same<00:02:38.770> thing

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
listing at the end like the same thing

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.350 
listing at the end like the same thing
again

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.789 

it's<00:02:46.360> basically<00:02:46.780> just<00:02:46.900> alternating<00:02:47.500> between

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
it's basically just alternating between

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.960 
it's basically just alternating between
these<00:02:48.189> on<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:48.549> part<00:02:48.760> except<00:02:49.120> for<00:02:49.150> when<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.480> go

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
these on the part except for when you go

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.539 
these on the part except for when you go
that's<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.120> G<00:02:52.540> B<00:02:53.049> D<00:02:53.349> F<00:02:53.939> G<00:02:55.680> so<00:02:56.680> not<00:02:56.860> very<00:02:56.890> hard<00:02:57.310> and

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
that's a G B D F G so not very hard and

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:05.460 
that's a G B D F G so not very hard and
then<00:02:58.379> for<00:02:59.379> the<00:02:59.530> part<00:02:59.829> that's<00:03:00.340> like<00:03:00.579> this<00:03:04.470> you

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
then for the part that's like this you

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.380 
then for the part that's like this you
keep<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.099> same<00:03:06.340> chords<00:03:06.819> in<00:03:07.000> your<00:03:07.030> left<00:03:07.150> hand

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
keep the same chords in your left hand

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.339 
keep the same chords in your left hand
just<00:03:09.359> playing<00:03:10.359> them<00:03:10.450> at<00:03:10.599> basically<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.170> same

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
just playing them at basically the same

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.839 
just playing them at basically the same
speeds<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:11.890> if<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.129> need<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.370> start<00:03:12.640> off<00:03:12.819> just

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
speeds and if you need to start off just

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.479 
speeds and if you need to start off just
playing<00:03:13.420> like<00:03:13.599> this<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:14.170> guess<00:03:14.349> weightless

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:26.849 

just<00:03:18.489> going<00:03:18.730> like<00:03:25.139> that's<00:03:26.139> fine<00:03:26.379> it<00:03:26.620> still

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
just going like that's fine it still

same<00:04:45.780> chords<00:04:47.840> but<00:04:48.840> um<00:04:49.160> after<00:04:50.160> you<00:04:50.460> go<00:04:50.550> through

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
same chords but um after you go through

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:58.760 
same chords but um after you go through
this<00:04:50.910> two<00:04:51.240> times<00:04:57.139> the<00:04:58.139> next<00:04:58.349> part<00:04:58.530> is<00:04:58.590> like

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
this two times the next part is like

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:16.249 
this two times the next part is like
this<00:05:07.340> so<00:05:08.340> it's<00:05:11.960> d<00:05:12.960> sharp<00:05:13.320> d<00:05:14.130> sharp<00:05:14.330> d<00:05:15.330> sharp<00:05:15.360> C

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
this so it's d sharp d sharp d sharp C

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:18.140 
this so it's d sharp d sharp d sharp C
sharp<00:05:16.289> d<00:05:16.979> sharp<00:05:17.009> and<00:05:17.490> then<00:05:17.639> the<00:05:17.699> next<00:05:17.910> part<00:05:18.000> is

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
sharp d sharp and then the next part is

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:24.680 
sharp d sharp and then the next part is
just<00:05:22.280> then<00:05:23.280> it's<00:05:23.400> just<00:05:23.520> an<00:05:23.699> even<00:05:24.120> half<00:05:24.300> instead

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
just then it's just an even half instead

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.170 
just then it's just an even half instead
of<00:05:24.810> this<00:05:24.990> even<00:05:25.380> back<00:05:25.530> to<00:05:25.560> the<00:05:25.740> D<00:05:25.889> um<00:05:26.250> so<00:05:27.000> that's

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
of this even back to the D um so that's

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.640 
of this even back to the D um so that's
basically<00:05:27.630> it<00:05:27.780> and<00:05:27.990> then<00:05:28.080> you<00:05:28.169> just<00:05:28.320> go<00:05:28.440> back

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650
