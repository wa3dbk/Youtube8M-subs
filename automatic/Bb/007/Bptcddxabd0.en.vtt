00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.259
 just before the start of the new dtm season 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.849
 the reigning champion Bruno had to 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.889
 Spengler an unfamiliar 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.099
 challenge a race against 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.949
 the master of the year 1989 roberto 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.420
 ravaglia both states each in the 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.730
 racing car the other 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.519
 So the 53-year-old ravaglia im 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.490
 current nearly 500 ps strong m3 and 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.699
 spengler in the 23 years old clearly 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.199
 weaker m3 of the old dtm the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.450
 Mechanics must have thought 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.219
 so that every driver in the strange car 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.680
 At least they should feel at ease 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.600
 paint has been so historic 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.460
 title winner for the first time in matte black 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.890
 to see that on the hockenheimring 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.289
 current racing car was made by ravaglia in 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.980
 well-known bmw design from back then 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.960
 piloted on the basis of the 23 years 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.570
 the winner between the two dtm 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.000
 Spengler 23 seconds ahead ins 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.340
 races of the generation go this time 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.440
 came robert or was certainly like one 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.930
 eternity before it finally for him 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.750
 lisa started the current dtm car 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.030
 flying in many alps shows 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.190
 compared to the new m3 is the old one 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.260
 masters daringly petite that 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.479
 light car reacts much more directly than 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.140
 the significantly heavier current dtm 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.510
 bolide 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.910
 and although several ps much had him 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.979
 robert or was fighting for order 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.979
 to get at his actual car 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.790
 But at the beginning of the Hockenheim motodrom 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.130
 then stars in the legendary Sachskurve 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.670
 but as far as Spengler had in the m3 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.790
 1989 and defeated the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.260
 Italians let this defeat 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.180
 But Bruno Spengler gets loose 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.010
 After all, he can sit in pain 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.580
 again in matte black this season 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.820
 dtm bmw m3 and tried his title 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.820
 To defend
