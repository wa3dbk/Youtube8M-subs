00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.990
 Hello first to all marica 18 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.240
 This we have found we need 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.200
 I tell you how you all characters 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.719
 and every few pages marica 82 switches 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.510
 we begin with the characters the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.570
 you can easily emblem primus 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.500
 unlock it and it does not matter if he 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.939
 the 50 displacement and 150 or mirrored 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.340
 drives as really does not matter but is 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.590
 maybe some cats drive several times 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.010
 if you do it for example 50 all cups once 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.160
 You have eight characters 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.800
 unlocked 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.760
 century would have to be just then again 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.730
 we say it times four races here cups 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.010
 drive them then the remaining four 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.539
 unlock characters 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.850
 actually relatively simple and yourself 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.750
 good on that is not too difficult now 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.390
 is like mario kart wii link to all 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.799
 character and so on you see too 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:14.400
 in the infobox again now come to 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:15.810
 the cards and there we once in 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.890
 squad 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.180
 So map as quad wheels and skid it 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.369
 like in the magazine 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.990
 now there is also quartz me 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.740
 relatively cool 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.649
 and turn every 50 coins a new one 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.220
 kathrin frey if you get here wheels 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:38.520
 A bike card is getting ladder 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.159
 mature in each run differently and 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.890
 that goes to 1000 coins so always 50 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.830
 rhythm to get each one cartel 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.810
 From 1000 coins you have to pay 100 coins 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:54.299
 collect to get a catalog 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.590
 then everything goes up to 2700 mÃ¼nstermann 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.330
 In 2007 , Munich was a total collected 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.490
 you have unlocked all cards 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.700
 is back in the infobox 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.560
 and then if will divide gold card 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.690
 and there are also here again like 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:15.510
 already in the years category and mario kart 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:18.480
 7 and that preventative so that is the 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.450
 that you just probably 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.690
 I think the best cards and the 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:29.130
 turned free the country from moody 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:33.980
 Gold has spoken in the cup in 50s each 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:37.109
 day 350 he and every cup in game mode 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.230
 if I understood that to me 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:43.170
 source is giga link to one more time 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.560
 really in the description video 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.450
 I have an amazing job 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.400
 I would be sitting for some hours 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.620
 I'm all the more happy about the thumb 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.060
 high and I hope you are 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.680
 I could not help further 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.930
 guarantee that everything is correct now 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.480
 I think that in most cases be correct and 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.760
 if a two things are not right 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.370
 have improved in the comments 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.900
 please do not give this here 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.090
 unfortunately something like that because I find it easy 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.830
 unnecessary 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.050
 i say something with this again i 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.019
 Thanks to all who looked at that 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:19.150
 I hope I could help you 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.150
 first again for gaming
