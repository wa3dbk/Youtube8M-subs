00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
animatedanatomy.com so in this lesson I

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.839 
animatedanatomy.com so in this lesson I
will<00:00:06.330> talk<00:00:06.600> about<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:07.140> deep<00:00:07.440> muscles<00:00:08.010> in<00:00:08.309> the

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
will talk about the deep muscles in the

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.910 
will talk about the deep muscles in the
anterior<00:00:09.540> compartment<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.469> forearm

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
anterior compartment of the forearm

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.299 
anterior compartment of the forearm
that's<00:00:11.670> right<00:00:11.969> here<00:00:12.740> previous<00:00:13.740> lesson<00:00:14.130> I

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
that's right here previous lesson I

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.820 
that's right here previous lesson I
talked<00:00:14.670> about<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.420> superficial<00:00:16.109> muscles<00:00:16.529> in

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
talked about the superficial muscles in

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.609 
talked about the superficial muscles in
this<00:00:17.070> anterior<00:00:17.640> compartment<00:00:17.970> here<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:19.320> the

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
this anterior compartment here so the

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.500 
this anterior compartment here so the
first<00:00:19.859> muscle<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.430> will<00:00:20.580> talk<00:00:20.789> about<00:00:20.970> this

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
first muscle that I will talk about this

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.620 
first muscle that I will talk about this
group<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.140> pronator<00:00:22.590> quadratus<00:00:23.630> pronator

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
group is the pronator quadratus pronator

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.259 
group is the pronator quadratus pronator
quadratus<00:00:25.199> has<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.920> origin<00:00:26.400> here<00:00:26.699> on<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
quadratus has the origin here on the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.189 
quadratus has the origin here on the
olan<00:00:27.630> now<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.439> muscle<00:00:28.859> then<00:00:29.670> be<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
olan now this is the muscle then be the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.860 
olan now this is the muscle then be the
insertion<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:31.949> muscle<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.210> radius

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
insertion of this muscle is on a radius

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.770 
insertion of this muscle is on a radius
the<00:00:34.800> function<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.550> muscle<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the function of this muscle is the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.530 
the function of this muscle is the
pronate<00:00:37.260> forearm<00:00:37.980> when<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> contract<00:00:39.300> it's

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
pronate forearm when a contract it's

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.410 
pronate forearm when a contract it's
going<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.870> make<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.530> rotate<00:00:41.250> inwards

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
going to make and rotate inwards

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.770 
going to make and rotate inwards
that's<00:00:43.170> called<00:00:43.500> pronation<00:00:44.360> it<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.510> innervated

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
that's called pronation it is innervated

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.610 
that's called pronation it is innervated
by<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.530> median<00:00:46.860> nerve<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.260> more<00:00:49.260> precisely

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
by the median nerve and more precisely

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.700 
by the median nerve and more precisely
by<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:49.950> anterior<00:00:50.670> interosseous<00:00:51.090> nerve<00:00:51.710> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
by the anterior interosseous nerve the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.680 
by the anterior interosseous nerve the
muscle<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.100> antagonizes<00:00:54.059> our<00:00:54.270> little

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
muscle that antagonizes our little

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.410 
muscle that antagonizes our little
pronator<00:00:55.230> quadratus<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.000> supinator

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
pronator quadratus is the supinator

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.880 
pronator quadratus is the supinator
muscle<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.129> muscle<00:00:59.609> here<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.800> I

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
muscle it is this muscle here and I

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.549 
muscle it is this muscle here and I
think<00:01:02.059> these<00:01:03.059> names<00:01:03.390> tell<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.870> everything

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
think these names tell you everything

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.969 
think these names tell you everything
this<00:01:05.309> muscle<00:01:05.760> man<00:01:06.060> makes<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> supination<00:01:07.560> and

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
this muscle man makes the supination and

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.850 
this muscle man makes the supination and
this<00:01:08.250> muscle<00:01:08.820> makes<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.299> pronation<00:01:09.860> another

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
this muscle makes the pronation another

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.039 
this muscle makes the pronation another
muscle<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.790> will<00:01:11.970> talk<00:01:12.180> about<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
muscle that I will talk about is the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.190 
muscle that I will talk about is the
flexor<00:01:13.619> digitorum<00:01:13.650> profundus

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
flexor digitorum profundus

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.480 
flexor digitorum profundus
remember<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.530> last<00:01:16.680> video<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.130> talked

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
remember in the last video I talked

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.740 
remember in the last video I talked
about<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.619> flexor<00:01:19.619> digitorum<00:01:19.650> superficialis

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
about the flexor digitorum superficialis

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.359 
about the flexor digitorum superficialis
while<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.990> one<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.229> profundus<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:25.369> flexor

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
while this one is profundus the flexor

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.740 
while this one is profundus the flexor
digitorum<00:01:26.400> profundus

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
digitorum profundus

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.330 
digitorum profundus
has<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.259> origin<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.890> ulna<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:31.340> insertion

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
has the origin on the ulna the insertion

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.050 
has the origin on the ulna the insertion
is<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.119> distal<00:01:33.500> boundaries<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.670> these

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
is the distal boundaries so these

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.080 
is the distal boundaries so these
boundaries<00:01:36.570> here<00:01:39.170> this<00:01:40.170> muscle<00:01:40.530> is

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
boundaries here this muscle is

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
boundaries here this muscle is
innervated<00:01:42.090> by<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.840> median<00:01:44.360> nerve<00:01:45.360> more

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
innervated by the median nerve more

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.020 
innervated by the median nerve more
precisely<00:01:46.470> actually<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.460> anterior

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
precisely actually the anterior

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.200 
precisely actually the anterior
interosseous<00:01:48.829> is<00:01:49.829> also<00:01:50.310> innovated<00:01:50.790> by<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
interosseous is also innovated by the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.670 
interosseous is also innovated by the
muscular<00:01:51.540> branches<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.369> ulnar<00:01:53.790> nerve<00:01:54.680> it

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
muscular branches of the ulnar nerve it

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.590 
muscular branches of the ulnar nerve it
serves<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.189> flax<00:01:56.460> began<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
serves the flax began and the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.929 
serves the flax began and the
interphalangeal<00:01:57.990> joints<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.430> flexes<00:01:59.909> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
interphalangeal joints so it flexes the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.450 
interphalangeal joints so it flexes the
hand<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.899> also<00:02:01.079> flexes<00:02:01.710> these<00:02:01.920> joints

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
hand and it also flexes these joints

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.899 
hand and it also flexes these joints
here<00:02:02.719> the<00:02:03.719> muscle<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.399> antagonizes<00:02:05.399> this

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
here the muscle that antagonizes this

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.710 
here the muscle that antagonizes this
muscle<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:07.350> expand<00:02:07.799> sir<00:02:08.039> digitorum<00:02:08.910> right

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
muscle is the expand sir digitorum right

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.220 
muscle is the expand sir digitorum right
here<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.730> think<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:12.209> just<00:02:12.239> think<00:02:12.750> about<00:02:12.870> the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
here I think you just think about the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.850 
here I think you just think about the
names<00:02:13.470> of

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
names of

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.010 
names of
muscles<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.790> tells<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.180> almost<00:02:15.540> everything

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
muscles it tells you almost everything

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.310 
muscles it tells you almost everything
first<00:02:16.950> we<00:02:17.130> had<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.280> pronator<00:02:17.820> quadratus<00:02:18.360> now

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
first we had to pronator quadratus now

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.640 
first we had to pronator quadratus now
you<00:02:19.380> have<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.830> flexor<00:02:20.370> profundus<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:22.470> now

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
you have the flexor profundus and now

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.760 
you have the flexor profundus and now
here<00:02:23.190> we<00:02:23.490> have<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:24.060> extensor<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.870> previously

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
here we have the extensor and previously

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.980 
here we have the extensor and previously
there<00:02:26.040> was<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.810> supine<00:02:27.810> major<00:02:29.210> so<00:02:30.210> as<00:02:30.660> soon<00:02:30.870> as

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
there was a supine major so as soon as

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.600 
there was a supine major so as soon as
you<00:02:31.110> know<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.290> name<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.830> know<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.040> function

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
you know the name you know the function

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.210 
you know the name you know the function
there<00:02:33.300> is<00:02:33.480> one<00:02:33.900> more<00:02:34.080> muscle<00:02:34.470> in<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:34.770> entire

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
there is one more muscle in this entire

actually here the flexor pollicis longus
now<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.300> name<00:02:45.540> tells<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.050> everything<00:02:46.920> it's

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
now the name tells you everything it's

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.760 
now the name tells you everything it's
flexing<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:49.590> thumb<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.989> it's<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.260> long<00:02:52.500> one

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
flexing the thumb and it's the long one

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.979 
flexing the thumb and it's the long one
because<00:02:53.040> we<00:02:53.310> have<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.760> small<00:02:54.239> one<00:02:54.480> here<00:02:54.750> too

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
because we have the small one here too

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.470 
because we have the small one here too
but<00:02:55.560> remember<00:02:56.280> do<00:02:56.430> not<00:02:56.580> study<00:02:56.880> about<00:02:57.239> this

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
but remember do not study about this

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.140 
but remember do not study about this
moment<00:02:57.720> right<00:02:58.020> now<00:02:58.320> right<00:02:58.860> now<00:02:58.890> in<00:02:59.610> this<00:02:59.910> group

moment right now right now in this group

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.740 
moment right now right now in this group
there<00:03:00.330> are<00:03:00.390> only<00:03:00.600> three<00:03:01.350> muscles<00:03:02.000> okay<00:03:03.030> now

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
there are only three muscles okay now

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.670 
there are only three muscles okay now
the<00:03:03.810> origin<00:03:04.230> of<00:03:04.489> our<00:03:05.870> flexor<00:03:06.870> pollicis<00:03:07.620> longus

the origin of our flexor pollicis longus

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.840 
the origin of our flexor pollicis longus
here<00:03:08.540> is<00:03:09.540> obviously<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.320> radius<00:03:10.770> then<00:03:11.610> comes

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
here is obviously the radius then comes

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.440 
here is obviously the radius then comes
interosseous<00:03:12.570> membrane<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.440> ulna<00:03:14.190> and

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
topic no it's wrong just remember it

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.590 
topic no it's wrong just remember it
goes<00:03:31.560> here<00:03:32.160> on<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.519> base<00:03:32.790> of<00:03:32.820> fists<00:03:33.390> of

now<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:36.360> function<00:03:36.840> of<00:03:36.930> this<00:03:37.080> muscle<00:03:37.320> is

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
now the function of this muscle is

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.590 
now the function of this muscle is
flexing<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.459> thumb<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.150> is<00:03:39.269> innervated

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
flexing the thumb and it is innervated

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.190 
flexing the thumb and it is innervated
by<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.049> anterior<00:03:40.580> Drossos<00:03:41.580> nerve<00:03:41.959> branch<00:03:42.959> of

by the anterior Drossos nerve branch of

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.080 
by the anterior Drossos nerve branch of
the<00:03:43.320> median<00:03:43.440> nerve<00:03:43.830> just<00:03:44.130> like<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.580> other<00:03:44.760> two

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
the median nerve just like the other two

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.330 
the median nerve just like the other two
muscles<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.260> it's<00:03:46.680> important<00:03:47.070> to<00:03:47.160> say<00:03:47.310> that

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
muscles and it's important to say that

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.130 
muscles and it's important to say that
this<00:03:47.730> arises<00:03:48.120> from<00:03:49.049> c8<00:03:49.590> t<00:03:50.519> 1<00:03:50.820> there<00:03:51.750> are<00:03:51.930> two

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
this arises from c8 t 1 there are two

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.979 
this arises from c8 t 1 there are two
muscles<00:03:52.890> that<00:03:53.070> antagonize<00:03:53.640> this<00:03:53.970> our<00:03:54.330> little

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
muscles that antagonize this our little

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.110 
muscles that antagonize this our little
here<00:03:55.760> actually<00:03:56.760> long<00:03:58.549> flexor<00:03:59.549> of<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.880> thumb

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
here actually long flexor of the thumb

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.600 
here actually long flexor of the thumb
and<00:04:00.390> that<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.989> two<00:04:01.320> extensors<00:04:02.160> two<00:04:02.400> thumb

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
and that is the two extensors two thumb

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.070 
and that is the two extensors two thumb
the<00:04:02.790> short<00:04:03.060> one<00:04:03.269> and<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:04.500> long<00:04:04.739> one<00:04:05.100> pardon<00:04:06.090> so

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
the short one and a long one pardon so

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.000 
the short one and a long one pardon so
here<00:04:07.320> we<00:04:07.440> have<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.950> short<00:04:08.720> extensors<00:04:09.720> and

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
here we have the short extensors and

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.310 
here we have the short extensors and
here<00:04:11.010> is<00:04:11.190> the<00:04:11.790> long<00:04:12.150> extensors<00:04:12.900> of<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.049> thumb

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
here is the long extensors of the thumb

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.159 
here is the long extensors of the thumb
so<00:04:13.590> they<00:04:13.769> antagonize<00:04:14.400> this<00:04:14.670> our<00:04:15.169> extensor

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
so they antagonize this our extensor

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.400 
so they antagonize this our extensor
pollicis<00:04:16.620> brevis<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.660> Spartan<00:04:18.660> our<00:04:18.870> flexor

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
pollicis brevis the Spartan our flexor

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.120 
pollicis brevis the Spartan our flexor
pollicis<00:04:19.890> longus<00:04:20.900> here<00:04:21.959> this<00:04:22.530> was<00:04:22.860> the

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
pollicis longus here this was the

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.820 
pollicis longus here this was the
extensor<00:04:24.090> pollicis<00:04:24.690> brevis<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.410> this<00:04:25.590> was

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
extensor pollicis brevis and this was

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.530 
extensor pollicis brevis and this was
the<00:04:26.010> extensor<00:04:26.520> pollicis<00:04:27.030> while

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
the extensor pollicis while

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.130 
the extensor pollicis while
this<00:04:28.610> now<00:04:29.610> I<00:04:29.640> will<00:04:29.970> talk<00:04:30.210> about<00:04:30.390> the<00:04:30.690> posterior

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
this now I will talk about the posterior

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.620 
this now I will talk about the posterior
compartment<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:32.250> that<00:04:32.310> means<00:04:32.820> these<00:04:33.150> muscles

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
compartment and that means these muscles

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.730 
compartment and that means these muscles
here<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.640> I<00:04:35.640> already<00:04:35.910> mentioned<00:04:36.710> some<00:04:37.710> of
