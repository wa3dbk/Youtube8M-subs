become part of curriculars it has to be
it<00:02:27.800> is<00:02:28.270> this<00:02:29.270> kind<00:02:29.720> of<00:02:30.550> industrial<00:02:32.260> revolution

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
it is this kind of industrial revolution

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.950 
it is this kind of industrial revolution
that<00:02:33.410> will<00:02:33.860> be<00:02:34.070> is<00:02:34.280> getting<00:02:35.240> triggered<00:02:35.570> now<00:02:35.720> by

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
that will be is getting triggered now by

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.450 
that will be is getting triggered now by
my<00:02:36.470> 3d<00:02:36.890> printing<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:37.400> very<00:02:37.900> disruptive<00:02:39.460> it

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
my 3d printing is a very disruptive it

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.380 
my 3d printing is a very disruptive it
really<00:02:40.880> will<00:02:41.710> make<00:02:42.710> a<00:02:42.770> lot<00:02:43.040> of<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.940> there<00:02:44.270> will

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
really will make a lot of it there will

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.030 
really will make a lot of it there will
be<00:02:44.420> lots<00:02:44.810> of<00:02:44.930> business<00:02:45.230> that<00:02:45.260> will<00:02:45.530> go<00:02:45.710> out<00:02:45.890> of

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
be lots of business that will go out of

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.470 
be lots of business that will go out of
business<00:02:46.220> but<00:02:46.610> new<00:02:46.760> businesses<00:02:47.270> with<00:02:47.420> a

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
business but new businesses with a

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.590 
business but new businesses with a
flourish<00:02:47.900> here<00:02:48.080> will<00:02:48.560> it<00:02:48.680> help<00:02:48.860> a<00:02:49.160> lot<00:02:49.400> yes<00:02:50.030> the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
flourish here will it help a lot yes the

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.860 
flourish here will it help a lot yes the
mini<00:02:51.320> ease<00:02:51.650> is<00:02:51.950> everything<00:02:52.760> going<00:02:53.120> for<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.390> why

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
mini ease is everything going for it why

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.990 
mini ease is everything going for it why
because<00:02:54.500> with<00:02:55.280> developing<00:02:56.240> a<00:02:56.510> industry<00:02:57.500> dead

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
because with developing a industry dead

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.840 
because with developing a industry dead
that<00:02:59.000> you<00:02:59.690> know<00:02:59.840> could<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.560> know<00:03:01.070> 3d<00:03:01.430> printing

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
that you know could you know 3d printing

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.670 
that you know could you know 3d printing
what<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.240> really<00:03:02.540> training<00:03:02.930> retraining<00:03:03.140> is

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
what is really training retraining is

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.970 
what is really training retraining is
machines<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.760> these<00:03:04.940> machines<00:03:05.480> using<00:03:06.320> the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
machines and these machines using the

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.940 
machines and these machines using the
same<00:03:09.280> production<00:03:10.280> process<00:03:10.970> by<00:03:11.180> layer<00:03:11.450> thing

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
same production process by layer thing

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.250 
same production process by layer thing
for<00:03:12.950> various<00:03:13.400> applications<00:03:13.430> is<00:03:14.360> this<00:03:14.780> is<00:03:14.959> my

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
for various applications is this is my

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.910 
for various applications is this is my
mission<00:03:15.709> yeah<00:03:16.370> had<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:16.910> bring<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.900> doula<00:03:18.290> into

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
mission yeah had to bring the doula into

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.580 
mission yeah had to bring the doula into
the<00:03:19.010> education<00:03:19.580> system<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:20.330> 3d<00:03:20.989> printing

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
the education system the 3d printing

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.570 
the education system the 3d printing
only<00:03:22.010> has<00:03:22.190> look<00:03:22.790> in<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.030> last<00:03:23.209> I<00:03:23.480> would<00:03:23.600> say<00:03:24.580> 33

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
only has look in the last I would say 33

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.990 
only has look in the last I would say 33
years<00:03:26.030> have<00:03:26.239> you<00:03:26.480> know<00:03:26.930> left<00:03:27.230> this

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
years have you know left this

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.560 
years have you know left this
prototyping<00:03:29.000> in<00:03:30.610> Miami<00:03:31.610> to<00:03:31.910> become<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.239> little

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
prototyping in Miami to become a little

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.570 
prototyping in Miami to become a little
bit<00:03:32.600> moment<00:03:33.020> soon<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.530> think<00:03:34.190> there's<00:03:34.340> still<00:03:34.520> a

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
bit moment soon I think there's still a

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.160 
bit moment soon I think there's still a
lot<00:03:35.000> that<00:03:35.030> needs<00:03:35.330> to<00:03:35.480> be<00:03:35.600> happening<00:03:35.959> in<00:03:36.050> the

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
lot that needs to be happening in the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.050 
lot that needs to be happening in the
industry<00:03:36.320> and<00:03:36.800> everything<00:03:37.459> that<00:03:37.640> you<00:03:37.760> see

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
industry and everything that you see

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.580 
industry and everything that you see
here<00:03:38.270> this<00:03:38.510> video<00:03:38.810> sir<00:03:38.870> is<00:03:39.260> in<00:03:39.440> development

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
here this video sir is in development

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.710 
here this video sir is in development
and<00:03:40.190> that<00:03:40.850> has<00:03:41.030> happened<00:03:41.420> over<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.840> years

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
and that has happened over the years

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.570 
and that has happened over the years
precise<00:03:44.720> believes<00:03:45.140> that<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.769> 3doodler<00:03:46.190> is

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
precise believes that the 3doodler is

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.640 
precise believes that the 3doodler is
the<00:03:46.790> missing<00:03:47.030> link<00:03:47.209> between<00:03:47.620> education<00:03:48.620> and

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
the missing link between education and

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.610 
the missing link between education and
