here
as<00:02:34.159> they<00:02:34.519> head<00:02:34.670> into<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.970> halftime<00:02:35.180> this<00:02:35.599> is<00:02:35.750> a

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
as they head into the halftime this is a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.210 
as they head into the halftime this is a
really<00:02:36.170> critical<00:02:36.319> point<00:02:36.830> where<00:02:36.980> these<00:02:37.069> guys

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
really critical point where these guys

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.890 
really critical point where these guys
need<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.519> recover<00:02:37.819> from<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.209> really<00:02:38.540> intense

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
need to recover from that really intense

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.449 
need to recover from that really intense
first<00:02:39.170> half<00:02:39.409> one<00:02:39.860> of<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:39.980> things<00:02:40.099> we<00:02:40.250> like<00:02:40.370> to

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
first half one of the things we like to

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.309 
first half one of the things we like to
recommend<00:02:40.849> is<00:02:40.940> really<00:02:41.150> adding<00:02:41.480> some<00:02:41.989> minerals

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
recommend is really adding some minerals

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.449 
recommend is really adding some minerals
and<00:02:42.440> electrolytes<00:02:42.500> what<00:02:43.099> that<00:02:43.250> does<00:02:43.430> is

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
and electrolytes what that does is

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.670 
and electrolytes what that does is
increases<00:02:44.330> the<00:02:44.569> osmolarity<00:02:44.930> of<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.379> drink

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
increases the osmolarity of the drink

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.530 
increases the osmolarity of the drink
which<00:02:46.159> actually<00:02:46.340> gets<00:02:46.700> into<00:02:47.030> your<00:02:47.120> body<00:02:47.299> where

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
which actually gets into your body where

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.640 
which actually gets into your body where
you<00:02:47.599> can<00:02:47.690> actually<00:02:47.810> use<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:48.170> that's<00:02:48.530> gonna

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
you can actually use it that's gonna

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.130 
you can actually use it that's gonna
help<00:02:49.099> them<00:02:49.370> preserve<00:02:49.879> that<00:02:50.329> 2,000<00:02:50.870> calories

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
help them preserve that 2,000 calories

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.690 
help them preserve that 2,000 calories
that's<00:02:51.290> stored<00:02:51.590> in<00:02:51.680> their<00:02:51.769> body<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.549> give

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
that's stored in their body and give

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.009 
that's stored in their body and give
them<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.819> staying<00:02:53.060> power<00:02:53.239> to<00:02:53.329> make<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:53.569> all<00:02:53.959> the

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
them a staying power to make it all the

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.720 
them a staying power to make it all the
way<00:02:54.200> through<00:02:54.409> a<00:02:54.470> game<00:02:54.680> well<00:02:55.310> maintained

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
way through a game well maintained

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.080 
way through a game well maintained
performance<00:02:56.239> at<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.450> very<00:02:56.659> end

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.310 

normally<00:03:02.090> I<00:03:02.120> think<00:03:02.570> in<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.780> second<00:03:03.140> half<00:03:03.290> you

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
normally I think in the second half you

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.550 
normally I think in the second half you
take<00:03:03.740> some<00:03:03.980> more<00:03:04.940> minutes<00:03:05.420> than<00:03:05.600> 1st<00:03:05.960> half<00:03:06.200> 22

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
take some more minutes than 1st half 22

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.770 
take some more minutes than 1st half 22
getting<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.370> game<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:08.060> majority<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.510> goals

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
getting the game the majority of goals

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.110 
getting the game the majority of goals
are<00:03:08.990> scored<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:09.560> that<00:03:09.860> last<00:03:10.160> little<00:03:10.400> 15<00:03:10.940> min<00:03:11.030> a

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
are scored and that last little 15 min a

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.490 
are scored and that last little 15 min a
block<00:03:11.360> of<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:11.660> first<00:03:11.870> half<00:03:12.080> of<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.230> second

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
block of the first half of the second

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.320 
block of the first half of the second
half<00:03:12.650> and<00:03:12.800> that's<00:03:12.830> just<00:03:13.160> naturally<00:03:14.090> when<00:03:14.210> guys

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
half and that's just naturally when guys

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.210 
half and that's just naturally when guys
are<00:03:14.360> tired<00:03:14.660> how<00:03:15.080> can<00:03:15.380> we<00:03:15.470> find<00:03:15.740> ways<00:03:16.010> to

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
are tired how can we find ways to

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.800 
are tired how can we find ways to
conserve<00:03:16.550> energy<00:03:17.090> whether<00:03:17.420> that's<00:03:17.600> with

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
conserve energy whether that's with

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.300 
conserve energy whether that's with
running<00:03:18.260> form<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.680> looking<00:03:18.920> at<00:03:19.010> running

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
running form and looking at running

mechanic<00:03:19.730> fitness<00:03:20.180> dros<00:03:20.420> that<00:03:20.600> we're<00:03:20.720> doing

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
mechanic fitness dros that we're doing

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.080 
mechanic fitness dros that we're doing
to<00:03:21.020> try<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.320> improve<00:03:21.770> our<00:03:21.980> ability<00:03:22.070> to<00:03:22.610> recover

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
to try to improve our ability to recover

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.330 
to try to improve our ability to recover
so<00:03:23.570> that<00:03:23.720> we<00:03:23.840> do<00:03:24.050> have<00:03:24.200> more<00:03:24.470> left<00:03:24.770> as<00:03:25.100> we<00:03:25.250> get

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
so that we do have more left as we get

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:38.309 
so that we do have more left as we get
into<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.610> back<00:03:25.790> half<00:03:26.060> of<00:03:26.210> a<00:03:26.330> day

when<00:03:39.319> we<00:03:39.530> score<00:03:39.770> go<00:03:39.980> it's<00:03:40.310> it's<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:41.390> best

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
when we score go it's it's the best

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.140 
when we score go it's it's the best

moment because you play your run you

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.750 
moment because you play your run you
work<00:03:44.569> a<00:03:44.780> lot<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:45.230> score<00:03:45.740> and<00:03:46.069> the<00:03:46.190> score<00:03:46.580> make

work a lot to score and the score make
you<00:03:46.910> win<00:03:47.150> games<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.840> lot<00:03:48.319> of<00:03:48.350> times<00:03:48.620> it's<00:03:48.770> more

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
you win games a lot of times it's more

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.320 
you win games a lot of times it's more
of<00:03:49.010> just<00:03:49.040> a<00:03:49.310> metal<00:03:49.640> check<00:03:49.850> how<00:03:50.090> do<00:03:50.150> i<00:03:50.270> get

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
of just a metal check how do i get

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.330 
of just a metal check how do i get
myself<00:03:50.600> into<00:03:50.959> a<00:03:51.140> better<00:03:51.410> place<00:03:51.950> starting

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
myself into a better place starting

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.860 
myself into a better place starting
position<00:03:52.760> so<00:03:52.910> that<00:03:52.940> maybe<00:03:53.209> i<00:03:53.360> don't<00:03:53.450> have<00:03:53.720> to

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
position so that maybe i don't have to

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.260 
position so that maybe i don't have to
make<00:03:54.050> a<00:03:54.350> 40-yard<00:03:55.250> run<00:03:55.430> when<00:03:55.580> I<00:03:55.610> am<00:03:55.790> now<00:03:55.970> you

make a 40-yard run when I am now you

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.610 
make a 40-yard run when I am now you
know<00:03:56.360> if<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:56.540> may<00:03:56.660> only<00:03:56.810> make<00:03:56.989> a<00:03:57.050> 20-yard<00:03:57.560> run

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
know if you may only make a 20-yard run

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.040 
know if you may only make a 20-yard run
it's<00:03:58.130> more<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:58.580> experience<00:03:59.180> and<00:03:59.330> the<00:03:59.690> game

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
it's more the experience and the game

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.160 
it's more the experience and the game
shows<00:04:00.530> you<00:04:00.770> that<00:04:01.160> veteran<00:04:01.790> in<00:04:02.510> him<00:04:02.840> you<00:04:03.020> know
