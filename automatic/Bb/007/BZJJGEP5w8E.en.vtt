00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.600
 this is a fix everybody welcome today 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.990
 me another video about the suspension 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.759
 and a knock on the suspension are those who watch 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.470
 periodically video on my channel you already 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:24.599
 have seen something like this today 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.689
 decided to post it again because 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.630
 the situation repeats it means this 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.120
 place in our suspension 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.740
 but not only with us at our e34 but also 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.960
 other cars just have a little more 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.020
 device but the bottom line is that here it is 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.590
 the place always suffers because if u 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.300
 the car knocks you on the first thing 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.810
 this place is called 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:53.670
 anti-roll bar 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:55.650
 and the essence is what is this here 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.000
 stabilizers here they are 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.640
 on both sides they are ball and 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.799
 they are twisted nuts let me tell you 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.200
 show this nut to make it clear that 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.479
 This is not an ordinary nut, but a nut with 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.159
 special plastic retainer 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.969
 ring 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:17.609
 And so when I was the pillar sometimes 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:19.079
 services are that unscrewed and 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:19.920
 immediately screwed himself well that is 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.319
 rearranged 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.509
 the stabilizer itself and the nut twisted too 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:26.399
 you canâ€™t do this yourself 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.990
 as soon as this stabilizer changes 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.880
 usually nuts go along with it in 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.889
 set if they do not go then you need to 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.670
 stores special buy nuts for 

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:38.819
 ball bearings under in our e34 here at 17 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.259
 internal 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:48.539
 how much I understand 10 to internal 10 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.659
 outer diameter r17 if that in 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.789
 stores to ask could be so 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.420
 Here is exactly this place first thing 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:01.319
 knocks didn't believe for something heavy not 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.600
 grab hold of saylenbloki for some 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.670
 there other rubber parts first here 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.709
 inspect in general like this if 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.280
 knocks in the suspension immediately climb and here in 

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:14.160
 this place they are often vani here 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.000
 and here on top of the back 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.130
 here here 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.670
 is fastened with a nut and in the evening even with your hands 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.260
 fingers turned that is it just from 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.060
 the movements get loose 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.670
 i know i say this in ninety 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.540
 percent of the cases if you knock 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.640
 suspension strong pieces this either here 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.020
 this bolts 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.020
 Well, I'll show you 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.590
 or 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.380
 this stabilizer is here 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.410
 first check the three nuts and bolts 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.670
 tweak them and shuruet a little bit 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.400
 by the way oddly so here I am 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.300
 raised the car and the stabilizer on the contrary 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.640
 swooped in and not knocking that is possible 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.200
 try and raised and lowered 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.980
 why does he knock because one 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.870
 the wheel is raised by 2 lowered and they are friend 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.380
 like a friend that is this 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:11.970
 Here is the beam, it is now stretched and this 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:14.660
 part of it pushes down and part of it pulls 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.130
 up that is, it is twisted like 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.920
 if you do not immediately see this case 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.750
 and do not twist as it should 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.650
 going on means boot i have 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.209
 climbed inside 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.440
 but this is not the worst scary itself 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:32.400
 that here until this bolt is about 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.500
 like that in motion he's rubbing here 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.430
 big hole and see here and so 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.900
 goes inside already this part 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.260
 Respectively already screw you not screwed 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.930
 and because he has her emphasis and accounts 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.640
 already somehow to excel in general at the idea I 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.660
 I think the best way here will be 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.410
 put the puck 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.690
 Well, about I do not know like no, but 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.329
 shorter than the puck that smoothly climbs on 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.040
 this part and keeps deliver and here and 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.799
 weld along the edges here to this part 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.739
 so that the stabilizer could not move it 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.260
 the puck is desirable to take in thicker here 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.970
 inside push some kind of grease 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.630
 flew on the former any lubricant and duster 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.579
 return back here in these grooves here 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.229
 here that is, in principle, here's the ball 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.150
 ok there is no anything for me 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.340
 exclude does not hang out that is she still 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.420
 very much alive 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.910
 just boot here 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.930
 dressed and here he is the size of a hole 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.880
 wider 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.380
 so pull up right away so that 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:32.490
 it did not happen then 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:35.810
 restore things like that in general 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.810
 I hope I helped someone
