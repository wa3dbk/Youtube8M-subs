00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
everything like that just because it's

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.900 
everything like that just because it's
similar<00:03:43.889> to<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.220> arkham<00:03:44.489> knight<00:03:44.639> that<00:03:44.760> has

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.789 
similar to the arkham knight that has
nothing<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.419> do<00:03:45.540> with<00:03:45.690> anything<00:03:46.049> you<00:03:46.680> know

nothing to do with anything you know

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.039 
nothing to do with anything you know
Batman<00:03:47.549> is<00:03:47.760> in<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:48.000> very<00:03:48.180> similar<00:03:48.450> pose<00:03:48.810> when

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
Batman is in a very similar pose when

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.960 
Batman is in a very similar pose when
the<00:03:49.169> Batmobile<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.739> called<00:03:49.980> in<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.519> evening

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
the Batmobile is called in the evening

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.539 
the Batmobile is called in the evening
the<00:03:51.090> odds<00:03:51.120> trailer<00:03:51.510> like<00:03:52.169> it's<00:03:52.799> just<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.130> badass

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
the odds trailer like it's just a badass

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.970 
the odds trailer like it's just a badass
pose<00:03:53.910> it<00:03:54.209> looks<00:03:54.450> cool<00:03:54.780> there's<00:03:55.349> not<00:03:55.650> much<00:03:55.950> more

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
pose it looks cool there's not much more

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.860 
pose it looks cool there's not much more
to<00:03:56.220> it<00:03:58.819> this<00:03:59.819> is<00:03:59.940> what<00:04:00.090> i<00:04:00.120> would<00:04:00.329> consider<00:04:00.480> the

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
to it this is what i would consider the

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.599 
to it this is what i would consider the
money<00:04:00.989> shot<00:04:01.319> of<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.500> trailer<00:04:01.859> has<00:04:02.099> he<00:04:02.340> has<00:04:02.459> his

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
money shot of the trailer has he has his

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.000 
money shot of the trailer has he has his
two<00:04:02.849> guns<00:04:03.150> ready<00:04:03.599> this<00:04:04.290> would<00:04:04.500> probably<00:04:04.680> be

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
two guns ready this would probably be

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.220 
two guns ready this would probably be
the<00:04:05.459> opening<00:04:05.879> cutscene<00:04:06.150> you<00:04:06.900> know<00:04:06.989> from<00:04:07.169> the

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
the opening cutscene you know from the

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.869 
the opening cutscene you know from the
way<00:04:07.379> it<00:04:07.530> looks<00:04:07.799> just<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.370> way<00:04:08.459> everything's

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
way it looks just the way everything's

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.879 
way it looks just the way everything's
all<00:04:09.060> cinematic<00:04:09.629> and<00:04:09.780> these<00:04:10.139> thugs<00:04:10.410> are<00:04:10.620> having

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
all cinematic and these thugs are having

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.369 
all cinematic and these thugs are having
their<00:04:10.980> first<00:04:11.310> initial<00:04:11.879> reaction<00:04:12.419> to<00:04:12.599> Red<00:04:13.169> Hood

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
their first initial reaction to Red Hood

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.830 
their first initial reaction to Red Hood
so<00:04:13.889> yeah<00:04:14.040> I<00:04:14.069> would<00:04:14.190> definitely<00:04:14.549> say<00:04:14.940> that<00:04:15.480> this

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
so yeah I would definitely say that this

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.360 
so yeah I would definitely say that this
is<00:04:15.989> probably<00:04:16.079> like<00:04:16.349> the<00:04:16.530> opening<00:04:16.919> cutscene<00:04:17.099> of

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
is probably like the opening cutscene of

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.920 
is probably like the opening cutscene of
the<00:04:17.489> story<00:04:17.729> pack<00:04:17.970> another<00:04:18.479> thing<00:04:18.690> to<00:04:18.780> mention

00:04:44.989 --> 00:04:44.999 
like I would say that Red Hood probably

00:04:44.999 --> 00:04:46.550
