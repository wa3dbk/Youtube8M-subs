I was walking out and this line was

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.030 
I was walking out and this line was
really<00:02:25.750> long<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.290> don't<00:02:26.590> really<00:02:26.740> need<00:02:26.950> to

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
really long so you don't really need to

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.890 
really long so you don't really need to
know<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.250> whole<00:02:27.340> story<00:02:27.490> but<00:02:28.180> I<00:02:28.420> ended<00:02:28.840> up

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
know the whole story but I ended up

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.150 
know the whole story but I ended up
putting<00:02:29.080> on<00:02:29.230> here<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.800> it<00:02:29.860> looked<00:02:30.010> really

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
putting on here and it looked really

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.210 
putting on here and it looked really
really<00:02:30.370> good<00:02:30.490> um<00:02:30.910> it's<00:02:31.600> just<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.320> basic<00:02:32.620> black

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220

it looks really really sheer but that's

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:39.870 
it looks really really sheer but that's
only<00:02:38.860> because<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.250> lights<00:02:39.520> are<00:02:39.700> really

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
only because the lights are really

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.240 
only because the lights are really
really<00:02:40.090> bright<00:02:40.240> um<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:41.110> what<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.010> love<00:02:42.190> about
