00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.750

 or is celebrating 30 years of the tragedy 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.290
 night of the pencils' the night 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.290
 pencils in registered television 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.269
 something 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.269
 to strangers the central thing 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:41.789
 a single day without dying without screaming without law 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.360
 without understanding without loving what disaster of 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:48.019
 people who could not be in peace want 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.019
 I know what it is 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.310
 but let's say Sofia as I calculate that 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.680
 everyone will have been here in the studio 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.540
 all quietly looking at the report and 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.710
 suffering not 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.510
 I do not notice anything to say 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.510
 well we are going a lot for that crying 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.890
 this piece of sandpaper tipped 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:23.530
 I never give you anything again 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.530
 my reason never again as a gift 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.150
 dalila 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.810
 I had to bring them or because I was 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.960
 wonderful what he did with photos 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.840
 kind collage of her in my tummy of hers 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.410
 as as life as a poem I cried is the 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.410
 best gift 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.110
 I must clarify that all the queues and all 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.460
 the little things and the marquez primers already 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:58.040
 I have all of them security what happens 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.590
 that once a thing that was mine I the 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.360
 he took out and I painted it and he turned it 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.360
 give away to understand was not hers 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.380
 the first one has helped me do the 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.440
 the divine life second the second 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.090
 usually a poronga do not exist or not what 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.280
 you gave my son a little box that 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.380
 you stole from me the collage was a 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.900
 crap but it was mine and never again should 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.049
 give away nothing because it broke my heart 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.079
 and we are forgetting your dad to 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:31.590
 it's important to have my last name in my 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.590
 blood 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:42.450
 but the story 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.450
 for TV for me it is not very few 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.030
 first fire a god theme 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.030
 that does not have well drawn 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.560
 and 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.680
 this not 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.050
 I like a lot of things lately 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.810
 I'm thinking that we idealize it and a 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.120
 old drunk goes but I love him very much 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.390
 why this saná for example asks 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.660
 apologies to sofía yes of course yes 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:17.610
 apologies why 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.560
 sometimes one thing what one is 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.340
 and another thing is what the guys want 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.349
 that is not 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.260
 and the truth also that goes on the canvas 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.900
 why 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.299
 it was not easy to see 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.730
 of going from making a humor to being another 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.420
 that was quite more vulgar and more 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.420
 hard 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.689
 the fruits 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.240
 spears and nights governments very well 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.360
 present lists 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.370
 we go 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.990
 and we think about the opinion of 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.060
 maradona about which if it is going to 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.710
 bilardo with him goes to all the selection 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.210
 Argentina it seems to me that behind that 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.530
 is less 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.330
 have the opportunity to start 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.870
 again to what company lucky to 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.870
 Valencia 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.380
 as long as you do not come back 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.380
 videla massera and agosti 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.579
 d 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.410
 old like you choose a bottle of 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.450
 whiskey but it was not sold to the system in 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.040
 the sense that it was at least 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.840
 honest with himself to me also me 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.030
 it seems that anyone is not in 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.650
 himself has to end up taking drugs 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.600
 with something 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:36.440
 those think that because it's still very 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.720
 difficult of what I do with life is not a 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.510
 drug to endure something like 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.940
 like how to live in a way and 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.220
 give up everything because you do not like them 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.220
 certain things and if you do not suck
