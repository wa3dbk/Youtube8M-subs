00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.930 
PB for it so we're gonna go for mobile
5k<00:02:16.610> level<00:02:16.880> seven<00:02:17.240> here<00:02:17.420> and<00:02:18.550> this<00:02:19.550> is<00:02:19.670> only<00:02:19.790> the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
5k level seven here and this is only the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.220 
5k level seven here and this is only the
beginning<00:02:20.120> of<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.510> game<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:20.750> it's<00:02:21.080> pretty

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
beginning of the game so it's pretty

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:30.730 
beginning of the game so it's pretty
quick

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.230 

so<00:02:31.740> this<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.370> another<00:02:32.580> way<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.850> level<00:02:33.090> up

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
so this is another way to level up

16<00:04:19.400> in<00:04:19.610> the<00:04:19.700> video<00:04:20.000> because<00:04:20.480> we<00:04:20.750> already<00:04:20.870> have

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.110 
16 in the video because we already have

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.930 
16 in the video because we already have
level<00:04:21.470> 50<00:04:21.800> counts<00:04:22.250> it<00:04:22.370> would<00:04:22.460> be<00:04:22.550> really<00:04:22.820> a

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
level 50 counts it would be really a

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.910 
level 50 counts it would be really a
waste<00:04:23.180> of<00:04:23.300> our<00:04:23.390> time<00:04:23.660> but<00:04:23.930> you<00:04:24.620> get<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.890> idea

waste of our time but you get the idea

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.620 
waste of our time but you get the idea
of<00:04:25.310> how<00:04:25.430> fast<00:04:25.640> you<00:04:25.880> can<00:04:26.000> level<00:04:26.150> up

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
of how fast you can level up

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.750
