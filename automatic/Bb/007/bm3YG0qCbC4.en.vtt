external hard drive solutions now never
Thunderbolt<00:00:07.890> first<00:00:08.760> came<00:00:08.970> out<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.300> was

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
Thunderbolt first came out and was

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.299 
Thunderbolt first came out and was
announced<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.840> was<00:00:09.929> pretty<00:00:10.139> excited<00:00:10.260> I<00:00:10.740> thought

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
announced I was pretty excited I thought

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.160 
announced I was pretty excited I thought
this<00:00:11.429> would<00:00:11.580> be<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.759> really<00:00:11.969> cool<00:00:12.509> way<00:00:12.660> to

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
this would be a really cool way to

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.499 
this would be a really cool way to
basically<00:00:13.830> hook<00:00:14.130> up<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.400> hard<00:00:14.639> drive<00:00:14.700> or<00:00:15.240> maybe

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
basically hook up a hard drive or maybe

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.529 
basically hook up a hard drive or maybe
even<00:00:15.599> an<00:00:15.870> external<00:00:16.350> display<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:17.760> my<00:00:17.910> imac<00:00:18.510> and

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
even an external display to my imac and

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.570 
even an external display to my imac and
have<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.289> really<00:00:19.619> quick<00:00:19.890> connection<00:00:20.220> um

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
have a really quick connection um

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.200 
have a really quick connection um
unfortunately<00:00:21.800> over<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:23.100> long<00:00:23.519> time<00:00:23.850> there<00:00:24.119> was

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
unfortunately over a long time there was

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.200 
unfortunately over a long time there was
hardly<00:00:24.570> anything<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:26.160> consumers<00:00:26.760> could<00:00:26.970> buy

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
hardly anything that consumers could buy

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.169 
hardly anything that consumers could buy
that<00:00:27.990> would<00:00:28.140> work<00:00:28.289> for<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.680> funderbolt<00:00:29.179> then

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
that would work for the funderbolt then

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.780 
that would work for the funderbolt then
finally<00:00:30.630> let<00:00:31.019> chi<00:00:31.289> or<00:00:31.560> Lacey<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.579> don't<00:00:32.730> know

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
finally let chi or Lacey I don't know

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.729 
finally let chi or Lacey I don't know
how<00:00:32.910> you're<00:00:33.059> supposed<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.360> say<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.590> came<00:00:34.590> out

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
how you're supposed to say that came out

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.740 
how you're supposed to say that came out
with<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.340> hard<00:00:35.910> drive<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.360> was<00:00:36.450> really

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
with this hard drive that was really

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.530 
with this hard drive that was really
expensive<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.620> six<00:00:38.399> terabytes<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.210> I

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
expensive is like six terabytes and I

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.200 
expensive is like six terabytes and I
don't<00:00:39.750> know<00:00:39.809> like<00:00:40.050> who<00:00:40.559> wants<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.860> um<00:00:41.340> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
don't know like who wants that um and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.510 
don't know like who wants that um and
people<00:00:42.660> have<00:00:42.690> been<00:00:42.960> actually<00:00:43.559> now<00:00:43.920> coming<00:00:44.430> out

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
people have been actually now coming out

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.549 
people have been actually now coming out
with<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> lot<00:00:45.059> more<00:00:45.239> Thunderbolt<00:00:45.809> devices<00:00:46.230> well

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
with a lot more Thunderbolt devices well

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.330 
with a lot more Thunderbolt devices well
one<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.280> problems<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.670> almost<00:00:48.420> nobody

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
one of the problems is almost nobody

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.430 
one of the problems is almost nobody
actually<00:00:50.340> offers<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.300> free<00:00:51.360> Thunderbolt<00:00:52.289> cable

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
actually offers a free Thunderbolt cable

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.410 
actually offers a free Thunderbolt cable
included<00:00:52.770> which<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.520> really<00:00:53.789> annoying<00:00:54.090> as

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
included which is really annoying as

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.319 
included which is really annoying as
fifty<00:00:55.320> dollars<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.800> not<00:00:56.129> cheap<00:00:56.550> for<00:00:56.910> just<00:00:57.149> a

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
fifty dollars is not cheap for just a

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.049 
fifty dollars is not cheap for just a
cable<00:00:57.780> right<00:00:58.260> now<00:00:58.469> my<00:00:59.070> personal<00:00:59.340> opinion<00:00:59.910> I

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
cable right now my personal opinion I

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.139 
cable right now my personal opinion I
think<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:01.020> these<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:02.010> seagate<00:01:02.520> did<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
think that these that seagate did a

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.160 
think that these that seagate did a
really<00:01:03.480> good<00:01:03.629> job<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:04.140> with<00:01:05.070> their<00:01:06.000> option<00:01:06.720> for

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
really good job on with their option for

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.810 
really good job on with their option for
Thunderbolt<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:09.260> this<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.409> actually<00:01:10.560> an<00:01:11.460> older

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
Thunderbolt so this is actually an older

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.670 
Thunderbolt so this is actually an older
hard<00:01:12.119> drive<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:12.930> only<00:01:13.170> 500

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
hard drive that I have it's only 500

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.330 
hard drive that I have it's only 500
gigabytes<00:01:14.130> which<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.549> know<00:01:14.610> only<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:16.100> while<00:01:17.100> ago

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
gigabytes which I know only a while ago

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
gigabytes which I know only a while ago
this<00:01:17.549> was<00:01:17.790> way<00:01:18.509> too<00:01:18.570> much<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.200> now<00:01:20.030> I've<00:01:21.030> moved

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
this was way too much but now I've moved

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.929 
this was way too much but now I've moved
on<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.720> one<00:01:21.990> terabyte<00:01:22.439> cuz<00:01:22.830> backups<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.850> all

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
on to one terabyte cuz backups and all

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.960 
on to one terabyte cuz backups and all
that<00:01:24.060> stuff<00:01:24.180> anyway<00:01:24.689> hmm<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:26.729> cool<00:01:26.939> thing

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
about this drive is that it has a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.630 
about this drive is that it has a
detachable<00:01:29.689> port<00:01:30.689> thing<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.530> have<00:01:32.340> no<00:01:32.520> idea

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
detachable port thing I have no idea

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.550 
detachable port thing I have no idea
what<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.060> call<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.710> basically<00:01:34.710> um<00:01:35.840> if<00:01:36.840> you

what to call this basically um if you
want<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.829> change<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.759> say<00:01:39.360> firewire<00:01:39.900> 800

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
want to change this to say firewire 800

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.359 
want to change this to say firewire 800
or<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.369> USB<00:01:44.270> 3.5<00:01:45.270> clone<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.649> know<00:01:46.770> transfer

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
or a USB 3.5 clone it you know transfer

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.219 
or a USB 3.5 clone it you know transfer
to<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.549> new<00:01:47.640> one<00:01:47.909> really<00:01:48.659> all<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.899> have<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.079> do

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
to the new one really all you have to do

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.889 
to the new one really all you have to do
is<00:01:49.430> exchange<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.909> really<00:01:51.360> simple<00:01:51.540> um<00:01:52.250> so

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
is exchange this really simple um so

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.139 
is exchange this really simple um so
because<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.369> if<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.549> did<00:01:56.759> buy<00:01:56.939> one<00:01:57.119> of

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
because of this if you did buy one of

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.450 
because of this if you did buy one of
these<00:01:57.270> hard<00:01:57.570> drives<00:01:57.689> like<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.200> did<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.280> buy

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
these hard drives like I did you can buy

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.859 
these hard drives like I did you can buy
a<00:01:59.729> $99<00:02:00.600> adapter<00:02:01.320> which<00:02:02.280> allows<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.659> just

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
a $99 adapter which allows you to just

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.840 
a $99 adapter which allows you to just
put<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.920> does<00:02:05.159> make<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.549> little<00:02:05.700> bit

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
put it in it does make this a little bit

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.900 
put it in it does make this a little bit
thicker<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.420> have<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.899> say<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.610> you<00:02:08.610> can<00:02:08.759> use<00:02:08.879> it

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
thicker I have to say and you can use it

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.660 
thicker I have to say and you can use it
as<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.239> thunderbolt<00:02:09.750> drive<00:02:09.959> know<00:02:10.459> one<00:02:11.459> thing

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
as a thunderbolt drive know one thing

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.940 
as a thunderbolt drive know one thing
that<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:11.879> do<00:02:12.090> have<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.300> keep<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.569> mind

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
that you do have to keep in mind

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.770 
that you do have to keep in mind
is<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.489> this<00:02:13.940> is<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:15.040> HDD<00:02:16.040> meaning<00:02:16.879> it's<00:02:17.360> not<00:02:17.569> a

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
is that this is a HDD meaning it's not a

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.780 
is that this is a HDD meaning it's not a
solid<00:02:18.140> state<00:02:18.349> drive<00:02:18.620> meaning<00:02:19.069> that<00:02:19.340> you're

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
solid state drive meaning that you're

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.509 
solid state drive meaning that you're
not<00:02:19.940> gonna<00:02:20.120> have<00:02:20.269> that<00:02:20.330> as<00:02:20.629> fast<00:02:21.080> speeds

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
not gonna have that as fast speeds

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.000 
not gonna have that as fast speeds
however<00:02:22.519> this<00:02:22.640> is<00:02:22.849> a<00:02:22.930> 7200<00:02:23.930> RPM<00:02:24.379> drive<00:02:24.650> which

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
however this is a 7200 RPM drive which

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.880 
however this is a 7200 RPM drive which
means<00:02:25.310> it<00:02:25.489> it<00:02:26.209> turns<00:02:26.450> pretty<00:02:26.780> quickly<00:02:26.959> so<00:02:27.260> you

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
means it it turns pretty quickly so you

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.130 
means it it turns pretty quickly so you
do<00:02:28.370> get<00:02:28.550> faster<00:02:29.090> hardware<00:02:29.599> of<00:02:29.660> speeds<00:02:29.959> than

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
do get faster hardware of speeds than

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.910 
do get faster hardware of speeds than
like<00:02:30.349> a<00:02:30.430> 5400<00:02:31.430> RPM<00:02:31.940> hard<00:02:32.720> drive<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.620> over

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
like a 5400 RPM hard drive and over

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.320 
like a 5400 RPM hard drive and over
Thunderbolt<00:02:34.989> that's<00:02:35.989> that's<00:02:36.349> pretty<00:02:36.590> good<00:02:36.709> um

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
Thunderbolt that's that's pretty good um

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.030 
Thunderbolt that's that's pretty good um
now<00:02:38.330> this<00:02:38.540> does<00:02:38.840> not<00:02:38.989> come<00:02:39.290> with<00:02:39.410> a<00:02:39.440> cord<00:02:39.830> which

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
now this does not come with a cord which

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.670 
now this does not come with a cord which
is<00:02:40.220> once<00:02:40.519> again<00:02:40.610> in<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.970> wine<00:02:41.260> so<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.290> hundred
