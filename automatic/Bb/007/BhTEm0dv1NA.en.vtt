00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
I don't know excited maybe the tectonic

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.490 
I don't know excited maybe the tectonic
plates<00:02:52.330> that<00:02:52.420> moved<00:02:52.750> apart<00:02:53.140> you<00:02:53.260> can't

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
plates that moved apart you can't

earthquakes<00:02:55.959> or<00:02:56.230> volcanoes<00:02:56.590> that's<00:02:56.980> quite

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
earthquakes or volcanoes that's quite

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.170 
earthquakes or volcanoes that's quite
sad<00:02:57.519> oh<00:02:57.849> well<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:59.319> is<00:02:59.380> baby<00:02:59.650> parkland<00:03:00.250> which

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
sad oh well this is baby parkland which

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.150 
sad oh well this is baby parkland which
is<00:03:01.360> like<00:03:01.540> it's<00:03:01.930> called<00:03:02.079> seventh<00:03:02.500> most<00:03:02.739> drift

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
is like it's called seventh most drift

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.930 
is like it's called seventh most drift
yeah<00:03:03.790> is<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.110> odd<00:03:05.110> drift<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:05.860> now<00:03:06.489> there's

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
yeah is a odd drift and now there's

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.660 
yeah is a odd drift and now there's
seven<00:03:07.299> laps<00:03:07.450> in<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.720> zone<00:03:07.959> zone<00:03:08.590> level<00:03:09.750> and

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
seven laps in the zone zone level and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.069 
seven laps in the zone zone level and
obviously<00:03:12.670> this<00:03:12.849> this<00:03:12.910> really<00:03:13.360> does<00:03:13.720> show<00:03:13.930> its

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
obviously this this really does show its

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.509 
obviously this this really does show its
repetitiveness<00:03:14.620> it's<00:03:14.890> you<00:03:15.220> know<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.370> keeps

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
repetitiveness it's you know it keeps

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.059 
repetitiveness it's you know it keeps
going<00:03:15.959> Ice<00:03:16.959> Cube

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069

the beach peach level you think Braden

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.420 
the beach peach level you think Braden
is<00:03:40.690> God<00:03:40.959> I<00:03:41.230> think<00:03:41.650> I<00:03:41.799> recruited<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:42.370> because

is God I think I recruited you because
he<00:03:42.670> didn't<00:03:42.940> win<00:03:43.090> now<00:03:43.450> that<00:03:43.720> would<00:03:43.870> be<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:44.049> very

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
he didn't win now that would be a very

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.150 
he didn't win now that would be a very
plausible

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
plausible

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.410 
plausible
you<00:03:45.790> know<00:03:46.139> explanation<00:03:47.170> Braden<00:03:47.620> doesn't<00:03:47.950> like

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
you know explanation Braden doesn't like

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.539 
you know explanation Braden doesn't like
plus<00:03:49.420> plus<00:03:49.959> as<00:03:50.109> well-read<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.530> he's<00:03:51.400> good

enough<00:03:51.579> to<00:03:51.760> be<00:03:51.850> God<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:54.250> when<00:03:54.370> you<00:03:54.489> win<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:54.700> I

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
enough to be God so when you win the I

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.270 
enough to be God so when you win the I
have<00:03:55.569> all<00:03:55.690> these<00:03:55.780> other<00:03:55.959> points<00:03:56.170> and<00:03:56.410> stuff<00:03:56.590> so
