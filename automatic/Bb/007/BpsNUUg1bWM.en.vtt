00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.630
 lie down 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.740
 and the dream pursues you 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.080
 when 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.080
 ah 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.490
 basil what we love so 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.360
 we decided to sit with her 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.190
 we do not talk about your campaigns 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.020
 international or their prize for best 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.550
 model in madrid fashion week but yes 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.200
 how this world works what it is that 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.710
 he likes what he does while he waits and that 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.710
 he is passionate 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.170
 an agency but that was a bit of 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.360
 coincidence that comes to arrive at this 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.740
 agency and did not work much with them 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.420
 then a friend told me are you going to 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.650
 take some pictures for bad baba 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.840
 So if you're interested, we'll make them 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.010
 with you I made this catalog and a 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.660
 couple more and told me look I'm going to send 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.520
 your photos to fernando merino to see what 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.530
 He thinks that I know it's always cool 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.570
 get some money doing things 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.920
 how is it that in the end it was a hobby and 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.290
 then I started working with fernando 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.710
 merino and it was getting serious the thing and 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.710
 until today 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.630
 all around, I'm pretty 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.880
 restless ass and for example now in 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.470
 I've been in Barcelona for 4 days 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.020
 Friday and I know that if I had to 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.640
 to stay a week longer would be a little longer 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.470
 with the monkey after catching a train or 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.670
 catch a plane then I'm 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.230
 delighted that's why I love the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.070
 hotels my dreams have a hotel 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.070
 biggest set 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.619
 a little bit because the little dress on duty is 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.509
 the pre after the day to day is like the 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.189
 from a normal person only that has that 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.930
 of special that travel a lot like that of 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.580
 a businessman maybe all the 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.799
 airport day in airport you know 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.020
 a lot of people too but it's not 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.009
 It is not so surprising or so glamorous 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.009
 how they paint it at the end 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.840
 and since he contacted me 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.179
 he told me hey we want to open your blog 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.969
 in this and at the beginning it was also 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.310
 wow how cool what piece of opportunity 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.520
 has been almost a year in March makes a 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.520
 year 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.460
 is to find content because in the end 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.959
 you supposedly have to update as 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.000
 two three times a week so that the 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.379
 people stay a little there but clear 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.360
 there comes a point that you say is that as 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:15.860
 update three times a week two of 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.290
 the entries they make are not going to be worth 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.810
 nothing I prefer to do a post that this is 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.420
 half an hour reading what to do three post 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.470
 let them serve us 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.420
 I would very much like that their life to 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.250
 the best in a magazine being an editor 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.980
 so it would cost me a bit but that 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.000
 send special des sent - from no 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.000

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.780

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.430
