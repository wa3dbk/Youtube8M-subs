00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
because the first six letters on the top

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.130 
because the first six letters on the top
left-hand<00:00:53.659> side<00:00:54.110> contain<00:00:55.040> these<00:00:55.309> keys<00:00:56.140> so

looking at the keys themselves this can
take<00:01:05.210> several<00:01:05.510> hours<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:06.080> learn<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:06.710> more<00:01:07.310> to
