credibly well ventilated in the front

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.340 
credibly well ventilated in the front
and<00:00:45.070> it<00:00:45.520> has<00:00:45.730> this<00:00:46.110> different<00:00:47.110> to<00:00:47.170> anybody

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
and it has this different to anybody

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.229 
and it has this different to anybody
else<00:00:47.680> but<00:00:47.829> it<00:00:47.920> has<00:00:48.100> this<00:00:48.309> sort<00:00:48.700> of<00:00:48.760> like<00:00:48.940> arrow

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
else but it has this sort of like arrow

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.819 
else but it has this sort of like arrow
shape<00:00:49.690> at<00:00:49.840> the<00:00:49.899> back<00:00:50.079> and<00:00:50.320> that<00:00:50.379> has<00:00:50.620> more<00:00:50.770> to

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
shape at the back and that has more to

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.740 
shape at the back and that has more to
do<00:00:51.070> with<00:00:51.300> ventilation<00:00:52.300> when<00:00:52.420> your<00:00:52.570> heads

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
do with ventilation when your heads

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.049 
do with ventilation when your heads
upright<00:00:53.170> better<00:00:53.739> for<00:00:53.950> climbing<00:00:54.370> and<00:00:54.460> then

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
upright better for climbing and then

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.670 
upright better for climbing and then
when<00:00:55.510> your<00:00:55.629> heads<00:00:55.840> down<00:00:56.079> in<00:00:56.350> a<00:00:56.530> more

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
when your heads down in a more

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.500 
when your heads down in a more
aerodynamic<00:00:56.829> position<00:00:57.430> you<00:00:58.090> get<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.360> arrow

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
aerodynamic position you get the arrow

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.990 
aerodynamic position you get the arrow
benefit<00:00:59.050> there<00:00:59.340> according<00:01:00.340> to<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.550> testing

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
benefit there according to the testing

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.360 
benefit there according to the testing
they<00:01:01.090> say<00:01:01.360> it<00:01:01.600> is<00:01:01.840> most<00:01:02.199> aerodynamic<00:01:02.980> from<00:01:03.160> all

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
they say it is most aerodynamic from all

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.429 
they say it is most aerodynamic from all
conditions<00:01:04.000> so<00:01:04.269> I<00:01:04.299> suppose<00:01:04.839> we're<00:01:05.019> looking<00:01:05.289> at

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
conditions so I suppose we're looking at

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.109 
conditions so I suppose we're looking at
any<00:01:05.619> most<00:01:05.859> aerodynamic<00:01:06.579> helmet<00:01:06.759> in

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
any most aerodynamic helmet in

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.569 
any most aerodynamic helmet in
real-world<00:01:07.749> conditions<00:01:08.139> very<00:01:09.009> impressive

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:09.579 
real-world conditions very impressive

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:11.069 
real-world conditions very impressive
some<00:01:10.029> of<00:01:10.119> the<00:01:10.179> other<00:01:10.299> cool<00:01:10.479> features<00:01:10.899> about

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079 
some of the other cool features about

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:14.160 
some of the other cool features about
the<00:01:11.259> helmet<00:01:11.439> is<00:01:11.709> it<00:01:12.159> has<00:01:12.340> some<00:01:12.670> really<00:01:13.659> nice

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
the helmet is it has some really nice

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.719 
the helmet is it has some really nice
internal<00:01:14.799> padding<00:01:15.219> the<00:01:15.340> padding<00:01:15.639> is

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
internal padding the padding is

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.609 
internal padding the padding is
replaceable<00:01:16.240> so<00:01:16.509> it<00:01:16.599> will<00:01:16.779> be<00:01:16.959> spare<00:01:17.289> units

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
replaceable so it will be spare units

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.349 
replaceable so it will be spare units
