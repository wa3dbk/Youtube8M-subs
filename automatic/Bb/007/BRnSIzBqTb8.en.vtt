00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
zero one CG you can also use a a500 CG

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.310 
zero one CG you can also use a a500 CG
and<00:00:14.670> they<00:00:14.849> work<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.299> same<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.289> first

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
and they work the same so the first

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.870 
and they work the same so the first
thing<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:16.859> need<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.220> do<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.699> download

thing that you need to do is download
these<00:00:18.300> two<00:00:18.539> files<00:00:18.570> okay<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.439> boot<00:00:19.650> understand

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
these two files okay the boot understand

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.550 
these two files okay the boot understand
-<00:00:20.400> new<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.180> boot<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.689> system<00:00:22.020> -<00:00:22.170> new

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
- new and the boot and the system - new

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.320 
- new and the boot and the system - new
so<00:00:23.100> these<00:00:23.279> two<00:00:23.490> are<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.760> files<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.300> need

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
now that we're in the bootloader will

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.999 
now that we're in the bootloader will
slash<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.929> profiles<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:52.890> have

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
downloaded okay so for the tape that

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:03.880 
downloaded okay so for the tape that
commands<00:01:55.979> would<00:01:56.189> be<00:01:56.459> fastboot<00:01:59.959> flash

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.229 

we<00:02:04.890> have<00:02:04.979> dashing<00:02:05.399> into<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.789> boot<00:02:06.000> partition

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:06.239 
we have dashing into the boot partition

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:08.960 
we have dashing into the boot partition
so<00:02:06.810> we'll<00:02:06.929> right<00:02:07.140> boot<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.709> then<00:02:08.429> we'll<00:02:08.640> type

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
so we'll right boot and then we'll type
