00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.049
 there are many minecraft editors and 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.850
 many as you are seeing here we are 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.799
 in plants against zombies playing here 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.780
 in minecraft and well I will teach a 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.670
 little about what the map consists of and how it is 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.259
 as you see here we have the plants that 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.940
 we would have to defend to not 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.980
 the zombies will come through these 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.140
 roads that are formed by water to the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.790
 house and do not eat the plants then 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.090
 that little bar that you see red when 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.830
 disappears entirely is that you have lost 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.530
 and how do you start this, you have to 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.810
 iu give and to start again for 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.269
 go withdrawing the level then you give here 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.730
 and here you have all the arrows here 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:37.679
 you have more in case you want without dates 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.999
 or without food and as today is being done 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:39.929
 at night and when it is doing 

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:41.910
 night that you will have to do 

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:44.460
 just come here to bed and 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.859
 sleep let's start but I'm going to 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.540
 wait for a little day 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:52.000
 well I'm going to start 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.350
 let's start Libya to give and as you see 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.220
 to go see now they are going to appear 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.960
 zombies that are going to try to get to 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.060
 our our house I'll let 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.430
 some are arriving especially for 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.199
 so that you can see how the 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.540
 bar because it's pretty enough 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.510
 cool and this map has been quite 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.990
 time what happens I'm going to do 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.990
 little and I said others ask to upload it to the channel 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.720
 that can be cool to play and as you see 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.220
 it is already coming to one you look like 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.830
 lowering the bar as they arrive 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.910

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.650

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.160
 very cool playing with friends playing 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.190
 with more people like this can be more 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.440
 entertaining and let's go killing this and 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.880
 others are coming in enough I'm 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.130
 realizing 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:44.200

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.980

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.180

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:53.720
 we're going to give that we're going to run 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:02:00.020
 come on I do not give it or what I fall 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:01.520
 and your coffee king changing as you see 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.410
 lowering the bar little by little and what 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.250
 I was telling you our planet is about 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:10.210
 how many now and we go to that pretty 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.830
 come sometimes has been 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.830
 he felt as if he wanted a spider 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.450
 Come on and I said it is pretty cool 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.370
 what are you going to have in the description in case 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.440
 you want to try it and if what you like 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.720
 this type of minigames so 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.750
 I will try to look for more because I know there 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.120
 others more 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:35.170
 run body is very little for us 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.280
 kill so let's go kill these 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.950
 5 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.810
 here is going to sound a music of those that 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.430
 we have lost is that it has sounded a 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.600
 music I do not know if you have heard the 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.330
 video 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.160
 in the video but it is heard as well as tim 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.830
 no or no and that is that we have lost and 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.959
 Now, as you can see, it is recovering 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.080
 slowly or if you want you will still 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.090
 here and it will be recovering every time 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.980
 that is going is recovering a 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.930
 little more and so you can do more 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.790
 fast and as I said if you want that 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.150
 be by day you will simply have here 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.060
 you finish and when you wake up like 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.650
 well you will know it is daytime and you will say yes 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.080
 but they are going to burn the zombies and 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.600
 but that's why the water issue is 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.100
 so that they go down and so that they do not 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.900
 go burn and you can play 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.209
 also of the day and be much better 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.040
 so what I said, I hope that I have 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.880
 liked to leave it and if you want it to rise 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.739

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.239
