00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
talk about spirit walk which in my

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.559 
talk about spirit walk which in my
opinion<00:00:05.279> is<00:00:05.670> one<00:00:05.850> of<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.029> two<00:00:06.240> strongest

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
opinion is one of the two strongest

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.530 
opinion is one of the two strongest
skills<00:00:07.170> available<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.069> witch<00:00:08.189> doctor<00:00:08.540> the

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
skills available to the witch doctor the

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.290 
skills available to the witch doctor the
other<00:00:09.660> one<00:00:09.809> being<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.050> gargantuan<00:00:10.500> so<00:00:11.429> what

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
other one being the gargantuan so what

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.999 
other one being the gargantuan so what
would<00:00:12.540> what<00:00:12.990> spirit<00:00:13.349> walked<00:00:13.530> allows<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:13.920> to

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
would what spirit walked allows you to

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.000 
would what spirit walked allows you to
do<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.420> basically<00:00:15.420> it's<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.410> same<00:00:16.770> type<00:00:16.980> of

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
do is basically it's the same type of

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.150 
do is basically it's the same type of
skill<00:00:17.460> as<00:00:17.699> lingering<00:00:18.630> fog<00:00:18.859> which<00:00:19.859> is

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
skill as lingering fog which is

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.830 
skill as lingering fog which is
extremely<00:00:20.699> well<00:00:21.029> known<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.510> Diablo

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
extremely well known in the Diablo

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.290 
extremely well known in the Diablo
community<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:23.340> strongest<00:00:23.730> immunity

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
community is the strongest immunity

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.720 
community is the strongest immunity
skill<00:00:24.570> well<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.500> think<00:00:25.560> spirit<00:00:25.980> walk<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.340> just

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
skill well I think spirit walk is just

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.540 
skill well I think spirit walk is just
as<00:00:26.849> effective<00:00:26.970> if<00:00:27.480> not<00:00:27.689> more<00:00:27.900> effective

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
as effective if not more effective

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.679 
as effective if not more effective
because<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.880> fact<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.330> lasts<00:00:30.510> for

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
because of the fact that it lasts for

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.069 
because of the fact that it lasts for
two<00:00:30.810> seconds<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:33.149> essentially<00:00:33.719> allows

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
two seconds and so it essentially allows

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.760 
two seconds and so it essentially allows
you<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.350> be<00:00:34.469> immune<00:00:34.860> for<00:00:35.670> two<00:00:36.239> seconds<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.989> get

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
you to be immune for two seconds and get

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.840 
you to be immune for two seconds and get
rid<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.010> any<00:00:38.160> trouble<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.360> need<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
rid of any trouble that you you need to

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.030 
rid of any trouble that you you need to
while<00:00:41.930> also<00:00:42.930> increasing<00:00:43.260> your<00:00:43.649> movement

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
while also increasing your movement

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.670 
while also increasing your movement
speed<00:00:44.070> now<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.360> perfect<00:00:46.020> example<00:00:46.170> of

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
speed now this is the perfect example of

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.090 
speed now this is the perfect example of
when<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.520> want<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.789> use<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:47.969> spell<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:49.100> not

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
when you want to use that spell is not

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.450 
when you want to use that spell is not
only<00:00:50.340> does<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.550> allow<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:52.190> get<00:00:53.190> away<00:00:53.309> from

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
only does it allow you to get away from

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.910 
only does it allow you to get away from
them<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.870> if<00:00:55.050> any<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.289> them<00:00:55.440> are<00:00:55.559> about<00:00:55.800> to

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
them but if any of them are about to

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.010 
them but if any of them are about to
explode<00:00:56.309> then<00:00:56.850> at<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.449> same<00:00:57.480> time<00:00:57.809> you're

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
explode then at the same time you're

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.140 
explode then at the same time you're
able<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:59.480> ignore<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.719> damage

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.320 

and<00:01:05.800> so<00:01:06.800> let's<00:01:07.220> take<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.520> look<00:01:07.760> at<00:01:07.880> Beaver<00:01:08.300> and

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
and so let's take a look at Beaver and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.000 
and so let's take a look at Beaver and
choices<00:01:08.660> the<00:01:08.960> first<00:01:09.170> turn<00:01:09.320> choice<00:01:09.530> is<00:01:09.740> John

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
choices the first turn choice is John

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.550 
choices the first turn choice is John
which<00:01:10.820> is<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:11.180> most<00:01:11.390> popular<00:01:11.840> ruin<00:01:12.080> choice<00:01:12.290> as

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
which is the most popular ruin choice as

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.990 
which is the most popular ruin choice as
it<00:01:13.220> allows<00:01:13.460> for<00:01:13.490> three<00:01:14.030> seconds<00:01:14.480> of<00:01:16.000> immunity

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
it allows for three seconds of immunity

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.620 
it allows for three seconds of immunity
rather<00:01:17.300> than<00:01:17.540> just<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.140> normal<00:01:18.410> too<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:19.630> for

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
rather than just the normal too so for

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.990 
rather than just the normal too so for
the<00:01:20.720> three<00:01:20.930> seconds<00:01:21.470> you<00:01:21.950> can<00:01:22.130> just<00:01:22.520> run

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
the three seconds you can just run

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.930 
the three seconds you can just run
around<00:01:23.180> in<00:01:23.420> circles<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:24.400> not<00:01:25.400> really<00:01:25.640> have<00:01:25.820> to

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
around in circles and not really have to

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.410 
around in circles and not really have to
worry<00:01:26.090> about<00:01:26.240> too<00:01:26.479> much<00:01:26.979> so<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.820> mean<00:01:29.120> time

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
worry about too much so the mean time

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.510 
worry about too much so the mean time
that<00:01:30.200> I<00:01:30.229> utilize<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:30.890> skill<00:01:31.130> i<00:01:31.250> use<00:01:31.370> it<00:01:31.490> for

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
that I utilize the skill i use it for

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.940 
that I utilize the skill i use it for
two<00:01:31.880> reasons<00:01:32.120> the<00:01:32.690> first<00:01:32.960> was<00:01:34.450> in<00:01:35.740> order<00:01:36.740> for

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
two reasons the first was in order for

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.660 
two reasons the first was in order for
survivability<00:01:37.430> if<00:01:38.800> I'm<00:01:39.800> dealing<00:01:40.430> with<00:01:40.550> the

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
survivability if I'm dealing with the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.840 
survivability if I'm dealing with the
situation<00:01:40.880> like<00:01:41.450> this<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:42.020> I<00:01:43.009> need<00:01:43.220> to<00:01:43.400> to

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
situation like this and I need to to

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.660 
situation like this and I need to to
just<00:01:43.880> get<00:01:44.210> away<00:01:44.240> from<00:01:44.450> them<00:01:45.130> then<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.520> allows

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
just get away from them then it allows

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.820 
just get away from them then it allows
me<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:47.090> do<00:01:47.210> that<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:48.080> other<00:01:48.259> thing<00:01:48.590> that<00:01:48.619> I'll

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
me to do that the other thing that I'll

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.280 
me to do that the other thing that I'll
use<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:49.160> for<00:01:49.400> is<00:01:49.660> if<00:01:50.660> we're<00:01:50.960> dealing

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
use it for is if we're dealing

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.730 
use it for is if we're dealing
specifically<00:01:51.860> with<00:01:51.979> an<00:01:52.250> elite<00:01:52.490> pack<00:01:53.170> then<00:01:54.170> if

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
specifically with an elite pack then if

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.100 
specifically with an elite pack then if
I<00:01:54.950> see<00:01:55.100> a<00:01:55.130> helpful<00:01:55.369> Obon<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:55.880> ground<00:01:56.149> then

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
I see a helpful Obon the ground then

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.670 
I see a helpful Obon the ground then
what<00:01:57.350> I'll<00:01:57.440> do<00:01:57.590> is<00:01:57.800> I'll<00:01:58.990> initiate<00:01:59.990> spirit

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
what I'll do is I'll initiate spirit

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.530 
what I'll do is I'll initiate spirit
walk<00:02:00.860> just<00:02:01.100> like<00:02:01.220> this<00:02:01.550> grab<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.390> health

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
walk just like this grab the health

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.130 
walk just like this grab the health
globes<00:02:02.899> and<00:02:03.140> then<00:02:03.830> come<00:02:04.040> back<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:04.509> so<00:02:05.509> that's

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
globes and then come back and so that's

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.290 
globes and then come back and so that's
the<00:02:06.440> other<00:02:06.700> big<00:02:07.700> use<00:02:08.000> that<00:02:08.240> I<00:02:08.270> find<00:02:08.630> for<00:02:10.300> spirit

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
the other big use that I find for spirit

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:23.750 
the other big use that I find for spirit
walk

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.330 

so<00:02:24.360> overall<00:02:24.750> like<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.379> said<00:02:25.650> this<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:26.069> an

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
so overall like I said this is an

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.399 
so overall like I said this is an
ability<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.299> think<00:02:27.569> ever<00:02:27.750> which<00:02:28.049> doctor

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
ability that I think ever which doctor

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.880 
ability that I think ever which doctor
needs<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.769> have<00:02:28.950> its<00:02:29.390> a<00:02:30.390> mandatory<00:02:31.260> skill<00:02:31.739> if

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
needs to have its a mandatory skill if

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.890 
needs to have its a mandatory skill if
you're<00:02:32.010> playing<00:02:32.220> hardcore<00:02:32.640> but<00:02:33.510> even<00:02:33.810> in

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
you're playing hardcore but even in

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.080 
you're playing hardcore but even in
softcore<00:02:34.110> there's<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:34.709> many<00:02:34.829> uses<00:02:35.099> for<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.610> but

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
softcore there's so many uses for it but

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.300 
softcore there's so many uses for it but
I<00:02:36.120> think<00:02:36.480> you're<00:02:36.659> crazy<00:02:36.930> if<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.290> decide<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:37.950> to

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
I think you're crazy if you decide to to

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.740 
I think you're crazy if you decide to to
go<00:02:38.459> with<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:38.700> belt<00:02:38.939> leather<00:02:39.060> room<00:02:39.420> this<00:02:39.540> one

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
go with this belt leather room this one

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.110 
go with this belt leather room this one
on<00:02:39.870> your<00:02:40.079> on<00:02:40.319> your<00:02:40.379> toolbar<00:02:43.819> let's<00:02:44.819> go<00:02:44.940> back<00:02:45.090> to

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
on your on your toolbar let's go back to

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.520 
on your on your toolbar let's go back to
tell<00:02:45.450> them<00:02:45.599> we<00:02:45.750> will<00:02:45.840> check<00:02:46.019> out<00:02:46.170> some<00:02:46.379> of<00:02:46.409> the

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
tell them we will check out some of the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.030 
tell them we will check out some of the
other<00:02:46.680> rooms<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:52.200> an<00:02:52.349> extra<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.799> honored

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
other rooms so an extra and honored

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.589 
other rooms so an extra and honored
guest<00:02:53.310> increases<00:02:54.090> your<00:02:54.209> mana<00:02:54.420> regeneration

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
guest increases your mana regeneration

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.530 
guest increases your mana regeneration
so<00:02:55.530> if<00:02:55.829> you<00:02:56.069> have<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.340> man<00:02:56.790> intensive<00:02:57.299> build

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
so if you have a man intensive build

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.849 
so if you have a man intensive build
then<00:02:58.379> again<00:02:58.890> another<00:02:59.489> incredible<00:03:00.209> skill<00:03:00.859> let

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
then again another incredible skill let

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:07.039 
then again another incredible skill let
me<00:03:01.980> empty<00:03:02.159> at<00:03:02.430> my<00:03:02.579> mana<00:03:02.849> pool<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:05.780> so<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:06.870> can

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
me empty at my mana pool and so you can

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.140 
me empty at my mana pool and so you can
see<00:03:07.230> what<00:03:07.379> my<00:03:07.530> normal<00:03:07.889> mana<00:03:08.220> regeneration<00:03:08.670> is

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
see what my normal mana regeneration is

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.250 
see what my normal mana regeneration is
like<00:03:09.739> well<00:03:10.739> one<00:03:11.129> casting<00:03:11.549> spirit<00:03:11.909> walk<00:03:12.260> you

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
like well one casting spirit walk you

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.860 
like well one casting spirit walk you
can<00:03:13.440> see<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.799> it<00:03:13.950> basically<00:03:14.720> doubles<00:03:15.720> or

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
can see that it basically doubles or

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.610 
can see that it basically doubles or
triples<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:17.370> again<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:18.150> great<00:03:18.690> skill<00:03:19.109> not

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
triples and so again a great skill not

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.190 
triples and so again a great skill not
only<00:03:19.889> do<00:03:20.069> you<00:03:20.129> get<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.400> de<00:03:21.239> spirit<00:03:21.629> walk<00:03:21.840> from

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
only do you get the de spirit walk from

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.160 
only do you get the de spirit walk from
the<00:03:23.069> safety<00:03:23.670> perspective<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.629> being<00:03:24.870> able<00:03:24.989> to

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
the safety perspective and being able to

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.220 
the safety perspective and being able to
get<00:03:25.290> in<00:03:25.440> trouble<00:03:25.829> but<00:03:26.459> at<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.700> same<00:03:26.879> time

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
get in trouble but at the same time

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.960 
get in trouble but at the same time
regenerates<00:03:28.310> there<00:03:29.310> be<00:03:29.430> presenting<00:03:29.849> your

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
regenerates there be presenting your

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.099 
regenerates there be presenting your
mana<00:03:30.150> pool<00:03:30.410> well<00:03:32.480> why<00:03:33.480> would<00:03:33.599> you<00:03:33.690> use<00:03:33.720> it

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
mana pool well why would you use it

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.890 
mana pool well why would you use it
because<00:03:34.889> as<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.250> as<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:36.000> indicated<00:03:36.449> it<00:03:36.720> lasts

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
because as it as I indicated it lasts

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.360 
because as it as I indicated it lasts
for<00:03:37.079> two<00:03:37.199> seconds<00:03:37.590> and<00:03:37.709> he<00:03:37.829> gained<00:03:37.980> fifteen

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
for two seconds and he gained fifteen

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.979 
for two seconds and he gained fifteen
percent<00:03:38.730> per<00:03:38.940> second<00:03:44.480> also<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.660> skills

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
percent per second also the skills

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.569 
percent per second also the skills
really<00:03:46.290> well<00:03:46.560> because<00:03:46.859> of<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.160> fact<00:03:47.400> that

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
really well because of the fact that

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.099 
really well because of the fact that
it's<00:03:48.590> percent<00:03:49.590> of<00:03:49.709> mana<00:03:49.949> rather<00:03:50.340> than<00:03:51.109> total

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
it's percent of mana rather than total

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.449 
it's percent of mana rather than total
mana<00:03:52.319> or<00:03:52.579> a<00:03:53.579> set<00:03:53.849> amount<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:54.209> mana<00:03:55.099> so<00:03:56.099> even<00:03:56.340> if

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
mana or a set amount of mana so even if

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.319 
mana or a set amount of mana so even if
you<00:03:56.579> have<00:03:56.819> a<00:03:56.900> thousand<00:03:57.900> manner<00:03:58.079> rather<00:03:58.379> than

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
you have a thousand manner rather than

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.939 
you have a thousand manner rather than
740<00:04:00.329> that<00:04:00.480> I've<00:04:00.569> got<00:04:00.810> it's<00:04:01.500> still<00:04:01.680> extremely

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949 
740 that I've got it's still extremely

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.160 
740 that I've got it's still extremely
beneficial

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.140 

okay<00:04:06.170> now<00:04:06.560> that<00:04:06.590> these<00:04:06.980> guys<00:04:07.189> are<00:04:07.250> done<00:04:07.579> the

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
okay now that these guys are done the

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.000 
okay now that these guys are done the
next<00:04:08.420> turn<00:04:08.629> choice<00:04:08.840> is<00:04:09.170> an<00:04:09.409> offensive<00:04:09.829> run

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
next turn choice is an offensive run

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:19.050 
next turn choice is an offensive run
choice<00:04:10.220> and<00:04:10.489> so<00:04:11.349> what<00:04:16.209> when<00:04:17.209> spirit<00:04:17.660> walk<00:04:17.840> ends

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
choice and so what when spirit walk ends

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.689 
choice and so what when spirit walk ends
then<00:04:20.060> it<00:04:21.039> deals<00:04:22.039> three<00:04:22.280> hundred<00:04:22.550> and<00:04:22.639> ten

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:22.699 
then it deals three hundred and ten

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:25.990 
then it deals three hundred and ten
percent<00:04:23.090> weapon<00:04:23.570> damage<00:04:23.690> to<00:04:24.110> an<00:04:24.229> area<00:04:25.000> close

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
percent weapon damage to an area close

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.610 
percent weapon damage to an area close
by<00:04:26.300> your<00:04:26.479> body<00:04:26.690> so<00:04:27.580> let's<00:04:29.110> find<00:04:30.110> somewhere

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
by your body so let's find somewhere

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:38.230 
by your body so let's find somewhere
where<00:04:30.860> there's<00:04:31.070> a<00:04:31.160> couple<00:04:31.310> enemies<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:36.940> so<00:04:37.940> as

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
where there's a couple enemies and so as

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.890 
where there's a couple enemies and so as
my<00:04:39.010> spirit<00:04:40.010> walk<00:04:40.160> ended<00:04:40.490> you<00:04:41.270> can<00:04:41.419> see<00:04:41.570> that<00:04:41.600> it

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
my spirit walk ended you can see that it

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.750 
my spirit walk ended you can see that it
did<00:04:42.080> a<00:04:42.110> fair<00:04:42.320> amount<00:04:42.350> of<00:04:42.560> damage<00:04:42.919> there<00:04:43.130> I'm

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
did a fair amount of damage there I'm

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.000 
did a fair amount of damage there I'm
not<00:04:44.060> a<00:04:44.120> fan<00:04:44.419> of<00:04:44.449> this<00:04:44.690> run<00:04:44.900> choice<00:04:45.139> because<00:04:45.830> as

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
not a fan of this run choice because as

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.980 
not a fan of this run choice because as
I<00:04:46.190> said<00:04:46.250> what<00:04:46.970> i<00:04:47.000> normally<00:04:47.120> use<00:04:47.479> this<00:04:47.720> for<00:04:47.960> is

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
I said what i normally use this for is

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.469 
I said what i normally use this for is
to<00:04:48.169> get<00:04:48.320> out<00:04:48.440> of<00:04:48.470> trouble<00:04:48.910> whereas<00:04:49.910> in<00:04:50.210> this

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
to get out of trouble whereas in this

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:54.310 
to get out of trouble whereas in this
case<00:04:50.740> spirit<00:04:51.740> walk<00:04:51.919> ends<00:04:52.810> while<00:04:53.810> you're<00:04:54.110> in

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
case spirit walk ends while you're in

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.500 
case spirit walk ends while you're in
the<00:04:54.680> middle<00:04:54.860> of<00:04:54.979> bowel<00:04:55.220> and<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:56.360> other

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
challenge or thing that I don't like

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.159 
challenge or thing that I don't like
about<00:04:58.220> it<00:04:58.520> is<00:04:58.880> if<00:04:59.539> you're<00:04:59.690> using<00:04:59.810> it<00:04:59.990> for

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
about it is if you're using it for

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.020 
about it is if you're using it for
offensive<00:05:00.560> purposes<00:05:00.590> if<00:05:01.250> you<00:05:01.370> actually<00:05:01.580> need

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
offensive purposes if you actually need

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.360 
offensive purposes if you actually need
it<00:05:02.060> for<00:05:02.449> defensive<00:05:02.900> purposes<00:05:02.930> it<00:05:03.919> may<00:05:04.099> be<00:05:04.160> on

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
it for defensive purposes it may be on

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.040 
it for defensive purposes it may be on
cooldown<00:05:04.720> so<00:05:06.130> it's<00:05:07.130> a<00:05:07.280> strong<00:05:07.550> skill<00:05:07.910> but<00:05:08.840> it's

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
cooldown so it's a strong skill but it's

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.330 
cooldown so it's a strong skill but it's
against<00:05:09.440> my<00:05:09.500> play<00:05:09.770> style<00:05:11.919> the<00:05:12.919> next<00:05:13.160> one<00:05:13.310> is

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
against my play style the next one is

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.580 
against my play style the next one is
another<00:05:13.699> offensive<00:05:14.180> run<00:05:14.419> severance<00:05:14.990> the

another offensive run severance the

another offensive run severance the
difference<00:05:15.919> between<00:05:16.130> this<00:05:16.280> one<00:05:16.430> and<00:05:16.490> the

difference between this one and the
other<00:05:16.699> one<00:05:16.880> is<00:05:17.270> this<00:05:18.020> one<00:05:18.370> you<00:05:19.370> can<00:05:19.400> use<00:05:19.760> for

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
other one is this one you can use for

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.980 
other one is this one you can use for
defensive<00:05:20.840> purposes<00:05:21.820> but<00:05:22.820> it<00:05:22.940> deals<00:05:23.120> 225

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
defensive purposes but it deals 225

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.879 
defensive purposes but it deals 225

weapon percent weapon damage per second

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.520 
weapon percent weapon damage per second
the<00:05:27.889> problem<00:05:28.820> with<00:05:29.030> this<00:05:29.330> if<00:05:30.080> you<00:05:30.289> want<00:05:30.470> to

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
the problem with this if you want to

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.510 
the problem with this if you want to
call<00:05:30.740> it<00:05:30.770> a<00:05:30.949> problem<00:05:31.220> is<00:05:31.690> that<00:05:32.770> the<00:05:33.770> skill<00:05:34.220> tix

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
call it a problem is that the skill tix

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.379 
call it a problem is that the skill tix
very<00:05:35.180> quickly<00:05:35.510> and<00:05:35.900> a<00:05:35.990> number<00:05:36.199> of<00:05:36.560> times<00:05:37.389> so

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
very quickly and a number of times so

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.969 
very quickly and a number of times so
you<00:05:38.770> need<00:05:39.770> to<00:05:40.099> be<00:05:41.020> basically<00:05:42.020> in<00:05:42.440> constant

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
you need to be basically in constant

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.330 
you need to be basically in constant
contact<00:05:43.220> in<00:05:43.729> order<00:05:44.389> to<00:05:44.780> deal<00:05:45.020> a<00:05:45.380> decent<00:05:46.250> amount

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
contact in order to deal a decent amount

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.939 
contact in order to deal a decent amount
of<00:05:46.550> damage<00:05:47.620> so<00:05:48.620> I<00:05:48.889> find<00:05:49.400> the<00:05:50.289> previous<00:05:51.289> room<00:05:51.590> a

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
of damage so I find the previous room a

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.430 
of damage so I find the previous room a
much<00:05:52.639> better<00:05:52.970> offensive<00:05:53.570> run<00:05:53.840> but<00:05:54.110> like<00:05:54.320> I

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
much better offensive run but like I

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.150 
much better offensive run but like I
said<00:05:54.500> the<00:05:54.860> only<00:05:54.979> advantage<00:05:55.490> to<00:05:55.849> this<00:05:56.000> one<00:05:56.270> is

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
said the only advantage to this one is

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.530 
said the only advantage to this one is
you<00:05:57.250> want<00:05:57.460> to<00:05:57.520> do<00:05:57.670> just<00:05:57.880> a<00:05:57.970> little<00:05:58.300> bit<00:05:58.420> of

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
you want to do just a little bit of

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.070 
you want to do just a little bit of
damage<00:05:58.800> while<00:05:59.800> going<00:06:00.790> in<00:06:01.060> and<00:06:01.240> out<00:06:01.330> like<00:06:01.630> this

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
damage while going in and out like this

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.640 
damage while going in and out like this
then<00:06:02.920> that<00:06:03.700> will<00:06:03.910> provide<00:06:04.300> some<00:06:05.140> damage

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
then that will provide some damage

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.410 
then that will provide some damage
without<00:06:06.220> being<00:06:06.610> in<00:06:06.730> the<00:06:06.820> middle<00:06:06.970> of<00:06:07.150> battle

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420 
without being in the middle of battle

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.540 
without being in the middle of battle
when<00:06:07.990> spirit<00:06:08.380> walk<00:06:08.530> ends<00:06:08.910> the<00:06:09.910> final<00:06:10.300> one<00:06:10.480> is

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
when spirit walk ends the final one is

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.280 
when spirit walk ends the final one is
the<00:06:12.550> healing<00:06:12.910> rune<00:06:13.150> associated<00:06:13.750> with<00:06:13.930> it<00:06:14.110> and

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
the healing rune associated with it and

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.000 
the healing rune associated with it and
so<00:06:14.890> healing<00:06:15.130> journey<00:06:15.490> heals<00:06:16.360> you<00:06:16.690> for<00:06:17.200> seven

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
so healing journey heals you for seven

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.030 
so healing journey heals you for seven
percent<00:06:18.460> of<00:06:18.640> your<00:06:19.180> life<00:06:19.480> per<00:06:19.930> second<00:06:20.380> so<00:06:20.890> it's

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 
percent of your life per second so it's

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.470 
percent of your life per second so it's
going<00:06:21.160> to<00:06:21.250> restore<00:06:21.580> fourteen<00:06:22.030> percent<00:06:22.210> of

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:22.480 
going to restore fourteen percent of

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.560 
going to restore fourteen percent of
your<00:06:22.570> life<00:06:22.780> as<00:06:23.050> a<00:06:23.110> result<00:06:23.800> of<00:06:23.980> of<00:06:24.910> using<00:06:25.390> this

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:25.570 
your life as a result of of using this

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.690 
your life as a result of of using this
and<00:06:25.840> so<00:06:26.440> if<00:06:26.530> you're<00:06:26.680> using<00:06:26.830> it<00:06:27.040> truly<00:06:27.370> for<00:06:27.610> the

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
and so if you're using it truly for the

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.500 
and so if you're using it truly for the
defensive<00:06:28.180> purposes<00:06:28.570> like<00:06:28.870> I<00:06:29.050> do<00:06:29.110> then<00:06:30.510> this

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510 
defensive purposes like I do then this

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.470 
defensive purposes like I do then this
is<00:06:31.720> a<00:06:31.750> great<00:06:32.410> run<00:06:32.590> choice<00:06:32.910> because<00:06:33.910> normally

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:34.480 
is a great run choice because normally

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.240 
is a great run choice because normally
when<00:06:35.200> you're<00:06:35.410> going<00:06:35.620> to<00:06:35.830> be<00:06:36.090> using<00:06:38.250> spirit

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
when you're going to be using spirit

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.300 
when you're going to be using spirit
walk<00:06:39.490> it's<00:06:40.860> because<00:06:41.860> you've<00:06:42.010> been

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
walk it's because you've been

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.460 
walk it's because you've been
encountering<00:06:42.970> a<00:06:43.090> tough<00:06:43.300> battle<00:06:43.510> you<00:06:44.200> may<00:06:44.380> have

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
encountering a tough battle you may have

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.550 
encountering a tough battle you may have
lost<00:06:44.680> life<00:06:45.840> but<00:06:46.840> there's<00:06:47.020> a<00:06:47.080> couple<00:06:47.380> of<00:06:47.470> other

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
lost life but there's a couple of other

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.780 
lost life but there's a couple of other
things<00:06:47.650> that<00:06:48.040> I<00:06:48.070> want<00:06:48.310> to<00:06:48.340> mention<00:06:48.400> really

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:48.790 
things that I want to mention really

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.960 
things that I want to mention really
quickly<00:06:49.170> as<00:06:50.170> far<00:06:50.470> as<00:06:50.620> when<00:06:50.890> healing<00:06:51.790> journey

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970 
quickly as far as when healing journey

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.990 
quickly as far as when healing journey
is<00:06:52.300> is<00:06:52.540> really<00:06:53.380> effective<00:06:53.800> against<00:06:54.190> reflects

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 
is is really effective against reflects

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.150 
is is really effective against reflects
damage<00:06:55.300> packs<00:06:55.570> so<00:06:56.440> not<00:06:56.650> only<00:06:56.680> are<00:06:56.950> you<00:06:57.070> not

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:03.730 
yourself the reflex damage could cause

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.000 
yourself the reflex damage could cause
you<00:07:04.000> to<00:07:04.030> end<00:07:04.480> your<00:07:04.720> your<00:07:05.410> spirit<00:07:05.830> walk
