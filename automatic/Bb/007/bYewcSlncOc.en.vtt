get<00:06:20.950> him<00:06:21.070> to<00:06:21.130> throw<00:06:21.400> it<00:06:21.700> and<00:06:21.850> it'd<00:06:22.240> be<00:06:22.419> an

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
get him to throw it and it'd be an

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.450 
get him to throw it and it'd be an
incomplete<00:06:23.080> pass<00:06:23.110> but<00:06:23.680> since<00:06:23.919> he<00:06:24.130> just<00:06:24.310> took

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
incomplete pass but since he just took

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.630 
incomplete pass but since he just took
the<00:06:24.610> sack<00:06:24.880> the<00:06:25.660> time<00:06:25.960> ran<00:06:26.320> out<00:06:26.350> and<00:06:26.830> that's<00:06:27.520> a

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
the sack the time ran out and that's a

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.900 
the sack the time ran out and that's a
