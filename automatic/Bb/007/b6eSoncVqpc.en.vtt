 Tranquility in the movie the intense movie is

 nekrif that serves to relax and forget 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.759

 of tranquility a thing that is 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.119
 impressive kant tension situations 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.590
 who noticed guinea in the audience when 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.409

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.310
 to the audience 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.470
 I was seeing that jesus says nervous 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.649
 and soon after they have concluded 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.399
 or for the own good for everybody 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.409
 concluded 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.930
 the good side could hear that noise 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.020
 that meet breathe of even relief 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.500
 jean time 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.299
 and when the situation develops in the 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.599
 that's a bad thing, you can see the 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.519
 q until Thursday gave birth football staff is 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.519
 impressive the film's staff is 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.830
 from the beginning to the end is a 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.739
 blockbuster is obviously a blockbuster 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.910
 but until then maybe it's better 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.140
 blockbuster of the year is world war z 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.750
 recommended the word that the movie 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.849
 can scares something that what 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.769
 had happened before starting a 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:36.760
 movie is that the movie he had cut 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.440
 some more violent scenes for agreement 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.049
 with the secretary to accept 13 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.750
 years and the film did not have to demonstrate 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.540
 violent scenes to be tense. 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.750
 director got where only sometimes a 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.840
 shaking the camera a little more or who 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.519
 with lusa leaves him in the darkest shadow 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.870
 we were able to take everything 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.239
 attention he needed without needing 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.549
 show nothing or wanted to show what 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.170
 was happening and did not show any 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.150
 it was understood that people knew that 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.670
 was happening there then when 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.319
 need to show that blood on the screen does not 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.959
 Needless to show blood was needed 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.819
 inspired by the screen or a scene more 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.220
 visceral for you to be tense in the 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.840
 movies go out on merits of the subway 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:22.120
 medical director of the staff who produced the 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:24.850
 movie is the word that kilt the port 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.430

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.910
 said highly recommended and world war 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.560
 z 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.750
 if you want an intense movie a blow 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.440
 low-grade first 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.660
 step 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.300
 I do not know that you are. 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.000
 Making my movie now runs out of 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.900
 according to computer and pool view
