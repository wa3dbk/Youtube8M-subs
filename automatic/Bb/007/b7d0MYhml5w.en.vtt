collection now they they can jump over a

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.510 
collection now they they can jump over a
block<00:00:36.510> height<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.900> one<00:00:37.170> which<00:00:37.950> makes<00:00:38.220> it<00:00:38.370> easy

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
block height of one which makes it easy

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.430 
block height of one which makes it easy
for<00:00:38.850> them<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.270> come<00:00:39.630> back<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.900> your<00:00:39.960> farm<00:00:40.230> but

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
also means they can escape if you just

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.090 
also means they can escape if you just
try<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:42.960> surround<00:00:43.200> them<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.650> a<00:00:43.680> one<00:00:43.950> block

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.700 
try and surround them in a one block
height<00:00:44.600> you<00:00:45.600> can<00:00:45.780> use<00:00:45.990> the<00:00:46.110> two<00:00:46.260> block<00:00:46.500> height

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
height you can use the two block height

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.710 
height you can use the two block height
of<00:00:46.890> dirt<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.520> put<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.700> door<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:47.940> but<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.450> prefer

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
of dirt and put a door in but I prefer

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.200 
of dirt and put a door in but I prefer
fences<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.670> because<00:00:50.670> that's<00:00:50.820> what<00:00:50.970> they've<00:00:51.120> put

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
fences a because that's what they've put

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.850 
fences a because that's what they've put
in<00:00:51.330> the<00:00:51.390> game<00:00:51.540> for<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.020> be<00:00:52.230> because<00:00:52.500> they<00:00:52.830> are

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
in the game for and be because they are

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.150 
in the game for and be because they are
a<00:00:53.340> block<00:00:53.670> height<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.000> 1.5<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:55.080> as<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.100> see

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
a block height of 1.5 and as you can see

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.710 
a block height of 1.5 and as you can see
the<00:00:56.460> player<00:00:56.670> can't<00:00:56.970> jump<00:00:57.210> over<00:00:57.300> them<00:00:57.570> either

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
the player can't jump over them either

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.070 
the player can't jump over them either
and<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.500> could<00:00:58.710> advance<00:00:58.920> gates<00:00:59.220> in<00:00:59.930> now<00:01:00.930> as

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
and you could advance gates in now as

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.320 
and you could advance gates in now as
you<00:01:01.110> can<00:01:01.290> see<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.650> have<00:01:02.040> a<00:01:02.310> number<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.760> color<00:01:03.000> of

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
you can see I have a number of color of

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:09.649 
you can see I have a number of color of
sheep<00:01:04.339> we<00:01:05.339> have<00:01:05.610> even<00:01:06.180> more<00:01:06.420> over<00:01:06.720> here<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:08.659> in

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
sheep we have even more over here and in

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.149 
sheep we have even more over here and in
order<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.990> change<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.500> color<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.950> sheep

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
order to change the color of a sheep

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.270 
order to change the color of a sheep
it's<00:01:11.759> reasonably<00:01:12.720> easy<00:01:13.259> if<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.439> go<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:14.009> the<00:01:14.100> red

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
it's reasonably easy if we go to the red

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.669 
it's reasonably easy if we go to the red
guys<00:01:14.490> over<00:01:14.789> here<00:01:15.469> and<00:01:16.999> use<00:01:17.999> orange<00:01:18.570> dye<00:01:18.869> and

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:19.679

guys over here and use orange dye and
simply<00:01:20.130> select<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.810> right<00:01:21.810> click<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.950> it

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
simply select that I right click and it

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.840 
simply select that I right click and it
changes<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.520> orange<00:01:25.399> right<00:01:26.399> click<00:01:26.579> on<00:01:26.729> him

changes to orange right click on him

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.249 
changes to orange right click on him
again<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.359> he<00:01:27.450> turns<00:01:27.659> back<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.079> red<00:01:29.929> now<00:01:30.929> when

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
again and he turns back to red now when

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.050 
again and he turns back to red now when
you<00:01:31.350> change<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.740> color<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.280> sheep<00:01:32.490> I'm<00:01:32.850> just

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
you change the color of a sheep I'm just

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.160 
you change the color of a sheep I'm just
going<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.270> go<00:01:33.359> up<00:01:33.420> here<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:33.659> it's<00:01:33.869> not<00:01:33.960> quite<00:01:34.020> so

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
going to go up here so it's not quite so

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.980 
going to go up here so it's not quite so
low<00:01:34.939> when<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.060> change<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.359> color<00:01:36.539> of<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.780> sheep

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
low when you change the color of a sheep

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.510 
low when you change the color of a sheep
it<00:01:37.170> will<00:01:37.350> stay<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.560> color<00:01:37.859> permanently

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
it will stay that color permanently

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.450 
it will stay that color permanently
however<00:01:39.389> if<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.749> want<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.170> breed<00:01:40.469> for<00:01:41.009> example

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
however if you want to breed for example

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.260 
however if you want to breed for example
a<00:01:41.700> green<00:01:42.299> sheep<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.020> can<00:01:43.289> mix<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:44.060> yellow<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.179> a

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
a green sheep you can mix a yellow and a

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.469 
a green sheep you can mix a yellow and a
blue<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.719> help<00:01:46.439> will<00:01:46.679> pop<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.100> green<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:48.359> it's

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
blue and help will pop the green so it's

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.679 
blue and help will pop the green so it's
kind<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.899> color<00:01:49.560> mixer<00:01:50.479> equally<00:01:51.479> a

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
kind of like a color mixer equally a

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.080 
kind of like a color mixer equally a
black<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.770> white<00:01:52.950> sheep<00:01:53.219> will<00:01:53.490> produce<00:01:53.700> a

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
black and a white sheep will produce a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.080 
black and a white sheep will produce a
gray<00:01:54.479> sheep<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.369> on<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.609> so<00:01:56.729> forth

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
gray sheep and so on and so forth

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.440 
gray sheep and so on and so forth
however<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:58.200> much<00:01:58.560> easier<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.280> to

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
however it's much easier just to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.300 
however it's much easier just to
surround<00:02:00.450> them<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> pen<00:02:00.959> and<00:02:01.380> apply<00:02:02.249> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
surround them in a pen and apply the

surround them in a pen and apply the
dikes<00:02:02.609> otherwise<00:02:03.119> you'd<00:02:03.299> be<00:02:03.329> dead<00:02:03.420> forever<00:02:03.920> as

dikes otherwise you'd be dead forever as
you<00:02:05.039> can<00:02:05.159> see<00:02:05.279> there's<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.579> small<00:02:05.789> path<00:02:05.999> between

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
you can see there's a small path between

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.980 
you can see there's a small path between
the<00:02:06.569> pens

this<00:02:07.979> isn't<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.490> for<00:02:08.610> convenience<00:02:09.090> for<00:02:09.270> me

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
this isn't just for convenience for me

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.340 
this isn't just for convenience for me
although<00:02:09.990> it's<00:02:10.200> quite<00:02:10.319> useful<00:02:10.880> as<00:02:11.880> you<00:02:12.750> breed

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
although it's quite useful as you breed

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.640 
although it's quite useful as you breed
them<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:15.120> lamb<00:02:15.300> is<00:02:15.330> born<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.990> can<00:02:16.319> pop

them and the lamb is born it can pop

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
and go into the next pen and of course

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.660 
and go into the next pen and of course
if<00:02:21.420> you're<00:02:21.660> mixing<00:02:22.200> colors<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:23.490> can<00:02:23.610> be

disastrous because if I had red and

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.520 
disastrous because if I had red and
white<00:02:26.550> together<00:02:26.880> for<00:02:27.090> example<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:27.780> there

white together for example and there

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.770 
white together for example and there
wasn't<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.920> gap<00:02:29.100> I'd<00:02:29.700> start<00:02:30.030> getting<00:02:30.180> the

why<00:02:34.320> do<00:02:34.380> we<00:02:34.530> have<00:02:34.710> them<00:02:34.890> in<00:02:35.280> survival<00:02:36.210> which<00:02:36.630> is

why do we have them in survival which is
what<00:02:37.020> I'm<00:02:37.140> in<00:02:37.460> explains<00:02:38.460> that<00:02:38.630> they<00:02:39.630> produce

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
what I'm in explains that they produce

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.810 
what I'm in explains that they produce
wool<00:02:40.110> if<00:02:40.740> you<00:02:40.920> right-click<00:02:41.130> on<00:02:41.430> them<00:02:41.550> they

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
wool if you right-click on them they

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.890 
wool if you right-click on them they
produce<00:02:41.970> one<00:02:42.330> two<00:02:42.480> three

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
produce one two three

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.920 
produce one two three
if<00:02:43.020> you<00:02:43.170> kill<00:02:43.380> them<00:02:43.590> those<00:02:44.220> reduce<00:02:44.930> between

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
if you kill them those reduce between

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.260 
if you kill them those reduce between
one<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.230> three<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.980> even<00:02:47.430> if<00:02:47.760> they<00:02:47.940> kill

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
one and three and even if they kill

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:56.300 
one and three and even if they kill
themselves<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.930> usually<00:02:49.110> get<00:02:49.470> one<00:02:55.310> just

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
themselves you usually get one just

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.480 
themselves you usually get one just
another<00:02:56.610> pair<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:56.940> shears<00:02:59.720> and<00:03:01.190> in<00:03:02.190> order<00:03:02.460> to

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
respawn their wool they have to be grass

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.950 
respawn their wool they have to be grass

wheat as we see in the game they eat

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.140 
wheat as we see in the game they eat
wheat<00:03:22.110> there's<00:03:22.980> one<00:03:23.160> just<00:03:23.370> regenerated<00:03:23.850> it's

wheat there's one just regenerated it's

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.690 
wheat there's one just regenerated it's
wood<00:03:24.710> and<00:03:25.710> this<00:03:25.860> is<00:03:26.010> how<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.190> get<00:03:26.370> them<00:03:26.520> back

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
wood and this is how you get them back

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.190 
wood and this is how you get them back
in<00:03:26.880> first<00:03:27.120> place<00:03:27.330> they<00:03:27.690> would<00:03:27.810> follow<00:03:27.960> you

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
in first place they would follow you

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.270 
in first place they would follow you
pretty<00:03:28.470> much<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:28.920> end<00:03:28.950> of<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.220> earth

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.460 
pretty much to the end of the earth
there's<00:03:29.640> limited<00:03:29.940> bit<00:03:30.240> equipped<00:03:30.600> if<00:03:31.320> you

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
there's limited bit equipped if you

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.050 
there's limited bit equipped if you
change<00:03:31.740> to<00:03:31.800> something<00:03:32.070> else<00:03:32.310> they're<00:03:33.030> just

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
change to something else they're just

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.610 
change to something else they're just
down<00:03:33.840> there<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:34.920> eventually<00:03:35.460> wander<00:03:36.000> off<00:03:36.120> and

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
down there and eventually wander off and

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.880 
down there and eventually wander off and
in<00:03:37.620> order<00:03:37.830> to<00:03:37.860> breed<00:03:38.280> them<00:03:39.380> you<00:03:40.380> select<00:03:40.710> to

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
in order to breed them you select to

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.140 
in order to breed them you select to
right-click<00:03:42.890> they<00:03:43.890> do<00:03:44.070> a<00:03:44.100> little<00:03:44.340> dance<00:03:44.580> and

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
right-click they do a little dance and

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.940 
right-click they do a little dance and
out<00:03:45.600> pops<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:46.110> sheep<00:03:46.500> of<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.710> correct<00:03:47.040> color

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.100 

so<00:03:51.950> again<00:03:52.250> if<00:03:52.490> you<00:03:52.640> wanted<00:03:52.940> a<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:55.810> say<00:03:56.810> a<00:03:56.840> light

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
so again if you wanted a a say a light

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.060 
so again if you wanted a a say a light
ring<00:03:57.520> you'd<00:03:58.520> get<00:03:58.790> a<00:03:58.820> dark<00:03:59.090> green<00:03:59.240> sheep<00:03:59.480> and

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
ring you'd get a dark green sheep and

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.890 
ring you'd get a dark green sheep and
sheep<00:04:01.070> and<00:04:01.400> break<00:04:02.180> them<00:04:02.300> together<00:04:02.450> but<00:04:02.810> again

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
sheep and break them together but again

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.580 
sheep and break them together but again
this<00:04:03.680> is<00:04:03.890> a<00:04:04.100> very<00:04:04.700> slow<00:04:05.030> way<00:04:05.180> of<00:04:05.270> doing<00:04:05.510> it<00:04:05.660> as

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
this is a very slow way of doing it as

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.950 
this is a very slow way of doing it as
you<00:04:06.770> can<00:04:06.920> see<00:04:07.100> on<00:04:07.370> this<00:04:07.520> server<00:04:07.850> it's<00:04:08.330> not<00:04:08.570> the

you can see on this server it's not the
