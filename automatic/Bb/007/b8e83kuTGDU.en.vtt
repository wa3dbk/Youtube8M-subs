left a safe environment to do the

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:04.919 
maximum effect it's not only for safety

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:08.629 
maximum effect it's not only for safety
it<00:06:05.279> also<00:06:05.489> gives<00:06:05.819> the<00:06:05.969> lift<00:06:07.639> psychological

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
it also gives the lift psychological

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:11.059 
it also gives the lift psychological
boost<00:06:08.879> knowing<00:06:09.659> that<00:06:10.110> there<00:06:10.289> is<00:06:10.379> a<00:06:10.409> safety<00:06:10.739> net

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:11.069 
boost knowing that there is a safety net

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:15.319 
boost knowing that there is a safety net
and<00:06:11.509> I<00:06:12.509> think<00:06:13.019> that<00:06:13.349> with<00:06:14.309> that<00:06:14.909> in<00:06:15.089> mind

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:15.329 
and I think that with that in mind

00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:20.179 
and I think that with that in mind
people<00:06:16.319> can<00:06:17.689> get<00:06:18.689> one<00:06:18.989> or<00:06:19.139> two<00:06:19.349> more<00:06:19.649> reps<00:06:19.919> in

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:20.189 
people can get one or two more reps in

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:21.829 
people can get one or two more reps in
that<00:06:20.519> they<00:06:20.639> normally<00:06:20.819> would<00:06:21.209> do<00:06:21.389> and

00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:21.839 
that they normally would do and

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:25.719 
that they normally would do and
definitely<00:06:22.379> avoid<00:06:22.819> can<00:06:23.819> improve<00:06:24.269> their

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:25.729 
definitely avoid can improve their

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:37.620 
definitely avoid can improve their
maximum<00:06:26.729> RAM<00:06:26.939> so<00:06:27.269> that<00:06:27.649> a<00:06:28.649> nice

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.690
