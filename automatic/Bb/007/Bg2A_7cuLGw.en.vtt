00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.330
 no I don't know how to do it like we do 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:29.330
 he is a friend said he is waiting for me 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:57.660
 sent by e-mail 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.940
 cs baragallo today we are on wolf is true 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.520
 we are on modern warfare for like before 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.710
 what of course I apologize for given 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.439
 that I almost never tell my parents 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.180
 video but nothing this time if I have to 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.369
 to tell the truth did not make videos for 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.010
 those four five days which is strange 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.659
 because we said type one 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.640
 week ago shopping carts still sought 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.049
 to maintain a certain constancy la 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.360
 week later one more by uploading it 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.610
 nothing but that is due to the fact that mine 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.729
 mother was sick is still hurting and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.369
 so she then stayed at home and I don't know if 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.619
 you know but I never register the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.780
 my mother at home the strange thing is that 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.549
 it's just the register and I wouldn't want that 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.380
 a video name appeared that didn't make it 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.659
 I do there is a thing of my own and like like 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.899
 player in a video two days ago 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.820
 when someone enters the room while 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.979
 is recording when someone you to 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.570
 surely directors is more or less like 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.610
 when any of the tools you are 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.680
 making a saw making videos is one thing 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.300
 so personal is not like 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.220
 when public that is beautiful beautiful 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:02.400
 everyone invited 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.960
 bassano like that in malaga e 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.790
 he probably could n't record 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.039
 even if there was someone next to 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.660
 me in fact on the channel should still 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.160
 be if they were deleted because the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.290
 of the obscene I had made a video a 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.360
 day with my classmate was 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.000
 only a comment to make is the thing 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.000
 simpler than a youtuber could 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.810
 wide as verbs are missing verbs too 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.150
 the night really a very simple thing 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.810
 they deal with mental yet you are left of 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.690
 like an hour trying to talk 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.550
 without laughing everywhere saying something 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:42.420
 sensible I didn't remember so funny 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:44.160
 season to type the video looks like for you 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.410
 however, there is normal when I talk to 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.840
 this is normal, but you think 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.970
 to someone who puts the door more 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.860
 and it concerns me only talks about it 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.750
 simply when sclero in front of the 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.380
 television that is quite ugly from 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.480
 see also why you 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.130
 But you can see me at a window ea 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.910
 shutters closed twenty-four hours up 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.620
 twenty-four 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.360
 and you imagine that someone is me 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.940
 look right from there on while me 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.860
 I'm talking to with the computer is a 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.060
 obscene thing to avoid these 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.060
 misunderstandings 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.620
 let's say I do video shutter closed 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.080
 and especially when there is no one in 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.600
 home the boys and this was mine 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.110
 first goal is the first true because me 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.000
 I played modern warfare 2 for the first time 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.160
 but his moves further in private at home 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.560
 of a friend then all those in the classroom 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.510
 with me they bought the cops 1 when 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.340
 still playing was not considered a thing 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.020
 from losers or I bought I had three 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.970
 along with another friend I have it with 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.280
 good kind all but my neighbors have 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.530
 they give like sick people and we have fun 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.450
 like crazy especially looking at 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.430
 we were really na video 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.930
 they all do random things like me 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.790
 remembered that they never called me that 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.790
 people could do pig instead 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.560
 pigs from that moment I 'm not closed 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.480
 and until I learned to whom 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:05.530
 now he knows how to do more or less well 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:07.750
 what kind they have to learn to make pork 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.060
 I can't write private mail and I do 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.690
 never a tutorial on this part from 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.020
 lincoln 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:17.020
 if this property I say immediately local 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.150
 probably the manga channel called a 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.730
 what colors you winners of the salle 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.760
 this is grateful because it is recommended 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.310
 and aliens because it is like a robe has 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.620
 made from the gameplay then maybe you will see it 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.620
 even now 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.090
 another a deal with him for a year 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.479
 so obviously I lost the channel 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.479
 brega
