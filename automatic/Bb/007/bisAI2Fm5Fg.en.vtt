there's my friend going off in the
background<00:01:13.409> turn<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.040> down<00:01:14.159> real<00:01:14.310> quick<00:01:14.490> but

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
background turn that down real quick but

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.340 
background turn that down real quick but
um<00:01:15.180> yeah<00:01:15.540> we<00:01:15.630> start<00:01:15.840> off<00:01:15.900> really<00:01:16.110> brightly

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
um yeah we start off really brightly

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.050 
um yeah we start off really brightly
creating<00:01:16.770> chances<00:01:16.979> early<00:01:17.189> on<00:01:17.490> Scott<00:01:17.850> getting

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
creating chances early on Scott getting

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.719 
creating chances early on Scott getting
the<00:01:18.659> better<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.860> two<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.070> think<00:01:20.189> gisle

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the better of the two I think gisle

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.390 
the better of the two I think gisle
they're<00:01:20.909> getting<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.360> shot<00:01:21.600> off<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.100> saved<00:01:23.100> and

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
they're getting a shot off and saved and

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.520 
they're getting a shot off and saved and
there<00:01:23.939> weren't<00:01:24.060> many<00:01:24.600> chances<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.320> first

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
there weren't many chances in that first

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.929 
there weren't many chances in that first
half<00:01:25.710> Young<00:01:25.979> was<00:01:26.159> obviously<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.549> really<00:01:26.700> strong

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
half Young was obviously a really strong

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.700 
half Young was obviously a really strong
side<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.420> lot<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.780> possession<00:01:28.229> football<00:01:28.530> going

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
side a lot of possession football going

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.080 
side a lot of possession football going
on<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.040> game<00:01:29.250> but<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.790> second<00:01:30.060> half

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
on in this game but in the second half

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.429 
on in this game but in the second half
they<00:01:30.299> kind<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.630> take<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> lead<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:31.290> their

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
they kind of take the lead with their
