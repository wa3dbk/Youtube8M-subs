00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
coffee and I've got a bit of range here

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.410 
coffee and I've got a bit of range here
for<00:00:33.470> some<00:00:33.650> strange<00:00:33.890> reason<00:00:34.040> so<00:00:36.820> yeah<00:00:37.820> okay

for some strange reason so yeah okay
well<00:00:38.600> we've<00:00:39.079> pulled<00:00:39.440> them<00:00:39.590> out<00:00:39.680> again<00:00:39.829> haven't

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
well we've pulled them out again haven't

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.040 
well we've pulled them out again haven't
cleaned<00:00:40.550> it<00:00:40.700> up<00:00:40.760> Sarah<00:00:41.059> yet<00:00:41.300> but<00:00:41.450> had<00:00:41.870> a<00:00:41.899> good

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
cleaned it up Sarah yet but had a good

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.770 
cleaned it up Sarah yet but had a good
look<00:00:42.170> at<00:00:42.289> it<00:00:42.379> and<00:00:42.829> then<00:00:43.100> I<00:00:43.280> watched<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:44.030> video

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
look at it and then I watched the video

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.299 
look at it and then I watched the video
over<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:45.170> last<00:00:45.289> time<00:00:45.500> with<00:00:45.649> a<00:00:45.680> glance<00:00:45.950> smoke

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
over the last time with a glance smoke

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.819 
over the last time with a glance smoke
all<00:00:46.460> over<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.670> place<00:00:46.940> and<00:00:47.469> we're<00:00:48.469> lucky<00:00:48.649> we

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
all over the place and we're lucky we

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.400 
all over the place and we're lucky we
found<00:00:49.100> a<00:00:49.190> reason<00:00:49.520> for<00:00:49.670> it<00:00:49.789> the<00:00:50.110> the<00:00:51.110> ring<00:00:51.289> in

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
found a reason for it the the ring in

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.590 
found a reason for it the the ring in
number<00:00:51.620> two<00:00:51.800> piston<00:00:52.219> fisherman<00:00:53.059> was<00:00:53.210> gone<00:00:53.420> and

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
number two piston fisherman was gone and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.729 
number two piston fisherman was gone and
that<00:00:53.660> was<00:00:53.719> causing<00:00:54.110> with<00:00:54.289> a<00:00:54.320> blower<00:00:54.559> oil

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
that was causing with a blower oil

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.520 
that was causing with a blower oil
everything<00:00:55.180> so<00:00:56.180> did<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.930> did<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:57.230> ring

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
everything so did the did the ring

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.490 
everything so did the did the ring
actually<00:00:58.149> get<00:00:59.149> to<00:00:59.359> did<00:00:59.660> it<00:00:59.780> break<00:00:59.989> or<00:01:00.260> did<00:01:00.469> it

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
actually get to did it break or did it

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.439 
actually get to did it break or did it
just<00:01:00.620> sort<00:01:00.980> of<00:01:01.100> lose<00:01:01.309> tension<00:01:01.609> no<00:01:02.090> now<00:01:02.300> is

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
just sort of lose tension no now is

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.930 
just sort of lose tension no now is
broken<00:01:02.690> in<00:01:02.899> about<00:01:03.109> six<00:01:03.530> pieces<00:01:03.800> but<00:01:04.610> it<00:01:04.790> had

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
broken in about six pieces but it had

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.310 
broken in about six pieces but it had
wanted<00:01:05.120> to<00:01:05.390> be<00:01:05.480> flapping<00:01:05.750> around<00:01:05.930> for<00:01:06.140> quite

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
wanted to be flapping around for quite

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.860 
wanted to be flapping around for quite
some<00:01:06.530> time<00:01:06.560> pumping<00:01:07.280> oil<00:01:07.370> and<00:01:07.700> it's<00:01:08.300> worn<00:01:08.630> to<00:01:08.840> a

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
some time pumping oil and it's worn to a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.500 
some time pumping oil and it's worn to a
probably<00:01:09.290> you<00:01:09.350> half<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:09.710> mil<00:01:09.890> thick<00:01:10.190> it's<00:01:10.850> one

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
probably you half a mil thick it's one

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.540 
probably you half a mil thick it's one
of<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:11.660> most<00:01:11.920> one-stop<00:01:12.920> rings<00:01:13.160> I've<00:01:13.310> ever

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
of the most one-stop rings I've ever

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.780 
of the most one-stop rings I've ever
seen<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:13.970> it's<00:01:14.120> damaged<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:14.750> piston<00:01:15.670> but<00:01:16.670> as

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
seen and it's damaged the piston but as

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.370 
seen and it's damaged the piston but as
you<00:01:16.940> know<00:01:17.060> sometimes<00:01:17.390> they<00:01:17.690> got<00:01:17.900> beside<00:01:18.230> the

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
you know sometimes they got beside the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.750 
you know sometimes they got beside the
fisherman<00:01:18.770> reckless<00:01:19.130> on<00:01:19.310> there<00:01:19.490> but<00:01:19.610> there's

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
fisherman reckless on there but there's

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.070 
fisherman reckless on there but there's
been<00:01:19.880> no<00:01:20.030> damage<00:01:20.210> like<00:01:20.600> that<00:01:20.780> at<00:01:20.900> all

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
been no damage like that at all

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.690 
been no damage like that at all
thankfully<00:01:23.050> it<00:01:24.050> did<00:01:24.400> us<00:01:25.400> through<00:01:26.530> probably

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
thankfully it did us through probably

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.280 
thankfully it did us through probably
1400<00:01:28.700> k's<00:01:28.940> after<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.540> started<00:01:29.900> running<00:01:30.050> on

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
1400 k's after it started running on

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.290 
1400 k's after it started running on
three<00:01:30.530> cylinders<00:01:30.710> it<00:01:31.700> looks<00:01:31.880> a<00:01:31.970> bit<00:01:32.000> like<00:01:32.150> that

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
three cylinders it looks a bit like that

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.050 
three cylinders it looks a bit like that
but<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.170> Rings<00:01:33.410> John<00:01:33.920> on<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.160> other<00:01:34.610> Pistons

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
but the Rings John on the other Pistons

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.180 
but the Rings John on the other Pistons
are<00:01:35.210> top<00:01:35.390> rings<00:01:35.630> are<00:01:35.840> very<00:01:36.110> very<00:01:36.380> worn<00:01:36.710> side<00:01:36.980> on

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
are top rings are very very worn side on

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.430 
are top rings are very very worn side on
which<00:01:37.370> to<00:01:37.880> me<00:01:38.030> indicates<00:01:38.540> a<00:01:38.750> lot<00:01:39.050> of<00:01:39.170> dirt<00:01:39.410> in

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
which to me indicates a lot of dirt in

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.740 
which to me indicates a lot of dirt in
the<00:01:39.650> motor<00:01:39.950> in<00:01:40.190> the<00:01:40.310> early<00:01:40.580> stages<00:01:40.850> that<00:01:41.600> the

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
the motor in the early stages that the

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.360 
the motor in the early stages that the
Rings<00:01:41.960> if<00:01:42.440> they've<00:01:42.680> got<00:01:42.860> dirty<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:43.310> I'm

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
Rings if they've got dirty and I'm

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.010 
Rings if they've got dirty and I'm
generally<00:01:43.730> a<00:01:43.760> bit<00:01:43.940> method<00:01:44.360> on<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.660> outside

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
generally a bit method on the outside

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.540 
generally a bit method on the outside
but<00:01:45.170> these<00:01:45.350> are<00:01:45.500> now<00:01:45.590> shiny<00:01:45.920> which<00:01:46.160> makes<00:01:46.400> me

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
but these are now shiny which makes me

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.700 
but these are now shiny which makes me
think<00:01:46.790> that<00:01:46.820> recently<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:48.080> maintenance<00:01:48.500> has

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
think that recently the maintenance has

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.520 
think that recently the maintenance has
been<00:01:48.740> better<00:01:49.190> than<00:01:49.550> what<00:01:49.730> it<00:01:49.760> was<00:01:49.850> earlier<00:01:50.530> you

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
been better than what it was earlier you

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.680 
been better than what it was earlier you
know<00:01:51.680> that's<00:01:52.220> that's<00:01:52.520> amazing<00:01:52.880> out<00:01:53.300> because

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
know that's that's amazing out because

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.610 
know that's that's amazing out because
I've<00:01:54.590> always<00:01:55.190> thought<00:01:55.990> most<00:01:56.990> of<00:01:57.230> the<00:01:57.290> damage

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
I've always thought most of the damage

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.810 
I've always thought most of the damage
happened<00:01:57.980> to<00:01:58.040> this<00:01:58.160> motor

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
happened to this motor

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.970 
happened to this motor
when<00:01:59.180> I<00:01:59.210> first<00:01:59.450> fitted<00:01:59.900> at<00:02:00.020> about<00:02:00.290> ten<00:02:00.590> eleven

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
when I first fitted at about ten eleven

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.860 
when I first fitted at about ten eleven
years<00:02:01.010> ago<00:02:01.400> because<00:02:01.670> I<00:02:01.790> did<00:02:01.940> a<00:02:01.970> crit<00:02:02.270> a<00:02:02.300> trip

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
years ago because I did a crit a trip

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.260 
years ago because I did a crit a trip
across<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.200> Simpson<00:02:03.830> with<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:04.670> busted<00:02:05.120> air

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
across the Simpson with a busted air

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.070 
across the Simpson with a busted air
tube<00:02:05.570> so<00:02:06.080> if<00:02:06.500> it's<00:02:07.310> sucked<00:02:07.610> 500<00:02:08.330> case<00:02:08.569> worth<00:02:08.840> of

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
tube so if it's sucked 500 case worth of

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.690 
tube so if it's sucked 500 case worth of
sin

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
sin

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.480 
sin
pretty<00:02:11.600> neat<00:02:11.840> seen<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.410> in<00:02:12.560> places<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.250> wasn't

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
pretty neat seen to in places it wasn't

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.490 
pretty neat seen to in places it wasn't
a<00:02:13.520> lot<00:02:13.670> of<00:02:13.700> air<00:02:13.940> in<00:02:14.120> its

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
a lot of air in its

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.950 
a lot of air in its
yeah<00:02:14.770> I<00:02:14.800> think<00:02:15.010> you've<00:02:15.310> yeah<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.330> think

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
yeah I think you've yeah and I think

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.260 
yeah I think you've yeah and I think
you've<00:02:17.110> you've<00:02:17.860> read<00:02:18.100> that<00:02:18.310> beautifully<00:02:18.910> ever

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
you've you've read that beautifully ever

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.400 
you've you've read that beautifully ever
since<00:02:19.480> I've<00:02:19.630> had<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.870> it's<00:02:20.110> been<00:02:20.260> well

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
since I've had it it's been well

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.680 
since I've had it it's been well
serviced<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:20.950> everything<00:02:21.310> but<00:02:21.970> prior<00:02:22.510> to

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
serviced and everything but prior to

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.660 
serviced and everything but prior to
that<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.990> was<00:02:23.020> a<00:02:23.620> dump<00:02:23.980> truck<00:02:24.100> engine<00:02:24.520> so

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
that it was a dump truck engine so

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.240 
that it was a dump truck engine so
probably<00:02:25.000> just<00:02:25.060> copped<00:02:25.390> retaining<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:27.040> top

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
probably just copped retaining the top

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.800 
probably just copped retaining the top
surface<00:02:27.520> of<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.970> engine<00:02:28.360> block<00:02:28.480> means

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
surface of the engine block means

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.600 
surface of the engine block means
surfacing<00:02:29.470> because<00:02:29.830> they<00:02:30.010> had<00:02:30.220> guess<00:02:30.400> it's

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
surfacing because they had guess it's

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.180 
surfacing because they had guess it's
been<00:02:30.820> leaking<00:02:31.780> not<00:02:32.020> seriously<00:02:32.500> but<00:02:32.800> leaking

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
been leaking not seriously but leaking

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.910 
been leaking not seriously but leaking
so<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.550> so<00:02:34.000> when<00:02:34.180> we<00:02:34.300> put<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.920> sleaze

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
so that so when we put that sleaze

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.550 
so that so when we put that sleaze
pistons<00:02:36.520> and<00:02:36.820> rings<00:02:37.060> in<00:02:37.270> it<00:02:37.360> will<00:02:37.570> surface<00:02:38.440> the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
pistons and rings in it will surface the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.680 
pistons and rings in it will surface the
block<00:02:38.740> beforehand<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.550> make<00:02:39.580> a<00:02:39.970> better<00:02:40.390> seal

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
block beforehand to make a better seal

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.490 
block beforehand to make a better seal
up<00:02:45.150> toplist<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.330> enjoy<00:02:46.660> your<00:02:46.870> new<00:02:46.900> pistons<00:02:47.380> as

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
up toplist and enjoy your new pistons as

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.160 
up toplist and enjoy your new pistons as
well<00:02:47.710> there's<00:02:48.670> been<00:02:48.820> some<00:02:49.510> quite<00:02:49.690> damage<00:02:50.050> is

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
well there's been some quite damage is

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.560 
well there's been some quite damage is
because<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.710> rings<00:02:50.950> are<00:02:51.160> worn<00:02:51.400> sidon<00:02:52.090> it's

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
because the rings are worn sidon it's

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.450 
because the rings are worn sidon it's
interesting<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:53.110> note<00:02:53.290> that<00:02:53.320> with<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.800> BT

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
interesting to note that with the BT

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.420 
interesting to note that with the BT
motor<00:02:54.730> with<00:02:54.970> a<00:02:55.000> turbo<00:02:55.420> that<00:02:55.830> they<00:02:56.830> have<00:02:57.070> much

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
motor with a turbo that they have much

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.460 
motor with a turbo that they have much
heavier<00:02:57.820> gudgeons<00:02:58.270> in<00:02:58.420> them<00:02:58.540> so<00:02:58.750> people<00:02:59.230> who

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
heavier gudgeons in them so people who

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.980 
heavier gudgeons in them so people who
fit<00:02:59.680> surveys<00:03:00.270> aftermarket<00:03:01.270> just<00:03:01.720> need<00:03:01.900> to

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
fit surveys aftermarket just need to

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.540 
fit surveys aftermarket just need to
watch<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:02.200> because<00:03:02.710> the<00:03:02.890> goujian's<00:03:03.400> do

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
watch that because the goujian's do

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.010 
watch that because the goujian's do
break<00:03:03.820> on<00:03:04.000> them<00:03:04.090> some<00:03:04.270> loans<00:03:04.480> but<00:03:04.630> on<00:03:04.780> yours

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
break on them some loans but on yours

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.540 
break on them some loans but on yours
they're<00:03:05.260> massive<00:03:05.680> it's<00:03:05.980> totally<00:03:06.430> different

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
they're massive it's totally different

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.240 
they're massive it's totally different
to<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:06.910> 3b<00:03:07.360> isn't<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.750> in<00:03:08.110> every<00:03:08.410> sense<00:03:08.680> much

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
to a 3b isn't it in every sense much

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.130 
to a 3b isn't it in every sense much
much<00:03:09.580> more<00:03:09.790> improved<00:03:10.150> motor<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.780> block<00:03:10.990> is

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
much more improved motor the block is

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.600 
much more improved motor the block is
going<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.380> come<00:03:11.500> up<00:03:11.590> really<00:03:11.800> good<00:03:12.070> when<00:03:12.310> we<00:03:12.460> get

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
going to come up really good when we get

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.120 
going to come up really good when we get
it<00:03:12.700> back<00:03:12.790> together<00:03:16.620> yeah<00:03:17.620> I<00:03:17.650> think<00:03:17.950> probably

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
it back together yeah I think probably

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
it back together yeah I think probably
balancing<00:03:18.730> will<00:03:18.880> that<00:03:19.060> add<00:03:19.270> 40%<00:03:19.930> of<00:03:20.610> 40%<00:03:21.610> life

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
balancing will that add 40% of 40% life

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.820 
balancing will that add 40% of 40% life
to<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.450> motor<00:03:22.630> from<00:03:22.780> what<00:03:22.959> I've<00:03:23.050> seen<00:03:23.140> of<00:03:23.320> my

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
to the motor from what I've seen of my

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.010 
to the motor from what I've seen of my
racing<00:03:24.250> experience<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:25.060> balancing<00:03:25.540> is<00:03:25.660> a

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
racing experience the balancing is a

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.880 
racing experience the balancing is a
brilliant<00:03:26.590> idea

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
brilliant idea

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.880 
brilliant idea
so<00:03:27.720> when<00:03:28.720> you<00:03:28.810> say<00:03:28.959> 40%

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
so when you say 40%

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.280 
so when you say 40%
you<00:03:30.190> mean<00:03:30.340> 40%<00:03:30.970> to<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.600> life<00:03:31.750> life<00:03:32.140> of

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
you mean 40% to the to the life life of

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.040 
you mean 40% to the to the life life of
the<00:03:32.350> life<00:03:32.620> of<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:32.890> motor<00:03:33.010> yeah<00:03:33.670> unreal<00:03:34.660> yep

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
the life of the motor yeah unreal yep

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.620 
the life of the motor yeah unreal yep
that's<00:03:35.590> terrific<00:03:35.830> and<00:03:36.280> silver<00:03:36.730> head<00:03:36.880> it's<00:03:37.510> a

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
that's terrific and silver head it's a

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.720 
that's terrific and silver head it's a
direct<00:03:37.840> injection<00:03:38.290> engine<00:03:38.560> of<00:03:38.680> course<00:03:38.830> and<00:03:39.190> so

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
direct injection engine of course and so

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:40.530 
direct injection engine of course and so
on<00:03:39.790> the<00:03:39.880> head<00:03:40.000> we'll<00:03:40.120> have<00:03:40.209> a<00:03:40.240> look<00:03:40.360> at<00:03:40.480> the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
on the head we'll have a look at the

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.330 
on the head we'll have a look at the
valves<00:03:40.900> but<00:03:41.020> the<00:03:41.380> head<00:03:41.560> itself<00:03:41.920> looks<00:03:42.130> good

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
valves but the head itself looks good

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.220 
valves but the head itself looks good
and<00:03:42.490> of<00:03:42.580> course<00:03:42.790> it'll<00:03:42.970> be<00:03:43.030> lightly<00:03:43.660> surfaced

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
and of course it'll be lightly surfaced

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.650 
and of course it'll be lightly surfaced
when<00:03:44.709> we<00:03:44.830> put<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.100> back<00:03:45.130> you<00:03:45.640> know<00:03:45.880> a<00:03:46.150> lot<00:03:46.540> of

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
when we put it back you know a lot of

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.830 
when we put it back you know a lot of
people<00:03:47.130> get<00:03:48.130> scared<00:03:48.370> about<00:03:48.850> gray<00:03:49.450> Toyota

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
people get scared about gray Toyota

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.340 
people get scared about gray Toyota

engines but in actual fact I mean this
is<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:53.560> gray<00:03:53.800> motor<00:03:54.100> and<00:03:54.489> yet<00:03:56.910> well<00:03:57.910> we<00:03:58.150> had<00:03:58.330> a

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
is a gray motor and yet well we had a

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.910 
is a gray motor and yet well we had a
look<00:03:58.480> at<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.690> bearings<00:03:59.140> on<00:03:59.410> of<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.590> big<00:03:59.800> in

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
look at the bearings on of the big in
