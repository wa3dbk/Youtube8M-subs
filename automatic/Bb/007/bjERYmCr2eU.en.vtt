 good afternoon you want to tell rally 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:12.269
 you about one rather pleasant for me 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:15.210
 events some time ago through 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.490
 I received a new mail package which 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:23.480
 ordered via the Internet here is a package wrapped 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:27.359
 it's eight and a half kilograms 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.769
 cambric cambric is designed to 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:34.910
 grape bushes 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.910
 clear bushes and trees 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.180
 I used to use it like this 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.670
 means the material for the garter it was 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:52.800
 sliced aluminum wire 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:55.590
 PVC insulation but so far has been 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.879
 would have wire had the opportunity 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:03.930
 use when the wire ran out 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:05.700
 buy new became the next 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.110
 the material that I used 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:14.310
 it's also a three millimeter cambric it 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.040
 specifically electric cambric but 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.189
 served on me serves serves not 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:24.530
 more than four years of frost crumbles 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:34.320
 at dawn also loses its properties 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:37.920
 breaks well and pretty thin stocks of it 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.670
 I have already run out and this cambric 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.460
 as the manufacturer claims 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.620
 Made from high polyvinyl chloride 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.920
 quality does not affect it 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.500
 reduced temperature i.e. frost 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.480
 By the way, I cut those twenty here 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:02.350
 centimeter pieces and five of them 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:06.130
 kept the whole week freezer at -15 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.280
 again trick with positive 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.080
 temperature on the radiator 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.380
 a week later took them and no changes 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:19.060
 they did not happen here they were like 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.780
 so remained the length of the pieces for 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.660
 garters 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.080
 I have chosen for myself a twenty centimeter 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:29.980
 very comfortable to work with her and now we are with 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:34.810

 Well, please polyvinyl chloride 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:08.170
 the material does not let him garter slip 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:15.690
 over the wire and does not need a second 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:19.420
 node to fix the escape 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:24.820

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:28.860

 wire and tie the cambric on one 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.180
 node in the second node it does not need 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.260
 because 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.489
 polyvinyl chloride material does not give 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:17.700
