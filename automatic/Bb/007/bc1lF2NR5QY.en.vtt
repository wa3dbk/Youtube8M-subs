those three matches to be promoted to
the<00:04:29.870> next<00:04:29.960> division<00:04:30.320> so<00:04:30.950> i'm<00:04:31.490> not<00:04:31.640> sure<00:04:31.700> if<00:04:31.940> at

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
the next division so i'm not sure if at

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.340 
the next division so i'm not sure if at
the<00:04:32.090> hundred<00:04:32.330> division<00:04:32.660> points<00:04:32.870> for<00:04:33.020> East<00:04:33.200> you

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
the hundred division points for East you

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.140 
the hundred division points for East you
know<00:04:33.410> rank<00:04:34.070> up<00:04:34.190> or<00:04:34.370> they<00:04:34.490> add<00:04:34.640> more<00:04:34.880> to<00:04:35.000> get<00:04:35.060> to

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
know rank up or they add more to get to

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.550 
know rank up or they add more to get to
the<00:04:35.240> next<00:04:35.270> division<00:04:35.660> I'm<00:04:35.810> not<00:04:35.960> sure<00:04:36.200> it<00:04:36.380> didn't

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
the next division I'm not sure it didn't

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.490 
the next division I'm not sure it didn't
really<00:04:36.710> specify<00:04:36.890> just<00:04:37.310> said<00:04:37.430> bronze<00:04:37.670> silver

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
really specify just said bronze silver

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.990 
really specify just said bronze silver
I'm<00:04:39.500> guessing<00:04:40.070> kind<00:04:40.490> of<00:04:40.580> make<00:04:40.670> it<00:04:40.790> seem<00:04:40.910> like

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
I'm guessing kind of make it seem like

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.730 
I'm guessing kind of make it seem like
it's<00:04:41.150> 100<00:04:41.480> for<00:04:41.600> each<00:04:41.630> one<00:04:41.870> go<00:04:42.020> I'm<00:04:42.380> not<00:04:42.590> sure

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
it's 100 for each one go I'm not sure

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.980 
it's 100 for each one go I'm not sure

sure if this is right or not but

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.920 
sure if this is right or not but
basically<00:05:18.230> I<00:05:18.350> kind<00:05:18.770> of<00:05:18.830> I<00:05:19.400> can't<00:05:20.240> I<00:05:20.450> took<00:05:20.510> it<00:05:20.810> as

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
basically I kind of I can't I took it as

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.580 
basically I kind of I can't I took it as
basically<00:05:21.350> like<00:05:21.560> you<00:05:22.340> know<00:05:22.460> if<00:05:22.610> your<00:05:22.820> team<00:05:23.090> is

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
basically like you know if your team is

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.900 
basically like you know if your team is
42<00:05:24.590> there's<00:05:24.980> four<00:05:25.100> people<00:05:25.340> wanting<00:05:25.610> to<00:05:25.760> be

Lana team your team losing you had the
two<00:05:27.950> people<00:05:28.250> and<00:05:28.370> I'm<00:05:28.460> guessing<00:05:28.970> it's<00:05:29.150> not

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
two people and I'm guessing it's not

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.180 
two people and I'm guessing it's not
gonna<00:05:29.450> give<00:05:29.600> you<00:05:29.630> as<00:05:29.870> me<00:05:30.110> I<00:05:30.350> could<00:05:30.890> not<00:05:31.070> going

to<00:05:31.250> make<00:05:31.310> you<00:05:31.460> lose<00:05:31.640> as<00:05:31.760> many<00:05:31.880> division<00:05:32.330> points

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
to make you lose as many division points

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.210 
to make you lose as many division points
because<00:05:33.170> you<00:05:33.320> only<00:05:33.500> have<00:05:33.680> to<00:05:33.800> be<00:05:33.920> pulling<00:05:34.100> your

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
team at the end of the game I think 20

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.630 
team at the end of the game I think 20
min<00:05:36.140> by<00:05:36.260> and<00:05:36.440> if<00:05:36.590> you<00:05:36.680> have<00:05:36.770> for<00:05:37.010> talking<00:05:37.400> give
