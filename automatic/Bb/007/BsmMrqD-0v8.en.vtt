00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.700
 the medical category was mobilized during 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.649
 every Wednesday with the elaboration of a 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.599
 document that has been 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.190
 representative office of the 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.559
 ministry of health physicians 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.480
 criticisms and suggestions to the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.340
 federal government we have not 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.369
 we are against the coming of doctors 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.609
 foreigners are against contracting 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.160
 indiscriminate doctor of which country is 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.380
 without a revalidation test of the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.449
 diploma we focus on the question of a 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.600
 creation of a state career for 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.579
 doctors citing everyone to force the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.129
 federal government to invest at least 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.750
 10% of GDP in the budget is health 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.820
 the president of the doctors' union 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.100
 says that the category is not against 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.620
 import of doctors but argues that in the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.870
 Brazil there are enough professionals 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.270
 to meet the demand the problem is the 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.340
 remuneration offered that does not attract 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.070
 professionals for the public service 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.329
 doctors are concentrating more on 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.219
 supplementary health 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.439
 doctors are stamping out 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.659
 public health care due to lack of 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.430
 remuneration for lack of a career 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.890
 status due to lack of 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.390
 work due to lack of investment by the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.280
 federal government in health 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.470
 the order of brazilian lawyers in bush 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.420
 southern part is against the importation of 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.670
 doctors to work in the country 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.650
 the entity believes that the arrival of these 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.740
 professional series rights 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.740
 the measure announced by the federal government 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.150
 attentive eyes, the dignity of the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.020
 human person 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.840
 Why will this knowingly expose 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:40.290
 patients from disadvantaged classes 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.439
 there are obvious risks because doctors 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.590
 these will be brought without revalidation 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.009
 diploma and this implies risks to the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.049
 population and click on risks to society 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.880
 Ernesto points out another discontent 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.829
 as a professional 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.500
 all directors of colleges and 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.689
 universities in the country have received 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.880
 the task of drawing up a 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.770
 prepare the imported doctors 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.020
 they want us federal institution 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.780
 that we have a three-week course 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.660
 these training 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.760
 in family health something humanly 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.580
 impossible as we institutions 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.650
 federal schools are already lagging behind 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.870
 human resources we will do in three 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.870
 training for more than a thousand 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.580
 people it is practically impossible that 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.620
 promoted a walk in the 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.810
 large field center carrying banners 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.690
 with the requirement of proof of revalidation 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.440
 for all Cuban doctors and the 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.440
 of the Minister of Health
