00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
life where I actually started with the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.250 
life where I actually started with the
overhead<00:00:47.250> press<00:00:47.520> being<00:00:48.149> my<00:00:48.300> main<00:00:48.570> compound

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
so red press really I was never really

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.569 
so red press really I was never really
strong<00:00:55.140> at<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.530> just<00:00:55.949> because<00:00:56.250> I've<00:00:56.399> never

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
strong at it just because I've never

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.760 
strong at it just because I've never
really<00:00:56.969> done<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.449> lot<00:00:57.719> before<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.590> always

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
really done it a lot before it always

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.830 
really done it a lot before it always
used<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.160> make<00:00:59.340> my<00:00:59.489> back<00:00:59.760> really<00:01:00.000> light<00:01:00.390> which

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
used to make my back really light which

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.930 
used to make my back really light which
would<00:01:01.079> fuck<00:01:01.320> up<00:01:01.469> my<00:01:01.620> leg<00:01:01.890> days<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.460> squats<00:01:02.760> and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
would fuck up my leg days for squats and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.850 
would fuck up my leg days for squats and
deadlifts<00:01:03.300> which<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.960> why<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.110> kept<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.619> out<00:01:04.769> of

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
deadlifts which is why I kept it out of

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.580 
deadlifts which is why I kept it out of
my<00:01:04.949> routine<00:01:05.250> which<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.299> also<00:01:06.479> why<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.780> see<00:01:07.020> me

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
my routine which is also why you see me

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.469 
my routine which is also why you see me
wearing<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.010> belt<00:01:08.280> when<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.180> movement

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
wearing a belt when I do this movement

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.210 
wearing a belt when I do this movement
because<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:09.990> feel<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.770> helps<00:01:10.979> stabilize

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
because I feel like it helps stabilize

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.060 
because I feel like it helps stabilize
my<00:01:11.670> core<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.540> my<00:01:12.990> back<00:01:13.200> doesn't<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:13.650> as<00:01:13.799> tight

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
my core and my back doesn't get as tight

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.160 
my core and my back doesn't get as tight

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
blue and I just felt like it's such a

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.910 
blue and I just felt like it's such a
tight<00:02:17.520> position<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.720> every<00:02:19.110> time<00:02:19.380> before<00:02:19.680> I

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920
