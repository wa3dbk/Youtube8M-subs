day<00:00:30.900> up<00:00:31.199> there<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.529> one<00:00:31.740> thing<00:00:31.949> i<00:00:32.070> do<00:00:32.130> on-site

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
day up there is one thing i do on-site

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.150 
day up there is one thing i do on-site
if<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.450> keep<00:00:33.630> your<00:00:33.780> guns<00:00:33.989> up<00:00:34.140> like<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.590> you

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
if you keep your guns up like this you

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.490 
if you keep your guns up like this you
can't<00:00:35.460> put<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> lot<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.030> oil<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.200> barrel

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
can't put a lot of oil in the barrel

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.250 
can't put a lot of oil in the barrel
because<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.770> will<00:00:37.950> leak<00:00:38.129> into<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.460> mechanism

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
because it will leak into the mechanism

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.940 
because it will leak into the mechanism
okay<00:00:41.660> this<00:00:42.660> way<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.079> not<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> humongous<00:00:43.739> big

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
okay this way it's not a humongous big

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.080 
okay this way it's not a humongous big
deal<00:00:44.160> because<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.520> can<00:00:44.640> actually<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:45.059> a

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
deal because you can actually have a

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.240 
deal because you can actually have a
barrel<00:00:45.420> tilted<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.989> little<00:00:46.410> bit<00:00:46.680> no<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:47.039> run

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
barrel tilted a little bit no just run

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.459 
barrel tilted a little bit no just run
on<00:00:47.370> out<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.600> shouldn't<00:00:48.840> be<00:00:48.960> poured<00:00:49.230> oil

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
on out but you shouldn't be poured oil

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.069 
on out but you shouldn't be poured oil
down<00:00:50.309> there<00:00:50.370> anyway<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.210> should<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:51.899> leave

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
down there anyway you should just leave

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.660 
down there anyway you should just leave
it<00:00:52.140> up<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.469> code<00:00:52.710> for<00:00:53.640> storage<00:00:55.460> but<00:00:56.460> anyway

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
it up to code for storage but anyway

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.220 
it up to code for storage but anyway
reason<00:00:57.120> i<00:00:57.180> like<00:00:57.360> them<00:00:57.480> up<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.840> because<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.109> can

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
reason i like them up is because you can

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.710 
reason i like them up is because you can
actually<00:00:58.289> get<00:00:58.620> more<00:00:59.510> so<00:01:02.539> I<00:01:03.830> found<00:01:04.830> these<00:01:05.040> hooks

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
actually get more so I found these hooks

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.410 
actually get more so I found these hooks
at<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> hardware<00:01:07.049> store<00:01:08.030> it's<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.180> little

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
at the hardware store it's a little

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.300 
at the hardware store it's a little
screw<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.780> there<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.890> I'm<00:01:10.950> putting<00:01:11.189> them

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
screw on there and so I'm putting them

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.280 
screw on there and so I'm putting them
in<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> wall<00:01:11.610> like<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.420> does<00:01:12.630> bearable

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
in the wall like so so does bearable

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.410 
in the wall like so so does bearable
just<00:01:13.470> rest<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.830> there<00:01:14.010> it's<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.000> little<00:01:15.210> harder

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
just rest in there it's a little harder

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.969 
just rest in there it's a little harder
this<00:01:15.600> one<00:01:15.780> because<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.080> good<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.799> get<00:01:16.920> some

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
this one because it's good to get some

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.370 
this one because it's good to get some
of<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.310> right<00:01:17.490> there<00:01:18.380> but<00:01:20.630> these<00:01:21.630> were<00:01:21.750> 898

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
of you right there but these were 898

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.380 
of you right there but these were 898
since<00:01:22.740> one<00:01:22.979> hardware<00:01:23.280> store<00:01:23.640> went<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.939> walmart

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
since one hardware store went to walmart

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.320 
since one hardware store went to walmart
I've<00:01:25.320> got<00:01:25.590> two<00:01:25.950> packs<00:01:26.250> there's<00:01:26.970> two<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.240> them

and hang out with me um I'm running to

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.240 
and hang out with me um I'm running to
slight<00:01:44.520> problem<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.229> plan<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.380> using<00:01:46.530> these<00:01:47.189> for

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
slight problem I plan on using these for

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.999 
slight problem I plan on using these for
a<00:01:47.460> few<00:01:47.640> pistols<00:01:48.000> too<00:01:48.350> until<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.439> get<00:01:49.649> another

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
a few pistols too until I get another

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:58.190 
a few pistols too until I get another
method<00:01:52.250> but<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:54.470> little<00:01:55.470> kill<00:01:55.649> tech<00:01:55.860> here<00:01:57.200> it's

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
method but a little kill tech here it's

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.700 
method but a little kill tech here it's
really<00:01:58.850> kind<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.939> hard<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.180> hold<00:02:00.560> like<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
really kind of hard to hold like the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.679 
really kind of hard to hold like the
rest<00:02:01.890> against<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.369> wall<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:03.290> think<00:02:04.290> imma<00:02:04.560> do

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
rest against the wall I think imma do

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:07.240 
rest against the wall I think imma do
something

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
something

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.570 
something
I<00:02:08.380> just<00:02:09.380> like<00:02:09.590> hanging<00:02:09.890> off<00:02:10.160> of<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.369> third

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
I just like hanging off of the third

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.100 
I just like hanging off of the third
guard<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:13.190> like<00:02:13.370> that<00:02:13.610> good<00:02:14.540> problem<00:02:14.960> is<00:02:15.020> like

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
guard and like that good problem is like

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.700 
guard and like that good problem is like
with<00:02:15.320> my<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.530> v10<00:02:16.010> here<00:02:17.080> there's<00:02:18.080> no<00:02:18.320> way<00:02:18.470> like

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
with my a v10 here there's no way like

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.440 
with my a v10 here there's no way like
fit<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:19.430> I'm<00:02:19.490> gonna<00:02:19.670> have<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:19.940> hang<00:02:20.240> that

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
fit it so I'm gonna have to hang that

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:32.250 

we<00:03:21.920> keep<00:03:22.129> longer

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:41.640 

okay<00:03:33.260> yeah<00:03:36.849> I'm<00:03:37.849> pretty<00:03:38.120> sure<00:03:38.450> she's<00:03:38.660> longer

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.460 

and<00:03:42.650> not<00:03:42.980> by<00:03:43.160> much<00:03:44.170> so<00:03:45.170> what<00:03:45.380> I'm<00:03:45.470> doing<00:03:47.470> and
