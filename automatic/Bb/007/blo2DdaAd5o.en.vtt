 the cable is too hard to bother to 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:42.030
 use the mouse itself is not here is 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:44.220

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.470

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.569
 in the dark for you to have an idea 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.090
 the best finish of this mouse or the 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:30.170
 dark he has a button down here 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.170

 three different speed levels 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.310
 for the mouse 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.070

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.930
 tighten option leaves the middle speed 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.989
 bullet in your windows regulates the speed 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.000
 that you like and when you increase

 will have a faster speed than 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.430
 that one again tightens a speed 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:08.970
 smaller than the one you want to give 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.400
 headshot and press again to 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.540
