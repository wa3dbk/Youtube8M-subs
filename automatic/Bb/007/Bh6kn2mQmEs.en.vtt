reports<00:00:07.410> are<00:00:08.309> did<00:00:09.150> an<00:00:09.980> external<00:00:10.980> testing<00:00:11.280> on

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
reports are did an external testing on

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.120 
reports are did an external testing on
it<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.000> right<00:00:12.809> now<00:00:13.670> they<00:00:14.670> suggest<00:00:15.540> that<00:00:16.320> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
it and right now they suggest that the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.630 
it and right now they suggest that the
duct<00:00:17.640> tape<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.150> solution<00:00:18.539> or<00:00:19.340> deep<00:00:20.340> upper

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
duct tape is a solution or deep upper

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.450 
duct tape is a solution or deep upper
case<00:00:20.820> i<00:00:21.090> would<00:00:21.900> like<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.260> prove<00:00:22.590> them<00:00:23.060> wrong

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
case i would like to prove them wrong

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.929 
case i would like to prove them wrong
i'm<00:00:26.460> using<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:27.180> bumper<00:00:27.990> case<00:00:28.230> right<00:00:28.710> now<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.189> as

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
i'm using a bumper case right now and as

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.920 
i'm using a bumper case right now and as
you<00:00:30.269> can<00:00:30.510> see<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:31.040> my<00:00:32.040> iphone<00:00:32.579> 4<00:00:33.059> signal<00:00:33.750> bar

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
you can see that my iphone 4 signal bar

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.090 
you can see that my iphone 4 signal bar
it's<00:00:34.200> only<00:00:34.530> two<00:00:35.570> three<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.320> on<00:00:37.350> sometimes

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
it's only two three and so on sometimes

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.690 
it's only two three and so on sometimes
it<00:00:38.250> goes<00:00:38.489> up<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.030> i<00:00:39.800> like<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.010> use<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.219> speed

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
it goes up and i like to use a speed

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.049 
it goes up and i like to use a speed
test<00:00:42.059> because<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.780> test<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
test because you can test the

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.400 
test because you can test the
transmission<00:00:45.590> rate<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.879> fly<00:00:48.180> with<00:00:49.170> my

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
transmission rate on the fly with my

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.139 
transmission rate on the fly with my
hand<00:00:50.000> blocking<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.329> lower<00:00:51.719> left<00:00:53.000> region<00:00:54.000> on

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
hand blocking the lower left region on

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.250 
hand blocking the lower left region on
my<00:00:54.600> iphone<00:00:55.230> 4<00:00:55.649> alright<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.020> five

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
bars i am going to do a quick test

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.130 
bars i am going to do a quick test
without<00:01:01.949> touching<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> lower<00:01:03.210> left<00:01:03.809> and

without touching anything about antenna

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.429 
without touching anything about antenna
this<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.200> an<00:01:07.350> insulated<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.280> tanner<00:01:08.840> ok<00:01:09.840> now

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
this is an insulated and tanner ok now

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.780 
this is an insulated and tanner ok now
i'm<00:01:10.500> going<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.740> do<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> speed<00:01:11.130> test<00:01:11.340> at<00:01:11.549> this

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
i'm going to do a speed test at this

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:23.270 
i'm going to do a speed test at this
point<00:01:12.390> all<00:01:13.170> right<00:01:13.380> let's<00:01:13.680> start

as you can see the iphone four does have
a<00:01:26.729> very<00:01:27.770> very<00:01:28.770> very<00:01:28.950> excellent<00:01:29.580> speed<00:01:30.030> when

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
a very very very excellent speed when

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.520 
a very very very excellent speed when
it's<00:01:31.020> at<00:01:31.260> full<00:01:31.710> bars<00:01:32.210> okay<00:01:33.210> foo<00:01:33.540> as<00:01:33.810> like<00:01:34.140> five

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
it's at full bars okay foo as like five

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.560 
it's at full bars okay foo as like five
bars<00:01:34.860> or<00:01:35.130> full<00:01:35.610> signal<00:01:35.970> off<00:01:36.119> very<00:01:36.450> strong

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
bars or full signal off very strong

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.930 
bars or full signal off very strong
signal<00:01:37.229> right<00:01:37.409> now<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.710> slightly<00:01:38.040> down<00:01:38.640> a

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
signal right now is slightly down a

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.889 
signal right now is slightly down a
little<00:01:39.570> bit<00:01:39.810> okay<00:01:40.619> let<00:01:41.369> me<00:01:41.520> do<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> test<00:01:42.180> one

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
little bit okay let me do the test one

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:50.389 
little bit okay let me do the test one
more<00:01:43.170> time<00:01:43.590> okay<00:01:46.190> one<00:01:47.190> more<00:01:47.369> time<00:01:49.070> then<00:01:50.070> now<00:01:50.340> do

more time okay one more time then now do
my<00:01:50.909> grip<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:52.020> death<00:01:52.619> but<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.490> not<00:01:53.670> really

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
my grip of death but it's not really

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.410 
my grip of death but it's not really
deaf<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.659> called<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.990> grip<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:56.420> attenuation

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
deaf it's called a grip of attenuation

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.669 
deaf it's called a grip of attenuation
okay<00:02:00.080> again<00:02:01.080> without<00:02:01.800> touching<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.820> antenna

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
okay again without touching the antenna

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:09.550 
okay again without touching the antenna
it's<00:02:04.679> the<00:02:05.670> speed<00:02:06.030> comes<00:02:06.330> up<00:02:06.509> not<00:02:07.340> too<00:02:08.340> bad

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
it's the speed comes up not too bad

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.110 
it's the speed comes up not too bad
although<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.739> upload<00:02:11.190> speed<00:02:11.220> has<00:02:11.700> slight

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
although the upload speed has slight

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.210 
although the upload speed has slight
issue<00:02:12.840> okay<00:02:14.000> compared<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.060> previous<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:16.069> I<00:02:17.069> am

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
issue okay compared to previous and I am

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.470 
issue okay compared to previous and I am
going<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:18.290> see<00:02:19.290> if<00:02:19.440> I'm<00:02:19.560> going<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:20.480> almost

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
going to see if I'm going to almost

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.750 
going to see if I'm going to almost
ladies<00:02:21.959> on<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.170> table<00:02:22.620> but<00:02:22.709> I<00:02:22.769> can't<00:02:23.370> do<00:02:23.580> that

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
ladies on the table but I can't do that

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.860 
ladies on the table but I can't do that
yet<00:02:24.319> alright<00:02:25.319> i'm<00:02:25.470> just<00:02:25.769> going<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.510> touch<00:02:27.510> the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
yet alright i'm just going to touch the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
yet alright i'm just going to touch the
phone<00:02:28.829> like<00:02:29.160> that<00:02:31.459> so<00:02:32.459> even<00:02:32.760> with<00:02:32.940> two<00:02:33.239> bars<00:02:33.510> I

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
phone like that so even with two bars I

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.430 
phone like that so even with two bars I
get<00:02:34.890> pretty<00:02:35.730> fast<00:02:36.120> reception<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.019> even

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
get pretty fast reception and even

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.039 
get pretty fast reception and even
faster<00:02:37.829> than<00:02:37.980> four<00:02:38.310> bars<00:02:38.579> because<00:02:39.060> 3g<00:02:39.660> uses

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
faster than four bars because 3g uses

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.750 
faster than four bars because 3g uses
multiple<00:02:40.560> cell<00:02:40.860> towers<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.459> do<00:02:41.640> the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
multiple cell towers to do the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.800 
multiple cell towers to do the
transmission<00:02:45.680> okay<00:02:46.850> now<00:02:47.850> this<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.150> one<00:02:48.540> bar

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
transmission okay now this is one bar

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:57.559 
transmission okay now this is one bar
right<00:02:49.200> now<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.090> test<00:02:51.090> again

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.809 

as<00:02:58.569> you<00:02:58.930> can<00:02:59.080> see<00:02:59.440> that<00:02:59.709> one<00:03:00.190> or<00:03:00.370> two<00:03:00.580> bar

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
as you can see that one or two bar

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:08.280 
as you can see that one or two bar
doesn't<00:03:01.060> really<00:03:01.569> matter<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:07.569> speed<00:03:07.989> just

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
doesn't really matter the speed just

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.059 
doesn't really matter the speed just
keeps<00:03:08.590> going<00:03:08.950> around<00:03:10.020> 1.5<00:03:11.040> megabit<00:03:12.040> per

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
keeps going around 1.5 megabit per

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.820 
keeps going around 1.5 megabit per
second<00:03:12.670> or<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.819> little<00:03:12.970> bit<00:03:13.060> about<00:03:13.450> 1.5<00:03:14.350> megabit

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
second or a little bit about 1.5 megabit

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.979 
second or a little bit about 1.5 megabit
per<00:03:14.860> second<00:03:15.489> upload<00:03:16.150> speed<00:03:16.450> is<00:03:16.600> slightly

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
per second upload speed is slightly

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.740 
per second upload speed is slightly
slower<00:03:17.530> so<00:03:18.959> 273<00:03:19.959> kill<00:03:20.560> bit<00:03:21.550> per<00:03:21.880> second<00:03:22.390> so

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
slower so 273 kill bit per second so

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.860 
slower so 273 kill bit per second so
divide<00:03:23.110> that<00:03:23.290> by<00:03:23.500> eight<00:03:23.769> okay<00:03:24.760> it's<00:03:25.209> around<00:03:25.360> 30

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
divide that by eight okay it's around 30

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.420 
divide that by eight okay it's around 30
kilobytes<00:03:26.140> per<00:03:26.380> second<00:03:26.830> upstream<00:03:27.400> now<00:03:29.430> what

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
kilobytes per second upstream now what

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.500 
kilobytes per second upstream now what
happened<00:03:30.880> if<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.269> do<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.690> regular<00:03:32.260> way<00:03:32.739> of

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
happened if I do the regular way of

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.470 
happened if I do the regular way of
holding<00:03:34.510> using<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.410> left<00:03:35.620> hand<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:37.150> think

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
holding using the left hand and I think

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.400 
holding using the left hand and I think
we<00:03:37.690> should<00:03:37.900> do<00:03:38.110> another<00:03:38.500> test<00:03:38.980> right<00:03:39.640> now<00:03:39.670> and

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
we should do another test right now and

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.190 
we should do another test right now and
see<00:03:41.410> what's<00:03:41.890> going<00:03:42.100> on<00:03:42.569> even<00:03:43.569> with<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.810> bumper

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
see what's going on even with a bumper

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.630 
see what's going on even with a bumper
case<00:03:44.410> okay<00:03:45.310> and<00:03:46.709> look<00:03:47.709> my<00:03:48.069> thumb<00:03:48.430> it's

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
case okay and look my thumb it's

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.420 
case okay and look my thumb it's
touching<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.420> metal<00:03:49.989> buttons<00:03:50.680> over<00:03:50.830> here<00:03:51.690> so

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
touching the metal buttons over here so

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.170 
touching the metal buttons over here so
let's<00:03:54.430> see<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.120> result<00:03:55.299> all<00:03:55.780> right<00:03:56.069> now<00:03:57.180> with

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
let's see the result all right now with

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.009 
let's see the result all right now with
my<00:03:58.330> left<00:03:58.600> hand<00:03:59.790> my<00:04:00.790> thumb<00:04:01.090> not<00:04:01.299> touching<00:04:01.780> the

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
my left hand my thumb not touching the

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.520 
my left hand my thumb not touching the
metal<00:04:02.560> buttons<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:04.450> I'm<00:04:05.109> going<00:04:05.320> to<00:04:05.380> do<00:04:05.500> a

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
metal buttons and I'm going to do a

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.580 
metal buttons and I'm going to do a
speed<00:04:05.890> test<00:04:06.160> as<00:04:06.600> you<00:04:07.600> can<00:04:07.720> see<00:04:07.989> that<00:04:08.200> it<00:04:08.350> goes

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
speed test as you can see that it goes

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.949 
speed test as you can see that it goes
pretty<00:04:08.859> fast<00:04:09.250> right<00:04:11.130> looks<00:04:12.130> good<00:04:12.250> right<00:04:12.959> yeah

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
pretty fast right looks good right yeah

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.759 
pretty fast right looks good right yeah
its<00:04:14.950> good<00:04:15.070> looks<00:04:15.730> normal<00:04:16.209> to<00:04:16.239> me<00:04:16.390> even<00:04:17.169> at<00:04:17.350> one

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
its good looks normal to me even at one

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.550 
its good looks normal to me even at one
bar<00:04:18.039> so<00:04:18.579> it<00:04:18.700> turns<00:04:18.880> out<00:04:19.120> that<00:04:19.180> is<00:04:19.390> a<00:04:19.750> TNT<00:04:20.169> signal

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
bar so it turns out that is a TNT signal

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.710 
bar so it turns out that is a TNT signal
issues<00:04:20.919> right<00:04:22.470> maybe<00:04:23.580> most<00:04:24.580> likely<00:04:24.850> it<00:04:25.660> is

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
issues right maybe most likely it is

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.460 
issues right maybe most likely it is
AT&amp;T<00:04:26.229> signal<00:04:26.710> issue<00:04:27.479> now<00:04:28.479> let<00:04:28.750> me<00:04:28.780> try<00:04:29.140> to<00:04:29.200> use

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
AT&amp;T signal issue now let me try to use

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.750 
AT&amp;T signal issue now let me try to use
my<00:04:29.740> thumb<00:04:30.520> to<00:04:30.729> touch<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.950> metal<00:04:32.950> volume

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
my thumb to touch the metal volume

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.469 
my thumb to touch the metal volume
buttons<00:04:34.150> okay<00:04:34.870> and<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.710> see<00:04:36.130> the<00:04:36.479> speed

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
buttons okay and you see the speed

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:43.230 
buttons okay and you see the speed
change<00:04:39.419> all<00:04:40.419> right

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.290 

see<00:04:43.930> that<00:04:44.139> it<00:04:45.130> slows<00:04:45.550> down<00:04:45.610> and<00:04:46.000> once<00:04:46.180> I

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
see that it slows down and once I

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.770 
see that it slows down and once I
release<00:04:46.479> it<00:04:46.660> it<00:04:46.960> goes<00:04:47.139> up<00:04:47.380> see<00:04:47.860> that<00:04:48.599> it<00:04:49.599> goes

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
release it it goes up see that it goes

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.270 
release it it goes up see that it goes
up<00:04:50.020> all<00:04:50.889> right<00:04:52.289> again<00:04:53.289> upload<00:04:53.710> speed<00:04:54.009> I<00:04:54.039> can

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
up all right again upload speed I can

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.550 
up all right again upload speed I can
pause<00:04:54.490> it<00:04:54.520> using<00:04:55.060> my<00:04:55.210> thumb<00:04:55.509> when<00:04:55.990> i<00:04:56.020> touch<00:04:56.349> the

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
pause it using my thumb when i touch the

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.850 
pause it using my thumb when i touch the
volume<00:04:56.949> button<00:04:58.229> see<00:04:59.229> that<00:04:59.610> all<00:05:00.610> right<00:05:01.800> ok<00:05:02.800> so

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
volume button see that all right ok so

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.010 
volume button see that all right ok so
the<00:05:03.280> bumper<00:05:03.699> is<00:05:03.729> actually<00:05:04.389> not<00:05:04.720> really

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
the bumper is actually not really

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.150 
the bumper is actually not really
solving<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:06.069> issue<00:05:06.900> this<00:05:07.900> antenna<00:05:08.650> still

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
solving the issue this antenna still

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.700 
solving the issue this antenna still
needs<00:05:09.460> more<00:05:09.669> insulation<00:05:10.599> especially<00:05:11.440> the

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
needs more insulation especially the

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.879 
needs more insulation especially the
metal<00:05:12.310> buttons<00:05:12.669> here<00:05:13.060> so<00:05:13.780> obviously<00:05:14.380> it

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
metal buttons here so obviously it

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.700 
metal buttons here so obviously it
proves<00:05:15.250> that<00:05:15.370> apple<00:05:16.090> doesn't<00:05:16.720> probably

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
proves that apple doesn't probably

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.089 
proves that apple doesn't probably
doesn't<00:05:18.099> even<00:05:18.190> know<00:05:18.370> that<00:05:18.880> the<00:05:19.030> bumper<00:05:19.449> case

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
doesn't even know that the bumper case

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.339 
doesn't even know that the bumper case
not<00:05:21.099> totally<00:05:21.669> solving<00:05:22.150> the<00:05:22.330> signal<00:05:22.960> problem

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
not totally solving the signal problem

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:24.990 
not totally solving the signal problem
you<00:05:23.620> know<00:05:23.740> I<00:05:23.770> usually<00:05:24.190> hold<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.699> phone<00:05:24.819> like

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
you know I usually hold the phone like

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.230 
you know I usually hold the phone like
that<00:05:25.030> and<00:05:25.479> with<00:05:26.110> my<00:05:26.259> thumb<00:05:26.789> kind<00:05:27.789> of<00:05:27.849> touching

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
that and with my thumb kind of touching

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.719 
that and with my thumb kind of touching
the<00:05:28.360> volume<00:05:28.720> button<00:05:29.050> and<00:05:30.270> the<00:05:31.270> reception<00:05:31.840> does

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
the volume button and the reception does

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.879 
the volume button and the reception does
attenuate<00:05:33.729> ok<00:05:34.300> or<00:05:34.539> drop<00:05:34.930> all<00:05:35.319> right<00:05:35.620> one<00:05:35.860> more

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
attenuate ok or drop all right one more

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.879 
attenuate ok or drop all right one more
test<00:05:36.310> again<00:05:36.699> to<00:05:36.849> prove<00:05:37.360> that<00:05:37.569> it's<00:05:38.139> not<00:05:38.409> just<00:05:38.740> a

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
test again to prove that it's not just a
