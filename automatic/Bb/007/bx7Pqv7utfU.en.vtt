in three very different parts of the
country<00:02:40.360> it<00:02:41.360> seems<00:02:41.420> is<00:02:41.870> now<00:02:42.110> becoming<00:02:42.920> a

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
country it seems is now becoming a

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.910 
country it seems is now becoming a
training<00:02:43.430> hub<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:44.990> becoming<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.620> place

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
training hub and it is becoming a place

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.290 
training hub and it is becoming a place
where<00:02:46.220> you<00:02:46.460> can<00:02:46.640> actually<00:02:46.820> train<00:02:47.240> people

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
where you can actually train people

where you can actually train people
right<00:02:47.900> at<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.170> remote<00:02:48.410> villages<00:02:49.840> this<00:02:50.840> is

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
right at the remote villages this is

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.720 
right at the remote villages this is
transforming<00:02:51.740> the<00:02:51.830> health<00:02:51.950> scenario<00:02:52.520> of<00:02:52.580> the

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
transforming the health scenario of the

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.780 
transforming the health scenario of the
country<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:54.140> is<00:02:54.410> possible<00:02:54.680> in<00:02:55.490> a<00:02:55.580> large

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
country and that is possible in a large

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.840 
country and that is possible in a large
scale<00:02:56.210> only<00:02:56.540> through<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:57.680> distance<00:02:58.520> mode

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
scale only through a distance mode

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.570 
scale only through a distance mode
because<00:02:59.480> it<00:03:00.290> is<00:03:00.470> not<00:03:00.650> possible<00:03:01.130> to<00:03:01.220> train

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
because it is not possible to train

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.640 
because it is not possible to train
everybody<00:03:02.000> in<00:03:02.450> one<00:03:02.660> hub<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.170> it's<00:03:03.320> actually<00:03:03.620> a

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
everybody in one hub so it's actually a

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.160 
everybody in one hub so it's actually a
multiplier<00:03:04.190> effect<00:03:04.280> if<00:03:05.210> we<00:03:05.270> train<00:03:05.660> and<00:03:05.960> they

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
multiplier effect if we train and they

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.990 
multiplier effect if we train and they
train<00:03:06.470> someone<00:03:06.890> they<00:03:07.040> train<00:03:07.310> someone<00:03:07.670> this<00:03:07.940> is

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
train someone they train someone this is

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.630 
train someone they train someone this is
truly<00:03:08.390> transforming<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.710> the<00:03:09.800> people<00:03:10.160> and

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
truly transforming to the people and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.440 
truly transforming to the people and
they<00:03:11.270> get<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:12.260> right<00:03:12.440> care<00:03:13.130> at<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.300> right

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
they get the right care at the right

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.440 
they get the right care at the right
time<00:03:14.900> at<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.560> right<00:03:15.680> place<00:03:15.860> so<00:03:16.460> what<00:03:17.300> we're

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
time at the right place so what we're

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.420 
time at the right place so what we're
trying<00:03:17.600> to<00:03:17.780> do<00:03:17.960> is<00:03:18.050> empower<00:03:18.500> as<00:03:18.770> many<00:03:19.040> people
