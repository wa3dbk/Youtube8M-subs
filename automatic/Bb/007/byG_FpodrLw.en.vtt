00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 Hi, cool people. I'm here to talk. 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.410
 For you of my reference with 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.080
 castor oil and I came to tell some of 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.660
 things that happened to me the year he and 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.570
 It 's nothing out of the ordinary and it's because 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.820
 asked to see this video to say the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.830
 I found it from him if I'm liking it. 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.170
 because a month ago I recorded a video 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.109
 saying that I was going to make the challenge of 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.230
 castor oil that I was going to use it for 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.579
 fill in to fill in is not to fill 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.700
 eyebrow because I was missing 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.430
 some hair and says that it helps in the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.629
 hair growth so I kind of 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.270
 I challenged myself I'm using it and I liked it 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.899
 much of the result folks in two weeks 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.510
 I already noticed a big difference so what 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.430
 I have to talk about him it 's just things 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.430
 good are positive things 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.109
 I used neither the eyebrow nor the eyelashes and 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.570
 now I'll go back to use it again 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.370
 because I really liked me, manta. 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.870
 using and also liked 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.100
 For those who do not know what I am. 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.930
 Speaking I'm leaving the video link. 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.439
 down here for you there and 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.479
 It 's for you, I'll see you there 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.490
 explaining right but here I tell you 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.460
 a brief summary for you 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.040
 castor oil it is a laxative that 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.340
 sells in pharmacy and drugstores that both 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.880
 are the same thing you find him 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.810
 well cheap $ 3 I bought my but 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.110
 in pharmacies that have 1 50 meets 23 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:42.000
 then it depends on the pharmacy and it is a 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.549
 eye that he helps he assists in 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.710
 Hair growth then has girls 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.890
 using the hair and uses for 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.600
 eyebrow to the eyelashes and I'm 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.200
 using only the eyebrow possible 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:59.189
 because I'm already using too much 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.990
 vitamin A think that af finish in 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.950
 hair I 'm wearing a shampoo 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.310
 bomb 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.379
 so it's too much vitamin so mix 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.240
 a lot of things I think instead of 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:14.390
 progress will portray 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:19.700
 gives my hair growth movement 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.950
 so I preferred to stay alone in the shampoo boma 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.160
 so I am applying the elimination of 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.200
 tiles 1 and already have a month so gave super 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.050
 sure my eyebrow was fine 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.720
 Fininha this from here and the other very thick 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.620
 So the two now rocked and now I 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.420
 I'll use it even more to fill the 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.030
 places I want to be able to do the 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.440
 eyebrow design right that I want 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.920
 so this is it for those who had 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.670
 curiosity the girls who left are 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.360

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.970
 very little and lasts a lot but very much 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.410
 us then it super worth investing 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.540
