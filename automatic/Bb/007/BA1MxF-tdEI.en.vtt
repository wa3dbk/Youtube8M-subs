 6000 raging spectators the csp crushed paris 97% to 57 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:23.099
 the club has never been so close to rome 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:23.939
 meetings 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.970
 we must now win the final on June 20th at bercy against Poitiers 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.479
 that we find beautiful 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:32.780
 and the two teams will play a nice Saturday to decide between 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.980
 the fortunate Frederic president will be our guest on images of joy 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.069
 fabrice as in the team this morning 

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:40.749
 we see all the happiness of the players to have got their ticket last night 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:44.850
 for the final of pro b at bercy the popular of course who offers us 

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:48.279
 also the most beautiful images of the evening with the fervor of 

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:51.250
 limougeaud public who encouraged inert beaublanc 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.400
 what would be alas at the palais des sports de beaublanc the csp signed a 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.260
 victory against Paris and qualified for the pro final 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.489
 before republic 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.489
 over-excited with all this recurrence 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.170
 force is to notice the seam in the memory of the supporters 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.440
 there are evenings like this where everything you 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.310
 for white dubbed as the most beautiful hours of the csp nothing could not stay 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.770
 skeptical 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.770
 in the final of bercy 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.130
 here is the jungle all the fans lÃ©zignanaise everyone has us 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.130
 supported we really really played well 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.659
 yet the trend the most pressure 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.720
 victory could have blocked all the players more 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.710
 invited on the contrary from the start of the match the limougeauds loose pilot 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.470
 in his opponents inside 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.470
 they mostly show an address 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.630
 he is in aggression in order 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.189
 its collective aspect 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.729
 because we have seen players like really want to play together 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.829
 the American who played for the French and French who played for 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:07.830
 Americans 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.289
 men stayed in europe 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.169
 they went on an adventure 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:13.989
 we hope everything goes better 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.989
 fair trade how are things going 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:19.799
 Mohammed 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.620
 amazing last night the team played its best basketball at the best 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.859
 moment of the season 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:28.799
 four wins in four playoff matches the course is ideal and 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.939
 especially the victory 97 57 40 points difference with paris 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.169
 sounds like a warning to the future opponent 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:39.169
 only able to 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:57.119
 in lyon-st etienne 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:58.759
 the attempt does not have anything to chance 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:02.179
 short through his career 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:03.519
 brief case 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.519
 for the first 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:09.640
 now we will wait 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.009
 our opponent 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:14.009
 I think tonight we sent a message a little to everyone 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:17.779
 we go to bercy to win it goes not just like that we go for 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:20.519
 win and to ride 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.680
 it will beat Poitiers or porto short csp c is a very different team in 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.189
 playoffs 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.549
 metamorphosis 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.950
 to shorten good day to day got up with our tormentors first get 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:32.729
 return 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:35.889
 a matter of abortion on both sides of decorating like that 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.949
 I do not know since I was not indulging in the 2000s 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:43.030
 in europe the case i think m before certainly been 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.019
 five years later 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.359
 it's been a few games but for women 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.479
 not necessarily in the 90's 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:49.810
 but in the 80s 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.760
 there were matches like that seen the atmosphere you have to overcome a husband 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.370
 few years to fill this atmosphere then so 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.620
 you played the poopers but I want to tell you that this morning nothing 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.190
 is done and that the actors of the final and you will be problem and 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.860
 next one will have forgotten all that exactly and day thank you for reading because 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.660
 that his clothes the the statement that one makes is that it must be necessary 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.660
 do we are obviously very happy last night it's a draw 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.409
 the audience the room the the mood the match in itself the gap at the end 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:18.019
 but today we are and we did not find downstream despite everything more than 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.070
 field the time prove that 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.769
 when frau and still remains a one-way match 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.629
 then final and on the finals of the two finalists there are some who win 1 who loses 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:27.629
 it is true the police to thousands of children come reinforce our teams 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:30.459
 alberti who will lose we really do not want to be there but you have to know 

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:33.589
 that it is the reality then we will see precisely which of the two 

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:37.489
 teams you will face since borough in bresse or poitiers it was 

00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:40.330
 not decided yet since beaten on Saturday by two points 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.330
 the poitevins 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.009
 took their revenge last night so they imposed themselves 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:44.840
 facing the team 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.319
 didier dobbels 7 71 to 64 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.849
 both teams played the day before Saturday if we listen planters aside 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.149
 I think we're stupid and we're back in the game we did this 

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:55.190
 that it was necessary at the beginning 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.309
 we took the time 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:05:00.809
 we found solutions in attack that we managed to stop one or two 

00:05:00.809 --> 00:05:04.089
 time the team of town in braids defensively besides the players 

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:05.770
 will have surrendered 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.580
 she is not at the referral trying to keep it all and targets dives at 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.080
 next match 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.319
 so would that strong you prefer poitiers that you already have 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.379
 faced repeatedly had practically the same course 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:19.479
 hitherto place today at the port of prey 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.270
 stuffed with drop notes 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.719
 frankly pending the contribution of law will choose 

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:28.080
 so keep him from choosing the opponent we will prepare ourselves 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.080
 we'll see it feels the best team win Saturday 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:32.680
 it is to be expected 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.059
 no we will see we have just 3 15 days more to recover 

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:38.589
 which can be a small advantage and inconvenience these contracts little bit 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:41.129
 less in the rhythm and that just a team like the 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.159
 the potter's executioner who would see who will play 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.729
 a little bit more with this Saturday match 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.699
 so disadvantaged the pros and cons to just about everywhere 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:49.729
 we will only do it 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:51.699
 June 20 the grand tour of 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:55.440
 from 16h30 but what team seems to you the most difficult Poitiers during 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:58.430
 poutine beaten twice 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.849
 the executioner beat us only once but 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:03.490
 for this team a little bit peculiar who got very what 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.339
 has grown stronger lately so 

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:07.270
 no specific shark on that side 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.910
 so the key to winning the final is what the message during these ten 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:10.639
 days 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:13.379
 we'll just stay on the ground yannick because I believe he's 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:16.319
 important urban planning of the north or in the communes of shock 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:17.300
 parts 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.159
 tribunes and bleachers she got off she arrived on the 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:21.699
 field and there 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:22.750
 the barricade 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.130
 Dede de Paris has helped to keep it out of quarters for a quarter and then 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:27.720
 third quarter time face it is there 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.800
 they did a little bit even if claude puel 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.039
 we must be able to keep this precisely this shock wave this will 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:34.110
 and this desire 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.639
 we see the dynamics on which players are currently they need it 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.379
 must keep this spirit there must really stay in there but know 

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:43.440
 that actually an effect having how many spectators for the winter 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.250
 you will be warned we hope a maximum of what we do the same atmosphere 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.540
 so we could have put a little bercy 1 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.580
 thabo white sony i think we can put his child too strong these ten 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.920
 thousand people% the contador part which have been delimited by the cautela 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.260
 place meanwhile 750 years has made demands already for labor at least 1000 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.220
 the train is getting ready so that everyone is calling 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.190
 as early as this morning at the Sports Palace and the new downtown boutique so much 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.840
 that means 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.830
 a very nice atmosphere 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.039
 thank you very much we brought still congratulations and then I add that this 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.789
 evening it's gÃ©rard who will be the guest of our newspaper
