hello I'm Seth Johnson would land the
house<00:00:11.900> so<00:00:12.740> about<00:00:13.010> a<00:00:13.070> year<00:00:13.370> ago<00:00:13.460> I<00:00:13.850> had<00:00:14.210> the

house so about a year ago I had the

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.590 
house so about a year ago I had the
bright<00:00:14.510> idea<00:00:14.540> of<00:00:15.550> making<00:00:16.550> a<00:00:16.700> dam<00:00:17.090> out<00:00:17.390> of

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
bright idea of making a dam out of

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.620 
bright idea of making a dam out of
concrete<00:00:18.200> blocks<00:00:18.790> while<00:00:19.790> I<00:00:19.820> wised<00:00:20.119> up<00:00:20.390> and

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
concrete blocks while I wised up and

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.019 
concrete blocks while I wised up and
decided<00:00:20.990> to<00:00:21.020> use<00:00:21.110> a<00:00:21.260> flume<00:00:21.710> instead<00:00:22.310> but<00:00:22.880> if

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
decided to use a flume instead but if

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.060 
decided to use a flume instead but if
you'd<00:00:23.150> like<00:00:23.300> to<00:00:23.480> read<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:24.050> book<00:00:24.920> I<00:00:25.040> wrote

below<00:00:31.480> so<00:00:32.480> I<00:00:32.780> have<00:00:33.050> all<00:00:33.170> these<00:00:33.320> concrete

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
below so I have all these concrete

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.130 
below so I have all these concrete
blocks<00:00:34.070> now<00:00:34.340> and<00:00:34.610> what<00:00:35.480> am<00:00:35.600> I<00:00:35.660> going<00:00:35.809> to<00:00:35.900> use

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
blocks now and what am I going to use

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.970 
blocks now and what am I going to use
them<00:00:36.350> for<00:00:36.879> I'm<00:00:37.879> thinking<00:00:38.270> about<00:00:38.860> using<00:00:39.860> these

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
them for I'm thinking about using these

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.270 
them for I'm thinking about using these
blocks<00:00:40.340> as<00:00:40.610> the<00:00:41.210> bottom<00:00:41.960> three<00:00:42.350> layers<00:00:42.650> maybe

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
blocks as the bottom three layers maybe

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
blocks as the bottom three layers maybe
even<00:00:43.580> four<00:00:43.909> of<00:00:44.150> my<00:00:45.050> cabin<00:00:45.559> in<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:45.739> woods<00:00:46.300> not

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
even four of my cabin in the woods not

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.270 
even four of my cabin in the woods not
sure<00:00:47.570> if<00:00:47.659> that's<00:00:47.809> a<00:00:47.900> good<00:00:47.989> idea<00:00:48.050> or<00:00:48.500> not<00:00:48.530> but

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
sure if that's a good idea or not but

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.880 
sure if that's a good idea or not but
I'm<00:00:49.370> going<00:00:49.550> to<00:00:49.580> give<00:00:49.790> it<00:00:49.940> a<00:00:50.000> try<00:00:50.409> so<00:00:51.409> the<00:00:51.620> blocks

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
I'm going to give it a try so the blocks

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.759 
I'm going to give it a try so the blocks
were<00:00:52.220> used<00:00:52.250> I<00:00:52.970> got<00:00:53.360> 300<00:00:54.199> of<00:00:54.290> them<00:00:54.409> for<00:00:54.620> about

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
were used I got 300 of them for about

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.719 
were used I got 300 of them for about
$100<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:55.729> so<00:00:56.350> I<00:00:57.350> have<00:00:57.769> to<00:00:57.949> clean<00:00:58.339> them<00:00:58.519> off

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
$100 and so I have to clean them off

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.840 
$100 and so I have to clean them off
from<00:00:59.089> all<00:00:59.269> the<00:00:59.479> old<00:01:00.220> cement<00:01:01.220> that's<00:01:01.430> on<00:01:01.580> them

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
from all the old cement that's on them

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.420 
from all the old cement that's on them
the<00:01:02.269> mortar<00:01:02.629> so<00:01:02.900> I<00:01:03.170> thought<00:01:03.979> I<00:01:04.010> would<00:01:04.220> show<00:01:04.400> you

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
the mortar so I thought I would show you

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.670 
the mortar so I thought I would show you
that<00:01:05.330> process<00:01:05.960> right<00:01:06.229> now

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
that process right now

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.139 
that process right now
so<00:01:07.159> let's<00:01:07.340> do<00:01:07.490> it<00:01:10.360> so<00:01:11.360> I've<00:01:11.840> just<00:01:11.870> been

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
so let's do it so I've just been

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.550 
so let's do it so I've just been
selecting<00:01:14.149> a<00:01:14.210> block<00:01:14.450> that<00:01:14.479> I<00:01:14.689> want<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.340> clean

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
selecting a block that I want to clean

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.830 
selecting a block that I want to clean
setting<00:01:18.560> it<00:01:18.649> up<00:01:18.710> over<00:01:19.039> here<00:01:19.509> I've<00:01:20.509> been<00:01:20.659> using

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
setting it up over here I've been using

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.660 
setting it up over here I've been using
the<00:01:21.020> sledgehammer<00:01:21.680> not<00:01:22.130> really<00:01:22.340> sure<00:01:22.490> how

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
the sledgehammer not really sure how

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.440 
the sledgehammer not really sure how
heavy<00:01:22.880> it<00:01:23.030> is<00:01:23.740> probably<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:24.770> 5<00:01:25.130> I<00:01:25.159> guess<00:01:25.609> and

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
heavy it is probably a 5 I guess and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.429 
heavy it is probably a 5 I guess and
it's<00:01:26.659> old<00:01:26.840> chisel<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:27.530> just<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:29.289> popping<00:01:30.289> off

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
it's old chisel and just a popping off

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.310 
it's old chisel and just a popping off
the<00:01:30.710> old<00:01:30.920> mortar<00:01:31.250> mix<00:01:32.439> like<00:01:33.439> that<00:01:35.170> most<00:01:36.170> of<00:01:36.259> the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
the old mortar mix like that most of the

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.209 
the old mortar mix like that most of the
time<00:01:36.469> it's<00:01:36.619> pretty<00:01:36.740> painless<00:01:38.890> and<00:01:39.890> a<00:01:39.979> lot<00:01:40.130> of

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
time it's pretty painless and a lot of

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.310 
time it's pretty painless and a lot of
these<00:01:40.280> blocks<00:01:40.869> are<00:01:41.869> for<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.229> most<00:01:42.409> part<00:01:42.560> clean

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
these blocks are for the most part clean

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.389 
these blocks are for the most part clean
these<00:01:45.320> are<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.590> ones<00:01:45.770> that<00:01:45.920> get<00:01:46.100> kind<00:01:46.250> of

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
these are the ones that get kind of

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:48.760 
these are the ones that get kind of
annoying<00:01:46.670> because<00:01:47.350> sometimes<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.500> top

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
annoying because sometimes the top

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.770 
annoying because sometimes the top
doesn't<00:01:49.250> quite<00:01:49.520> come<00:01:49.880> off<00:01:50.030> like<00:01:50.270> you<00:01:50.450> want<00:01:50.689> it

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
doesn't quite come off like you want it

00:01:50.780 --> 00:02:16.309 
doesn't quite come off like you want it
to<00:01:53.469> and<00:01:54.469> sometimes<00:01:54.979> it<00:01:55.369> does

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.430 

after<00:02:17.319> I've<00:02:17.440> cleaned<00:02:17.769> a<00:02:17.920> few<00:02:18.129> blocks<00:02:18.370> I

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
after I've cleaned a few blocks I

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.500 
after I've cleaned a few blocks I
grabbed<00:02:20.440> two<00:02:20.470> of<00:02:20.830> them<00:02:20.920> at<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.010> time<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.549> walk

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
grabbed two of them at a time and walk

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.289 
grabbed two of them at a time and walk
up<00:02:22.720> here<00:02:22.989> and<00:02:23.370> stack<00:02:24.370> them<00:02:24.519> up<00:02:24.610> ready<00:02:24.879> to<00:02:24.940> be

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
up here and stack them up ready to be

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:33.240 
up here and stack them up ready to be
put<00:02:25.840> down<00:02:25.870> on<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.290> foundation<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.920> doesn't

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
put down on the foundation it doesn't

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.789 
put down on the foundation it doesn't
take<00:02:33.430> long<00:02:33.459> before<00:02:33.940> 80<00:02:34.269> pounds<00:02:34.810> gets<00:02:35.019> heavy

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.229 

just<00:02:41.799> been<00:02:41.980> making<00:02:42.310> this<00:02:42.900> stack<00:02:43.900> right<00:02:43.930> here

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
just been making this stack right here

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.520 
just been making this stack right here
now<00:02:46.239> I'm<00:02:46.390> figuring<00:02:46.569> that<00:02:47.340> about<00:02:48.340> 36<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:50.290> what<00:02:50.500> I

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
now I'm figuring that about 36 is what I

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.800 
now I'm figuring that about 36 is what I
need<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:50.829> go<00:02:50.980> around<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.640> whole<00:02:51.819> foundation

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
need to go around the whole foundation

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.920 
need to go around the whole foundation
one<00:02:53.500> time<00:02:53.829> but<00:02:54.819> then<00:02:54.970> there's<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.360> door<00:02:55.569> so

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
one time but then there's the door so

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.800 
one time but then there's the door so
it's<00:02:56.049> gonna<00:02:56.140> be<00:02:56.260> more<00:02:56.349> like<00:02:56.670> 32<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.090> half<00:02:58.329> or

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
it's gonna be more like 32 and a half or
