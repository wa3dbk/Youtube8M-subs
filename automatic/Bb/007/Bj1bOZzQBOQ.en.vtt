00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.150 
just something I'm gonna have to live
with<00:04:15.800> I<00:04:16.010> suppose<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:18.470> passenger<00:04:18.859> side<00:04:19.010> of<00:04:19.130> the

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
with I suppose the passenger side of the

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.740 
with I suppose the passenger side of the
truck<00:04:19.370> is<00:04:19.549> just<00:04:19.730> as<00:04:19.880> clean<00:04:20.120> as<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:20.390> driver's

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
truck is just as clean as the driver's

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.729 
truck is just as clean as the driver's
side<00:04:20.870> actually<00:04:21.140> it's<00:04:21.350> a<00:04:21.410> little<00:04:21.590> better

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
side actually it's a little better

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.080 
side actually it's a little better
because<00:04:21.890> it<00:04:22.100> doesn't<00:04:22.340> have<00:04:22.460> that<00:04:22.610> rough<00:04:22.820> spot

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
because it doesn't have that rough spot

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.620 
because it doesn't have that rough spot
the<00:04:23.960> driver's<00:04:24.290> side<00:04:24.410> does<00:04:24.650> I<00:04:25.390> need<00:04:26.390> to<00:04:26.540> get

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
the driver's side does I need to get

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.570 
the driver's side does I need to get
some<00:04:26.870> mothers<00:04:27.200> back<00:04:27.470> to<00:04:27.680> black<00:04:27.919> for<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.310> side

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
some mothers back to black for the side

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.560 
some mothers back to black for the side
molding<00:04:29.090> because<00:04:29.510> it's<00:04:29.720> faded<00:04:30.620> out<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:31.580> it's

molding because it's faded out and it's

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.540 
molding because it's faded out and it's
looking<00:04:32.840> more<00:04:33.020> gray<00:04:33.350> than<00:04:33.380> black<00:04:33.919> so<00:04:34.340> I<00:04:34.400> need

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
looking more gray than black so I need

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.700
