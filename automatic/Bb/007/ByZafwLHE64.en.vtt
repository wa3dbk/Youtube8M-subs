00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.570
 people are jerry john doe 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.920
 young people meet for a small 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.199
 video about stylists in the web 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.550
 for you, that's fine 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.230
 nickel the potato and from there we left 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.550
 for a little video on destiny for 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.380
 a totally useless thing 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.029
 or so this time just for a 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.039
 trick can if you want that when 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.750
 you arrive on the torn coast when 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.279
 you are on patrol on venus and that 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.500
 you observe in the sky you can 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.340
 find at extremely intervals 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.899
 rare this circle swirling dragon ci can 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.700
 also be observed at the door 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.780
 glass vault or steps 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.399
 infinity so what is it that 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.809
 this dragon already is extremely rare 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.530
 you will not see each time 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.050
 go on patrol 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.170
 this phenomenon that happens randomly 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.430
 but this dragon is actually a little 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.719
 would list I'm going to talk to you a 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.890
 little bit on this video a little bit more 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.840
 long as usual on these stuff 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.579
 useless because it's not so I have this 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.289
 that there is a little story to 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.270
 revealed behind these little lady dragons 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.829

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.119
 precisely yes because it's not 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.760
 gargoyles of simple dragons these are 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:10.150
 kara souls are a kind of dragon 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.650
 donkey who simply live at the time 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.119
 guards and who became 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.189
 extremely rare that they have become a 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.560
 endangered species and why 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.960
 since they are chased by the guards 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.900
 and why they are hunted since 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.390

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.610

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.869
 magical quite exceptional and it's this 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.939
 that the guards covet 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.590

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.810

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.450

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.100
 that it would not appear at every 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.880

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.750
 extremely rare because they are 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.040
 chased by the guards in order to 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.500
