00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.750
 parts that have thinner fabric as well 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.670
 has enough clothes that would integrate the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.800
 My husband's shirt has more fabric 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.660

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.309

 to have a new-face piece 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.420
 always leave only with what I do 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.300
 Good people, the first thing I do is 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.619
 separate clothes by main color from 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.740

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.440
 colorful and Stephano largest white bucket has 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.770
 the white clothes or celinha clarinha 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.930
 I do this separation is for all 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.750
 types of clothing so as not to have unforeseen 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.520
 of spotting a particular piece then it is 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.890
 very important to separate the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.630
 clothes by color before 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.910
 Good people say that showing you is 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.619

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.660

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.340
 becomes transparent has this 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.649
 Detail rubble is that under the skirt 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.640

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.740

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.110
 prejudice the third then there is 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.080

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.959

 detail that has this pedraria I wash 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:05.369
 always on the wrong side and to ensure 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.310
 I still use this little bag here, that bag. 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.920
 It is actually a special bag for the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.800
