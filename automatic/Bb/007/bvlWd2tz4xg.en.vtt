me personally I've fallen into the habit
of<00:05:05.380> not<00:05:05.470> even<00:05:05.710> writing<00:05:06.070> a<00:05:06.280> script<00:05:06.580> based<00:05:06.730> off

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
of not even writing a script based off

of not even writing a script based off
of<00:05:07.030> an<00:05:07.270> idea<00:05:07.540> if<00:05:07.690> I<00:05:07.780> can't<00:05:08.020> really<00:05:08.260> come<00:05:08.410> up

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
of an idea if I can't really come up

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.140 
of an idea if I can't really come up
with<00:05:08.560> a<00:05:08.680> compelling<00:05:09.100> log<00:05:09.430> line<00:05:09.670> that<00:05:09.910> grabs

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
with a compelling log line that grabs

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.850 
with a compelling log line that grabs
your<00:05:10.330> attention<00:05:10.780> because<00:05:11.110> it's<00:05:11.650> an<00:05:11.740> early

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
your attention because it's an early

your attention because it's an early
indication<00:05:12.490> for<00:05:12.610> me<00:05:12.730> that<00:05:12.910> the<00:05:13.030> idea<00:05:13.300> is

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
indication for me that the idea is

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.700

probably<00:05:13.750> not<00:05:13.870> as<00:05:13.960> good<00:05:14.020> as<00:05:14.200> I<00:05:14.290> thought<00:05:14.440> it<00:05:14.590> was

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710

there's no right or wrong that's just
