00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
little hook there again just to make

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.039 
little hook there again just to make
sure<00:04:08.970> it<00:04:09.150> doesn't<00:04:09.269> flap<00:04:09.510> around<00:04:09.660> wash<00:04:09.900> you're

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
take a look at the end valve now as you

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.920 
take a look at the end valve now as you
see<00:04:14.340> very<00:04:14.760> good<00:04:14.940> design<00:04:15.269> when<00:04:15.660> you<00:04:15.690> want<00:04:15.900> to

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930

take a drink you turn the tap section on

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.360 
take a drink you turn the tap section on
so<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.630> broad<00:04:18.900> can<00:04:19.169> flow<00:04:19.349> through<00:04:19.380> we<00:04:20.280> don't

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
so the broad can flow through we don't

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.159 
so the broad can flow through we don't
want<00:04:20.579> to<00:04:20.639> use<00:04:20.760> it<00:04:20.789> turn<00:04:21.299> this<00:04:21.419> off<00:04:21.630> just<00:04:21.810> stops
