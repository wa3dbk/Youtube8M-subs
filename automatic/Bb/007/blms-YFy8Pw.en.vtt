has<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.790> been<00:02:13.909> harder<00:02:14.359> when<00:02:14.810> you<00:02:14.900> came<00:02:15.079> to

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:15.109 
has it been harder when you came to

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:16.720 
has it been harder when you came to
Richmond<00:02:15.530> from<00:02:15.799> Air<00:02:15.980> Force<00:02:16.219> and<00:02:16.459> maybe<00:02:16.579> you

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
Richmond from Air Force and maybe you

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.270 
Richmond from Air Force and maybe you
thought<00:02:17.590> probably<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.650> little<00:02:18.769> bit<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.040> think

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
thought probably a little bit I think

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.369 
thought probably a little bit I think
that<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:20.510> know<00:02:20.599> each<00:02:20.780> time<00:02:21.019> you<00:02:21.170> make<00:02:21.200> a

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
that you know each time you make a

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.080 
that you know each time you make a
change<00:02:21.500> like<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:21.980> we<00:02:22.219> had<00:02:22.519> left<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.849> really

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
change like that we had left a really

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.610 
change like that we had left a really
good<00:02:23.239> Air<00:02:23.390> Force<00:02:23.629> team<00:02:23.900> behind<00:02:24.079> to<00:02:24.469> go<00:02:24.560> to

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
good Air Force team behind to go to

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.130 
good Air Force team behind to go to
Richmond<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:25.219> you<00:02:26.120> know<00:02:26.239> you<00:02:26.299> just<00:02:26.510> encounter

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
some things that are a little bit a

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.740 
some things that are a little bit a
little<00:02:28.579> bit<00:02:28.849> different<00:02:29.329> or<00:02:29.390> a<00:02:29.450> little<00:02:29.629> bit

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750

more<00:02:29.900> difficult<00:02:30.109> than<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:30.739> then<00:02:31.099> you<00:02:31.189> might

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
more difficult than you then you might

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.459 
more difficult than you then you might
expect<00:02:31.790> but<00:02:32.389> that's<00:02:32.900> part<00:02:33.139> of<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.319> you<00:02:33.439> know

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:33.469 
expect but that's part of it you know

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:35.080 
expect but that's part of it you know
you<00:02:33.590> make<00:02:34.069> that<00:02:34.250> jump<00:02:34.549> and<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:34.760> make<00:02:34.879> the<00:02:34.969> leap

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
you make that jump and you make the leap

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.140 
you make that jump and you make the leap
of<00:02:35.269> faith<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.450> go<00:02:35.719> to<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:35.840> new<00:02:36.260> program<00:02:36.769> and<00:02:37.700> it

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
of faith to go to a new program and it

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.129 
of faith to go to a new program and it
has<00:02:38.299> been<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.569> little<00:02:38.719> bit<00:02:38.930> difficult

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:39.139 
has been a little bit difficult

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.470

players<00:03:00.739> back<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.340> they<00:03:01.400> go<00:03:01.549> to<00:03:01.609> summer

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
school for a session in May and we try

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.409 
school for a session in May and we try
to<00:03:03.829> keep<00:03:04.010> them<00:03:04.189> around<00:03:04.280> working<00:03:04.700> our<00:03:04.939> camps

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:05.419 
to keep them around working our camps

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:06.909 
to keep them around working our camps
and<00:03:05.629> they're<00:03:06.290> able<00:03:06.379> to<00:03:06.500> work<00:03:06.680> with<00:03:06.799> the

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:06.919 
and they're able to work with the

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.259 
and they're able to work with the
strength<00:03:07.159> coach<00:03:07.430> which<00:03:07.579> is<00:03:07.700> very<00:03:07.879> important

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
strength coach which is very important

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.780 
strength coach which is very important
to<00:03:08.299> all<00:03:08.510> of<00:03:08.540> us<00:03:08.810> so<00:03:09.620> that's<00:03:09.799> important<00:03:10.370> but

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
to all of us so that's important but

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.099 
to all of us so that's important but
they<00:03:10.879> don't<00:03:10.969> get<00:03:11.150> a<00:03:11.209> chance<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.689> work<00:03:11.810> with<00:03:11.989> the

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
they don't get a chance to work with the

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:14.379 
they don't get a chance to work with the
coaches<00:03:12.530> and<00:03:12.560> you'll<00:03:13.250> lose<00:03:13.400> that<00:03:13.639> you<00:03:14.180> lose<00:03:14.209> a

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 
coaches and you'll lose that you lose a

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:15.909 
coaches and you'll lose that you lose a
little<00:03:14.599> bit<00:03:14.689> of<00:03:14.780> that<00:03:14.870> relationship<00:03:15.260> because

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:15.919 
little bit of that relationship because

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:17.319 
little bit of that relationship because
you're<00:03:16.040> not<00:03:16.189> out<00:03:16.400> there<00:03:16.430> working<00:03:16.879> with<00:03:17.180> them

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
you're not out there working with them

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.210 
you're not out there working with them
talking<00:03:17.569> to<00:03:17.720> them<00:03:17.810> and<00:03:18.079> it's<00:03:18.560> obviously<00:03:19.069> it's

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
talking to them and it's obviously it's

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.589 
talking to them and it's obviously it's
a<00:03:19.250> great<00:03:19.489> thing<00:03:19.729> and<00:03:19.940> it's<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.150> most<00:03:20.329> you<00:03:20.510> know

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
a great thing and it's the most you know

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.270 
a great thing and it's the most you know
it's<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.870> very<00:03:21.260> big<00:03:21.470> reason<00:03:21.829> while<00:03:21.949> they're<00:03:22.250> at

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
it's a very big reason while they're at

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.369 
it's a very big reason while they're at
the<00:03:22.489> school<00:03:22.849> and<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.540> relationships<00:03:24.079> that<00:03:24.169> we

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
the school and the relationships that we

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.080 
the school and the relationships that we
all<00:03:24.530> have<00:03:24.560> with<00:03:24.859> our<00:03:24.949> players<00:03:25.220> are<00:03:25.430> strong<00:03:25.790> and

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
all have with our players are strong and

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.819 
all have with our players are strong and
are<00:03:26.239> only<00:03:26.569> enhanced<00:03:27.079> by<00:03:27.169> being<00:03:27.440> out<00:03:27.590> on<00:03:27.620> the

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
are only enhanced by being out on the

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.589 
are only enhanced by being out on the
floor<00:03:28.010> with<00:03:28.220> them<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:28.579> coaching<00:03:29.269> them<00:03:29.419> and

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
floor with them and coaching them and

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:30.729 
floor with them and coaching them and
talking<00:03:29.780> to<00:03:29.930> them<00:03:29.989> about<00:03:30.139> different<00:03:30.500> things

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
talking to them about different things

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.369 
talking to them about different things
on<00:03:31.040> their<00:03:31.159> game<00:03:31.400> and<00:03:31.669> so<00:03:32.599> I<00:03:32.629> hope<00:03:32.989> that<00:03:33.049> rule

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
on their game and so I hope that rule

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.199 
on their game and so I hope that rule
does<00:03:33.590> change<00:03:33.949> but<00:03:34.459> it<00:03:34.549> can<00:03:34.909> be<00:03:35.060> difficult

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
does change but it can be difficult

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.780 
does change but it can be difficult
because<00:03:35.720> we'd<00:03:36.650> like<00:03:36.799> to<00:03:36.889> keep<00:03:37.010> our<00:03:37.189> guys<00:03:37.430> there

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
because we'd like to keep our guys there

because we'd like to keep our guys there
