00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 This cup made me fight in 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.089
 several moments we all knew about the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.340
 overfilling of the incompetence of 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.840
 the theft of all manipulation because 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.849
 was involved in the construction of this 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.860
 but as someone who loves his father. 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.199
 truth can twist against its own 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.060
 selection as you find a boy has been 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.010
 top scorer of the cups up to the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.869
 final as twisting against david luiz 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.699
 who enchanted the country with its claw and 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.380
 control your humility as twisting 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.570
 against Julius Caesar who came smaller 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.580
 internal overcoming where he made 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.980
 everything to take Brazil further or 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.780
 how to cheat against each player 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.940
 that I do everything within the field to 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.070
 It was not Bruno's fault and I 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.110
 I confess that I twisted 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.059
 I screamed and hit the chest for the selection 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.980
 because the man this country and I want 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.899
 He always wins but I believe that the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.820
 It was better we lost and better. 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.100
 still have lost how we lost the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.530
 tram take a burst of 71 in one 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.149
 semifinal when Brazil is the home is that 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.500
 ends with that false sense that 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.390
 Is everything okay in this country? 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.789
 the worst legacy that this cup could leave 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.010
 it is from a country that they stop one year 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.589
 call for health education and the end of 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.290
 corruption and in the other year the country 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.150
 a world cup deceives you and make it one more 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.140
 manipulated by a false sense of 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.760
 that is okay 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.170
 it would be good if the Brazilian had a 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.670
 little joy in the midst of so much 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.409
 disgrace but better than Brazil 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.869
 win the world cup is he win 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.460
 elections that will define their future and 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.229
 To tell you the truth, brother, I wanted to. 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.640
 without fear of Brazil but I do not 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.650
 I had notion of how much this copy 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.729
 to interfere in the elections but I want to 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.680
 say something 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.150
 the humiliation is not to be defeated in the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.790
 football field but we will be 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.670
 defeated in justice at work and 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.850
 health education and dignity and safety 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.650
 every day the greatest humiliation is censored 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.600
 by a mediocre party that manipulates 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.369
 population and the worst is that it is the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.799
 The truth is that the Brazilian takes a 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.869
 every day of a system of a government that 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.790
 ridicules you with the highest taxes 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.079
 of the world and exchange absolutely nothing 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.060
 so I want to remind you that the 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.040
 Brazil is not well to corruption ever 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.780
 censorship was so evident that it was never 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.850
 both because the highest censorship exists 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.049
 that disguised as democracy and in that 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.450
 the current government of that country is 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.130
 specialist so that's why it's important 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.960
 us to be humiliated in football 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.119
 show us that we are 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.679
 humiliated every day as Brazilians by 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.830
 Have you ever tried to buy a car? 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.230
 In this country, I do not know if you know more. 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.540
 stations and the abuses of concessionaires 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.550
 make a car here in Brazil worth 3 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.770
 of the same cars in the United States and 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.230
 two of the same cars in Argentina 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.910
 people twisted we vibrated and people went 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.370
 along with Brazil in the field but is 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.500
 It's time to go back and do it again. 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.240
 without violence without break without breaks 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.240
 put up with any black block destroyer 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.830
 manifests day 13 just after the final 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.870
 because we do not want to ruin the end 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.300
 that deserved it's there we'll be in the 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.550
 main streets squares and points of the 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.650
 our cities to tell them that the 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.230
 that they did what they do 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.670
 with us is more than us still 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.500
 we want to leave a final legacy to 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.900
 this cup and this is the best time to 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.730
 This, please join us with the 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.740
 brazil shirt to fight once again 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.810
 for us against corruption 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.240
 handling and against the 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.740
 together last legacy I ask that 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.870
 spread these videos to everyone 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.250
 as fast as possible because 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.070
 we have less than a week to 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.270
 get a big hug to you I hope 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.270
 all in the following places 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:29.860
 the campaign was good then in force 30 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.860
 years and no reader 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:38.430
 they did 30 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.430
 the law came and it was in her that
