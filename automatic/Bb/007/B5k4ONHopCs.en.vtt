00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
with a finger that I had to build up

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.399 
with a finger that I had to build up
this<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> more<00:01:03.120> realistic<00:01:03.480> swatch<00:01:03.989> over

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
this is a more realistic swatch over

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.620 
this is a more realistic swatch over
here<00:01:04.710> with<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> brush<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.270> even<00:01:06.600> more

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
here with a brush that is even more

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.780 
here with a brush that is even more
subtle<00:01:07.200> than<00:01:07.229> what<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:08.010> would<00:01:08.100> get<00:01:08.340> with<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
subtle than what you would get with the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.570 
subtle than what you would get with the
finger<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.390> even<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.619> heavy<00:01:10.860> fingers

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
finger and even in the heavy fingers

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.370 
finger and even in the heavy fingers
watch<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.270> don't<00:01:12.689> really<00:01:12.780> see<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.140> lot<00:01:13.229> of

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
watch I don't really see a lot of

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.740 
watch I don't really see a lot of
glitter<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.070> went<00:01:14.820> into<00:01:14.970> rectus<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.570> light

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
glitter I went into rectus on the light

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.070 
glitter I went into rectus on the light
and<00:01:16.490> by<00:01:17.490> looking<00:01:17.700> very<00:01:18.060> closely<00:01:18.270> at<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.780> I

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
and by looking very closely at it I

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.800 
and by looking very closely at it I
could<00:01:19.439> see<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.670> couple<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.210> specs<00:01:21.570> but

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
could see just a couple of specs but

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.240 
could see just a couple of specs but
it's<00:01:22.020> really<00:01:22.320> not<00:01:22.619> anything<00:01:23.009> that's

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
it's really not anything that's

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.090 
it's really not anything that's
overpowering<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:25.500> honest<00:01:25.860> most

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
overpowering and to be honest most

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.850 
overpowering and to be honest most
people<00:01:26.450> wouldn't<00:01:27.450> actually<00:01:27.750> even<00:01:28.320> notice<00:01:28.680> it

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
people wouldn't actually even notice it

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.560 
people wouldn't actually even notice it
and<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.340> worn<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.790> shade<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.329> did<00:01:30.540> not

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
and I have worn the shade and I did not

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.490 
and I have worn the shade and I did not
notice<00:01:30.990> any<00:01:31.439> glitter<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.400> my<00:01:32.790> cheeks<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.500> think

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
especially for the spring and summer the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.260 
especially for the spring and summer the
nice<00:01:39.900> thing<00:01:39.930> about<00:01:40.259> all<00:01:40.710> these<00:01:41.070> blushes<00:01:41.850> is

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
nice thing about all these blushes is

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.749 
nice thing about all these blushes is
that<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.350> there<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.040> user<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.369> lot<00:01:44.610> of

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
that is that there for the user a lot of

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.200 
that is that there for the user a lot of
control<00:01:45.180> meaning<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.439> if<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.640> use<00:01:47.759> them

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
control meaning that if you use them

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.840 
control meaning that if you use them
lightly<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:49.350> get<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.860> very<00:01:50.130> light<00:01:50.460> wash

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
lightly you get just a very light wash

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.569 
lightly you get just a very light wash
of<00:01:50.880> color<00:01:51.570> on<00:01:51.840> your<00:01:51.990> cheeks<00:01:52.369> but<00:01:53.369> they<00:01:53.520> are

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
of color on your cheeks but they are

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.830 
of color on your cheeks but they are
very<00:01:53.670> very<00:01:54.210> buildable<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.020> they<00:01:55.560> do<00:01:55.619> blend

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
very very buildable and they do blend

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.200 
very very buildable and they do blend
wonderfully<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.860> next<00:01:59.130> color<00:01:59.369> sweet<00:01:59.790> retreat

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
wonderfully the next color sweet retreat

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.370 
wonderfully the next color sweet retreat
is<00:02:00.950> actually<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.130> lightest<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.939> bunch

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
is actually the lightest of the bunch

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.380 
is actually the lightest of the bunch
this<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.590> very<00:02:04.680> neutral<00:02:05.189> shade<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.820> pink<00:02:06.119> and

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
this is a very neutral shade of pink and

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.630 
this is a very neutral shade of pink and
I<00:02:07.079> would<00:02:07.320> say<00:02:07.500> that<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.399> most

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
I would say that this is the most

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.510 
I would say that this is the most
neutral<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.539> them<00:02:09.780> all<00:02:09.989> if<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.220> apply<00:02:11.489> it

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
neutral of them all if you apply it

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.690 
neutral of them all if you apply it
lightly<00:02:11.790> on<00:02:12.120> your<00:02:12.150> face

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700

that it makes you look radiant but it

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.210 
that it makes you look radiant but it
doesn't<00:02:20.110> look<00:02:20.260> like<00:02:20.319> you're<00:02:20.530> wearing<00:02:20.860> makeup

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
you apply them on the face there is

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.740 
you apply them on the face there is
actually<00:04:39.190> not<00:04:39.370> so<00:04:39.670> much<00:04:39.730> difference<00:04:40.390> in<00:04:40.600> the

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750
