00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
what they've always believed in and I've

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.450 
what they've always believed in and I've
seen<00:01:48.299> how<00:01:48.509> people<00:01:48.720> treasure<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:49.560> see<00:01:50.310> that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
seen how people treasure that see that

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.999 
seen how people treasure that see that
as<00:01:50.580> a<00:01:50.610> livelihood<00:01:51.210> seeing<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.350> as<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.590> means

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
as a livelihood seeing that as a means

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.100 
as a livelihood seeing that as a means
to<00:01:53.430> an<00:01:53.490> end<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.240> think<00:01:54.450> taking<00:01:54.690> that<00:01:54.899> away

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
to an end and I think taking that away

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.529 
to an end and I think taking that away
from<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:56.009> patient<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.700> from<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.970> family

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
from the patient and from the family

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.480 
from the patient and from the family
could<00:01:57.810> do<00:01:57.930> more<00:01:58.170> damage<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> long<00:01:59.159> run

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
could do more damage in the long run

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.210 
could do more damage in the long run
that<00:01:59.729> letting<00:02:00.299> them<00:02:00.560> fulfill<00:02:01.560> their<00:02:01.799> beliefs

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
that letting them fulfill their beliefs

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.050 
that letting them fulfill their beliefs
for<00:02:03.210> example<00:02:03.690> my<00:02:04.110> my<00:02:04.740> grandmother<00:02:05.190> has<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> very

for example my my grandmother has a very

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.960 
for example my my grandmother has a very

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
very devout faith in her church and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.699 
very devout faith in her church and
there<00:02:09.569> are<00:02:09.630> certain<00:02:09.899> disagreements<00:02:10.410> I've<00:02:10.500> had

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
there are certain disagreements I've had

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.400 
there are certain disagreements I've had
with<00:02:10.860> her<00:02:11.009> directly<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.900> also<00:02:13.110> see<00:02:13.380> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
with her directly but I also see the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.250 
with her directly but I also see the
benefits<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.250> does<00:02:14.489> for<00:02:14.670> her<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.120> if<00:02:15.989> she

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
benefits that it does for her and if she

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.900 
benefits that it does for her and if she
were<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.410> be<00:02:16.530> in<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.769> position<00:02:16.950> where<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.610> could

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
were to be in a position where I I could

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.030 
were to be in a position where I I could
see<00:02:18.030> someone<00:02:18.209> denying<00:02:18.720> after<00:02:19.110> her<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.530> could

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
see someone denying after her I could

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.040 
see someone denying after her I could
see<00:02:20.069> that<00:02:20.250> affecting<00:02:20.670> her<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.660> would<00:02:21.750> affect

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
see that affecting her that would affect

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.630 
see that affecting her that would affect
me<00:02:22.260> even<00:02:22.560> though<00:02:22.650> I'm<00:02:22.800> not<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.220> faith<00:02:23.430> of

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
me even though I'm not in the faith of

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.120 
me even though I'm not in the faith of
the<00:02:24.480> Mormon<00:02:24.780> Church<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:25.590> would<00:02:25.769> affect<00:02:26.010> our

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
the Mormon Church it would affect our

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.370 
the Mormon Church it would affect our
family<00:02:26.519> as<00:02:26.640> well<00:02:26.760> because<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:28.110> sense<00:02:28.290> a

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
family as well because in the sense a

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.860 
family as well because in the sense a
patient's<00:02:28.769> interconnected<00:02:29.519> and<00:02:29.870> it's

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
patient's interconnected and it's

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.600 
patient's interconnected and it's
important<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.500> allow<00:02:31.769> them<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.130> fulfill<00:02:32.280> their

for<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.430> then<00:02:38.430> what<00:02:39.860> the<00:02:40.860> patient<00:02:41.220> dies

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
for it and then what the patient dies

and<00:02:41.819> in<00:02:42.269> medicine<00:02:43.170> sometimes<00:02:43.829> not<00:02:44.310> everyone

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
and in medicine sometimes not everyone

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.990 
and in medicine sometimes not everyone
can<00:02:44.850> be<00:02:44.970> saved<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.540> even<00:02:45.840> though<00:02:46.730> it<00:02:47.730> was<00:02:47.850> not

can be saved and even though it was not

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.490 
can be saved and even though it was not
because<00:02:48.269> of<00:02:48.299> medicine<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:48.900> this<00:02:49.200> person

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
because of medicine that this person

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.069 
because of medicine that this person
that<00:02:49.620> survived<00:02:50.010> but<00:02:50.370> I<00:02:50.640> feel<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.209> respecting

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
that survived but I feel that respecting

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.140 
that survived but I feel that respecting
the<00:02:52.170> religion<00:02:52.680> is<00:02:52.860> still<00:02:53.250> an<00:02:53.340> opportunity<00:02:54.000> to

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
the religion is still an opportunity to

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.720 
the religion is still an opportunity to
heal<00:02:54.570> because<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.650> patient<00:02:56.040> fulfilled<00:02:56.519> their

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
heal because the patient fulfilled their

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.350 
heal because the patient fulfilled their
needs<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.329> family

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
needs in the family

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.140 
needs in the family
better<00:02:59.110> than<00:02:59.590> us<00:03:00.130> having<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.520> deny<00:03:00.760> their

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
better than us having to deny their

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.570 
better than us having to deny their
beliefs<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.840> knowing<00:03:05.650> that<00:03:05.680> that

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
beliefs and knowing that that

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.790 
beliefs and knowing that that
transfusion<00:03:07.480> with<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:08.080> transfusion<00:03:08.770> that

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
transfusion with that transfusion that

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.300 
transfusion with that transfusion that
patient<00:03:09.460> would<00:03:09.640> be<00:03:09.850> alive<00:03:10.480> today<00:03:11.250> how<00:03:12.250> would

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
patient would be alive today how would

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.480 
patient would be alive today how would
that<00:03:12.610> make<00:03:12.850> you<00:03:13.150> feel<00:03:13.360> I<00:03:14.130> wouldn't<00:03:15.130> like<00:03:15.280> it

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
that make you feel I wouldn't like it

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.170 
that make you feel I wouldn't like it
I<00:03:15.640> would<00:03:16.480> disagree<00:03:16.600> with<00:03:17.080> it<00:03:17.230> but<00:03:17.970> again<00:03:18.970> that

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
I would disagree with it but again that

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.850 
I would disagree with it but again that
my<00:03:19.360> background<00:03:19.870> with<00:03:20.050> the<00:03:20.140> family<00:03:20.440> who's<00:03:20.650> with

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
my background with the family who's with

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.160 
my background with the family who's with
it<00:03:21.010> and<00:03:21.310> if<00:03:21.460> they<00:03:21.960> understand<00:03:22.960> that<00:03:23.050> they

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
it and if they understand that they

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.200 
it and if they understand that they
found<00:03:23.350> that<00:03:23.560> as<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:24.070> most<00:03:24.220> comforting<00:03:24.790> result

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
found that as the most comforting result

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.910 
found that as the most comforting result
and<00:03:25.510> I<00:03:25.810> think<00:03:26.020> that's<00:03:26.200> more<00:03:26.410> important

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
and I think that's more important

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.940 
and I think that's more important
because<00:03:27.750> sometimes<00:03:28.750> for<00:03:29.500> example<00:03:29.530> with<00:03:29.920> my

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
because sometimes for example with my

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.430 
because sometimes for example with my
case<00:03:30.370> when<00:03:30.580> I<00:03:30.610> lost<00:03:30.820> my<00:03:31.090> mother<00:03:31.330> there<00:03:31.990> was<00:03:32.200> no

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
case when I lost my mother there was no

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.780 
case when I lost my mother there was no
answer<00:03:32.950> medically<00:03:33.730> or<00:03:34.090> faith<00:03:34.540> wise<00:03:34.780> and

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
answer medically or faith wise and

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.770 
answer medically or faith wise and
sometimes<00:03:36.790> things<00:03:37.120> are<00:03:37.330> going<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.570> end<00:03:37.600> a

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
sometimes things are going to end a

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.270 
sometimes things are going to end a
certain<00:03:38.050> way<00:03:38.110> you<00:03:38.140> don't<00:03:38.470> want<00:03:38.680> that<00:03:38.830> I<00:03:39.100> don't

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
certain way you don't want that I don't

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.699 
certain way you don't want that I don't
know<00:03:39.370> how<00:03:39.490> the<00:03:39.550> physician<00:03:40.000> took<00:03:40.240> that<00:03:40.480> but<00:03:41.380> in

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
know how the physician took that but in

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.430 
know how the physician took that but in
this<00:03:42.280> example<00:03:42.700> I<00:03:43.090> think<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:44.050> family

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
this example I think that the family

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.800 
this example I think that the family
being<00:03:44.620> comforted<00:03:45.220> is<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.970> big<00:03:46.240> component<00:03:46.450> to

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
being comforted is a big component to

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.640 
being comforted is a big component to
being<00:03:46.959> a<00:03:47.050> physician<00:03:47.260> in<00:03:47.709> healing<00:03:48.190> a<00:03:48.280> community

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
being a physician in healing a community

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.670 
being a physician in healing a community
okay

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.380 

most<00:03:53.680> of<00:03:53.830> the<00:03:53.950> questions<00:03:54.130> I<00:03:54.400> had<00:03:54.610> for<00:03:54.640> you<00:03:54.910> do

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
most of the questions I had for you do

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.570 
most of the questions I had for you do
you<00:03:55.420> have<00:03:55.690> any<00:03:55.840> questions<00:03:56.320> for<00:03:56.620> me<00:03:56.800> I<00:03:59.580> was

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
you have any questions for me I was

my<00:04:18.609> opinion<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:19.269> place<00:04:19.900> where<00:04:20.140> I<00:04:20.169> you<00:04:21.160> know

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
my opinion the place where I you know

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.480 
my opinion the place where I you know
spend<00:04:21.970> most<00:04:22.240> of<00:04:22.419> my<00:04:22.600> lifetime<00:04:23.520> most

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
spend most of my lifetime most

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.700 
spend most of my lifetime most
and<00:04:26.380> I've<00:04:27.380> been<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.220> other<00:04:29.710> medical

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
and I've been to the other medical

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.430 
and I've been to the other medical
schools<00:04:30.830> before<00:04:31.370> I<00:04:32.090> think<00:04:32.690> that<00:04:33.050> by

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
schools before I think that by

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.230 
schools before I think that by
comparison<00:04:34.009> I<00:04:34.400> think<00:04:34.460> we<00:04:34.849> have<00:04:34.970> one<00:04:35.120> of<00:04:35.210> the

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
comparison I think we have one of the

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.180 
comparison I think we have one of the
better<00:04:35.449> ones<00:04:36.130> we<00:04:37.130> take<00:04:37.280> great<00:04:37.550> pride<00:04:37.819> and<00:04:39.910> the

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
better ones we take great pride and the

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.779 
better ones we take great pride and the
instructors<00:04:43.190> that<00:04:43.340> are<00:04:43.400> here<00:04:43.639> in<00:04:43.729> the

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
instructors that are here in the

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.180 
instructors that are here in the
professors<00:04:44.210> that<00:04:44.240> are<00:04:44.419> here<00:04:44.630> and<00:04:44.810> I<00:04:45.800> think

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
professors that are here and I think

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.219 
professors that are here and I think
that<00:04:46.460> we<00:04:46.759> are<00:04:48.669> you<00:04:49.669> know<00:04:49.789> my<00:04:50.060> opinion<00:04:50.330> one<00:04:51.199> of

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
that we are you know my opinion one of

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.800 
that we are you know my opinion one of
the<00:04:51.319> best<00:04:51.560> that<00:04:51.949> there<00:04:52.099> is<00:04:52.160> our<00:04:52.370> own<00:04:52.810> San

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
the best that there is our own San

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.020 
the best that there is our own San
Antonio<00:04:54.199> I<00:04:54.229> think<00:04:54.500> because<00:04:54.800> of<00:04:54.979> its<00:04:55.160> locality

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
Antonio I think because of its locality

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.790 
Antonio I think because of its locality
and<00:04:56.180> because<00:04:56.479> of<00:04:56.509> its<00:04:56.780> culture<00:04:57.319> and<00:04:57.560> because

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
and because of its culture and because

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.890 
and because of its culture and because
of<00:04:57.830> its<00:04:58.130> it's<00:04:59.919> just<00:05:00.919> it's<00:05:01.190> it's<00:05:01.970> to<00:05:02.539> all<00:05:02.720> the

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
of its it's just it's it's to all the

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.189 
of its it's just it's it's to all the
different<00:05:03.199> diversity<00:05:03.590> that's<00:05:03.770> here<00:05:03.860> I<00:05:04.039> think

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
different diversity that's here I think

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.700 
different diversity that's here I think
creates<00:05:06.199> an<00:05:06.560> environment<00:05:07.130> that<00:05:08.169> attacks<00:05:09.169> of

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
creates an environment that attacks of

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.700 
creates an environment that attacks of
students<00:05:10.099> and<00:05:10.280> keeps<00:05:10.520> them<00:05:10.699> here<00:05:10.910> and

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
students and keeps them here and

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.010 
students and keeps them here and
provides<00:05:12.710> for<00:05:13.039> not<00:05:13.310> only<00:05:13.430> our<00:05:13.639> very<00:05:14.020> excellent

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
provides for not only our very excellent

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.100 
provides for not only our very excellent
a<00:05:15.259> Hayek<00:05:15.710> excellent<00:05:16.490> education<00:05:17.000> but<00:05:17.570> a<00:05:17.599> really

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
a Hayek excellent education but a really

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.339 
a Hayek excellent education but a really
good<00:05:18.320> atmosphere<00:05:19.159> for<00:05:20.500> growth<00:05:21.500> and<00:05:23.289> so<00:05:24.289> I

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
good atmosphere for growth and so I

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.010 
good atmosphere for growth and so I
think<00:05:24.500> that<00:05:24.860> this<00:05:25.099> would<00:05:25.310> be<00:05:25.460> a<00:05:26.389> my<00:05:26.750> thing

really<00:05:27.979> the<00:05:28.130> choice<00:05:28.430> of<00:05:28.639> this

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:28.969 
really the choice of this

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:31.209 
really the choice of this
