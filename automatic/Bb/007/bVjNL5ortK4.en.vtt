 don't scare that you are there for something 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.680
 English language in principle is not to have 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.789
 no value waiting until plunged 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.879
 means the game does not require any 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.960
 registration in it 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.969

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.869
 so this game is happening initially you 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.970
 there will be only this simplest fish 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.610
 fishing rod and here it is vacation namaz 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.090
 Drigo means now we choose the cursor 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.689
 where to drop the float and 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.170
 press the left mouse button abandoned 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.170
 we wait 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:39.240
 After biting the left mouse button you need 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:40.170
 hook that does not bite the way pay 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.270
 Attention 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:49.560
 it is possible it is possible right-to-left we tighten 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.860
 pull up the direction at the fishing pole itself and 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.970
 look pikes disk reds yes she 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.190
 turns red it means she 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.590
 ready to burst and excessive 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.570
 the voltage therefore turns red 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.140
 stop winding and wait while she 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.850
 a little goes out and so we have there 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.060
 in my opinion whether it is one and a half or two minutes 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.620
 to catch as much as possible 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.940
 here is the time by the way is the top countdown 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.909
 see from petty you again red risk 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.170
 waited for different 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.170
 so vyvivaem slowly 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:34.739
 so 2 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.739
 43 seconds left 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.719
 honestly I do not understand smashed than what 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:46.109
 between casting far and close not 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:55.450
 noticed that there would be graves and 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:58.030
 more so now here add 22 more 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.889
 seconds, we bite something and show at the same time 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.419
 then a second vacation there is a fish 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.459
 more serious and 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:06.010
 original fishing rod but harder 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.939
 to catch in my mind the same carp catch 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:17.099
 was a member 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:22.680

 in the same way we conduct 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:44.240
 when I first sat down to play this game I 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.449
 spent about an hour and a half 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.009

 take too ripped off immediately excellent 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.080
