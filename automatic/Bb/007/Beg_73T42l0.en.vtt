these days however I would definitely

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:29.389

film<00:01:37.200> there<00:01:37.530> was<00:01:37.619> also<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.979> good<00:01:38.219> amount<00:01:38.399> of

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
film there was also a good amount of

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.429 
film there was also a good amount of
censorship<00:01:38.969> which<00:01:39.329> actually<00:01:39.600> happened<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.319> it

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
censorship which actually happened in it

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.469 
censorship which actually happened in it
as<00:01:40.590> well<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.280> for<00:01:41.459> example<00:01:41.490> when<00:01:42.060> someone<00:01:42.389> was

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
as well so for example when someone was

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.359 
as well so for example when someone was
say<00:01:42.689> blasted<00:01:43.289> through<00:01:43.530> their<00:01:43.679> body<00:01:43.950> there

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
say blasted through their body there

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.160 
say blasted through their body there
would<00:01:44.490> be<00:01:44.520> no<00:01:44.639> visible<00:01:45.299> hole<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:45.899> there<00:01:46.049> would

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
would be no visible hole but there would

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.050 
would be no visible hole but there would
be<00:01:46.200> something<00:01:46.770> there<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.219> would<00:01:47.549> be<00:01:47.670> akin<00:01:47.999> to

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
be something there that would be akin to

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.569 
be something there that would be akin to
a<00:01:48.359> hole<00:01:48.749> like<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> burn<00:01:49.409> mark<00:01:49.439> other<00:01:50.130> than<00:01:50.399> that

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
a hole like a burn mark other than that

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.499 
a hole like a burn mark other than that
I<00:01:50.609> would<00:01:50.850> definitely<00:01:50.939> say<00:01:51.240> that<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
I would definitely say that the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.660 
I would definitely say that the
animation<00:01:51.990> was<00:01:52.109> very<00:01:52.409> solid<00:01:52.979> now<00:01:53.219> moving<00:01:53.520> on

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
animation was very solid now moving on

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.789 
animation was very solid now moving on
to<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.819> actual<00:01:54.240> crux<00:01:54.719> of<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.170> film<00:01:55.469> which<00:01:55.770> is

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
to the actual crux of this film which is

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.919 
to the actual crux of this film which is
the<00:01:56.130> story<00:01:56.520> plot<00:01:57.029> and<00:01:57.299> character<00:01:57.899> development

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
the story plot and character development

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.169 
the story plot and character development
this<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.740> actually<00:01:59.099> where<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.369> film<00:01:59.639> tends<00:01:59.969> to

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
this is actually where the film tends to

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.120 
this is actually where the film tends to
suffer<00:02:00.599> the<00:02:00.779> most<00:02:00.990> now<00:02:01.529> although<00:02:01.770> there's

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
suffer the most now although there's

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.230 
suffer the most now although there's
definitely<00:02:02.459> a<00:02:02.549> number<00:02:02.789> of<00:02:02.880> interesting

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
definitely a number of interesting

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.080 
definitely a number of interesting
action<00:02:03.899> set<00:02:04.229> pieces<00:02:04.560> as<00:02:05.009> well<00:02:05.039> as<00:02:05.399> scenarios

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
action set pieces as well as scenarios

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.630 
action set pieces as well as scenarios
and<00:02:06.359> the<00:02:06.599> idea<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.469> story<00:02:07.770> itself<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.459> a

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
and the idea of the story itself of a

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.249 
and the idea of the story itself of a
villain<00:02:09.000> actually<00:02:09.330> being<00:02:09.539> brought<00:02:09.810> back<00:02:09.990> to

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
villain actually being brought back to

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.080 
villain actually being brought back to
life<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.709> then<00:02:10.860> training<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.550> combat<00:02:11.910> his

life and then training to combat his

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.030 
life and then training to combat his
enemy<00:02:12.570> which<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.870> kind<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.260> inverse<00:02:13.830> of

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
enemy which is kind of the inverse of

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.620 
enemy which is kind of the inverse of
what<00:02:14.190> we<00:02:14.280> typically<00:02:14.550> see<00:02:14.670> in<00:02:14.910> Dragon<00:02:15.450> Ball<00:02:15.480> Z

whatsoever<00:03:12.450> nor<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.410> explained<00:03:14.010> as<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.340> how

whatsoever nor is it explained as to how

whatsoever nor is it explained as to how
it<00:03:14.730> works<00:03:15.030> but<00:03:15.600> I<00:03:15.660> would<00:03:15.810> have<00:03:15.990> to<00:03:16.020> say<00:03:16.170> that

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
it works but I would have to say that

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.470 
it works but I would have to say that
overall<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.340> biggest<00:03:17.670> problem<00:03:18.150> with<00:03:18.330> this

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
overall the biggest problem with this

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.020 
overall the biggest problem with this
film<00:03:18.900> is<00:03:19.110> lack<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.530> tension<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.520> the<00:03:20.670> fact<00:03:20.940> that

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
film is lack of tension in the fact that

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.840 
film is lack of tension in the fact that
all<00:03:21.300> of<00:03:21.450> it<00:03:21.540> in<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.870> end<00:03:22.050> feels<00:03:22.380> pointless

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
all of it in the end feels pointless

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.950 
all of it in the end feels pointless
despite<00:03:23.850> earlier<00:03:24.240> in<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.480> film<00:03:24.690> them

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
despite earlier in the film them

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.900 
despite earlier in the film them
instituting<00:03:25.650> stakes<00:03:26.070> which<00:03:26.370> could<00:03:26.580> certainly

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
instituting stakes which could certainly

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.510 
instituting stakes which could certainly
improve<00:03:27.450> upon<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.960> drama<00:03:28.350> later<00:03:28.980> in<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.280> film

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
improve upon the drama later in the film

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.580 
improve upon the drama later in the film
they<00:03:29.730> no<00:03:29.940> longer<00:03:30.150> seem<00:03:30.570> to<00:03:30.720> really<00:03:30.900> matter<00:03:31.260> all

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
they no longer seem to really matter all

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.680 
they no longer seem to really matter all
too<00:03:31.830> much<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.430> unfortunately<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:33.240> film<00:03:33.480> goes

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
too much and unfortunately the film goes

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.690 
too much and unfortunately the film goes
out<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:33.930> its<00:03:34.080> way<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.350> dispel<00:03:34.860> any<00:03:35.070> tension

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
out of its way to dispel any tension

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.580 
out of its way to dispel any tension
which<00:03:35.850> could<00:03:36.060> arise<00:03:36.300> as<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.600> result<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:37.200> them<00:03:37.440> so

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
which could arise as a result of them so

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.840 
which could arise as a result of them so
you<00:03:37.680> definitely<00:03:37.890> shouldn't<00:03:38.280> come<00:03:38.520> into<00:03:38.760> this

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
you definitely shouldn't come into this

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.790 
you definitely shouldn't come into this
film<00:03:39.150> expecting<00:03:39.750> something<00:03:40.020> like<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.350> super

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800

perfect cell vs an injured teen gohan in

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.350

tension<00:03:48.030> all<00:03:48.270> drama<00:03:48.720> that<00:03:48.990> would<00:03:49.110> accompany

this tension in the action set-pieces

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.930 
this tension in the action set-pieces
makes<00:03:51.930> them<00:03:52.140> all<00:03:52.380> fall<00:03:52.770> flat<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.670> although

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
definitely have to say it really isn't

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.480 
definitely have to say it really isn't
worth<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.080> price<00:04:34.440> that<00:04:34.710> you<00:04:34.860> would<00:04:34.890> pay<00:04:35.190> to<00:04:35.250> go
