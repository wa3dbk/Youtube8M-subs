00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
might lack a little of his intensity

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.690 
might lack a little of his intensity
which<00:02:12.340> was<00:02:12.610> which<00:02:13.180> was<00:02:13.330> very<00:02:13.480> special<00:02:14.550> but<00:02:15.550> it

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
which was which was very special but it

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.430 
which was which was very special but it
does<00:02:15.850> allow<00:02:16.090> us<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.360> put<00:02:16.570> ourselves<00:02:16.690> into<00:02:17.230> the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.160 

let's<00:02:25.940> take<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.180> look<00:02:26.390> at<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.600> quarter<00:02:26.990> going

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
let's take a look at the quarter going

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.700 
let's take a look at the quarter going
to<00:02:27.260> use<00:02:28.180> first<00:02:29.180> of<00:02:29.360> all<00:02:29.480> I<00:02:29.630> use<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.840> long<00:02:30.170> a<00:02:30.440> in

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
to use first of all I use a long a in

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.280 
to use first of all I use a long a in
this<00:02:30.980> form<00:02:33.520> but<00:02:34.520> often<00:02:34.880> I<00:02:35.120> use<00:02:35.930> my<00:02:36.110> little

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
this form but often I use my little

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.510 
this form but often I use my little
finger<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:37.010> hold<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.310> last<00:02:37.490> two<00:02:37.820> strings<00:02:38.180> down

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
finger to hold the last two strings down

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.490 
finger to hold the last two strings down
this<00:02:40.520> is<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:40.730> line<00:02:40.970> in<00:02:41.150> Hopkins<00:02:41.630> trick<00:02:41.990> which

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
this is a line in Hopkins trick which

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.920 
this is a line in Hopkins trick which
gives<00:02:42.800> a<00:02:42.980> really<00:02:43.430> nice<00:02:43.610> effect

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.990 

you'll<00:02:49.930> notice<00:02:50.170> throughout<00:02:50.710> this<00:02:51.010> song<00:02:51.340> that

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
you'll notice throughout this song that

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.390 
you'll notice throughout this song that
the<00:02:52.150> thumb<00:02:52.420> is<00:02:52.870> striking<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:54.190> bass

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
the thumb is striking the the bass

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.610 
the thumb is striking the the bass
strings<00:02:54.670> quite<00:02:55.060> heavily<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:56.050> very<00:02:56.350> often

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
strings quite heavily and very often

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:13.290 
strings quite heavily and very often
damping<00:02:57.340> as<00:02:57.670> soon<00:02:57.880> as<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.150> strikes<00:03:12.240> is<00:03:13.240> a

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
damping as soon as it strikes is a

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.970 
damping as soon as it strikes is a
strange<00:03:13.690> kind<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:14.080> technique<00:03:14.500> because<00:03:14.800> if<00:03:14.920> you

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
strange kind of technique because if you

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.860 
strange kind of technique because if you
do<00:03:15.100> too<00:03:15.340> hard<00:03:15.610> the<00:03:15.850> strings<00:03:16.180> bus<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.810> they

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
do too hard the strings bus and they

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.290 
do too hard the strings bus and they
don't<00:03:17.050> make<00:03:17.170> a<00:03:17.200> very<00:03:17.440> nice<00:03:17.680> nice<00:03:18.070> noise<00:03:18.400> so<00:03:19.120> the

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
don't make a very nice nice noise so the

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.790 
don't make a very nice nice noise so the
down<00:03:19.510> thing<00:03:19.750> with<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:19.960> farm<00:03:20.230> is<00:03:20.410> a<00:03:20.440> little<00:03:20.680> bit

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
down thing with the farm is a little bit

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.190 
down thing with the farm is a little bit
critical<00:03:21.040> but<00:03:21.970> it<00:03:22.090> provides<00:03:22.960> this<00:03:24.570> boom<00:03:25.570> the

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
critical but it provides this boom the

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.440 
critical but it provides this boom the
nice<00:03:26.410> driving<00:03:27.100> bass<00:03:27.370> beat<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:27.970> gives<00:03:28.180> it<00:03:28.300> a<00:03:28.330> lot

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
nice driving bass beat it gives it a lot

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.200 
nice driving bass beat it gives it a lot
of<00:03:28.570> intensity<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:29.590> of<00:03:29.890> course<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.730> treble

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
of intensity and of course the treble

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.210 
of intensity and of course the treble
notes<00:03:31.360> with<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.750> fingers<00:03:32.200> provide<00:03:32.860> an<00:03:33.010> answer

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
notes with the fingers provide an answer

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:51.240 
notes with the fingers provide an answer
to<00:03:33.730> that<00:03:33.760> bass

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:04:24.270 

you

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.030 

and<00:04:25.280> as<00:04:25.400> we<00:04:25.550> move<00:04:25.699> onto<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.090> d7<00:04:26.780> we<00:04:27.500> open<00:04:27.919> the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
and as we move onto the d7 we open the

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.879 
and as we move onto the d7 we open the
base<00:04:28.220> and<00:04:28.520> then<00:04:28.669> put<00:04:28.880> our<00:04:29.000> phone<00:04:29.240> back<00:04:29.479> on<00:04:29.889> in

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
base and then put our phone back on in

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.980 
base and then put our phone back on in
that<00:04:31.100> way<00:04:31.310> which<00:04:32.000> is<00:04:32.120> a<00:04:32.150> nice<00:04:32.389> percussive

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
that way which is a nice percussive

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:39.490

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
effect and now we come to the section

effect and now we come to the section
where<00:04:39.530> we're<00:04:39.710> going<00:04:39.860> to<00:04:39.919> play<00:04:40.070> d7<00:04:40.699> again<00:04:41.000> and
