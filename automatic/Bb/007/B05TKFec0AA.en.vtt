think we were just lucky together but I

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:39.959 
think we were just lucky together but I
did<00:01:38.590> find<00:01:38.799> that<00:01:39.009> there<00:01:39.369> are<00:01:39.399> two<00:01:39.579> different

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
did find that there are two different

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.779 
did find that there are two different
kinds<00:01:40.090> of<00:01:40.420> ear<00:01:40.899> bud<00:01:41.499> one<00:01:41.950> is<00:01:42.100> a<00:01:42.130> sort<00:01:42.399> of<00:01:42.429> thick

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
kinds of ear bud one is a sort of thick

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.450 
kinds of ear bud one is a sort of thick
spongy<00:01:43.509> black<00:01:43.719> right<00:01:44.289> yeah<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:44.799> the<00:01:45.130> other<00:01:45.280> is

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
spongy black right yeah and the other is

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.190 
spongy black right yeah and the other is
more<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.759> a<00:01:45.819> hollow<00:01:46.030> kind<00:01:46.359> of<00:01:46.420> mushroom<00:01:46.749> caps<00:01:46.990> I

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
more of a hollow kind of mushroom caps I

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.719 
more of a hollow kind of mushroom caps I
think<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.710> whole<00:01:47.889> a<00:01:47.950> mushroom<00:01:48.310> cap<00:01:48.460> is<00:01:48.579> much

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
think the whole a mushroom cap is much

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.370 
think the whole a mushroom cap is much
easier<00:01:48.759> to<00:01:49.060> get<00:01:49.210> in<00:01:49.299> your<00:01:49.359> ear<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.719> you<00:01:50.139> feel

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
easier to get in your ear and you feel

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.139 
easier to get in your ear and you feel
much<00:01:50.560> less<00:01:50.770> nervous<00:01:51.069> about<00:01:51.280> it<00:01:51.460> just<00:01:51.579> staying

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
much less nervous about it just staying

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:53.639 
much less nervous about it just staying
there<00:01:52.389> forever<00:01:52.539> which<00:01:53.020> is<00:01:53.200> of<00:01:53.350> course<00:01:53.380> the

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
there forever which is of course the

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.010 
there forever which is of course the
fear<00:01:53.799> that<00:01:53.889> we<00:01:54.009> will<00:01:54.039> have<00:01:54.159> so<00:01:55.149> we<00:01:55.600> have<00:01:55.780> no

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
fear that we will have so we have no

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.740 
fear that we will have so we have no
doubt<00:01:56.289> that<00:01:56.319> she<00:01:56.619> lost<00:01:56.889> about<00:01:57.130> this<00:01:57.280> is<00:01:57.429> no

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
doubt that she lost about this is no

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.600 
doubt that she lost about this is no
ever<00:01:58.140> possibly<00:01:58.560> get<00:01:58.710> lost<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.190> your<00:01:59.250> grave

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
ever possibly get lost in your grave

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.000 
ever possibly get lost in your grave
this<00:01:59.910> is<00:02:00.090> very<00:02:00.330> very<00:02:00.420> true<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:01.350> be

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
this is very very true that be

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.950 
this is very very true that be
nonetheless<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.910> think<00:02:02.940> paranoid<00:02:03.510> does<00:02:03.720> strike

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
nonetheless I think paranoid does strike

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.450 
nonetheless I think paranoid does strike
yes<00:02:04.260> if<00:02:04.560> you're<00:02:04.740> willing<00:02:04.980> to<00:02:05.010> get<00:02:05.190> over<00:02:05.370> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
yes if you're willing to get over the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.010 
yes if you're willing to get over the
paranoia<00:02:05.850> they<00:02:06.150> do<00:02:06.210> work<00:02:06.510> extremely<00:02:06.870> well

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
paranoia they do work extremely well

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.450 
paranoia they do work extremely well
would<00:02:07.260> you<00:02:07.380> say<00:02:07.440> having<00:02:07.860> looked<00:02:08.130> at<00:02:08.250> noise

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
would you say having looked at noise

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.650 
would you say having looked at noise
canceling<00:02:08.789> headphones<00:02:08.820> just<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.420> other<00:02:09.570> way

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
canceling headphones just the other way

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.609 
canceling headphones just the other way
could<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.929> say<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.200> these<00:02:10.410> are<00:02:10.560> actually

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
starting I prefer the in-ear box so that

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.210 
starting I prefer the in-ear box so that
the<00:02:15.120> huge<00:02:15.390> kind<00:02:15.660> of<00:02:15.750> fluid<00:02:16.350> cattle<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:16.950> there
