00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.710
 And then people are beautiful, I 'm Carlos. 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.660
 perfect auto electric and mechanical car and 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.349
 Today I'm going to give you a nice tip. 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.949
 how to proceed in the exchange of cables 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.780
 candle cover and the candles ok of the monza 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.000
 cadet and pan 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.949
 Let's suppose you went to change the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.769
 cables and the candles and when it is 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:46.260
 linking here you got lost in the 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.300
 the position of connecting the cables and you 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.690
 start the car is giving that esp 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.189
 little and does not handle 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.869
 so I 'm going to give you a tip to 

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:57.839
 You're not getting lost. 

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:59.430
 ok if you get lost I'll show you 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.670
 You here to put the cars in the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.350
 right position right here is as follows 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.729
 just to understand you a little bit 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.759
 cables he has the right order and you are 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.310
 seeing here belt side the count 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:20.100
 cylinder always starts on the side of the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:23.070
 belt in case it would be here 1234 would be 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.130
 to the four candles right always starts from 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.119
 here on the left side of the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.890
 there is an axis that rotates the rotor 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.499
 that is inside this part can 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.350
 distribute them all in the right cables 

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:39.240
 she leaves this coil body to the pin 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.240
 center and the pi on the central 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.259
 turn to distribute to candles 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:50.069
 right and here is the meaning of 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:54.799
 motor rotation here is felt 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:57.780
 anti-clockwise beauty anti-clockwise 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.759
 sure if you put it here in the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.619
 time will not work, the car will go 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.779
 getting a little and will not get 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.619
 so always connect the cables in the 

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:12.890
 anti-clockwise and the order of explosion 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.890
 of the cylinder that would be like this would be 1 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:21.300
 342 ok by repeating the deletion order of 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:27.030
 monza kadett ipanema ignition order 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:29.319
 would be right 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.349
 and here is the following 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:35.079
 for we put the cable in the lid here 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.819
 at the time of the correct explosion 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.340
 We always were, let's get this. 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.260
 first pina here what is located 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:49.769
 no screw here 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:51.040
 O follows here there would be so O 1342 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:57.129
 beauty 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:03:00.430
 come on again 13 42 that would be order 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.439
 right cylinder explosion here is the 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.810
 next for you to know if the car 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:08.530
 is on point to see if the 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.680
 Your car here is a good tip. 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.709
 basic you do what you remove to 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.169
 and there will be the first right cylinder 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.480
 while a screwdriver you engage 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:21.239
 fifth gear , you start to spin in the 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.799
 time that the piston is get up there 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:28.719
 you know that there will be the only engine 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:35.669
 this is going to be the first cylinder 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:38.319
 right here the quiet engine 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:41.530
 this tip here until it is facing to 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:44.019
 attack towards the screw here that 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.000
 would be the first right cylinder if you 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.189
 has doubt to tear off the veil of the first 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.549
 following at the time that the cylinder 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:55.060
 in pm s that are already there 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:58.180
 you look here the sense of the way out 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.599
 of the rotor had no rotor output stop 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:06.579
 would be the first cylinder ok 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:08.979
 There we are going to count 11 342 okay. 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:12.430
 counter clockwise not clockwise 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:14.620
 right anti-clockwise direction if you 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.000
 lost in that is there another tip you 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.930
 is looking here 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.609
 central and middle opino and the rotor it 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.600
 goes running to distribute hundreds 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.560
 to get them right 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.740
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.370
 Super tip there if in case you get lost it 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.190
 there is the little way of is switching the 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.760
 cables candles sure if you have my doubt 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.010
 takes on the mechanic of your confidence asks

 Headache 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.639
 Correct, I hope you have 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.040
