it<00:00:38.129> was<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> very<00:00:38.489> rare<00:00:38.760> system<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:40.050> if<00:00:41.010> I

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
it was a very rare system so if I

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.069 
it was a very rare system so if I
understand<00:00:41.730> correctly<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:42.329> system<00:00:42.989> was

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
understand correctly this system was

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.440 
understand correctly this system was
semi<00:00:43.350> popular<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> little<00:00:44.730> bit<00:00:44.820> more<00:00:44.940> popular

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
semi popular a little bit more popular

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.660 
semi popular a little bit more popular
in<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.870> state<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.170> known<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.129> Europe<00:00:47.309> than<00:00:47.550> it

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
in the state in known in Europe than it

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.369 
in the state in known in Europe than it
was<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> States<00:00:48.270> even<00:00:48.570> more<00:00:48.870> popular<00:00:49.079> in

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
was in the States even more popular in

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.080 
was in the States even more popular in
Australia<00:00:49.440> if<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.129> understand<00:00:50.550> correctly<00:00:50.610> and

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
Australia if I understand correctly and

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.080 
Australia if I understand correctly and
extremely<00:00:51.539> popular<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.140> Brazil<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:52.879> my<00:00:53.879> point

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
extremely popular in Brazil so my point

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.610 
extremely popular in Brazil so my point
is<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.570> because<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.170> wasn't<00:00:55.440> popular

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
is is that because it wasn't popular

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.959 
is is that because it wasn't popular
with<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> states<00:00:56.129> there<00:00:56.370> weren't<00:00:56.730> very<00:00:56.760> many

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
with the states there weren't very many

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.260 
with the states there weren't very many
titles<00:00:57.390> for<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.770> lot<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.670> titles<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.120> i

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.460 
it's like a five dollar for dollar title
I<00:06:42.580> think<00:06:42.790> I<00:06:42.880> even<00:06:43.060> seen<00:06:43.300> it<00:06:43.479> go<00:06:43.840> for<00:06:44.050> like<00:06:44.169> two

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
I think I even seen it go for like two

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.540 
I think I even seen it go for like two
bucks<00:06:44.770> or<00:06:45.039> something<00:06:45.160> are<00:06:45.400> gone<00:06:47.220> so<00:06:48.220> yeah<00:06:48.400> that

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
bucks or something are gone so yeah that

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.010 
bucks or something are gone so yeah that
pretty<00:06:48.699> much<00:06:48.820> I<00:06:49.120> think<00:06:49.180> covers<00:06:49.600> it<00:06:49.720> besides

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020 
pretty much I think covers it besides

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.330 
pretty much I think covers it besides
chocolate<00:06:50.259> or<00:06:50.620> haven't<00:06:50.919> mentioned<00:06:51.250> that

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340
