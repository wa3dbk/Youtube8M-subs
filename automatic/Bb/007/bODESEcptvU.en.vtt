00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.320 
looks like a Type B nice theory although
we're<00:07:16.500> both<00:07:16.530> type<00:07:16.980> p<00:07:17.190> and<00:07:17.460> we're<00:07:17.730> sort<00:07:17.910> of<00:07:18.060> twin

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.330 
we're both type p and we're sort of twin

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.840 
we're both type p and we're sort of twin
so<00:07:18.690> there's<00:07:18.900> now<00:07:19.080> yeah<00:07:19.560> that's<00:07:19.890> right<00:07:20.160> my<00:07:20.550> dad

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:20.850 
so there's now yeah that's right my dad

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.190 
so there's now yeah that's right my dad
and<00:07:21.180> while<00:07:21.360> we're<00:07:21.540> on<00:07:21.570> it<00:07:21.810> you're<00:07:21.930> a<00:07:21.990> bigger

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:22.200 
and while we're on it you're a bigger

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.200 
and while we're on it you're a bigger
slacker<00:07:22.530> than<00:07:22.830> I<00:07:22.950> am<00:07:23.160> there<00:07:23.490> are<00:07:23.669> several<00:07:23.970> ways

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.210 
slacker than I am there are several ways

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.060 
slacker than I am there are several ways
of<00:07:24.419> predicting<00:07:24.840> personality<00:07:25.500> types<00:07:25.770> such<00:07:26.040> as

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:26.070 
of predicting personality types such as

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:31.040 
of predicting personality types such as
using<00:07:26.400> animals<00:07:27.000> or<00:07:27.150> even<00:07:27.180> sushi<00:07:27.900> sushi<00:07:30.050> here

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.050 
using animals or even sushi sushi here

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.070 
using animals or even sushi sushi here
