00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.509 
think we all have regrets and our first
relationship<00:04:15.500> because<00:04:15.830> we're<00:04:16.010> clueless<00:04:16.190> so

no<00:04:18.410> one<00:04:18.560> tells<00:04:18.799> you<00:04:19.070> is<00:04:19.130> not<00:04:19.310> something<00:04:19.459> that

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
no one tells you is not something that

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.120 
no one tells you is not something that
you<00:04:19.910> can<00:04:20.090> just<00:04:20.120> read<00:04:20.540> off<00:04:20.570> a<00:04:20.750> book<00:04:21.130> something
