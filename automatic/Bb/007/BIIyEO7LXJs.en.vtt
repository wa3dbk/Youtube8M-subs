that<00:01:49.539> into<00:01:50.539> the<00:01:50.659> Sun<00:01:51.490> structure<00:01:53.409> it<00:01:54.409> will

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
that into the Sun structure it will

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:03.730 
that into the Sun structure it will
probably<00:01:54.920> be<00:01:55.759> cut<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.979> shape<00:02:02.289> or<00:02:03.289> the<00:02:03.530> wrong

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.130 
probably be cut the shape or the wrong
shape<00:02:04.069> or<00:02:04.610> maybe<00:02:04.939> not<00:02:05.179> because<00:02:05.539> we<00:02:05.750> didn't<00:02:05.990> do

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140
