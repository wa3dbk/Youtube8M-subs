00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.380
 good morning diagonally deadline bad 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.370
 I present you in today 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.150
 13 17 but first tests age of 13 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.080
 to 16 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.369
 snapshot and indeed took tags so 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.840
 nameplates can be the nameplates 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.220
 not be scratched they can only be in 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.050
 Banks are found 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.670
 but what sense do they have except one 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.009
 to be old that further us 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.110
 metal too mild the nameplates can 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.260
 should be renamed at the amboss 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.240
 then to order it with a right click 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.980
 animals to call and now 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.660
 we hardly have 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.910
 So they are there to do that , too 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.040
 normal minecraft mode sometime 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.330
 renaming any animals can do both 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.910
 usually only with 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.830
 renamed the pony and one in the 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.840
 Survival mode usually no trace 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.280
 it is still to be noted that all 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.020
 animals that got a name 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.460
 not this tomorrow forever 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.230
 stay as well as ten animals 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.180
 that is next to rename the zombie 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.530
 then he will stay with me unless 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.570
 he somehow burns but pure 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.920
 theoretically it stays that way forever 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.509
 you could also for adventure maps 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.979
 if you want to use for example 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.080
 that to a very specific place 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.550
 a certain kind of mob remains 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.050
 all the time no matter what happens and you 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.790
 do not want to rely on that 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.260
 Build this mob if and when 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.850
 the player just happens to come to him 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.430
 I hope you understand what I am about 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.590
 my good now but to snapshot 13 to 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.960
 17, if one wants a carpet of 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.060
 force now gives you three carpets instead 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.159
 only one was a new one 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.710
 added blog and hard and play 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.870
 in german hardened life 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.450
 that's just a brown one 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.490
 finished block not more 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.140
 At the moment he has absolutely no sense 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.260
 you can not do anything with it absolutely 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.360
 nothing rules 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.920
 the hardened block we receive 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.100
 by having a normal life blocking 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.020
 Call for advice 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.760
 Attention it must be life blocks if 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.650
 Then we will use normal life 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.270
 the well-known bricks with those 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.580
 Later we will see the brick blocks 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.110
 forces can up a new blog 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.210
 I always think of myself as being added 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.920
 First how to use the buildings 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.320
 could be one of mine now 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.869
 I did not find it that hard 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.760
 at least after all , he offers 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.930
 could give us a new brauntöne 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.970
 use and any extremes 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.700
 primitive increase people cottage too 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.140
 build or maybe for roads though 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.400
 All in all, I find this blog 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.650
 actually even a bit frack 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.240
 for the stream blog but no matter what I want 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.790
 I still sure that he us all 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.769
 new best friend will be 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.689
 see if you critically menu him 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.980
 one goes next to the respective one 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:31.780
 bloc or individually poor too 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.370
 displayed what it is exactly whether 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.200
 it is a building block or one 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.870
 decoration blog or for the 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.819
 transport here or any other 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.239
 old it is just indicated to which 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.420
 category of 1 ms heard made of the content 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.159
 Maul of the city ​​so if I times than 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.650
 free from mojang me in german 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:53.170
 translated means that from now on 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.239
 deserts less than 10 and oasis tons 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.579
 if anything, he's just on the edge of one 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.290
 However, desert lava can always be seen 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.720
 still no wonder they are 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.590
 pretty hot and there should as well 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:07.120
 we still have zombies 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.310
 so if you have no knowledge in 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.180
 English has as much as I could 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.950
 it concludes that zombies 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.720
 what has not become friendlier 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.609
 case is no it means that if 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.599
 zombies are hit or somehow 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.220
 get hurt that one 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.560
 the probability exists that new 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.510
 zombie they spawn all theirs 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.579
 call friends together and then you go 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.290
 just place in front of joke and zombie 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.669
 will write about twitter and facebook 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.669
 have attacked her help 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.319
 that's obviously a bit 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.870
 gone awry by the fact that the zombies 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.579
 get hurt from the fire spawn new ones 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.379
 Zombies in the air and fall off 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.530
 sky 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:45.329
 that's interesting that's really one 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.530
 Anyway, this is an apocalyptic scenario 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.450
 This function is still in the early stages 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.129
 beta phase right now it is so that the 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.900
 zombies spawn somewhere and there from 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.730
 Heaven can fall back later so 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.049
 be that you spawn against burgdorf where 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.150
 nobody sees it that way 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.579
 unnatural really seems like that 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.109
 suddenly emerge from the shadows 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.760
 that you could assume that you have hers 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.400
 It's always because that's not the case 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.579
 Striking is the game finished I've got 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.120
 The evening was 317 and until 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.120
 next video 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.020
 on
