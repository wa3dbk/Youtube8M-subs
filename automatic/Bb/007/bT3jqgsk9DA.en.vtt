00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.149

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.250

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.189
 subnormal driver as he forces 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.409

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.390
 well until it explodes hehehe and the 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.729
 second mystery is that if you break the 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.070
 semaphores the vehicles will start 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.200
 out of control juices you play like

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.810
 after breaking the traffic lights fuck 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:20.959

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.090
 when I focus on the angel right now in the 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.150
 maximum zoom the camera trembles alone from 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:21.269
