00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.760
 I was a bit stoned and looked at a photo fled a Danish 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.080
 it showed me and big DÃ¶hren on a Center he remembered and 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.889
 suddenly this idea came to me 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.329
 I thought Iraq that's it 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:21.220
 a modern Western two guys who roar across the country and on their machines 

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:25.289
 The maybe a big drug deal pervading rum novel novel heap 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.519
 To get money 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.879
 then they cross the country to retire in Florida 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.690
 In the end, a couple of ducks hunters came by in a pick-up truck and popped 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.070
 the two off because their look does not suit them 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.060
 in Toronto, it was half past four in the morning and the only person crazy 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.620
 enough to enjoy this idea was Dennis Hopper 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.960
 although the two often went into the wool of Dow and Hopper were the 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.600
 Biggest friends 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.250
 in Laab Ross at half past one in the morning 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.410
 From there, the phone turns and rang Hopper out of his sleep 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.260
 Pass on Malta you have to get one 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.170
 Madness that's a damn good story 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.770
 what are you doing with it 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.220
 So I think you will do the directing 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.890
 and I will produce 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.820
 We write the script together and we play the lead roles as well 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.390
 we save a lot of money 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.350
 You let me direct one man 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.000
 I do not trust me yet so you always say that want to lead through the 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.080
 and you have the necessary energy 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.080
 I want you to direct this strip 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.890
 According to Hoppe, Dow and he swore they were not stars of Rocker 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.160
 To acidify films 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.540
 they thought they were to be heard therefore Hoppers enthusiasm kept up 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.610
 border 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.650
 but until then, nothing better had offered and this movie was 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.360
 financially secured 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.010
 because from there had signed with IPIC contract for three films 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.370
 Dennis asked him 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.370
 Peter they said that he can get the money 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.890
 No, I think that's a damn good idea man 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.880
 then they discussed the drug deal 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.300
 Hopper said 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.730
 Peter that is an impossibility of putting up so much grass 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.809
 Motorcycles to transport that you could put it to rest 

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:14.079
 Son Deal would be total nonsense 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.139
 it has to be something else 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:17.829
 how about heroin 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:21.150
 No, that's not heroin world bad associations 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.619
 but how about cocaine 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:24.839
 that was the thing clarified
