here<00:00:50.510> basically<00:00:51.510> aiming<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.350> trying<00:00:52.620> to

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
here basically aiming and trying to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.490 
here basically aiming and trying to
figure<00:00:52.860> out<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.280> they'll<00:00:53.370> actually<00:00:53.640> see<00:00:53.969> them

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
figure out and they'll actually see them

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.170

takes takes a while and finally they

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.340 
takes takes a while and finally they
miss<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> ball<00:01:05.760> or<00:01:06.659> it'll<00:01:06.840> make<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> bolts

doing

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.420 
doing
whereas<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.810> might<00:01:12.960> take<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.560> professional

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
whereas you might take a professional

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.670 
whereas you might take a professional
who's<00:01:14.549> playing<00:01:14.790> real<00:01:15.000> fast<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.689> good<00:01:15.810> make<00:01:16.650> it

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
who's playing real fast and good make it

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.039 
who's playing real fast and good make it
down<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.310> then<00:01:17.400> Elise<00:01:17.640> do<00:01:18.330> one<00:01:18.600> practice

never miss a ball so how can this be and
how<00:01:25.290> can<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.560> develop<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.310> your<00:01:26.460> game

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720

and what you want to do is basically

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.910 
and what you want to do is basically

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
the ball what that does it shows you

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.690 
the ball what that does it shows you
where<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.670> are<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:51.259> your<00:01:52.259> lineup<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:53.399> begin

where you are in your lineup to begin
with<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.000> basically<00:01:54.450> tests<00:01:55.020> your<00:01:55.170> shot<00:01:55.860> making

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
with it basically tests your shot making

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.539 
with it basically tests your shot making
instinct<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.899> intuition<00:01:58.219> it<00:01:59.219> helps<00:01:59.460> you

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
instinct and intuition it helps you

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.080 
instinct and intuition it helps you
develop<00:01:59.670> that<00:02:00.229> so<00:02:01.229> what<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.469> want<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.680> do<00:02:01.770> is

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
develop that so what you want to do is

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.240 
develop that so what you want to do is
apply<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.960> bunch<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.799> different<00:02:05.070> shots

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
apply that to a bunch of different shots

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.800 
apply that to a bunch of different shots
so<00:02:06.079> extend<00:02:07.079> your<00:02:07.200> cue<00:02:07.940> about<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> foot<00:02:09.360> beyond

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
your bridge hand then line up bring it

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.309 
your bridge hand then line up bring it
down<00:02:12.599> right<00:02:12.870> into

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
down right into

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.390 
down right into
shut<00:02:13.499> and<00:02:13.829> then<00:02:14.489> pull<00:02:14.670> back<00:02:14.849> once<00:02:16.129> and<00:02:17.129> hit<00:02:17.280> the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
shut and then pull back once and hit the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.940 
shut and then pull back once and hit the
ball<00:02:17.989> we're<00:02:18.989> not<00:02:19.079> to<00:02:19.260> worry<00:02:19.439> about<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.769> cue

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
ball we're not to worry about the cue

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.099 
ball we're not to worry about the cue
ball<00:02:20.069> right<00:02:20.099> now<00:02:20.249> just<00:02:20.639> do<00:02:20.909> this<00:02:21.060> for<00:02:21.389> a<00:02:21.629> bunch

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:22.109 
ball right now just do this for a bunch

ball right now just do this for a bunch
of<00:02:22.170> different<00:02:22.469> shots<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.980> see<00:02:23.969> what<00:02:24.090> happens

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
of different shots and see what happens

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.039 
of different shots and see what happens
okay<00:02:26.189> so<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.879> idea<00:02:27.180> here<00:02:27.239> is<00:02:27.510> that<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.810> don't

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
okay so the idea here is that you don't

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.500 
okay so the idea here is that you don't
change<00:02:28.409> anything<00:02:28.939> while<00:02:29.939> you're<00:02:30.090> down<00:02:30.239> there

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
change anything while you're down there

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.629 
change anything while you're down there
shooting<00:02:30.689> the<00:02:30.930> ball<00:02:31.129> and<00:02:32.129> what<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.400> want<00:02:32.579> to

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:32.639 
shooting the ball and what you want to

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.309 
shooting the ball and what you want to
do<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:32.849> give<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.239> shot<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:33.719> what<00:02:33.870> happens<00:02:34.200> if

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
do is give it a shot so what happens if

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.699 
do is give it a shot so what happens if
you<00:02:34.439> miss<00:02:34.790> say<00:02:35.790> this<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.239> get<00:02:36.359> down<00:02:36.569> you<00:02:37.530> give

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
you miss say this you get down you give

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.270 
you miss say this you get down you give
it<00:02:37.829> your<00:02:37.950> normal<00:02:38.250> stroke<00:02:40.040> you<00:02:41.040> have<00:02:41.129> to

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
it your normal stroke you have to

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.170 
it your normal stroke you have to
observe<00:02:41.669> how<00:02:42.599> you<00:02:42.659> miss<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.109> ball<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:44.159> I<00:02:44.519> hit

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
observe how you miss the ball so I hit

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.330 
observe how you miss the ball so I hit
the<00:02:45.209> ball<00:02:45.480> too<00:02:45.959> full<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.590> then<00:02:46.799> hit<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:46.980> side

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
the ball too full and then hit that side

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.449 
the ball too full and then hit that side
of<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.519> pocket<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:49.200> now<00:02:49.379> I<00:02:49.650> want<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.040> set<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.280> up

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
of the pocket so now I want to set it up

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.409 
of the pocket so now I want to set it up
exactly<00:02:50.939> the<00:02:51.060> same<00:02:51.209> again<00:02:51.719> and<00:02:52.189> this<00:02:53.189> time<00:02:53.430> I'm

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:54.419 
exactly the same again and this time I'm

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.059 
exactly the same again and this time I'm
going<00:02:54.599> to<00:02:54.659> change<00:02:54.989> how<00:02:55.409> I<00:02:55.439> lined<00:02:55.769> up<00:02:55.919> to<00:02:56.040> the

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
going to change how I lined up to the

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.599 
going to change how I lined up to the
ball<00:02:56.780> right<00:02:57.780> away<00:02:58.019> I'm<00:02:59.010> not<00:02:59.219> going<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.459> change

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
ball right away I'm not going to change

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.479 
ball right away I'm not going to change
the<00:02:59.790> way<00:02:59.879> I<00:02:59.909> stroke<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.389> ball<00:03:01.280> or<00:03:02.280> anything

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
the way I stroke the ball or anything

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.670 
the way I stroke the ball or anything
about<00:03:02.790> my<00:03:02.939> stance<00:03:03.269> so<00:03:04.049> I<00:03:04.079> know<00:03:04.169> I<00:03:04.290> hit<00:03:04.469> it<00:03:04.500> too

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
about my stance so I know I hit it too

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.309 
about my stance so I know I hit it too
far<00:03:04.919> to<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.099> left<00:03:05.510> so<00:03:06.510> this<00:03:06.719> time<00:03:06.959> I'm<00:03:07.169> going

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
far to the left so this time I'm going

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.789 
far to the left so this time I'm going
to<00:03:07.379> aim<00:03:07.620> more<00:03:08.579> to<00:03:08.909> the<00:03:09.060> left<00:03:09.269> so<00:03:09.419> the<00:03:09.449> ball<00:03:09.689> goes

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
to aim more to the left so the ball goes

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.959 
to aim more to the left so the ball goes
more<00:03:10.799> to<00:03:10.949> the<00:03:10.980> right<00:03:11.189> and<00:03:11.250> hopefully<00:03:11.699> into<00:03:11.879> the

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:11.969 
more to the right and hopefully into the

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:14.629 
more to the right and hopefully into the
pocket<00:03:12.329> so<00:03:13.290> I'll<00:03:13.500> make<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:13.799> adjustment<00:03:13.949> on

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
pocket so I'll make that adjustment on

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:20.199 
pocket so I'll make that adjustment on
the<00:03:15.090> way<00:03:15.209> down<00:03:15.480> here<00:03:16.250> let's<00:03:17.250> see<00:03:17.400> that's<00:03:17.699> right

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.999 

okay<00:03:21.209> I<00:03:21.239> look<00:03:21.419> pretty<00:03:21.720> good<00:03:21.900> so<00:03:22.680> that's<00:03:22.859> what

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:23.009 
okay I look pretty good so that's what

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:25.069 
okay I look pretty good so that's what
you<00:03:23.069> do<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.699> basically<00:03:23.909> observe<00:03:24.659> your

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079
