00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.620
 your videos 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.840
 advanced options BIOS 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.920
 the hp 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.920
 first of all 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:31.250
 ok we come to f10 and at the same time 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.560
 manu and I did it many times I want that 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:45.160
 no more with a good robe can see 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:48.250
 the options are unlocked 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.900
 They can move what they want good 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.800
 Of course, if you know how to move because if not 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:57.379
 they know better not true 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.379
 I would like to set up my video 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.380
 good is in automatic and then to leave 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.790
 I see that he does not have 512 then 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.790
 my capacity 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.670
 well you have to put the 16 to see what 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.030
 I've never moved this but let's go 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.030
 Let's see 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.350
 now I record 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.010
 As you can see, all I did was 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.970
 press the f10 key 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.970
 and the letter 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:39.980
 so I think that would be all for 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:43.460
 true the model of my hp is the hp db5 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.460
