just<00:00:14.310> modding<00:00:14.760> the<00:00:14.910> fan<00:00:15.439> and<00:00:16.439> we're<00:00:16.590> not

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
just modding the fan and we're not

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.370 
just modding the fan and we're not
adding<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:17.130> fan<00:00:17.369> we're<00:00:17.699> actually<00:00:17.960> just<00:00:18.960> making

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
adding a fan we're actually just making

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.109 
adding a fan we're actually just making
it<00:00:19.470> so<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.680> can<00:00:19.890> control<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.490> speed<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:21.090> the

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
it so you can control the speed of the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.689 
it so you can control the speed of the
existing<00:00:21.780> fan<00:00:22.020> already<00:00:22.440> in<00:00:22.860> the<00:00:23.010> PlayStation

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
existing fan already in the PlayStation

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.680 
existing fan already in the PlayStation

but there's a pot inside there

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.649 
but there's a pot inside there
potentiometer<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:01.589> controls<00:01:02.069> the<00:01:02.249> fan<00:01:02.659> all

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
potentiometer that controls the fan all

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.450 
potentiometer that controls the fan all
you<00:01:03.839> do<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.019> stick<00:01:04.440> a<00:01:04.470> screwdriver<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.430> there

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
you do is stick a screwdriver in there

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.590 
you do is stick a screwdriver in there
I'm<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.540> make<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.940> you<00:01:08.940> can<00:01:09.150> do<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.450> with<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
I'm I make it so you can do it with a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.090 
I'm I make it so you can do it with a
case<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:12.170> kind<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.230> ridiculous<00:01:13.620> if<00:01:14.040> you

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
case on kind of ridiculous if you

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.160 
case on kind of ridiculous if you
couldn't<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.610> with<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.730> case<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.080> you'd<00:01:16.080> have

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
couldn't do it with a case on you'd have

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.390 
couldn't do it with a case on you'd have
to<00:01:16.260> open<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.560> up<00:01:16.710> every<00:01:16.890> time<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.160> wanted<00:01:17.310> to

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
to open it up every time you wanted to

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.490 
to open it up every time you wanted to
control<00:01:17.730> the<00:01:17.850> speed<00:01:21.020> basically<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.170> stick<00:01:22.410> a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
control the speed basically you stick a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.820 
control the speed basically you stick a
tiny<00:01:22.770> flat<00:01:23.160> head<00:01:23.370> screwdriver<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:24.090> there<00:01:24.830> and

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
tiny flat head screwdriver in there and

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.930 
tiny flat head screwdriver in there and
if<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.040> turn<00:01:26.190> it<00:01:26.340> all<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.490> way<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.760> right

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
if you turn it all the way the right

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.460 
if you turn it all the way the right
it's<00:01:27.180> all<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.450> way<00:01:27.480> up<00:01:27.660> on<00:01:27.780> high<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.260> you<00:01:28.350> turn

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
it's all the way up on high if you turn

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.280 
it's all the way up on high if you turn
it<00:01:28.530> all<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.740> way<00:01:28.830> to<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> left<00:01:29.280> it'll<00:01:29.670> be<00:01:30.290> all

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
it all the way to the left it'll be all

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.430 
it all the way to the left it'll be all
the<00:01:31.470> way<00:01:31.530> down<00:01:31.910> so<00:01:32.910> I'm<00:01:33.810> gonna<00:01:33.960> turn<00:01:34.110> all<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
the way down so I'm gonna turn all the

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.910 
the way down so I'm gonna turn all the
way<00:01:34.470> up<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.800> high<00:01:35.010> let<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.580> hear<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.740> you<00:01:37.740> mean

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
way up on high let you hear it you mean

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.470 
way up on high let you hear it you mean
you<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.190> leave<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.610> high<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.270> kind

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
you can leave it on high but that kind

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.270 
you can leave it on high but that kind
of<00:01:39.540> defeats<00:01:39.870> the<00:01:39.870> purpose<00:01:40.050> of<00:01:40.650> having<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
of defeats the purpose of having the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.970 
of defeats the purpose of having the
control<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:42.420> met<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:46.290> sound<00:01:46.650> of<00:01:46.890> it

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
control I met the the sound of it

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.420 
control I met the the sound of it
doesn't<00:01:47.430> bother<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:48.980> you<00:01:49.980> don't<00:01:50.159> need<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
doesn't bother you you don't need the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.660 
doesn't bother you you don't need the
potentiometer<00:01:53.659> so<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:55.220> want<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.310> show<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.520> what

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
all the way up like I find a noise level

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.420 
all the way up like I find a noise level
it<00:03:05.330> isn't<00:03:05.720> too<00:03:05.900> loud<00:03:06.170> but<00:03:07.070> it's<00:03:07.250> still<00:03:07.550> getting

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
it isn't too loud but it's still getting

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:19.210

you<00:03:10.430> know<00:03:10.610> really<00:03:11.510> good<00:03:11.780> pulling

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.350 

maybe<00:03:19.910> something<00:03:20.330> like<00:03:20.480> that

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
maybe something like that

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.480 
maybe something like that
it's<00:03:22.780> not<00:03:22.990> as<00:03:23.110> loud<00:03:23.320> as<00:03:23.680> it's<00:03:24.040> been<00:03:24.220> all<00:03:24.370> the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
it's not as loud as it's been all the

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.560 
it's not as loud as it's been all the

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
way up now you can play with it yourself

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:36.680 
way up now you can play with it yourself
still<00:03:28.570> getting<00:03:28.810> plenty<00:03:28.990> of<00:03:29.170> air<00:03:29.350> flow

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.100

and<00:03:45.110> it's<00:03:45.410> completely<00:03:45.830> way<00:03:46.220> better<00:03:46.490> than<00:03:46.730> when

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
and it's completely way better than when

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.000 
and it's completely way better than when
you<00:03:47.810> just<00:03:47.840> let<00:03:48.350> your<00:03:48.590> PlayStation<00:03:51.010> control

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.740 
you just let your PlayStation control
the<00:03:52.160> speeds<00:03:52.459> from<00:03:52.730> the<00:03:52.910> get-go<00:03:53.270> you<00:03:53.330> can

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
the speeds from the get-go you can

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.460 
the speeds from the get-go you can
control<00:03:54.170> them<00:03:54.940> and<00:03:55.940> give<00:03:56.120> it<00:03:56.270> a<00:03:56.540> nice<00:03:57.170> airflow

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
control them and give it a nice airflow

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.530 
control them and give it a nice airflow
all<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.040> way<00:03:58.130> around<00:03:58.310> a<00:03:58.910> whole<00:03:59.120> time<00:03:59.390> you're
