00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
I have been calling them for a long time

I have been calling them for a long time
the<00:00:44.340> robot<00:00:44.820> Knights<00:00:45.320> it's<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.680> think<00:00:46.950> it's

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
the robot Knights it's I think it's

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.279 
the robot Knights it's I think it's
great<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.850> get<00:00:48.149> 3<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.600> these<00:00:48.750> included

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
great that you get 3 of these included

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.830 
great that you get 3 of these included
in<00:00:49.410> one<00:00:49.620> set<00:00:49.950> so<00:00:50.160> you'll<00:00:50.340> be<00:00:50.460> able<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.879> army

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
in one set so you'll be able to army

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.990 
in one set so you'll be able to army
build<00:00:52.050> for<00:00:52.289> Skeletor<00:00:52.829> very<00:00:53.190> very<00:00:53.430> quickly<00:00:53.699> and

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
build for Skeletor very very quickly and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.029 
build for Skeletor very very quickly and
very<00:00:54.030> easily<00:00:55.070> with<00:00:56.070> 3<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.579> each<00:00:56.789> pack<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:58.039> all

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
very easily with 3 in each pack so all

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.400 
very easily with 3 in each pack so all
of<00:00:59.370> them<00:00:59.520> are<00:00:59.760> essentially<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.420> same<00:01:00.690> just

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
of them are essentially the same just

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.110 
of them are essentially the same just
based<00:01:01.649> upon<00:01:01.800> how<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.219> configure<00:01:02.760> them<00:01:02.940> with

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
based upon how you configure them with

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.870 
based upon how you configure them with
the<00:01:03.329> included<00:01:04.199> extra<00:01:04.920> parts<00:01:05.220> like<00:01:05.400> hands<00:01:05.700> and

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the included extra parts like hands and

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.730 
the included extra parts like hands and
whatnot<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.540> we'll<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:06.900> take<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> look<00:01:07.320> at<00:01:07.500> one

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
whatnot so we'll just take a look at one

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.520 
whatnot so we'll just take a look at one
to<00:01:08.430> begin<00:01:08.580> with<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.360> see<00:01:09.540> each<00:01:10.260> one

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
to begin with as you can see each one

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.560 
to begin with as you can see each one
comes<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.979> stand<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.390> plug

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
comes with a stand that you can plug

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.660 
comes with a stand that you can plug
right<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.770> bottom<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.159> figure<00:01:14.490> I

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
right in to the bottom of the figure I

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.399 
right in to the bottom of the figure I
have<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.030> say<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.360> think<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.840> all<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
have to say that I think of all of the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.320 
have to say that I think of all of the
little<00:01:16.650> flight<00:01:17.280> stands<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.790> we've<00:01:17.939> gotten

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
little flight stands that we've gotten

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.700 
little flight stands that we've gotten
for<00:01:18.600> Masters<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> Universe<00:01:19.200> Classics

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
for Masters of the Universe Classics

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.740 
for Masters of the Universe Classics
thus<00:01:20.159> far<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.909> one<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.210> probably<00:01:21.570> my

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
thus far this one is probably my

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.190 
thus far this one is probably my
favorite<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.560> definitely<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> most<00:01:23.460> sturdy

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
favorite it's definitely the most sturdy

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.350 
favorite it's definitely the most sturdy
compared<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.680> rest<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.070> them<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.670> has<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
compared to the rest of them so it has a

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.749 
compared to the rest of them so it has a
good<00:01:28.170> bit<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.530> balance<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.640> don't

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
good bit of balance to it and you don't

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.870 
good bit of balance to it and you don't
have<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.090> worry<00:01:30.299> about<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.320> tipping<00:01:31.650> over<00:01:31.880> this

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
have to worry about it tipping over this

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.969 
have to worry about it tipping over this
does<00:01:33.450> well<00:01:33.689> because<00:01:33.840> since<00:01:34.229> these<00:01:34.439> do<00:01:34.680> hover

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
does well because since these do hover

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.730 
does well because since these do hover
it<00:01:35.340> puts<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.720> little<00:01:36.900> figure<00:01:37.320> up<00:01:37.530> a

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
it puts the the little figure up a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.310 
it puts the the little figure up a
little<00:01:38.070> bit<00:01:38.250> higher<00:01:38.549> than<00:01:39.299> usual<00:01:39.750> but<00:01:40.049> you

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
little bit higher than usual but you

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.170 
little bit higher than usual but you
don't<00:01:40.619> need<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.700> order<00:01:42.060> to

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
don't need to have it in order to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.060 
don't need to have it in order to
display<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.899> figure<00:01:43.170> as<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.649> see<00:01:43.829> it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
display the figure as you can see it

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.139 
display the figure as you can see it
sits<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:44.490> fine

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
sits just fine

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.370 
sits just fine
so<00:01:46.020> these<00:01:46.680> are<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.909> know<00:01:48.030> fairly<00:01:48.720> basic

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
so these are you know fairly basic

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.319 
so these are you know fairly basic
little<00:01:49.649> figures<00:01:49.920> but<00:01:50.100> they<00:01:50.220> do<00:01:50.280> come<00:01:50.729> with<00:01:51.090> a

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
little figures but they do come with a

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.660 
little figures but they do come with a
bit<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.020> articulation<00:01:52.829> there's<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.159> bit<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.579> a

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
bit of articulation there's a bit of a

value to be able to get three of these
per<00:04:43.599> package<00:04:44.110> so<00:04:44.530> that<00:04:44.800> you<00:04:44.979> can<00:04:45.159> army<00:04:45.460> build

rather<00:04:45.939> quickly<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:47.110> I<00:04:47.650> think<00:04:47.889> that<00:04:48.039> kind<00:04:48.340> of

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
rather quickly and I think that kind of

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.240 
rather quickly and I think that kind of
brings<00:04:49.150> them<00:04:49.449> up<00:04:49.629> to<00:04:50.139> the<00:04:50.650> level<00:04:50.830> that<00:04:51.009> they

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
brings them up to the level that they

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.830 
brings them up to the level that they
need<00:04:51.430> to<00:04:51.460> be<00:04:51.819> so<00:04:52.090> that<00:04:52.120> you're<00:04:52.389> getting<00:04:52.509> the

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
need to be so that you're getting the

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.469 
need to be so that you're getting the
value<00:04:53.199> for<00:04:53.409> the<00:04:53.500> price<00:04:53.680> point<00:04:54.069> with<00:04:54.849> them<00:04:55.060> so

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
value for the price point with them so

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.860 
value for the price point with them so
as<00:04:56.469> I<00:04:56.620> said<00:04:56.800> be<00:04:56.979> on<00:04:57.069> the<00:04:57.159> lookout<00:04:57.400> for<00:04:57.460> these
