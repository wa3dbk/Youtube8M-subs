00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
did some more sophisticated systems in

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.530 
did some more sophisticated systems in
the<00:01:50.090> interactions<00:01:50.810> of<00:01:50.900> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.720 

as<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:13.900> find<00:02:14.200> out<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.650> car<00:02:14.680> requires<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.370> lot<00:02:15.610> of

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
as I find out the car requires a lot of

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.780 
as I find out the car requires a lot of
pushing<00:02:16.060> lifting<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.230> even<00:02:17.770> bouncing<00:02:18.520> to

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
pushing lifting and even bouncing to

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.150 
pushing lifting and even bouncing to
move<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.150> out<00:02:19.330> of<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.570> workroom<00:02:20.170> but<00:02:20.770> everyone

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
move it out of the workroom but everyone

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.260 
move it out of the workroom but everyone
chips<00:02:21.490> in<00:02:21.760> more<00:02:22.600> or<00:02:22.810> less<00:02:24.060> what<00:02:25.060> are<00:02:25.150> your

in<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.580> entire<00:02:30.910> project<00:02:31.240> which<00:02:31.780> cost<00:02:32.110> around

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
in the entire project which cost around

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.820 
in the entire project which cost around
$35,000<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.540> group<00:02:35.170> was<00:02:35.380> worried<00:02:35.800> that

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
$35,000 the group was worried that

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.610 
$35,000 the group was worried that
expense<00:02:36.790> would<00:02:37.120> stall<00:02:37.420> production<00:02:38.080> but<00:02:38.500> with

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
expense would stall production but with

assistants to get a better understanding
of<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.350> car's<00:02:56.590> components<00:02:57.400> though<00:02:57.970> some<00:02:58.330> of

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
of the car's components though some of

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.060 
of the car's components though some of
the<00:02:58.570> parts<00:02:58.870> were<00:02:59.020> imported<00:02:59.620> like<00:02:59.950> the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
the parts were imported like the

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.220 
the parts were imported like the
headlights<00:03:00.459> and<00:03:00.670> steering<00:03:01.030> wheel<00:03:01.300> most<00:03:02.050> of

headlights and steering wheel most of
the<00:03:02.350> other<00:03:02.530> elements<00:03:03.190> were<00:03:03.310> designed<00:03:03.730> and

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
the other elements were designed and

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.290 
the other elements were designed and
produced<00:03:04.360> right<00:03:05.080> here<00:03:05.140> in<00:03:05.470> Uganda<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:07.030> body

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
produced right here in Uganda the body

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.750 
produced right here in Uganda the body
we<00:03:07.720> made<00:03:07.959> this<00:03:08.170> it's<00:03:09.010> handmade

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
we made this it's handmade

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.830 
we made this it's handmade
we<00:03:10.090> used<00:03:11.010> wear<00:03:12.010> mesh<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.610> reinforce

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
we used wear mesh to reinforce

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.540 
we used wear mesh to reinforce
fiberglass<00:03:13.840> so<00:03:14.350> this<00:03:14.500> is<00:03:14.620> partly<00:03:14.920> yes<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.520> is

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
fiberglass so this is partly yes it is

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.420 
fiberglass so this is partly yes it is
in<00:03:15.880> life<00:03:16.150> is<00:03:16.360> yes<00:03:16.600> yes<00:03:17.500> so<00:03:17.680> that's<00:03:17.860> one<00:03:18.160> of<00:03:18.310> the

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
in life is yes yes so that's one of the

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.970 
in life is yes yes so that's one of the
unique<00:03:18.610> features<00:03:19.060> about<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.390> yeah<00:03:20.049> and<00:03:20.590> maybe

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
unique features about it yeah and maybe

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.590 
unique features about it yeah and maybe
also<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:24.160> components<00:03:25.030> we<00:03:25.120> use<00:03:25.299> the

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
also the the components we use the

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.870 
also the the components we use the
lithium-ion<00:03:26.110> batteries<00:03:26.799> and<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.280> moisture

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
lithium-ion batteries and the moisture

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.780 
lithium-ion batteries and the moisture
controller<00:03:28.299> and<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:29.080> motor<00:03:29.320> in<00:03:29.620> there<00:03:29.860> okay

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
controller and the motor in there okay

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.310 
controller and the motor in there okay
that<00:03:31.030> was<00:03:31.180> all<00:03:31.330> made<00:03:31.600> here

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
that was all made here

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.060 
that was all made here
no<00:03:33.220> we<00:03:33.610> programmed<00:03:34.209> it<00:03:34.420> you<00:03:34.870> program<00:03:35.530> so<00:03:36.010> at

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
no we programmed it you program so at

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.740 
no we programmed it you program so at
least<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.340> software<00:03:36.880> was<00:03:37.060> made<00:03:37.269> here<00:03:37.540> yeah

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
least the software was made here yeah

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.020 
least the software was made here yeah

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:14.350 
he's hopeful and we are building a
solution<00:06:12.439> for<00:06:12.649> that<00:06:12.799> future<00:06:13.039> much<00:06:13.759> guaranteed

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
solution for that future much guaranteed

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.879 
solution for that future much guaranteed
a<00:06:14.449> lot<00:06:14.629> of<00:06:14.779> power<00:06:15.019> projects<00:06:15.439> which<00:06:15.529> are<00:06:15.649> coming

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
a lot of power projects which are coming

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:18.639 
a lot of power projects which are coming
up<00:06:16.189> in<00:06:16.459> Uganda<00:06:16.969> recently<00:06:17.569> 250<00:06:18.169> megawatts<00:06:18.499> of

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:18.649 
up in Uganda recently 250 megawatts of

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:21.129 
up in Uganda recently 250 megawatts of
power<00:06:18.889> was<00:06:19.759> launched<00:06:20.239> at<00:06:20.360> with<00:06:20.599> your<00:06:20.689> guy<00:06:20.869> and

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:21.139 
power was launched at with your guy and

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:23.259 
power was launched at with your guy and
then<00:06:21.289> we<00:06:21.439> have<00:06:21.619> Karuma<00:06:22.159> coming<00:06:22.519> up<00:06:22.669> and<00:06:22.879> so<00:06:23.029> on

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:23.269 
then we have Karuma coming up and so on

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:26.499 
then we have Karuma coming up and so on
so<00:06:23.839> we<00:06:23.959> hope<00:06:24.169> those<00:06:24.769> will<00:06:25.219> feed<00:06:25.519> our<00:06:25.819> electric

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:26.509 
so we hope those will feed our electric

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:28.419 
so we hope those will feed our electric
car<00:06:26.719> and<00:06:26.929> that's<00:06:27.229> what<00:06:27.469> hydroelectric<00:06:28.219> power

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:28.429 
car and that's what hydroelectric power

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:31.059 
car and that's what hydroelectric power
yeah<00:06:28.849> this<00:06:29.479> one<00:06:29.689> uses<00:06:30.049> i3<00:06:30.379> electric<00:06:30.409> power<00:06:30.919> to

00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:31.069 
yeah this one uses i3 electric power to

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:32.259 
yeah this one uses i3 electric power to
charge<00:06:31.279> and<00:06:31.459> that's<00:06:31.669> what<00:06:31.879> we<00:06:32.029> are<00:06:32.119> targeting

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:32.269 
charge and that's what we are targeting

00:06:32.269 --> 00:06:35.169 
charge and that's what we are targeting
and<00:06:33.079> we<00:06:33.349> believe<00:06:33.709> where<00:06:34.519> the<00:06:34.729> country<00:06:35.149> is

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:35.179 
and we believe where the country is

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:36.909 
and we believe where the country is
going<00:06:35.269> people<00:06:35.689> will<00:06:35.899> be<00:06:36.079> able<00:06:36.139> to<00:06:36.349> afford<00:06:36.739> it

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 
going people will be able to afford it

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:38.799 
going people will be able to afford it
this<00:06:37.039> kind<00:06:37.249> of<00:06:37.429> thing<00:06:37.699> because<00:06:38.149> with<00:06:38.509> more

00:06:38.799 --> 00:06:38.809 
this kind of thing because with more

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:40.779 
this kind of thing because with more
generation<00:06:39.439> of<00:06:39.649> course<00:06:39.889> people<00:06:40.339> have<00:06:40.459> been

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:40.789 
generation of course people have been

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:42.909 
generation of course people have been
income<00:06:41.149> generating<00:06:41.929> activities<00:06:42.529> but<00:06:42.769> that

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:42.919 
income generating activities but that

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.100 
income generating activities but that
will<00:06:43.069> take<00:06:43.219> some<00:06:43.429> time<00:06:43.489> yes<00:06:44.209> or<00:06:44.569> even<00:06:44.809> electric

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110 
will take some time yes or even electric

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.479 
will take some time yes or even electric
vehicles<00:06:45.559> anywhere<00:06:45.949> in<00:06:46.069> the<00:06:46.159> world<00:06:46.369> the

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:46.489 
vehicles anywhere in the world the

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:48.729 
vehicles anywhere in the world the
challenge<00:06:46.879> is<00:06:47.029> making<00:06:47.239> them<00:06:47.509> affordable<00:06:48.169> t

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:48.739 
challenge is making them affordable t

00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:51.100 
challenge is making them affordable t
yeah<00:06:49.279> so<00:06:49.519> we<00:06:49.789> don't<00:06:49.939> want<00:06:50.239> to<00:06:50.300> be<00:06:50.479> left<00:06:50.659> out<00:06:50.869> in

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.110 
yeah so we don't want to be left out in

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.290 
yeah so we don't want to be left out in
this<00:06:51.349> movement<00:06:51.860> of<00:06:51.979> electric<00:06:52.429> because<00:06:53.089> we

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.300 
this movement of electric because we

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.389 
this movement of electric because we
were<00:06:53.479> left<00:06:53.689> out<00:06:53.869> when<00:06:54.439> internal<00:06:54.949> combustion

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:55.399 
were left out when internal combustion

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:57.399 
were left out when internal combustion
engine<00:06:55.669> cars<00:06:55.909> were<00:06:56.059> made<00:06:56.269> but<00:06:56.839> for<00:06:56.869> electric

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:57.409 
engine cars were made but for electric

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:59.799 
engine cars were made but for electric
cars<00:06:57.619> we<00:06:57.829> want<00:06:58.039> to<00:06:58.159> get<00:06:58.309> on<00:06:58.459> board<00:06:58.669> this<00:06:59.479> team's
