00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.389
 open study is a portal whose purpose 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.129
 is to enable online study groups 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.840
 providing a space to resolve 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.419
 doubts and problems on topics 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.970
 concrete the students through 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:25.610
 your questions and answers will be winning 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.930
 karma as the other companions 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.399
 then vote them or what would be the 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.110
 equivalent to facebook give me 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.780
 like 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.700
 The more karma has a user because 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.309
 more reputation you will have within your group 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.789
 of study and therefore your answers 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.620
 will be better valued here because those 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.050
 users that have the highest score 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.280
 Well, let's tell them they'll have more 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.199
 validity in general in addition to having the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.109
 possibility for example to expel 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.229
 temporarily to other peers 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.969
 hinder the work of the group 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:04.100
 practice that is also known as 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.449
 ban what we're going to do then 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.970
 is now 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.520
 go into 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.590
 in my open study account in my case 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.720
 we can associate the directly to 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.650
 facebook with which having facebook 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.480
 open click on login and 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.050
 inside open estadi and we would accede 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:27.000
 directly to the platform itself we 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:31.960
 to home for example because here we can 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.690
 we'll see we 'll get to the a 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.900
 all the groups that there are of study 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.490
 so good in this case I'm 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.990
 pointed to three that come down here 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.910
 which is physical pm baccalaureate physics 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.000
 physics and a group of limits about 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.860
 physical these also allow us here 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.160
 we see some activity has been 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.560
 within the group also allows us 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.180
 allows you to chat in real time and then 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.500
 Well, more or less the structure 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.770
 to enter for example the core of my 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.119
 physical I'm going to this topic and then 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.970
 within that group, you see that here 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.610
 There are a number of questions 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.890
 what can any user do and 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.860
 after answer 2 I'm going to go 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.060
 example to this question then good 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.110
 because here a user makes a 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.330
 ask anybody in this case of 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.580
 physical I can this question in addition 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.950
 share it on facebook or on twitter and 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.000
 well, we see that there is a user here 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:34.080
 who answers the question and we also see 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.090
 if this user has medals or not 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.470
 Well, we also see the score 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.050
 in this case 12 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.480
 if we go over we see a little this 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:48.170
 score to what is 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.150
 what is related is the work in 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.020
 team solving problems how many 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.600
 points has led and good 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.140
 also 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.750
 we can also add a 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.790
 answer in this case the answer 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.130
 we also have the option of not only 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.890
 write them but also add a 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.150
 drawing for example or add an equation 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.890
 or several 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.860
 here is the equation tool or 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.920
 also directly attach a file 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.230
 any of our desk what 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.299
 we would add here with the answer by 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.370
 example and we would give posse that it would be 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.459
 then publish then other users 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.739
 could rate this answer and 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.120
 Well if you already being the best better 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.640
 place other 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.730
 also in open study 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.939
 we can find other study groups 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.110
 for example here in order monsallier and 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:44.330
 here we will go looking for 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.770
 for example a math or we can 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.370
 write directly what we want 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.800
 search and also create this already you have to 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.770
 ask for it but good can be created if you 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.170
 is a professional teaching group 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.450
 specific so for thematic 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.300
 specific 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.129
 in which then work that work 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.250
 our students in principle all the 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:10.019
 groups are always open therefore 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.019
 anyone can sign up 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.070
