00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 a friend from my office asked me to 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.820
 present a friend who is already perfect but 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.040
 you have to present me a shame 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.840
 we went on a double blind date my cousin 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.059
 with friend cristÃ³bal and me with gesture 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.430
 High already knew that it was the indicated exit 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.460
 wet we study to walk we arm 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.210
 many delayed panorama to go out with 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.400
 some friends at home to whom 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.690
 we were for then we were like 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.140
 a year of boyfriends and then we spent 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:34.250
 we traveled we went to these countries on weekends 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.250
 we went to the beach 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.590
 the city we were like three years 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.500
 married without children you know why not 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.500
 we put ourselves in campaign if as much as 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.480
 where I knew I was waiting for the 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.340
 ema the one is projected by one begins to 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.280
 see guagua everywhere imagines 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.199
 all the things that one is going to do 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.940
 what we did was to take all 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.370
 the precautions to have a daughter 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.710
 sana the nicole did not take the nicole no 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.900
 smoked the nicole took his folic acid 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.600
 religiously 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.580
 We did the survey of how the 4 or 5 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.080
 months where we went as a 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.850
 see if the week had the nose 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.130
 upturned and you want to confirm to the hundred 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.850
 percent that the little girl I did not know that 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.500
 it was a complicated echo and suddenly the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.340
 body tells us not to this bus has 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.760
 a problem at a super hard moment 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.760
 very hard 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.060
 This little girl has spina bifida in the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.950
 2005 clx what is that a lousy 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.490
 disease that was terrible and you stay so 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.740
 2a is a condition that develops 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.650
 during the fetal state that is not 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.420
 finishes closing the spine well 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.680
 and start having contact with liquid 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.740
 amniotic this generates damage 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.930
 neurological that the child can from 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.540
 walking with crutches is prostrate in the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.500
 bed the only way to prevent it from 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:02.280
 you know is taking folic acid what I 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.860
 I did not know was that I had a mutation 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.540
 genetics that made you need more acid 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.350
 folic that I was taking yesterday and that's 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.350
 super difficult to take on 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.130
 then I started calling the clinics 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.050
 us i found the one that has been made 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.330
 experimental operation that will consult 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.570
 well this grew never had occurred in 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.570
 Chile 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.140
 there is a percentage chance that 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.390
 the hand resist the operation 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.490
 it opens in the uterus, they take out the baby 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.050
 they made the shoulder of the water 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.150
 save yourself in return after you 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.390
 they close again from the uterus and already in that 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.040
 moment right now he becomes a father 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.890
 and start to realize and take risks 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.060
 and be responsible for someone who is more 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.890
 boy who had that is with you the idea 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.980
 is to keep the yolk as much as possible 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.980
 inside the uterus two weeks inside 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.650
 the premature was born of 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:10.010
 six and a half months it was worth it in the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.010
 moment when the rest 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.569
 a second other is your life is going to be 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.459
 much harder of much more struggle and 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.930
 for one does not matter but you know that everything 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.930
 that will be the same for everyone 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.680
 the operation that made it well 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.659
 a healthy girl but a girl who 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.939
 As it has this condition that will 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.980
 have forever reduced a lot of 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:34.450
 problems of the eba but has another 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.049
 lot of problems that come by 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.049
 front same 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.370
 from the emanation we started 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:51.599
 focus on its realization and obviously 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:54.090
 what one thinks about the telethon is super 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.750
 good and telethon at the beginning when 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.750
 they are just starting 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.840
 because it is just the time when you most 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.930
 help because you are lost you do not know 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.390
 what to do 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.519
 since he is 6 months old he is 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.769
 training and is preparing day to 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.080
 day to be able to face this world 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.060
 Adverse coming ahead 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.890
 you can look a little at the horizon 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.540
 can say since it has not advanced 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.239
 a lot but they told me that this already happen 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.910
 and in two more months we will be better and 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.370
 that is completely 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.610
 that 's why it 's with the feet moves those that 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.490
 half will start to stop gives you a frame 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.390
 of hope that things are going to be 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.650
 better at the end of the telethon allows you 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.650
 start again 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.590
 the ema was a demonstration of love 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.570
 super strong of love that we 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.490
 we feel for her but at the same time 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.760
 of the love we have between it and the 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.760
 nikon 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.350
 me yes I happened when there were people 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.080
 with children with problems and when they said 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.050
 they were happy I say I believed them 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.039
 truth is that it is not impossible for them to be 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.039
 happy with that problem 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.220
 the ema will always need help from the 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.600
 telethon of his family us what 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.590
 we are going to always provide you with 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.990
 love security but now that he has not 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.120
 One year later we do not realize that one 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.340
 can be just as happy or even more 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.330
 because one realizes that from that 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.800
 as a family and as a person one 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.220
 layers of things that do not help us that do not 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.220
 outside this 

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:39.619
 same 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.770
 and always one can be even more 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:50.080
 happy with you check how you want it 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.080
 have a child with a disability
