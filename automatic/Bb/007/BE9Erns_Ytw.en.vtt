 by the way really is already the last very 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:04.009
 the ends of the hall or is it just me or 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:07.680
 it was always the case for server loading 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:10.890

 twisted connect and gray here we are 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.099
 We generate forces a good place and let me 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:41.019
 I will prescribe the team want that everyone knows 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:45.250
 let's take an example 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.250
 let's expo 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:54.139
 20th about everything is fine 20 is all 2 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:01.780
 xn 20 about 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:03:07.959
 and let's write the region glue rope here 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:11.379
 I forgot how to privatize the region to the lime 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:15.439
 line cargo 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:17.150
 no yes everything is fine on sp us now 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:20.930
 locked in region we can check 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.989
 just a couple with the help of the wand there is no 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.060
 using the shelf no later than checking 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.150
 so well we can just write a command 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.900
 region 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:37.129
 li-ion about korra 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.109
 like that well, lan doesn't matter under you 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:42.169
 you can also figure out the same thing 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:44.560
 can be done using glad guard the same 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:50.449
 the most 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:53.989
 all sorts of cubes a lot of everyone so here is cynthia 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:04:00.079
 also we can with the help of the pounds team 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:03.049
 so here so stone stone and let's 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.810
 write a radius of about 76 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.549
 You see, you can do these kinds of mugs 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:13.299

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:17.359
 Now I will demonstrate to you so sin ti 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:20.269
 sort of lag very he believes in the hand 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.130
 Itâ€™s easy to see with our rounds 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.590
 all symmetrical but possible with 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.100
 with on the tv do so beautiful 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.320
 things now i then guide so i think
