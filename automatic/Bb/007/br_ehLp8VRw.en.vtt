part why we do recommend having the
boilers<00:00:41.160> cleaned<00:00:41.660> once<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.809> year<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.559> way

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
boilers cleaned once a year this way

here<00:00:44.660> if<00:00:45.660> there<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> problem<00:00:47.930> now<00:00:48.930> in<00:00:49.140> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
here if there is a problem now in the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.290 
here if there is a problem now in the
case<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.469> our<00:00:49.890> little<00:00:50.160> furry<00:00:50.460> friend<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.149> we

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
case of our little furry friend that we

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.799 
case of our little furry friend that we
took<00:00:51.539> out<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> chimney<00:00:52.969> that<00:00:53.969> would

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
took out of the chimney that would

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.090 
took out of the chimney that would
certainly<00:00:55.110> cause<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> blockage<00:00:58.100> diminishing

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
the draft and then what happens is that

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
little bit more air next test what

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.199 
little bit more air next test what
you're<00:03:15.380> doing<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:15.769> you're<00:03:16.010> taking<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.760> gases

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
you're doing is you're taking the gases

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.849 
you're doing is you're taking the gases

fluid to give you your gas reading on a
scale<00:03:22.850> here<00:03:24.040> when<00:03:25.040> you<00:03:25.130> match<00:03:25.310> that<00:03:25.340> across

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
scale here when you match that across

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.460 
scale here when you match that across
with<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.299> temperature<00:03:26.810> which<00:03:27.079> we'll<00:03:27.260> take

with the temperature which we'll take

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.509 
with the temperature which we'll take
next<00:03:28.269> that'll<00:03:29.269> give<00:03:29.450> you<00:03:29.570> a<00:03:29.600> burning

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
next that'll give you a burning
