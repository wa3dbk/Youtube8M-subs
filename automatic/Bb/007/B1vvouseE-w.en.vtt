00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.389
 it's not a stone question at the end 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.539
 Esma was no longer forced 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.459
 from now on 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.090
 In Medellin, in Colombia, people often think that buying clothes 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:20.480
 used is synonymous with poverty or pejoratively related to a 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.980
 certain social class 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.960
 but this is a trend that in the increase here percent we find 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.770
 We all have clothes to know if we see what shoes we see hats 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:31.420
 percent 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.670

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.880
 backpacks we found absolutely everything then to arm yourself a good pint 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.210
 really only have a very good style and have as very very 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.500
 defined p your concept several are the places where we can find clothes 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.210
 vintage 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.230
 of all styles and very good prices between 15 and 17 to 20 thousand pesos 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.900
 ae3 that generates inti without quatre inta 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.800
 depends on the state of the garment I've been brandon 25 years in the retail space 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.379
 I have always dedicated myself to the tipical rock art 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.619
 at another end of the city 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.490
 in the street 9 of the neighborhood the retro town presents another option of wardrobe 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.960
 20h, come on, eighty, do not do business 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.300
 at first it started being like one more percent only of furniture 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.189
 the process of selection of the garments is fundamental 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.020
 quality and variety before this I normally 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.160
 I'm looking for 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.030
 I get in all the co2 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.050
 titin 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.040
 I feel other cities 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.660
 and in a certain way something like the curatorship 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.479
 tesco 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.260
 a like the ones that quote like toshiba 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.410
 very special as they see us like with tecos 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.430
 It is understood that when I buy them because of a very clean garment good 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.260
 state 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.570
 me dirty clothes in poor condition 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.280
 which then makes clothes of unique interest 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.650
 there are very cool brand-name things that are suddenly very cool 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.190
 you can not have access to them because soon they do not sell them in the city 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.160
 or because somehow not 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.120
 I do not have an economic access to them that I feel that is with the 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.129
 performance of exclusivity 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.029
 wing 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:15.529
 who does not feel repetitive not having what everyone has and looking for pieces 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.219
 as with how they have more
