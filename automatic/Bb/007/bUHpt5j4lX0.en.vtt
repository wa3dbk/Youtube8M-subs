00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.979
 hello I want to summarize them about the 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.440
 axolote and the beta will start with the 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:12.830
 ajolote the Mexican axolotl is a 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.570
 amphibian with amazing adaptations like 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.269
 the ability to preserve their 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.999
 features several even when 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:23.960
 Sexually mature phenomenon known 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:26.810
 as I did not average on average 25 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.509
 7 centimeters long points of the 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.470
 head to tail and individuals 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:36.800
 greater than 30 centimeters are rare 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:41.120
 weigh from 60 to 110 grams and on average 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:44.269
 85 grams its habitat is aquatic live 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.390
 lakes pools and channels require 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.850
 particular conditions of turbidity 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.609
 levels of oxygenation dissolved in the 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.879
 water and stable conditions of 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:01:00.499
 current the ideal water temperature 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:04.100
 it's cold from 16 to 18 degrees Celsius and 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:05.740
 must not exceed 20 to 22 degrees 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.810
 centigrade 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.520
 alcohol another Mexican is considered 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.369
 endemic currently 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.579
 in free life it is only found in the 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.039
 system of xochimilco channels in the 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.560
 Mexico City in captivity live 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:27.270
 up to 30 years while in life 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.390
 wild only 3 sometimes up to 6 years ago 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.450
 believes that the difference is currently 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.509
 it owes to pollution the breathe the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.479
 breathing is done by means of the 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.240
 branchial branches also have sacks 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.329
 pulmonary 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.579
 are partially developed so 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:50.390
 that occasionally rises to the surface 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:53.210
 to take puffs of air to your diet is 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:58.330
 wide as in small fish in 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:01.260
 aquariums aquatic insects earthworms 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.060
 crustaceans and freshwater molluscs 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.070
 when they are long small they are fed 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:13.420
 of plankton formed from embedded 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:16.300
 microscopic as copepods 2 - and 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.610
 rotifers in captivity can eat a 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.400
 great variety of things including 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.100
 special croquettes for turtles 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.740
 crickets to be effects artemias of 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.340
 beetle larvae nerves and this 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:34.210
 support are cannibals sometimes even 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:37.150
 bring and bring small or other gravel 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:40.060
 particles that they then expel can 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.940
 spend several weeks fasting in several 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.600
 countries are doing genetic studies of 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:50.230
 axolotl the majority focused on their 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.880
 technical characteristics and its unusual 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.310
 capacity 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.340
 regeneration has the ability to 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.370
 regenerate your limbs or the 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:05.440
 jaw skin organs and even parts 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:08.170
 of your brain or heart in water 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.590
 the axolotl is known as adso what 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.840
 means monster of water but in another 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.510
 Prehispanic tradition holds that 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.080
 name comes from the Aztec god of 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.330
 deformations and death called olot 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.540
 Brother of Quetzalcoatl the god alone 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.450
 It is also associated with the idea of 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.750
 movement and life other possible 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.110
 prehispanic meaning is the dog 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.230
 of water by the blue word that 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.990
 means water and sun another that can 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.470
 interpreted as a dog on the other hand 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:47.890
 the word ambystoma that form their 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.250
 scientific name means mouth in 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:54.920
 Inverted cup shape or flattened mouth 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.170
 due to its large and wide mouth 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.560
 human activities are and have been 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.840
 the main threat of this species 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.819
 for centuries agriculture has 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.480
 overexploitation for its uses 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.280
 medicinal and nutritional development 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.850
 from the urban sprawl of the city of 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.790
 Mexico and other populations have gone 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:18.799
 ending the lagoon system and the network 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.299
 of channels that were in the valley of 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:28.250
 Mexico 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:31.190
 300 years ago in 2006 the ucm modified the 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.220
 status of the vulnerable species in 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.530
 critical danger that is when a 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.919
 species faces a high risk of 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.919
 extinction 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:46.790
 hello we will start sales 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.550
 the two fish sell my best in pairs 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.890
 that in groups since they are territorial and 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.140
 they could apply to each other out there 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.470
 comes the other name by which 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:00.440
 he knows them is the fish fighter 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.870
 Betas are characterized by 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.750
 your ability to breathe oxygen in the 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.900
 air and water so that it will not be 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.750
 necessary to oxygenate the water we will have to 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:15.590
 to ensure that the filtration of the water is 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:18.380
 soft to avoid creating currents in 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.480
 case of not being able to get this better 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.540
 it will be canceled 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.930
 regarding the optimal temperature for 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:30.470
 the beta fish should be kept between 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.840
 25 and 30 degrees centigrade for this 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.420
 motive when caring for a betta fish 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.270
 correctly, probably 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:42.200
 necessary to buy a heater with 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.960
 thermostat the beta fish or fighters 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.110
 they are omnivores although they prefer 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.490
 feed themselves as carnivores 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:54.230
 especially of living organisms like 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:57.830
 your plankton mosquito larvae and others 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:06:00.770
 insects that riveros so that I forget 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.320
 and that the ideal would be to feed as 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.080
 food alive but the truth is that the 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.420
 Dry or frozen food will be more 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.700
 practical and safe due to the fact 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.700
 contain not contain parasites 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.370
 Now I want you I love you 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.270
 to show 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.270
 of the aquarium 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.230
 here we see the axolotl I actually have two 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.230
 saco lÃ³pez 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.160
 and then swim 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.590
 something I want to tell you that everything 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.940
 that we see here in natural and is 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.030
 recommended here we see the second 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:41.690
 place in that we see the two together 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:44.750
 the one below is the one that buys today 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:48.849
 that is here swimming 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:51.789
 I already have about three weeks with him 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:55.569
 and in the bottom part we see this 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:57.610
 leg that in the corners I put sand 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:07:00.129
 because that's where the food the 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:03.370
 water I put it here I forgive the food what 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:06.740
 I put here and a few minutes goes 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:09.860
 falling it was falling 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.509
 in the stone and that's how I am 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:16.310
 getting used to eating both the betas 

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:18.849
 as to just the temperature that 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.849
 I have now 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:28.690
 It's hard to see but 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:31.630
 is 68 degrees centigrade with this beta 

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:33.730
 I already have like three weeks and I know 

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:37.180
 have adopted survivors good 

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:41.610
 take care of any question suggestion 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.610
 write to be all good luck
