00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.099
 Hello everyone in this video we are with you 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.559
 let's unpack a box with new ipad mini 2 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.900
 which by the way is now with a retina display 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.660
 but take a quick look at the design of this 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.480
 devices and basically let's get started 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.480
 you probably should compare the design 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.910
 ipad air and ipad mini 2 boxes and how 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.699
 we see they look like but the design of the box 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.199
 ipad air a little bit bigger now 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.060
 let's look at the box design this 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.140
 iPad mini 2 and so on top of us 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.020
 ipod mini 2 itself 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.210
 and on the sides we have the inscriptions and the substitution of 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.600
 other parties we are giving barrels now 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.980
 let's open the ipod mini 2 box and 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.340
 let's see what we have inside there so 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.710
 let's make an incision to take off 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.079
 plastic packaging and so we remove 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.789
 plastic wrap and let's see 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.440
 what we have inside for that we need with 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:58.199
 you unpack it and here it is ours 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.840
 ipad mini 2 salie on the screen and let's 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.210
 it until we turn on and put aside and 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.630
 so besides and pick us up 2 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.299
 is the adapter for charging into the outlet and 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.610
 such a booklet from a company in which 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.670
 we find brief instructions on 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.369
 use warranty and 2 apple 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.600
 sticker and also in the box we have a 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.280
 lightning cable which allows you 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.619
 sync your device with 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.619
 computer and charge it now 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.270
 let's lay the box aside and 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.280
 Let's take a closer look at the substitution itself 2 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.750
 and so as you can see ipad design 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.369
 second generation mini is nothing 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.280
 different from design 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.590
 iped mini first generation and let's 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.290
 Let's compare them or something short 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.380
 design comparison and since we derive 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.659
 only the color of the first generation is different 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.299
 we just have a black version and 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.689
 in the second generation this version of space 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.790
 gray 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.740
 and by the way space gray I like more 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.500
 Mostly this similar device 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.600
 surely by design they are absolutely 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.729
 identical and 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.990
 ipad mini's design is similar to 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.000
 ipad air design 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.799
 overall i hope you liked it 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.110
 the video was like unpacking and first 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.090
 a look very soon there will be a full review 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.420
 ipad air and ipad mini 2 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.400
 we'll compare that if I tell you about 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.010
 whether it is worth buying ipad mini second 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.140
 generations and what is better to buy ipad air 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.160
 or ipad mini 2 and I hope you 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.810
