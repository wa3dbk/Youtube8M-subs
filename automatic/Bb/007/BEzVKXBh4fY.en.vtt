here<00:02:16.440> in<00:02:16.590> this<00:02:17.370> sequence<00:02:17.760> I've<00:02:18.180> got<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.870> piece

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
here in this sequence I've got a piece

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.930 
here in this sequence I've got a piece
of<00:02:19.170> video<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.770> Grand<00:02:20.010> Canyon<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.670> I've

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
of video of the Grand Canyon and I've

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.790 
of video of the Grand Canyon and I've
decided<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.450> have<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.690> vacation<00:02:22.320> of<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.560> Grand

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
decided to have a vacation of the Grand

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.980 
decided to have a vacation of the Grand
Canyon<00:02:22.920> so<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.430> created<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:24.090> vacation<00:02:24.660> sticker

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
Canyon so I created a vacation sticker

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.510 
Canyon so I created a vacation sticker
that<00:02:25.560> says<00:02:25.860> Grand<00:02:26.190> Canyon<00:02:26.730> vacation<00:02:28.250> $499<00:02:29.250> I

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
that says Grand Canyon vacation $499 I

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.970 
that says Grand Canyon vacation $499 I
figured<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.330> was<00:02:30.390> my<00:02:30.450> vacation<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:31.290> should<00:02:31.770> set

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
figured it was my vacation I should set

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.010 
figured it was my vacation I should set
the<00:02:32.100> price<00:02:32.310> well<00:02:33.180> how<00:02:33.330> do<00:02:33.390> we<00:02:33.480> create<00:02:33.750> this

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
the price well how do we create this

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.800 
the price well how do we create this
effect<00:02:34.350> well<00:02:35.040> inside<00:02:35.700> Photoshop

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
effect well inside Photoshop

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.430 
effect well inside Photoshop
I<00:02:36.840> created<00:02:37.620> this<00:02:37.830> pinwheel<00:02:38.220> effect<00:02:38.880> now<00:02:39.840> maybe

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
I created this pinwheel effect now maybe

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.380 
I created this pinwheel effect now maybe
it<00:02:40.650> looks<00:02:40.860> like<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> saw<00:02:41.400> blade<00:02:41.580> but<00:02:41.940> I<00:02:42.120> think

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
it looks like a saw blade but I think

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.240 
it looks like a saw blade but I think
pinwheel<00:02:42.870> is<00:02:43.080> much<00:02:43.290> friendlier<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.130> we're

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
pinwheel is much friendlier so we're

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.820 
pinwheel is much friendlier so we're
gonna<00:02:44.370> call<00:02:44.580> this<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:44.760> pinwheel<00:02:45.300> today<00:02:45.690> this<00:02:46.680> is

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
gonna call this a pinwheel today this is

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.370 
gonna call this a pinwheel today this is
a<00:02:46.860> TIFF<00:02:47.250> image<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.790> does<00:02:48.180> not<00:02:48.450> move<00:02:48.870> notice

difference in the process of how this

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.010 
difference in the process of how this
works<00:03:07.200> but<00:03:07.470> most<00:03:07.830> often<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.700> luma<00:03:09.480> key<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:09.780> done

with<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.230> still<00:03:10.590> image<00:03:10.940> what<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:11.970> luma<00:03:12.300> key<00:03:12.420> does

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
with a still image what a luma key does

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.080 
with a still image what a luma key does
is<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:12.989> takes<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.530> bright<00:03:14.130> part<00:03:14.580> of<00:03:14.640> an<00:03:14.910> image

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
is it takes the bright part of an image

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.479 
is it takes the bright part of an image
and<00:03:15.420> separates<00:03:16.050> it<00:03:16.200> from<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.470> dark<00:03:16.830> part<00:03:17.280> of

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
in my case I want to make the dark

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.750 
in my case I want to make the dark

one of the tests we have to find out is

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.160 
one of the tests we have to find out is
what<00:03:32.010> is<00:03:32.239> transparent<00:03:33.239> in<00:03:33.390> a<00:03:33.480> clip<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:34.049> do

fact<00:03:50.160> alpha<00:03:50.970> and<00:03:51.180> transparency<00:03:52.170> are<00:03:52.380> synonyms

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
fact alpha and transparency are synonyms

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.120 
fact alpha and transparency are synonyms
it's<00:03:53.340> just<00:03:53.489> that<00:03:53.640> alpha<00:03:54.120> sounds<00:03:54.480> sexier<00:03:55.130> that

it's just that alpha sounds sexier that

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
of the clip transparent in this case I'm

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.000 
of the clip transparent in this case I'm
going<00:05:15.060> to<00:05:15.120> say<00:05:15.270> key<00:05:15.510> out<00:05:15.690> darker<00:05:16.290> make<00:05:16.770> the

going to say key out darker make the

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.550 
going to say key out darker make the
darker<00:05:17.490> part<00:05:18.000> of<00:05:18.090> the<00:05:18.180> clip<00:05:18.420> transparent<00:05:19.380> and

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
darker part of the clip transparent and

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.610 
darker part of the clip transparent and
copy<00:05:19.980> that<00:05:20.310> transparency<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.750> the<00:05:21.900> alpha<00:05:22.470> or

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
copy that transparency to the alpha or

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
image copy it to the transparency

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.750 
image copy it to the transparency
channel<00:05:27.140> the<00:05:28.140> way<00:05:28.290> we<00:05:28.440> adjust<00:05:28.950> this<00:05:29.250> is<00:05:29.580> by

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
channel the way we adjust this is by

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.490 
channel the way we adjust this is by
using<00:05:29.970> the<00:05:30.180> threshold<00:05:30.750> if<00:05:30.930> I<00:05:31.020> drag<00:05:31.290> the

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
using the threshold if I drag the

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.740 
using the threshold if I drag the
threshold<00:05:32.010> up<00:05:32.280> notice<00:05:32.670> how<00:05:32.850> the<00:05:32.910> white

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
threshold up notice how the white

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.200 
threshold up notice how the white
becomes<00:05:34.380> less<00:05:34.770> solid<00:05:35.460> white<00:05:35.700> becomes

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
becomes less solid white becomes

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.660 
becomes less solid white becomes

black<00:05:46.670> in<00:05:47.670> general<00:05:48.180> I<00:05:48.360> adjust<00:05:49.050> the<00:05:49.320> threshold

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
black in general I adjust the threshold

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.530 
black in general I adjust the threshold
first<00:05:50.340> to<00:05:50.730> make<00:05:50.880> sure<00:05:51.000> I've<00:05:51.090> got<00:05:51.120> a<00:05:51.270> nice<00:05:51.510> clean

key<00:05:52.170> then<00:05:52.800> if<00:05:52.920> I<00:05:53.040> need<00:05:53.220> to<00:05:53.340> make<00:05:53.520> adjustments

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
key then if I need to make adjustments

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.590 
key then if I need to make adjustments
to<00:05:54.420> it<00:05:54.630> I'll<00:05:55.110> adjust<00:05:55.590> tolerance<00:05:56.370> for<00:05:57.240> graphics
