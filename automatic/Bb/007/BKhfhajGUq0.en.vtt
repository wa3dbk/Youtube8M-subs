 Important events on pc worth not 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.380
 There is more to Brazil than the event for 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.730
 Americans took futsal talent and 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.050
 fortunately there was no sequence in the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.289
 the next American year was held in 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.699
 mexico but the world championship marked 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.619
 our modality here in brazil 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.670
 title marked a lot then the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.740
 important now is we try 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.360
 develop our sport 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.040
 these changes that are happening are 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.750
 important you have to be aware 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.430
 of everything is happening in sport and 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.079
 this change is precisely this 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.559
 first mit here in usp is a step 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.600
 very important is the mit in a partnership 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.430
 from the league of paulista with usp one thing 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.730
 unprecedented in our sport 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.890
 trying to set up the coaching school 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.180
 to train professionals in the area 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.340
 view a partnership with 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.039
 portuguese university and then 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.300
 Let's try our long- awaited license 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.830
 everyone's license so that everything 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.740
 world may be able to work 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.820
 outside the country within the legality 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.470
 This is what we are looking for in this 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.729
 We hope this is signed 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.500
 as fast as possible this too 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.460
 involves the school of school managers of 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.960
 coaches 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.119
 usp made a project the one of a course of 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.520
 sports management for the 13 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.020
 unfortunately the club of 13 is over and 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.670
 now there is an adaptation that same 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.040
 course by function managers so that 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.900
 it will be another step one 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.250
 absolute professionalization in football 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.720
 Brazil does not need to talk a little bit about 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.240
 Did you spend a few months in Europe? 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.240
 Where did you teach to learn what you 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.500
 I brought different here is the course 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.729
 sports director of the real federation 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.259
 Spanish football team in the area of 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.090
 visit the main structures of the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.200
 world in the area of ​​sports training 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.299
 for us to understand what was 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.100
 happening and know what football is 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.020
 how football can be contained in the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.090
 soccer player training 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.040
 promote our sport as we 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.509
 There is a lot of financial problems in the country. 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.310
 we managed to do quite a lot 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.280
 we are discussing this by discussing a 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.110
 combined soccer dispute project 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.970
 there are people who are interested and 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.530
 trying to know what this is and I have 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.430
 given to my lectures to understand 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.989
 this process 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.390
 yesterday a lot was finally talked about 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.849
 philosophy of profiling 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.440
 work that we even issue a 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.660
 little in your time of the corinthians 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.220
 with lucas you speak the same language 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.069
 and the transition from sub 20 was very natural 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.510
 since you spoke the same but the 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.190
 important is that the modality be 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.900
 the club president is a process 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.110
 irreversible it seems to me that corinthians 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.940
 It's irreversible and you leave all 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.269
 categories counting all titles 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.340
 now a major and sub 20 also raise 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.569
 the principal this year probably arrives 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.709
 to the final of the championship with many chances 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.420
 and league champion 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.250
 we are honored to have 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.900
 participated in this process that people 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.980
 want it to happen in other clubs 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.090
 from brazil 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.980
 to finish talking a little 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.510
 Brazilian team but without comparing 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.310
 pc work with ney's work 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.690
 and Sergius even because they are 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.000
 different profiles in different 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.950
 different in the selection as you evaluate 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.270
 this clear renewal that the law is 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.460
 positive and 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.890
 and who you see with good eyes this 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.490
 New school is good, it's important for you. 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.050
 to help 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.520
 if we need help because it has 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.330
 only two years to make a good 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.970
 world 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.650
 then he needs to understand the process 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.520
 needs many competitions 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.840
 international organizations to understand the 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.510
 level of arbitration the criteria for 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.770
 arbitration outside the country are different 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.780
 so all this is a process of people 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.940
 wait for the contribution he finds 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.500
 necessary that everyone needs help 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.940
 We need to be world champion. 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.980
 again this is better 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.980
 Thank you. Good luck. Brazil play
