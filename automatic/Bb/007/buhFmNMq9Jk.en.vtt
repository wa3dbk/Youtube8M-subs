hearing<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.610> it's<00:02:26.820> like<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.210> you<00:02:28.050> know<00:02:28.080> the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
hearing it it's like that you know the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.560 
hearing it it's like that you know the
first<00:02:28.560> time<00:02:28.770> that<00:02:29.190> maybe<00:02:29.730> not<00:02:29.940> everyone<00:02:30.270> knows

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
the first time but like I guess I guess

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.980 
the first time but like I guess I guess
it<00:02:32.760> would<00:02:32.940> work<00:02:33.090> like<00:02:33.300> when<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.870> hear

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
it would work like when you hear

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.420 
it would work like when you hear
deathcore<00:02:34.440> for<00:02:34.590> people<00:02:34.770> who<00:02:34.860> don't<00:02:34.980> like<00:02:35.100> it

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
deathcore for people who don't like it

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.980 
deathcore for people who don't like it
it's<00:02:35.610> just<00:02:35.760> our<00:02:36.210> deathcore<00:02:36.630> metalcore

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
it's just our deathcore metalcore

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.850
