00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.210
 then one cannot, one cannot be defined 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.350
 bersani libertarian school is not 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.300
 You can find common characters a 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.260
 all libertarian schools as far as they are concerned 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.580
 I know it's about the scanu experience 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.470
 in the school it rises with of the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:32.940
 features somehow we say 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:35.850
 instinctive and not pre-ordinable or yes 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.710
 can predict in general I can 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:44.789
 say so much in general than in one 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.969
 libertarian school the founding core is 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.760
 the assembly composed of children and da 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.789
 teachers in the assembly decide everything 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.890
 says everything they propose initially 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.449
 activities are proposed by the masters 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.309
 every day the children follow without 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.559
 obligation to the elections 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.600
 in the assembly are precisely answers 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.860
 these activities that will have a part i 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:14.640
 there were children according to them 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.360
 them of their daily needs 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.850
 also their characteristics as a class 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.259
 which group feel inside the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.640
 same class then did the same 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:32.579
 assembly work and the master anyway 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:35.729
 takes into account these are the desires 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.369
 of children actually so it works 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.310
 the whole libertarian school and the assembly 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.880
 who has decision-making power over everything 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:49.220
 so democratically with that 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.229
 keyword decisions are made 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.000
 in general they can define this the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.040
 school freedom that of course would be 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.320
 nice to get off or in particular because 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.090
 every libertarian school that it works is 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.530
 different from another one 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.630
 and it has features probably 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:10.000
 similar but different non-protocol able 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:16.240
 not registered is one of the 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.820
 primary characteristics a day 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.400
 type at the libertarian school is not 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.750
 logged the protocols is not bile 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.670
 I should describe you every day 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.570
 which is different from another le 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.750
 common features are the assembly 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.880
 and therefore those decision-making circles in the 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.760
 such as instability also the structure 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.940
 same as the day that can be 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.700
 totally opposite to the day at 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.880
 previous day or day 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.880
 next one 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:56.920
 the only core assembly has 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:03:00.040
 rightly and the meeting a circle of 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.080
 children and teachers, then follow 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.430
 who follows the decision of the day that 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.560
 could also be put into 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.200
 discussion at mid-day and then a 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.290
 day planned in a way can 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.330
 totally change mid-day e 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.550
 arrive at conclusions that yes 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:23.320
 really expected unexpected so it is 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:26.680
 an itinere decision and tinary decisions 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:32.200
 that are inserted primary took the 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:36.209
 morning and totally unpredictable not 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.930
 it means that we don't do school 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.640
 unequal 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:46.630
 rather it means following follow 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:51.239
 democratically what the stimulus 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.239
 group daily in general
