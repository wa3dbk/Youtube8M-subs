double<00:01:13.170> bed<00:01:13.350> I'm<00:01:13.560> not<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:13.920> sure<00:01:13.950> about<00:01:14.220> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
double bed I'm not so sure about the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.340 
double bed I'm not so sure about the
flimsy<00:01:14.850> little<00:01:14.970> table<00:01:15.479> which<00:01:15.659> stores<00:01:15.990> under

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
the transverse bed at the back but I

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.700 
the transverse bed at the back but I
guess<00:01:18.210> that's<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.630> small<00:01:18.900> price<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.200> pay<00:01:19.380> for

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
guess that's a small price to pay for

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.020 
guess that's a small price to pay for
all<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.280> space<00:01:22.400> one<00:01:23.400> thing<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.790> may<00:01:23.909> it

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
all of that space one thing that may it

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.030 
all of that space one thing that may it
put<00:01:24.240> off<00:01:24.390> some<00:01:24.689> buyers<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.619> these<00:01:25.830> are

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
put off some buyers is that these are

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.550 
put off some buyers is that these are
the<00:01:26.100> only<00:01:26.340> two<00:01:26.729> belted<00:01:27.240> travel<00:01:27.600> seats<00:01:27.810> but

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
the only two belted travel seats but

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.260 
the only two belted travel seats but
then<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.100> resolutely<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> van<00:01:30.030> for

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
then this is resolutely a van for

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.690 
then this is resolutely a van for
couples<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.500> front<00:01:31.770> double<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.430> only

couples and that front double is only
really<00:01:33.000> likely<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.509> be<00:01:33.630> used<00:01:33.869> by<00:01:34.079> occasional
