00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello to all guys fip et gaming and 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.890
 today I present new to you up to 14 and 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.040
 as you know a few days ago 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.500
 release new news and gameplay about it 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.269
 this game is just today I will live 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.539
 summarize the aspects a little more 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.070
 important of all that came out 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.619
 out in the last few weeks 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.590
 the first aspect I will talk about 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.390
 will be the protected ball which is an aspect 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.510
 very innovative that in fact vi 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.800
 will protect the ball e 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.350
 will consist of pressing the lever 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.710
 left while running or if two 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.489
 stop and the player will slow down his 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.739
 race and will try to remove the 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.760
 defender behind him or a 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.950
 near and therefore this new this 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.289
 new appearance will be very effective with 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.070
 players like ibras and drugs that are 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.809
 very physically strong and therefore this 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.109
 the new type of is a new mechanic 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.199
 contact between the defender striker who 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.450
 precisely it will require a lot of physicality and 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.170
 keeping control of the balloon yes 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.180
 he will succeed in building his own play 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.240
 and therefore this aspect is very much 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.970
 nice because su fifa often happens 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.710
 that the defender as nothing of ruby ​​la 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.939
 ball is your attacker remains at 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.009
 mouth open 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.170
 a new aspect will then be the shortest 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.140
 which is a new shooting mechanic e 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.689
 of the shooting approach and therefore how 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.000
 well you know about spinners often i 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.610
 players position and shoot in a way 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.840
 very strange from the angles more 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.270
 disparate 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.420
 and all this will be different on 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.689
 fifa 13 his sorry Catholic son is 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.180
 the way the way you pull will change 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.549
 completely so animation are 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.310
 different than shooting positions and 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.439
 for example if a player takes a shot at 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.630
 turn and put in a way and if it makes a 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.369
 shooting standard you put in another and then 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.250
 all this seems much, much more 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.159
 realistic and the prospect of shooting 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.160
 indeed it will be on a whole other level 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.470
 and then the shot will be per person then 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:14.040
 each player will have his own particular 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.459
 way of approach of the shot therefore if 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.860
 let's take the examples maybe van persie e 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.680
 cristiano ronaldo van persie pull in 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.989
 one way and ronaldo if he pulls he pulls in a 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.580
 other then it is all this will be 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.830
 awesome 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.750
 third and final aspect will be the air album 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.560
 physics that will practically be a new one 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.680
 mechanism of the new a new vision 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.230
 ball physics and all these things 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.569
 they will then change from a video spinner 14 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.760
 in the sense that it is only the ball 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.700
 better to but practically change 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.010
 it will change completely so I can hold you 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.860
 a new level 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.200
 the method will be new 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.720
 shooting as you see the deep in shock here 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:02.409
 that the shot tends to go down 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.390
 bounces and that does not happen very often 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:07.720
 on spinners but then there will also be the 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:11.620
 crac holeshot which is the shooting shot of 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.360
 ronaldo and then the rising shot I am 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.629
 those shots when you get a job 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.310
 they tend to go up and therefore everything 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:22.510
 this will be exceptional I can't wait 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:25.569
 to try it on up to 14 note and then 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.690
 the release date will be more or less towards 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.590
 the September movie and news on 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.769
 ultimate team 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.940
 I think they will come towards the 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:39.489
 period towards the summer and nothing 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.920
 the video ends here I remind you of 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.530
 I like to wear lots of goodies 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.239
 write to the channel and above all to 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.730
 leave a comment on what it is 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:52.810
 think of these new ones of these new 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.419
 aspects and how you would like 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.030
 improve all this and then remember you 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:04:00.010
 also very important thing about registering 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.199
