 to prove for the next match it's always the same it's the next match 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.409
 which is the most important the seizure is the most important 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.050
 if you stay on a course like this 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.040
 promised I saw it means without coastal leading it's true you 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.040
 do not have to the final tree in the heads of the players that it is not possible 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.070

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.880
 he is very uncertain 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.150
 he for a 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.680
 on players who 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.680
 boris which of course completes to provide 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.940
 that was player who is 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.880
 they do not want that so it's clear who are players who have 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.250
 opportunities to even show that they are ready for the final 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.190
 we're going back 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.640
 in this match during the day the player will not be able to meet again 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.760
 possibility of existence is there 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.680
 it's the law of rugby that's what I left him it's really in jeju 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.010
 known that I did the game after so I know very well that

 if you are not there you will hurt yourself but also if you 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.470
 are afraid 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.130
 here but in front of the surprising if we make a good match against the leader if 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.230
 these words because it is here that the mythical 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.390

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.470
 kapo products maybe matches of excellence 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.150
 almost perfect so it's true that we know when 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.390
 we put in live one of the two was won gold 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.580
