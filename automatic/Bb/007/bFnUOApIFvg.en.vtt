as<00:00:54.570> you're<00:00:54.840> within<00:00:55.020> four<00:00:55.320> levels<00:00:55.590> each<00:00:55.649> other

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
as you're within four levels each other

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.920 
as you're within four levels each other
you<00:00:55.980> get<00:00:56.100> triple<00:00:56.340> experience<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.329> your

heirlooms<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.710> worn<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.100> top<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.670> so

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
heirlooms can be worn on top of that so

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.490 
heirlooms can be worn on top of that so
you<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.239> get<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.600> extra<00:01:00.840> thirty<00:01:01.289> five

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
you can get that extra thirty five

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.160 
you can get that extra thirty five
percent<00:01:01.530> experience<00:01:02.430> if<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.670> have<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> helm

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
percent experience if you have the helm

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.250 
percent experience if you have the helm
back<00:01:04.250> shoulders<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.489> chest<00:01:05.930> so<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.229> course

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
back shoulders and chest so of course

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.660 
back shoulders and chest so of course
the<00:01:07.530> fastest<00:01:07.830> way<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> grandeur<00:01:08.340> levels

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the fastest way is the grandeur levels

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.280 
the fastest way is the grandeur levels
but<00:01:08.880> if<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.060> can't<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.570> then<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.900> still

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
but if you can't do that then I still

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.450 
but if you can't do that then I still

can't do this on a panda because you

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.710 
can't do this on a panda because you
have<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.280> be<00:01:23.369> level<00:01:23.670> 10<00:01:24.000> before<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.570> can

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
have to be level 10 before you can

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.120 
have to be level 10 before you can
choose<00:01:24.869> your<00:01:24.990> faction<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.100> be

the other juicer faction before you can

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.480 
the other juicer faction before you can
be<00:01:27.900> granted<00:01:28.320> levels<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.189> we're<00:01:29.340> actually

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
be granted levels so we're actually

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.760 
be granted levels so we're actually
going<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.850> start<00:01:30.150> as<00:01:30.299> humans<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.170> then

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
going to start as humans and then

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.910 
going to start as humans and then
shortly<00:01:31.979> after<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.460> hit<00:01:32.579> 90<00:01:32.970> will<00:01:33.119> be<00:01:33.920> race

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
shortly after we hit 90 will be race

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.090 
shortly after we hit 90 will be race
changing<00:01:35.310> over<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.820> pandas<00:01:36.650> but<00:01:37.650> there's<00:01:37.950> also

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
changing over to pandas but there's also

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.319 
changing over to pandas but there's also
an<00:01:38.220> advantage<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.610> being<00:01:38.729> human<00:01:38.880> they<00:01:39.180> get<00:01:39.299> a

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
an advantage of being human they get a

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.569 
an advantage of being human they get a
reputation<00:01:39.600> bonus<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.500> reputation<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.400> going

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
reputation bonus and reputation is going

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.249 
reputation bonus and reputation is going
to<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.210> ways<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.540> get<00:01:42.689> gear<00:01:43.110> in

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
to be one of the ways to get gear in

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.740 
to be one of the ways to get gear in
mists<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.040> pandaria<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.210> kind<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.509> a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
mists of pandaria so it's kind of a

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.530 
mists of pandaria so it's kind of a
win-win<00:01:46.310> so<00:01:47.310> we'll<00:01:47.520> be<00:01:47.729> getting<00:01:47.970> up<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.119> 90

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
win-win so we'll be getting up to 90

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.389 
win-win so we'll be getting up to 90
right<00:01:48.689> away<00:01:48.930> I'm<00:01:49.380> sorry<00:01:49.649> up<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.829> 80<00:01:50.009> right<00:01:50.220> away

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
right away I'm sorry up to 80 right away

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.859 
right away I'm sorry up to 80 right away
when<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.640> game<00:01:50.790> comes<00:01:50.939> out<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.329> then<00:01:51.720> we've

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
when the game comes out and then we've

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.690 
when the game comes out and then we've
already<00:01:52.049> bought<00:01:52.320> some<00:01:52.680> bind<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.130> equip<00:01:53.159> gears

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
already bought some bind on equip gears

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.120 
already bought some bind on equip gears
so<00:01:53.939> that<00:01:54.090> we<00:01:54.180> can<00:01:54.360> be<00:01:54.479> fully<00:01:54.930> geared<00:01:55.170> at<00:01:55.409> 80<00:01:55.799> and

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
so that we can be fully geared at 80 and

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.249 
so that we can be fully geared at 80 and
not<00:01:56.490> just<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.850> naked<00:01:57.420> toon<00:01:57.810> turning<00:01:58.170> around

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
not just be naked toon turning around

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.160 
not just be naked toon turning around
now<00:01:58.790> one<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.969> ways<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.869> get

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
now one of the ways that you can get

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.560 
now one of the ways that you can get
that<00:02:01.350> little<00:02:01.469> faster<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.240> before<00:02:03.240> you<00:02:03.360> start

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
that little faster is before you start

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.819 
that little faster is before you start
granting<00:02:03.840> levels<00:02:04.110> make<00:02:04.350> sure<00:02:04.500> you're<00:02:04.619> almost

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
granting levels make sure you're almost

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.679 
granting levels make sure you're almost
level<00:02:05.280> two<00:02:05.490> because<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.149> ratio<00:02:06.540> of

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
level two because that ratio of

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.270 
level two because that ratio of
experience<00:02:07.170> will<00:02:07.350> carry<00:02:07.619> over<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.069> if<00:02:08.160> you're

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
experience will carry over so if you're

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.380 
experience will carry over so if you're
almost<00:02:08.399> little<00:02:08.759> too<00:02:08.910> when<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.179> start

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
almost little too when you start

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.270 
almost little too when you start
granting<00:02:09.690> levels<00:02:10.080> you'll<00:02:10.500> be<00:02:10.649> almost<00:02:10.860> level

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
granting levels you'll be almost level

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.700 
granting levels you'll be almost level
81<00:02:11.629> when<00:02:12.629> you're<00:02:12.750> done<00:02:12.900> being<00:02:13.050> granted<00:02:13.260> levels

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
81 when you're done being granted levels

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.440 
81 when you're done being granted levels
so<00:02:13.920> we've<00:02:14.070> been<00:02:14.160> told<00:02:14.370> we're<00:02:14.970> hoping<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.330> all

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
so we've been told we're hoping this all

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.660 
so we've been told we're hoping this all
works<00:02:15.630> out<00:02:15.750> really<00:02:15.900> well<00:02:16.160> then<00:02:17.160> once<00:02:17.400> we<00:02:17.550> get

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
works out really well then once we get

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.690 
works out really well then once we get
to<00:02:18.150> up<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.380> 80<00:02:19.530> we're<00:02:20.100> going<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.250> do<00:02:20.490> just

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
to up to 80 we're going to do just

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.490 
to up to 80 we're going to do just
instances<00:02:21.420> through<00:02:21.660> Cataclysm<00:02:22.200> we<00:02:22.290> believe

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
instances through Cataclysm we believe

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.050 
instances through Cataclysm we believe
that's<00:02:22.590> gonna<00:02:22.770> be<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.950> fastest<00:02:23.370> way<00:02:23.430> I'm

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
that's gonna be the fastest way I'm

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.630 
that's gonna be the fastest way I'm
going<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.330> be<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.450> brewmaster<00:02:24.870> or<00:02:25.260> a<00:02:25.290> tank<00:02:25.640> grim

actually faster to level of first two
with<00:02:52.230> instances<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.280> last<00:02:53.460> three<00:02:53.760> with

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
with instances and the last three with

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.000 
with instances and the last three with
quests<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.870> will<00:02:54.960> also<00:02:55.140> allow<00:02:55.290> us<00:02:55.710> to

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
quests and it will also allow us to

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.940 
quests and it will also allow us to
bypass<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:57.240> first<00:02:57.540> leveling<00:02:58.140> zone<00:02:58.350> which<00:02:58.680> you

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
bypass the first leveling zone which you

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.560 
bypass the first leveling zone which you
can<00:02:59.070> imagine<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.580> going<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.760> be<00:02:59.910> really

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
can imagine is going to be really

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.930 
can imagine is going to be really
crowded<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:01.320> first<00:03:01.530> couple<00:03:02.010> days<00:03:02.040> after<00:03:02.820> the

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
crowded the first couple days after the

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.490 
crowded the first couple days after the
expansion<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:03.630> we'll<00:03:03.750> just<00:03:03.780> do<00:03:04.080> instances

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
expansion so we'll just do instances

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.750 
expansion so we'll just do instances
through<00:03:04.680> that<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.040> then<00:03:05.400> we'll<00:03:05.490> be<00:03:05.580> able<00:03:05.640> to

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
through that and then we'll be able to

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.820 
through that and then we'll be able to
start<00:03:05.940> on<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.180> second<00:03:06.540> or<00:03:06.660> third<00:03:06.830> leveling

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
start on the second or third leveling

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.760 
start on the second or third leveling
zone<00:03:08.100> without<00:03:08.610> having<00:03:09.270> to<00:03:09.510> fight<00:03:09.900> against<00:03:10.380> the

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
zone without having to fight against the

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.280 
zone without having to fight against the
crowd<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.340> then<00:03:12.330> we'll<00:03:12.600> just<00:03:12.750> quest<00:03:12.990> all<00:03:13.200> the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
crowd and then we'll just quest all the

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.620 
crowd and then we'll just quest all the
way<00:03:13.350> till<00:03:13.560> ninety<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:15.150> should<00:03:15.420> be<00:03:15.570> able

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
way till ninety and that should be able

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.270 
way till ninety and that should be able
to<00:03:15.780> get<00:03:15.870> us<00:03:15.960> there<00:03:16.110> within<00:03:16.350> a<00:03:16.740> couple<00:03:17.100> days

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
to get us there within a couple days

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.040 
to get us there within a couple days
from<00:03:17.940> what<00:03:18.090> we've<00:03:18.210> heard<00:03:18.240> maybe<00:03:18.540> two<00:03:18.780> or<00:03:18.810> three
