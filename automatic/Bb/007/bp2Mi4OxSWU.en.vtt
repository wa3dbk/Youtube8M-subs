00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:10.700
 hey johannes here from news.de and the 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.580
 Here is the new Huawei S7 that is one 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.970
 field as you can see here so completely 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.599
 nice big but there are some 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.939
 fans who like that and the sabbat and others 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:27.320
 because here is another made in 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:31.279
 presented diagonally from 6 inches and one 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.380
 resolution of full hd 7 9 millimeters 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:38.380
 So thick here you can see also relatively 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.400
 thin and weighs 185 grams 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.570
 as a processor here comes one 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.350
 Company Hurricane Kirin 925s II 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.690
 for use 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.850
 he has eight cores his victim core 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:56.000
 Processor four of these are 1 a 15 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:59.840
 15 with 1 8 ghz and the other four are 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.670
 one arm a 7 with 1 3 ghz 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.309
 There is also a processor 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.220
 for example, the compass controls or 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.850
 the steps counts so then it will be 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.850
 less energy consumes what ever 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.770
 is very nice for a long time 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.510
 Akkulaufzeit has worked piano towards 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.240
 we have a battery here with one 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.420
 capacity of 4,100 media per hour 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.510
 and huawei here states that we two 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.159
 days to get away with it all 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.650
 case is in itself very desirable 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.790
 because most smartphones charge 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.690
 afternoon but with a 4100 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.479
 more hours of battery 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.930
 there should be a little something behind it 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.110
 stand 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.600
 there are still a few reserves like 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.460
 you can already see here metal case 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.340
 that is very nice too so i am one 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.520
 real fan of have here the 13th 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.790
 megapixel camera with sony sensor and 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.720
 here still photo led and a fingerprint 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.570
 scanner forward is a 5 megapixel 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.760
 camera attached up here with in one 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.400
 good wide angle so you with yours 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.840
 it also has enough information 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.749
 it does not get on the smartphone 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.890
 It must be very far away 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:17.300
 also for professionals like rogers 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.350
 otherwise the smartphone still has it here 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.240
 a mali 16 28 gpu so should here 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.390
 in any case enough power for you 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.980
 have games and in my coming 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.120
 of course, I will test report too 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.010
 some benchmarks and games 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.050
 install so we can see what 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.709
 this banned or smartphone so everything 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.470
 can afford 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.740
 she will be in germany at the end of october 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.410
 the market come for a price of 500 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.709
 Euro we even briefly gets around 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.790
 name here power button volume buttons 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.280
 and here then do that 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.450
 headphone jack 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.330
 this sentence on the left we have 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.970
 then the sim card slot micro sd cards 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.769
 slot and that the german version there 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.019
 is now with chris the chancellor in 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.120
 the international version will then 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.769
 so here is at least presented yet 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.040
 another sim card slot is there 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.739
 then give a dual sim to the versions 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.430
 unfortunately, that's not what it's all about in Germany 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.840
 is this simon this micro sd 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.739
 You can use your smartphone below 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.989
 charge so that's the huawei s7 here 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.410
 that presented in berlin on eva 2014 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.720
 has been 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.730
 Let me know in the comments if 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.970
 this is a smartphone for you more 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.700
 everything from the size can say of 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.130
 the processing really top metal housing 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.280
 feels really good on the hand too 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.870
 if it's really big it is 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.870
 maybe a little big you see 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.630
 her like that can look like in my hand 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.140
 you can use it well to gamble here 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:52.640
 watch movies but one-hand operation is 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.110
 hard I have to be the one we prefer 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.160
 the little ones and smartphones leave me 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.170
 just know below in the comments 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.549
 and if any questions about that 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.500
 then you just ask me 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.630
 below in the comments and will 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.900
 try to answer for you 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.950
