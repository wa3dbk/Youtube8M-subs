up over here so it's not peeking in the
center<00:03:41.560> is<00:03:41.650> peeking<00:03:41.980> a<00:03:42.040> little<00:03:42.340> bit<00:03:42.490> medial<00:03:43.060> or

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
center is peeking a little bit medial or

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.780 
center is peeking a little bit medial or
towards<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.170> center's<00:03:44.620> let's<00:03:45.460> draw<00:03:45.730> the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
towards the center's let's draw the

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.940 
towards the center's let's draw the
bottom<00:03:47.160> eyelid<00:03:48.360> now<00:03:49.360> my<00:03:49.540> pumpkin<00:03:49.989> is<00:03:50.110> is<00:03:50.290> being

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
bottom eyelid now my pumpkin is is being

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.590 
bottom eyelid now my pumpkin is is being
a<00:03:51.100> little<00:03:51.280> bit<00:03:51.400> splintering<00:03:51.970> it's

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
a little bit splintering it's

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.770 
a little bit splintering it's
splintering<00:03:53.140> a<00:03:53.260> little<00:03:53.530> so<00:03:54.390> normally<00:03:55.390> I<00:03:55.450> would

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
splintering a little so normally I would

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.500 
splintering a little so normally I would
I<00:03:56.020> would<00:03:56.709> baby<00:03:57.160> if<00:03:57.430> things<00:03:57.910> are<00:03:58.030> splintering

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
I would baby if things are splintering

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.020 
I would baby if things are splintering
that<00:03:58.750> much<00:03:58.959> sometimes<00:03:59.920> you<00:04:00.670> want<00:04:00.790> want<00:04:00.940> to

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
that much sometimes you want want to

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.250 
that much sometimes you want want to
jump<00:04:01.300> to<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.510> knife<00:04:01.690> right<00:04:01.959> away<00:04:02.110> because

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
jump to the knife right away because

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.020 
jump to the knife right away because
it's<00:04:02.410> sharper<00:04:02.830> and<00:04:03.250> it'll<00:04:03.550> prevent<00:04:03.850> the

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
it's sharper and it'll prevent the

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.860 
it's sharper and it'll prevent the
splintering<00:04:04.600> but<00:04:05.560> I<00:04:06.370> kind<00:04:07.360> of<00:04:07.420> really<00:04:07.660> want<00:04:07.690> to

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
splintering but I kind of really want to

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.440 
splintering but I kind of really want to
show<00:04:08.110> you<00:04:08.280> how<00:04:09.280> far<00:04:09.670> you<00:04:09.820> can<00:04:09.970> get<00:04:10.150> without

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
show you how far you can get without

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.780 
show you how far you can get without

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
using a knife now I'm going to do the

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.990 
using a knife now I'm going to do the
same<00:04:13.030> thing<00:04:13.510> but<00:04:13.780> I<00:04:13.900> kind<00:04:14.110> of<00:04:14.140> upside<00:04:14.560> down<00:04:15.000> for

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
size of the iris and where it's going to

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.409 
size of the iris and where it's going to
go<00:04:44.530> I<00:04:44.770> want<00:04:45.010> to<00:04:45.070> straight<00:04:45.370> down<00:04:45.640> so<00:04:45.940> I'm<00:04:46.120> kind

of<00:04:46.450> go<00:04:46.570> centered<00:04:46.990> I'm<00:04:47.500> going<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:47.770> go<00:04:47.980> straight

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
of go centered I'm going to go straight

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.380 
of go centered I'm going to go straight
down<00:04:48.520> and

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:03.790 

I<00:04:56.590> have<00:04:57.590> my<00:04:57.800> cut<00:04:58.160> go<00:04:58.430> straight<00:04:59.000> in<00:05:01.930> okay<00:05:02.930> there

next<00:05:05.240> thing<00:05:05.360> I<00:05:05.390> do<00:05:05.660> is<00:05:05.780> I'm<00:05:05.900> gonna<00:05:06.020> figure<00:05:06.590> out

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
next thing I do is I'm gonna figure out

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.260 
next thing I do is I'm gonna figure out
where<00:05:06.920> I<00:05:06.950> want<00:05:07.070> my<00:05:07.340> highlight<00:05:08.000> in<00:05:08.120> the<00:05:08.240> eye

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
where I want my highlight in the eye

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.700 
where I want my highlight in the eye
then<00:05:09.200> I<00:05:09.350> have<00:05:09.470> to<00:05:09.530> highlight<00:05:09.770> up<00:05:10.220> and<00:05:10.520> to<00:05:11.710> maybe

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
then I have to highlight up and to maybe

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.820 
then I have to highlight up and to maybe
say<00:05:12.980> two<00:05:13.220> o'clock<00:05:13.930> so<00:05:14.930> and<00:05:15.380> I'm<00:05:15.470> not<00:05:15.650> going<00:05:15.770> to

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
say two o'clock so and I'm not going to

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.190 
say two o'clock so and I'm not going to
have<00:05:15.920> the<00:05:16.280> edge<00:05:16.460> of<00:05:16.730> the<00:05:16.850> of<00:05:17.060> the<00:05:17.510> iris<00:05:17.870> I<00:05:17.990> want

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
have the edge of the of the iris I want

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.050 
have the edge of the of the iris I want
it<00:05:18.260> to<00:05:18.350> kind<00:05:18.500> of<00:05:18.590> overlap<00:05:19.100> the<00:05:19.340> iris<00:05:19.790> and<00:05:20.000> the

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
it to kind of overlap the iris and the

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.620 
it to kind of overlap the iris and the
pupil<00:05:20.120> so<00:05:20.800> I'm<00:05:21.800> going<00:05:22.310> to<00:05:22.370> kind<00:05:22.520> of<00:05:22.610> make<00:05:22.790> a<00:05:22.820> cut

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
pupil so I'm going to kind of make a cut

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:32.740 
pupil so I'm going to kind of make a cut
right<00:05:24.550> about<00:05:27.190> there<00:05:28.190> and<00:05:30.790> that<00:05:31.790> little<00:05:32.270> square

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
right about there and that little square

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.340 
right about there and that little square
right<00:05:33.140> there<00:05:33.530> is<00:05:33.770> going<00:05:33.950> to<00:05:34.010> be<00:05:34.130> the<00:05:34.310> highlight

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
right there is going to be the highlight

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.310 
right there is going to be the highlight
okay<00:05:36.350> next<00:05:36.980> step<00:05:37.220> I'm<00:05:37.370> going<00:05:37.520> to<00:05:37.580> do<00:05:37.730> is<00:05:38.260> take<00:05:39.260> a

be careful not to grab that highlight
and<00:05:58.490> pull<00:05:59.030> out<00:05:59.240> it's<00:05:59.480> really<00:06:00.050> small<00:06:00.470> and<00:06:00.770> thin

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
and pull out it's really small and thin

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.730 
and pull out it's really small and thin
so<00:06:01.280> it<00:06:01.400> can<00:06:01.610> tear<00:06:02.390> if<00:06:02.690> it<00:06:02.840> tears<00:06:03.050> off<00:06:03.320> just

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
so it can tear if it tears off just

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.480 
so it can tear if it tears off just
super<00:06:04.160> glue<00:06:04.280> it<00:06:04.400> back<00:06:04.430> or<00:06:05.150> pin<00:06:05.960> it<00:06:06.080> back<00:06:06.490> what's

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
super glue it back or pin it back what's

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:14.020 
super glue it back or pin it back what's
a<00:06:07.580> piece<00:06:07.760> of<00:06:07.880> wire<00:06:08.090> or<00:06:08.120> something

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.140 

there<00:06:14.720> you<00:06:14.840> go<00:06:14.990> that<00:06:15.470> what<00:06:16.070> we<00:06:16.190> want<00:06:16.460> not<00:06:16.940> what

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
there you go that what we want not what

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.920 
there you go that what we want not what
we<00:06:17.270> accomplished<00:06:17.780> here<00:06:18.020> is<00:06:18.170> is<00:06:18.440> um<00:06:19.810> you<00:06:20.810> know

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
we accomplished here is is um you know

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.220 
we accomplished here is is um you know
we've<00:06:21.140> we've<00:06:22.130> established<00:06:22.540> an<00:06:23.540> entire<00:06:23.870> all

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
we've we've established an entire all

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.590 
we've we've established an entire all
the<00:06:24.530> fundamentals<00:06:25.340> that<00:06:25.580> you<00:06:25.970> need<00:06:26.180> to<00:06:26.330> create

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.600 
the fundamentals that you need to create

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.670 
the fundamentals that you need to create
a<00:06:26.630> face<00:06:26.900> and<00:06:28.690> from<00:06:29.690> here<00:06:30.170> you<00:06:30.320> can<00:06:30.440> take<00:06:30.560> the

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:30.680 
a face and from here you can take the

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.160 
a face and from here you can take the
basic<00:06:31.040> principles<00:06:31.550> and<00:06:31.790> apply<00:06:32.720> it<00:06:32.780> to<00:06:32.990> all

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.170 
basic principles and apply it to all

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.260 
basic principles and apply it to all
sorts<00:06:33.680> of<00:06:33.740> phases<00:06:34.130> whether<00:06:34.340> the<00:06:34.520> angry<00:06:35.000> faces

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
sorts of phases whether the angry faces

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.330 
sorts of phases whether the angry faces
and<00:06:35.570> monstrous<00:06:35.960> ones<00:06:36.320> or<00:06:36.590> you<00:06:36.950> know<00:06:37.040> we<00:06:37.130> didn't

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 
and monstrous ones or you know we didn't

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.670 
and monstrous ones or you know we didn't
do<00:06:37.400> teeth<00:06:37.580> but<00:06:37.760> we<00:06:37.850> did<00:06:37.970> teeth<00:06:38.410> we<00:06:39.410> address

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
do teeth but we did teeth we address

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.600 
do teeth but we did teeth we address
some<00:06:39.710> teeth<00:06:39.980> and<00:06:40.130> the<00:06:40.190> other<00:06:40.340> thing<00:06:40.520> that's

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
some teeth and the other thing that's

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.460 
some teeth and the other thing that's
the<00:06:40.760> same<00:06:40.790> same<00:06:41.510> way<00:06:41.720> you<00:06:41.780> go<00:06:42.050> about<00:06:42.080> the<00:06:42.320> teeth

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 
the same same way you go about the teeth

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.060 
the same same way you go about the teeth
the<00:06:42.590> same<00:06:42.770> way<00:06:43.540> so<00:06:44.540> you<00:06:44.930> look<00:06:45.440> utilizing<00:06:45.950> that

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
the same way so you look utilizing that

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.190 
the same way so you look utilizing that
you<00:06:46.910> should<00:06:47.090> be<00:06:47.240> able<00:06:47.330> to<00:06:47.480> create<00:06:47.930> some<00:06:48.050> pretty

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:48.200 
you should be able to create some pretty

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.710 
you should be able to create some pretty
neat<00:06:48.380> designs
