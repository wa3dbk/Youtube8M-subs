00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
in on the other side of the house we had

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.650 
in on the other side of the house we had
trees<00:00:18.750> planted<00:00:19.230> around<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:20.330> when<00:00:21.330> we<00:00:21.480> first

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
trees planted around and when we first

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
moved in here we had no trees and so we

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.839

just<00:01:31.979> do<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.430> lack<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.729> water<00:01:33.170> but<00:01:34.170> we

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
just do this in the lack of water but we

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.469 
just do this in the lack of water but we
have<00:01:34.560> found<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.220> actually<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:36.299> dirt

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
have found that it actually the dirt

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.140 
have found that it actually the dirt
grows<00:01:36.750> pretty<00:01:37.079> well<00:01:37.409> as<00:01:37.740> long<00:01:38.369> as<00:01:38.640> we<00:01:39.030> get

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
grows pretty well as long as we get

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.370 
grows pretty well as long as we get
water<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.740> so<00:01:40.740> I'm<00:01:40.890> looking<00:01:41.009> forward<00:01:41.220> to

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
water to it so I'm looking forward to

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.289
