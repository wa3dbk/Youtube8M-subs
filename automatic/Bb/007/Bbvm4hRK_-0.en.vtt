00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
bit more as well but I think the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.740 
bit more as well but I think the
preseason<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.000> all<00:01:21.090> about<00:01:21.240> getting<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.540> team

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
preseason is all about getting the team

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.530 
preseason is all about getting the team
together<00:01:21.869> get<00:01:22.290> them<00:01:22.500> as<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> group<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.549> get<00:01:24.420> it

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
together get them as a group and get it

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.170 
together get them as a group and get it
going<00:01:24.570> into<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.049> season<00:01:25.229> as<00:01:25.530> one<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.939> think

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
going into the season as one and I think

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.160 
going into the season as one and I think
this<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.689> would<00:01:27.930> be<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> great

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170
