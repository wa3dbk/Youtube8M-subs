00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 The house was doing now, let's go. 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.269
 find the ball back in front of 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.880
 no one who has preferential tokyo is 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.299
 from the roundabout as long as you do not have anyone 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.770
 time who has entered and preferably 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.180
 from the moment you're in 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.550
 of the roundabout 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.619
 the priority is yours then a car that 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.420
 is coming to how much now it should 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.619
 allow you to do 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.019
 and now we have a situation 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.720
 different came two cars in the 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.820
 that the good difference has 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.260
 that deliberate trajectory would have 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.600
 prepared 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.270
 then that unfortunately people 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.800
 lack of knowledge they are now 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.809
 two cars arrived who have the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.840
 preference to enter the traffic circle is 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.059
 who is on the right side of why who 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.660
 it's on the right side i was on my side 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.460
 that then Catholics would not have 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.140
 expected and did not wait 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.270
 but it will be very difficult here in sÃ£o 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:03.030
 If you meet someone and their 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.220
 and when the cars arrive car that is 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.990
 the right has priority because 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.820
 on one side of the driver who is 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.510
 then exposed for the sake of 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.119
 safety 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.670
 one that is more exposed between 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.220
 first and then the car servants 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.689
 direct it will not stop pops is easy 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.509
 passes over then rotational 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.299
 even knowing the rule is never 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.310
 Trust her at the roundabout. 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.700
 little have you seen any of the 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.729
 people gave us the preference 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.159
 there and it happened because I really did not have 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:44.539
 another option is when the year depends on you 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.539
 All right but in truth from others. 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.290
 do not know if because all care is little 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.300
 Why can this happen? There's another one. 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.120
 roundabout simply prohibit a 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.120
 person passing over her ignores the
