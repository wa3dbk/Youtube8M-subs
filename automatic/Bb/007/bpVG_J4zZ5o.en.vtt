think<00:01:46.400> strating<00:01:46.850> was<00:01:47.030> on<00:01:47.510> a<00:01:47.600> play<00:01:47.780> when<00:01:48.110> it

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
think strating was on a play when it

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.720 
think strating was on a play when it
looks<00:01:48.530> like<00:01:48.680> you<00:01:48.770> get<00:01:48.890> cross-checked<00:01:49.550> in<00:01:49.640> the

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
looks like you get cross-checked in the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.010 
looks like you get cross-checked in the
ribs<00:01:49.910> there<00:01:50.120> and<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.300> stick<00:01:50.540> breaks<00:01:50.810> that

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
ribs there and the stick breaks that

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.900 
ribs there and the stick breaks that
there's<00:01:51.200> no<00:01:51.320> copy<00:01:51.740> on<00:01:51.860> them<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:52.340> z<00:01:52.580> ends<00:01:52.730> up

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
there's no copy on them and z ends up

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.160 
there's no copy on them and z ends up
getting<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.180> instigator<00:01:53.690> there<00:01:53.900> for

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
getting the instigator there for

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.470 
getting the instigator there for
stepping<00:01:54.890> up<00:01:54.950> one<00:01:55.160> of<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.340> statement<00:01:55.730> yeah

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.480 
stepping up one of the statement yeah

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.220 
stepping up one of the statement yeah
definitely<00:01:56.810> frustrating<00:01:58.660> you<00:01:59.660> know<00:01:59.780> I<00:01:59.810> don't

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
definitely frustrating you know I don't

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.320 
definitely frustrating you know I don't
get<00:02:00.640> little<00:02:01.640> bit<00:02:01.730> too<00:02:01.850> much<00:02:01.970> to<00:02:02.090> say<00:02:02.240> on<00:02:02.270> that

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
get little bit too much to say on that

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.300 
get little bit too much to say on that
just<00:02:02.690> how<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.410> play<00:02:03.620> when<00:02:03.770> we<00:02:03.920> killed<00:02:04.100> it<00:02:04.190> off

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
just how to play when we killed it off

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.460 
just how to play when we killed it off
and<00:02:04.550> no<00:02:05.240> came<00:02:05.420> off<00:02:05.600> that<00:02:05.630> came<00:02:06.020> up<00:02:06.140> short<00:02:06.260> the

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470
