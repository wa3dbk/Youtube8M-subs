not<00:01:26.130> sponsor<00:01:26.549> or<00:01:26.610> anything<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.390> wasn't<00:01:27.750> a

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
not sponsor or anything so it wasn't a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.469 
not sponsor or anything so it wasn't a
bias<00:01:28.020> review<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> thought<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.880> had<00:01:30.150> nothing

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
bias review so I thought I had nothing

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.289 
bias review so I thought I had nothing
to<00:01:30.570> lose<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:31.470> this<00:01:32.340> video<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.909> actually<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
to lose in this video is actually the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.630 
to lose in this video is actually the
model<00:01:33.479> RS<00:01:33.960> coilovers<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.799> actually<00:01:35.280> personally

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
model RS coilovers I actually personally

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.539 
model RS coilovers I actually personally
had<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.210> model<00:01:36.390> max<00:01:36.720> coilovers<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.590> my<00:01:37.799> car

had the model max coilovers in my car

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.390 
had the model max coilovers in my car
but<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.780> major<00:01:39.960> difference<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.860> rear

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
but the major difference is the rear

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.200 
but the major difference is the rear
spring<00:01:41.729> rates
