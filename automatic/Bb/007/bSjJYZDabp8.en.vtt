by seed and we'll show you how to do

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.970 
by seed and we'll show you how to do
both<00:00:26.609> here<00:00:27.029> now<00:00:27.750> there's<00:00:28.050> different<00:00:28.410> types<00:00:28.680> of

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
daisies and shasta daisies that grow

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.690 
daisies and shasta daisies that grow
very<00:00:36.600> similar<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.260> they're<00:00:37.440> taller<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.160> so

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
very similar but they're taller and so

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.880 
very similar but they're taller and so
they're<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.780> root<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.170> well<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.770> can

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
they're just to root as well so you can

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.090 
they're just to root as well so you can
start<00:00:41.040> them<00:00:41.430> by<00:00:41.460> root<00:00:41.940> or<00:00:42.239> by<00:00:42.960> seed<00:00:43.440> either<00:00:43.770> way

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
start them by root or by seed either way

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.279 
start them by root or by seed either way
so<00:00:44.969> now<00:00:45.329> we're<00:00:45.510> starting<00:00:45.899> our<00:00:46.050> English

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
so now we're starting our English

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.529 
so now we're starting our English
daisies<00:00:46.739> by<00:00:46.950> seeds<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.149> save<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
daisies by seeds you can just save the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.840 
daisies by seeds you can just save the
seeds<00:00:48.840> from<00:00:49.140> when<00:00:49.379> you're<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> next<00:00:50.160> or<00:00:50.579> as

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
seeds from when you're to the next or as

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.220 
seeds from when you're to the next or as
soon<00:00:51.030> as<00:00:51.180> they're<00:00:51.360> done<00:00:51.390> blooming<00:00:51.719> then<00:00:52.110> they

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
soon as they're done blooming then they

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.779 
soon as they're done blooming then they
make<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> little<00:00:52.739> seed<00:00:52.920> pods<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.579> lots

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
make the little seed pods you have lots

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.029 
make the little seed pods you have lots
of<00:00:53.940> little<00:00:54.180> seeds<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.530> break<00:00:55.770> those

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
of little seeds and you can break those

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.010 
of little seeds and you can break those
up<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.120> can<00:00:57.270> turn<00:00:57.449> around<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.930> plant

those right in the soil or you can put
them<00:00:59.820> right<00:01:00.030> into<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.420> seed<00:01:00.690> tray<00:01:01.850> just<00:01:02.850> kind<00:01:03.030> of

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
them right into a seed tray just kind of

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.750 
them right into a seed tray just kind of
break<00:01:03.300> them<00:01:03.449> up<00:01:03.680> just<00:01:04.680> breaking<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.220> seeds<00:01:05.489> up

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
break them up just breaking the seeds up

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.429 
break them up just breaking the seeds up
this<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.090> what<00:01:06.330> they<00:01:06.479> do<00:01:06.540> naturally<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.409> your

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
this is what they do naturally in your

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.330 
this is what they do naturally in your
yard<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.330> then<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:09.659> cover<00:01:09.930> those<00:01:10.260> up

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
yard and then you just cover those up

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.109 
yard and then you just cover those up
barely<00:01:12.860> maybe<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.979> half<00:01:14.610> an<00:01:14.760> inch<00:01:14.909> or<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.360> and

barely maybe a half an inch or so and
then<00:01:18.119> water<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.869> really<00:01:19.290> well<00:01:19.619> using<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
then water it in really well using a

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.469 
then water it in really well using a
mister<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.640> don't<00:01:20.820> want<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.000> use<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> lot<00:01:21.450> of

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
mister you don't want to use a lot of

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.999 
mister you don't want to use a lot of
pressure<00:01:21.750> because<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.229> dirts<00:01:22.619> just<00:01:22.830> going<00:01:22.950> to

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
pressure because the dirts just going to

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.010 
pressure because the dirts just going to
come<00:01:23.189> right<00:01:23.430> out<00:01:23.460> or<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.390> put<00:01:24.540> material

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
come right out or you can put material

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.039 
come right out or you can put material
on<00:01:25.140> top<00:01:25.380> either<00:01:25.650> way<00:01:25.890> it'll<00:01:26.070> do<00:01:26.220> really<00:01:26.549> well

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
on top either way it'll do really well

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.350 
on top either way it'll do really well
or<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.380> start<00:01:28.740> them<00:01:28.799> by<00:01:29.009> root<00:01:29.340> an<00:01:30.090> easy

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
or you can start them by root an easy

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.090 
or you can start them by root an easy
way<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.630> start<00:01:30.960> them<00:01:31.079> by<00:01:31.110> root<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:31.680> to

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
way to start them by root is just to

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.210 
way to start them by root is just to
break<00:01:32.369> all<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.939> roots<00:01:33.650> break<00:01:34.650> all<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.009> dirt

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
break all the roots break all the dirt

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.800 
break all the roots break all the dirt
off<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.670> don't<00:01:35.820> want<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:36.000> break<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.600> roots

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
off you don't want to break the roots

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.749 
off you don't want to break the roots
apart<00:01:37.229> from<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> stems<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.549> want<00:01:38.729> to

apart from the stems but you want to
break<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.150> apart<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.810> then<00:01:40.500> whenever<00:01:40.710> there's

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
break it apart and then whenever there's

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.889

two plants or three plants you can

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.950 
two plants or three plants you can
actually<00:01:43.110> kind<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.619> work<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.759> apart<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.750> you

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
from the roots if you work carefully

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.980 
from the roots if you work carefully
enough<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.060> actually<00:01:51.390> take<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> start

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
enough you can actually take a start

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
right off of it you have a root and you

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.660 
right off of it you have a root and you
can<00:01:54.360> turn<00:01:54.570> around<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.290> divide<00:01:55.649> your<00:01:56.250> daisies
