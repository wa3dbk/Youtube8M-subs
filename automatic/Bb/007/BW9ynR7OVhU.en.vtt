00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.640 
installment of the game this is
something<00:00:34.850> that<00:00:35.000> we<00:00:35.180> were<00:00:35.330> spoiling<00:00:35.930> a<00:00:36.020> bit<00:00:36.230> in

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:36.650 
something that we were spoiling a bit in

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.130 
something that we were spoiling a bit in
the<00:00:36.890> first<00:00:37.160> first<00:00:37.489> part<00:00:37.820> of<00:00:37.910> the<00:00:38.030> game<00:00:38.180> this<00:00:38.960> is

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
the first first part of the game this is

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.660 
the first first part of the game this is
something<00:00:39.530> that<00:00:39.559> all<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.129> readers<00:00:40.460> of<00:00:40.489> the

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
something that all the readers of the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.670 
something that all the readers of the
books<00:00:41.000> created<00:00:41.300> by<00:00:41.660> sub<00:00:41.870> Koski<00:00:42.290> know<00:00:42.440> more

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
books created by sub Koski know more

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.880 
books created by sub Koski know more
about<00:00:42.850> but<00:00:43.850> that's<00:00:44.270> I<00:00:44.809> think<00:00:45.260> it's<00:00:45.559> the<00:00:45.680> first

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
about but that's I think it's the first

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.830 
about but that's I think it's the first
time<00:00:46.129> in<00:00:46.309> our<00:00:46.370> games<00:00:46.730> when<00:00:47.090> Wild<00:00:47.449> Hunt<00:00:47.690> is

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
time in our games when Wild Hunt is

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:57.160 
time in our games when Wild Hunt is
becoming<00:00:48.199> so<00:00:48.470> important

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.520 

so<00:00:57.770> The<00:00:58.190> Witcher<00:00:58.430> 3<00:00:58.460> is<00:00:58.899> evolving<00:00:59.899> in<00:01:00.170> many

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
so The Witcher 3 is evolving in many

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.889 
so The Witcher 3 is evolving in many
different<00:01:00.800> ways<00:01:01.070> in<00:01:01.700> comparison<00:01:02.480> to<00:01:02.510> Witcher

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
different ways in comparison to Witcher

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.770 
different ways in comparison to Witcher
2<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.320> Witcher<00:01:03.649> 1<00:01:03.680> is<00:01:04.159> becoming<00:01:05.089> first<00:01:05.420> of<00:01:05.630> all

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
2 and Witcher 1 is becoming first of all

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.750 
2 and Witcher 1 is becoming first of all
an<00:01:06.020> open-world<00:01:06.619> game<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:09.680> combat<00:01:10.100> system<00:01:10.310> had

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
an open-world game the combat system had

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.380 
an open-world game the combat system had
evolved<00:01:11.390> alchemy<00:01:12.170> system<00:01:12.680> basically<00:01:13.369> most<00:01:14.210> of
