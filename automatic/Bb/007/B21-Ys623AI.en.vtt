[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:02.480

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.710
Welcome to the Waterpik® shower
head installation video.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.880
Replacing your shower head
is so easy, anyone can do it

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.080
and it takes just a few minutes.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.990
Some tools you may
need for installation

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.850
are adjustable pliers
and a cloth rag.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.870
The first step is to
remove the old shower head.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.830
To make sure you don't
scratch the fixture,

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.300
cover the pliers
with the cloth rag.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.610
Use the pliers to remove
the existing shower

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.690
head from the pipe
by unscrewing in

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.770
a counterclockwise direction.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.650
Once removed, set the
shower head aside.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.700
Before you install
the new shower head,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.160
you should first remove any old
Teflon tape or plumber's putty.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.170
Unpack your hand held
shower head and components.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.550
Locate the shower bracket and
find the threaded connection.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.290
Make sure the rubber
washer is in place.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.260
Thread the bracket onto the
pipe in a clockwise direction

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.170
and tighten by hand.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.680

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.120
Place the rag over the
pivot ball connection

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.010
to protect from
scratching the product.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.400
Tighten the connection
securely with the pliers,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.530
but do not over-tighten.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.780
Once the connection is snug,
loosen the large bracket nut

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.630
and rotate the
front of the bracket

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.510
to the desired position.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.530
When positioned correctly,
retighten the nut.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.960
Locate the shower hose
and check the connections

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.290
to make sure the rubber
washers are present.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.790
Locate the hose end that
connects to the bracket

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.210
by checking the labeling.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.110
If there's no labeling on
your hose, then either end

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.340
should work.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.610
Connect the correct
hose end to the bracket

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.370
by turning clockwise.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.230
Run your hand down the
hose to unfurl any twists,

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.050
then connect the other end
of the hose to the shower

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.820
by turning in a
clockwise direction.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.780
Place the shower
head into the bracket

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.110
in the preferred position.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.780
Turn on the water all the
way and test all connections

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.940
for leakage.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.860
If leaks appear at any
of the connections,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.040
shut off the water, tighten
the connection, and retest.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.390
If no leaks are visible, you
are ready to enjoy your Waterpik®

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.030
shower head.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.770
It takes just minutes to
power up your daily shower

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.740
experience.
