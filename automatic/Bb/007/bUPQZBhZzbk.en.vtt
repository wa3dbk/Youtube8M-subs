to<00:02:08.819> be<00:02:08.940> slightly<00:02:09.209> off<00:02:09.629> just<00:02:10.410> with<00:02:10.470> these

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
to be slightly off just with these

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.890 
to be slightly off just with these
angles<00:02:11.250> here<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:12.510> normally<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.290> know

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
angles here and normally you know

with<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.379> 14<00:02:14.739> to<00:02:14.799> 24<00:02:15.159> so<00:02:15.400> awkward<00:02:15.790> because

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
with that 14 to 24 so awkward because

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
this line looks straight I mean just

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.309 
this line looks straight I mean just
lines<00:02:19.090> just<00:02:19.360> get<00:02:19.569> weird<00:02:19.840> if<00:02:20.019> you're<00:02:20.140> not

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.910 
lines just get weird if you're not
perfectly<00:02:21.989> you<00:02:22.989> know<00:02:23.079> on<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.439> right<00:02:23.590> angle

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
perfectly you know on the right angle

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.800 
perfectly you know on the right angle
but<00:02:24.040> keep<00:02:24.220> in<00:02:24.340> mind<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.670> bus<00:02:24.849> is<00:02:25.030> moving<00:02:25.060> here
