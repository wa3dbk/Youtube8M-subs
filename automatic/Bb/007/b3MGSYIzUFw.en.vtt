00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.590
Gokyo is the fifth technique in the series
of techniques the Sensei established.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:16.250
And it is primarily used in removing a knife,
or a Tonto, from your partner's hand.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.350
But we'll demonstrate it real briefly.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.570
Let's start with the Shomenuchi.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.140
So normally when we start Shomenuchi, in this
whole series we begin from Ikkyo.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.119
Things change a little bit at Gokyo.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.450
Normally we would have our hand on top, and
rotate it over, so that I'm grabbing his wrist

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.050
from the top here, if we were to execute Ikkyo.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.210
For Gokyo, both hands come up underneath.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.440
As I move away I'm going to grab his wrist
from underneath, and lock the elbow.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.710
And move away from my partner, shoulder goes
down.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.649
Knee closest to my partner is down.

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.640
And I'm going to use the elbow to lift.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.469
Hand slides underneath the elbow, and you
want to put pressure down on the elbow.

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:05.590
With a pin.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.670
So Gokyo.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.710
Shomenuchi.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.750
Up.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.790
Turn.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.450
You've got the hand from underneath and the
elbow is locked.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.290
Straight down on top of the shoulder, Again,
knee that is closest to your partner is up.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.290
Lift the elbow.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.140
I'm going to use my hand to push my partner's
hand underneath the elbow, and apply pressure.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.920
You'll notice that it's almost impossible
for my partner to make a fist in this position.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:41.121
Which is exactly why it works very well with
the Tonto.

00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:46.960
So from that same attack overhand, the Shomenuchi,
one of the reasons I don't want to put my

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.720
hand here, is if the blade were to cut down
and make contact with my wrist.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.470
That's why I'm going to come from underneath,
lock the elbow and take it away from my partner's

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.790
body, and drop.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.820
When it's out, slide the Tonto underneath,
and the hand will pop open.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.740
It's very difficult to keep a fist in this
position.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.060
You can also see this from Yokomenuchi.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:26.409
Open, reach across and take the wrist, turn
the hips, create the pin, and take the knife.

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.269
Alright?

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.129
Gokyo.

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:30.810
Number five.
