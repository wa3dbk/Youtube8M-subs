long shot with him even though the
players<00:01:26.009> not<00:01:26.189> playing<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.000> angle<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.420> was

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
players not playing but the angle it was

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.359 
players not playing but the angle it was
at<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.259> goalkeeper<00:01:28.439> could<00:01:28.860> not<00:01:29.009> save<00:01:29.220> it

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
at and the goalkeeper could not save it

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.740 
at and the goalkeeper could not save it
because<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.790> goalkeeper<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.299> controlled<00:01:30.720> by

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
because the goalkeeper is controlled by

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.319 
because the goalkeeper is controlled by
CPU<00:01:31.290> anyway<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.549> was<00:01:32.729> such<00:01:32.970> an<00:01:33.119> amazing

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
CPU anyway so it was such an amazing

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.300 
CPU anyway so it was such an amazing
shot<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> player<00:01:34.320> was<00:01:34.740> not<00:01:34.979> playing

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
shot but the player was not playing

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.130 
shot but the player was not playing
during<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.790> clip<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.420> want<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.869> let<00:01:36.990> you

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
during that clip I just want to let you

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.679 
during that clip I just want to let you
guys<00:01:37.259> know<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.740> he<00:01:38.280> has<00:01:38.460> amazing<00:01:39.240> strength<00:01:39.540> I

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
guys know that he has amazing strength I

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.960 
guys know that he has amazing strength I
didn't<00:01:40.079> feel<00:01:40.259> he<00:01:40.470> was<00:01:40.500> as<00:01:40.979> strong<00:01:41.009> as<00:01:41.400> Burkham

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
didn't feel he was as strong as Burkham

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.389 
didn't feel he was as strong as Burkham
because<00:01:42.270> his<00:01:42.390> aggression<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.290> very<00:01:43.829> very<00:01:44.159> low

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
because his aggression is very very low

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.039 
because his aggression is very very low
so<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.970> keep<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.360> mind<00:01:45.570> don't

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
so you have to keep that in mind don't

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.749 
so you have to keep that in mind don't
expect<00:01:46.409> him<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.770> stronger<00:01:47.159> than<00:01:47.189> Bergkamp

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
expect him to be stronger than Bergkamp

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.210 
expect him to be stronger than Bergkamp
Bergkamp<00:01:48.479> for<00:01:48.810> me<00:01:48.930> was<00:01:49.170> extremely<00:01:49.619> strong

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
Bergkamp for me was extremely strong

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.700 
Bergkamp for me was extremely strong

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
as perfect as Bergkamp but then again

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.800 
as perfect as Bergkamp but then again
the<00:02:29.099> price<00:02:29.370> difference<00:02:29.760> is<00:02:29.939> quite<00:02:30.389> big

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
the price difference is quite big

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.839

between<00:02:31.200> him<00:02:31.349> and<00:02:31.500> Bergkamp<00:02:31.889> as<00:02:32.040> well<00:02:32.280> but

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
between him and Bergkamp as well but

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.030

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.240 
the gateway but on the pitch
he's<00:02:57.150> extremely<00:02:57.720> good<00:02:58.109> in<00:02:58.139> my<00:02:58.379> opinion<00:02:58.530> just

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
he's extremely good in my opinion just

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.649 
he's extremely good in my opinion just
the<00:02:59.370> dribbling<00:02:59.760> and<00:02:59.879> the<00:03:00.030> freestyle<00:03:00.450> skills

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
the dribbling and the freestyle skills

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.330 
the dribbling and the freestyle skills
his<00:03:00.900> agility<00:03:01.319> is<00:03:01.680> really<00:03:02.040> though<00:03:02.159> I<00:03:02.189> think

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
his agility is really though I think

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.039 
his agility is really though I think
that's<00:03:02.669> why<00:03:02.790> his<00:03:02.969> dribbling<00:03:03.329> is<00:03:03.510> pretty<00:03:03.840> bad

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
that's why his dribbling is pretty bad

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.050 
that's why his dribbling is pretty bad
but<00:03:04.260> then<00:03:04.680> again<00:03:04.889> his<00:03:05.040> dribbling<00:03:05.370> sets<00:03:05.609> on<00:03:05.819> to

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
but then again his dribbling sets on to

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.449 
but then again his dribbling sets on to
great<00:03:06.269> evil<00:03:06.659> so<00:03:06.840> don't<00:03:07.379> expect<00:03:07.500> him<00:03:07.980> you<00:03:08.340> know

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
great evil so don't expect him you know

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.709 
great evil so don't expect him you know
don't<00:03:08.669> expect<00:03:08.939> yourself<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.359> be<00:03:09.450> dribbling

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
don't expect yourself to be dribbling

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:11.300 
don't expect yourself to be dribbling
