ass<00:00:24.269> at<00:00:24.390> second<00:00:24.660> rotation<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.289> then<00:00:25.439> we

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
ass at second rotation and then we

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.380 
ass at second rotation and then we
wanted<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.369> first<00:00:26.609> pick<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.880> instead<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.330> they

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.179 
don't get to Trish and yeah that's
probably<00:00:30.480> with<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.779> plan<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.740> what<00:00:31.859> about<00:00:31.949> is

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189

expected him to pick resolution or

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.690 
expected him to pick resolution or
renege<00:00:43.020> solution<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.710> at<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.340> first<00:00:44.460> place

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
renege solution and at the first place

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.970 
renege solution and at the first place
and<00:00:45.000> but<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.140> knew<00:00:46.289> they<00:00:46.440> have<00:00:46.559> been<00:00:46.710> playing

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
and but we knew they have been playing

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.540 
and but we knew they have been playing
any<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.760> swims<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.289> liek<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.530> as<00:00:49.649> well<00:00:49.800> so

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
any and swims and so liek you as well so

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.700 
any and swims and so liek you as well so
I<00:00:50.579> kinda<00:00:51.120> think<00:00:51.570> they<00:00:51.750> planned<00:00:52.050> with<00:00:52.350> playing

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
I kinda think they planned with playing

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.889 
I kinda think they planned with playing
any<00:00:52.920> even<00:00:53.160> before<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.579> into<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> game<00:00:54.030> so

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
any even before going into the game so

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.200 
any even before going into the game so
they<00:00:55.110> had<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> Draven<00:00:55.860> band<00:00:56.579> out<00:00:56.760> must<00:00:57.059> feel

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
they had the Draven band out must feel

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.670

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
good for you after just a couple of

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.439 
good for you after just a couple of
performances<00:00:58.980> so<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.520> defaulted<00:01:00.059> back<00:01:00.210> to

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
performances so you defaulted back to

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.840 
performances so you defaulted back to
the<00:01:00.570> jinx<00:01:00.930> how<00:01:01.890> easy<00:01:02.039> was<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.309> choice<00:01:02.609> to

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850

make<00:01:03.000> one<00:01:03.180> or<00:01:03.210> any<00:01:03.359> other<00:01:03.570> 80<00:01:04.049> carries<00:01:04.409> that

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
make one or any other 80 carries that

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.460 
make one or any other 80 carries that
you<00:01:04.589> were<00:01:04.710> considering<00:01:05.659> well<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:07.229> game

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
you were considering well this game

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.380 
you were considering well this game
there<00:01:07.799> was<00:01:07.890> not<00:01:08.070> anything<00:01:08.729> else<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.090> could<00:01:09.240> play

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
there was not anything else I could play

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.929 
there was not anything else I could play
it<00:01:09.630> may<00:01:09.750> be<00:01:09.810> severe<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.340> kind<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.610> forced

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
it may be severe so it's kind of forced

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.100 
it may be severe so it's kind of forced
to<00:01:12.000> play<00:01:12.090> kings<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.689> then<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:12.900> play<00:01:13.080> a

little<00:01:13.260> bit<00:01:13.409> more<00:01:13.530> safe<00:01:13.770> because<00:01:14.040> they're

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
little bit more safe because they're

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.300 
little bit more safe because they're
focusing<00:01:15.210> me<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> lot<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.630> teamfights<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.320> so

super<00:02:07.740> weak<00:02:07.890> but<00:02:08.039> maybe<00:02:08.220> let's<00:02:08.429> say<00:02:08.459> three<00:02:08.729> or

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
super weak but maybe let's say three or

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.910 
super weak but maybe let's say three or
four<00:02:08.940> wins<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.470> think<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:10.530> have<00:02:10.649> really<00:02:10.800> good

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
four wins I think we have really good

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.320 
four wins I think we have really good
chances<00:02:11.310> because<00:02:11.610> we're<00:02:11.730> gonna<00:02:11.849> play<00:02:12.030> teams

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
chances because we're gonna play teams

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.350 
chances because we're gonna play teams
that<00:02:12.959> be<00:02:13.110> already<00:02:13.379> too<00:02:13.500> old

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
that be already too old

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.149 
that be already too old
so<00:02:15.360> yeah<00:02:15.629> I<00:02:15.870> think<00:02:16.170> we<00:02:16.530> have<00:02:16.860> really<00:02:17.010> good

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
so yeah I think we have really good

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.880 
so yeah I think we have really good
chances<00:02:17.549> to<00:02:17.700> go<00:02:17.849> at<00:02:18.060> least<00:02:18.209> 31<00:02:18.590> as<00:02:19.590> far<00:02:19.799> as

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
chances to go at least 31 as far as

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.740 
chances to go at least 31 as far as
bottom<00:02:20.189> lanes<00:02:20.370> go<00:02:20.610> what<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.239> one<00:02:21.360> in<00:02:21.450> super

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
bottom lanes go what is the one in super

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.210 
bottom lanes go what is the one in super
we<00:02:21.840> got<00:02:21.959> you're<00:02:22.110> dreading<00:02:22.379> the<00:02:22.560> most<00:02:22.769> going<00:02:23.129> up

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
we got you're dreading the most going up

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.380 
we got you're dreading the most going up
against<00:02:24.110> mmm<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.319> don't<00:02:25.709> know<00:02:25.890> her<00:02:26.519> forgiving

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
playing really good every game is most

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.940 
playing really good every game is most
