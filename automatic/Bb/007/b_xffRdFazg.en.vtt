00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 do not 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.760
 hello how about that what are andres very 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.370
 good for the friends that I 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.290
 they tell me to teach them how to whisk the egg 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.960
 that because it is very creamy is very 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.530
 nice or that I teach them my trick there is no 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.910
 no trick to beat the good egg 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:28.359
 in this case I'm going to need 5 eggs 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.730
 salt the blender in case you 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.010
 do not have a hand blender as 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.930
 with the hand beater either like this 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:40.059
 or from the hole what I do when I beat the egg 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:42.190
 is we have our teeth and I have this 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.790
 lima separator if you do not 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.510
 they have no matter we are going to split one of 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.510
 the eggs here 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:56.140
 maybe the secret or trick as they say 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:59.450
 you are that by separating the yolk 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.050
 only the clear is going, nothing is going 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.050
 what is the yolk 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.690
 well here we can write the yolk 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.510
 what I'm doing with my hands is 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.100
 clean hands because there are those who also 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.460
 they say we should use our hands 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.740
 well we separated the clear and we put 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.110
 in the container where we are going to beat it 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.170
 and so we're going to finish with the eggs 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.980
 that do not have this what I do to 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.080
 Sometimes this is 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.470
 as for example here comes seed you 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.950
 split the yolk what I do nothing else is 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.310
 try to get the clear 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:42.229
 and that the yolk does not go here in the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.229
 clear with care 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.050
 for that it serves to divide having these 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.050
 two utensils so if it happens to us what 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.820
 of the clear one does not break down with the others 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.380
 good since it is the return and 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.630
 we do good again 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.990
 repeat that step if we do not have the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.939
 bud separator since I have it here 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.690
 with clean hands I say again 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:12.860
 again I pull the white one the yolk 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.630
 and see here I already have it and I put it here and 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.000
 the clear one is without the full one and thus 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.180
 finished separating the yolks from the 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.180
 clear 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.640
 once we have the clear 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.579
 separated from the buds let's proceed 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.250
 a barrillo joel ali in the blender 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:34.099
 I put the maximum power and you know if 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.099
 you do not have a blender by hand 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.030
 turn off the blender so they can see how 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.950
 was already about to nougat but still 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.140
 I'm still going to beat it for about two 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.569
 minutes more and at the time that I what 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.560
 I start beating I move the blender 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.560
 I do this 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.010
 good 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.239
 Christ was left to see how it was and that's 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.879
 what is called nougat point 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.270
 when you turn the utensil and do not 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:26.520
 the egg falls 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.520
 salt but again turn on the blender 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.890
 integrated 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.370
 when adding the yolks you have to beat them 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.019
 fast and it's over and you do not have to be 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.230
 again beating and beating with the 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:01.830
 yolks and that's how the egg is for 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.410
 I hope that this easy way that 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.970
 shows them to ride them from 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.970
 utility for you friends
