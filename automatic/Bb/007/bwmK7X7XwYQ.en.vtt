this<00:00:04.740> exercise<00:00:05.069> that<00:00:05.250> power<00:00:05.519> demo<00:00:05.850> deadlift

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
this exercise that power demo deadlift

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.480 
this exercise that power demo deadlift
with<00:00:08.580> this<00:00:09.050> it's<00:00:10.050> pretty<00:00:10.320> much<00:00:10.559> just<00:00:10.920> a

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
with this it's pretty much just a

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.320 
with this it's pretty much just a
partial<00:00:12.290> ballistic<00:00:13.290> deadlift<00:00:14.280> so<00:00:15.090> you<00:00:15.150> can

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
partial ballistic deadlift so you can

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.980 
partial ballistic deadlift so you can
almost<00:00:15.480> think<00:00:15.720> of<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.109> more<00:00:16.349> as<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:17.990> explosive

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
almost think of it more as a explosive

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:27.050 
almost think of it more as a explosive
plyometric<00:00:19.980> type<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.310> exercise<00:00:21.380> on<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:26.060> you

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
plyometric type of exercise on this you

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.810 
plyometric type of exercise on this you
start<00:00:27.390> from<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.600> top<00:00:27.660> as<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.949> go<00:00:29.369> down<00:00:29.580> you're

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
start from the top as you go down you're

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.599 
start from the top as you go down you're
going<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.029> kick<00:00:30.240> your<00:00:30.330> hips<00:00:30.570> back<00:00:31.460> you<00:00:32.460> can

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:32.609 
going to kick your hips back you can

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:34.459 
going to kick your hips back you can
once<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.910> go<00:00:33.090> below<00:00:33.269> your<00:00:33.570> knees<00:00:33.750> you're

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
once you go below your knees you're

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.710 
once you go below your knees you're
going<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.649> pull<00:00:34.859> back<00:00:34.890> up<00:00:35.250> again<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:35.790> its<00:00:36.480> hips

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
going to pull back up again so its hips

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.810 
going to pull back up again so its hips
back<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.290> get<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> hamstring<00:00:37.890> stretch<00:00:38.630> up<00:00:39.630> into

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
back to get a hamstring stretch up into

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.580 
back to get a hamstring stretch up into
the<00:00:41.820> top<00:00:42.059> sit<00:00:42.360> down<00:00:43.100> hips<00:00:44.809> hips<00:00:45.809> they<00:00:46.260> need<00:00:46.410> to

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
the top sit down hips hips they need to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.750 
the top sit down hips hips they need to
wrap<00:00:51.170> each<00:00:52.170> rep<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.590> build<00:00:52.860> up<00:00:53.040> speed<00:00:53.430> in

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
wrap each rep you build up speed in

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.029 
wrap each rep you build up speed in
momentum<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:55.289> where<00:00:55.469> you're<00:00:55.620> basically

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
momentum to where you're basically

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.729 
momentum to where you're basically
dropping<00:00:56.430> catching<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.989> flexing<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> hips

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
dropping catching and flexing the hips

dropping catching and flexing the hips
through<00:00:59.000> on<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.180> exercise<00:01:00.660> we'll<00:01:00.899> use<00:01:01.079> about

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
through on this exercise we'll use about

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.179 
through on this exercise we'll use about
30<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.219> 40%<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.149> what<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.229> deadlift<00:01:04.619> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
30 to 40% of what you can deadlift the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.879 
30 to 40% of what you can deadlift the
repetitions<00:01:05.820> should<00:01:06.060> be<00:01:06.180> high<00:01:06.499> 15<00:01:07.499> to<00:01:07.649> 20

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:07.889

repetitions per set generally 2 to 3
sets<00:01:11.279> this<00:01:12.060> exercise<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.810> have<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.350> profound

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
sets this exercise can have a profound

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.469 
sets this exercise can have a profound
effect<00:01:14.459> on<00:01:15.350> posterior<00:01:16.350> chain<00:01:16.619> strength

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
effect on posterior chain strength

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.249 
effect on posterior chain strength
especially<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.599> strength<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.959> the<00:01:19.020> glutes

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
especially the strength of the glutes

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.160 
especially the strength of the glutes
and<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.529> lockout<00:01:19.889> of<00:01:20.099> dadlabs

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
and the lockout of dadlabs

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:45.950 
and the lockout of dadlabs
ok

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
bit too straight leg which is fine a

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.780 
bit too straight leg which is fine a
week<00:02:25.269> maybe<00:02:25.480> a<00:02:25.630> little<00:02:25.840> bit<00:02:26.019> too<00:02:26.200> much<00:02:26.670> for<00:02:27.670> him

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
week maybe a little bit too much for him

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.780 
week maybe a little bit too much for him
to<00:02:27.940> do<00:02:28.060> this<00:02:28.239> so<00:02:28.450> it's<00:02:28.569> got<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.780> be<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.900> stretch

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
to do this so it's got to be a stretch

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.630 
to do this so it's got to be a stretch
stretch<00:02:30.790> hamstrings<00:02:31.480> flex<00:02:32.170> glutes<00:02:32.640> stretch

hamstrings<00:02:34.239> flex<00:02:35.080> glutes<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.709> that's<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:36.580> demo

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
hamstrings flex glutes and that's a demo

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.239 
hamstrings flex glutes and that's a demo
