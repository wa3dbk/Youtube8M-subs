00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.570
 p 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.660
 study is called 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.660
 in this position the same arturo frediani 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.520
 the building the remains of homes dragged towards the media very 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.880
 tiny 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.810
 now located at nothing 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.810
 of them has given its set of social housing 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.330
 the first one that promotes Spanish also 3d of vilassar de dalt and what 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.090
 does his way in this project 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.840
 apparently he was transferred to the usual spokespeople in the way that 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.949
 it is built 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.490
 nor the type of after organization 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.980
 in space the relationship with him 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.190
 the defense gied 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.320
 in the materiality that it has 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.210
 the definition of spaces for the sake of social housing in August all 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.120
 are issues that we are trying in time to take forward 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.650
 with its own laws as space 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.400
 Really 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.400
 large differentiated very bright 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.640
 maybe a little bit that's what we wanted, they'll get it 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.080
 in social housing rooms up to 42 square meters of the budget and cie 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.870
 I think he travels Spain 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.100
 three small rooms for hundreds of them connected to one with the figure 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.030
 smaller for the farc to give a little agility to possible uses 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.970
 no other two spaces to access their homes 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.770
 by offering 100 heated to the hotel and to be built with its four 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.510
 walls 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.530
 moscoso bouquets part we do not accede with a rise catwalks that in addition a gift 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.580
 for appliances suárez many projects are concerned with the fer kicks to embol and 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.180
 casino and what happens inside the package because network does not matter to anyone not 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.109
 matter the architect does not care about the architecture criticism evidently p 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:55.330
 he does not care about the client not a little or nothing 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.870
 an aberration 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.390
 One thing, I think it's not 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.960
 dishonest no no in our profession 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.060
 eight and a half months when normally with 14 15 months the cost and is a 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.060
 similar building in tintín with traditional technique that money that you save in 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.750
 weather 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.609
 that money that you put after the materials 

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:19.239
 which are the highest quality I think that in that sense also a reference 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.760
 We are wished responsible for not being aware that 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.830
 I know that what we do alone does not only mark the environment of 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.430
 moment from the production of the object if not many years later not 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:37.519
 I think that they have understood the building per cent at the level of 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.930
 opportunities but at the level of style that tertiary principle does not 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.559
 for being disobedient sd 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:47.339
 it is very difficult to evaluate if not yes no if you do not arrive 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:50.039
 the building you put on the no when approving its own inhabitants
