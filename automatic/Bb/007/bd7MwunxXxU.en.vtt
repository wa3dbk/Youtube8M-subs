00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:55.250
 little more loss between about 34 days 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:58.329

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.560
 everyone likes these 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.410
 little bubbles so I'm going to remove them for 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.000
 ja to save them and later 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.070

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.870
 stars or by chats or as you 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.760

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.450
 box comes with our respective 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.700
 adapter that is for Latin America go 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.370
 and tablet case with a finish 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.640
 of wood a good cardboard type but 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.160
 Hard cardboard feels like a churro 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.600
 intel hits this tablet is very cool 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.450
 because it brings two operating systems what 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.160
 we can boot both with windows or with 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.900
 this what i am doing android 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.760
 then it can be a mini computer 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.080
 since I grabbed windows 8 then it's 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.630
 pretty cool it feels pretty 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.140
 it weighs the truth then that a 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.060
 url code with a qr argos code and if 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.310
 wants I think it's called not good here 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.850
 many things but in Chinese as well as the 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.500
 brand is your wii that the truth then good 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.560
 until now it feels good the heaviness 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.540
 so let's open it up and that's 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.670
 in a price more or less than 90 and 2.89 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.350
 dollars you will have the link in the 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.520

 acquire in this case let's see 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.230
 the unpacking and first impressions 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.470
 in this tablet we have here that is 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.440
 a little pamphlet that's good 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.940
 who knows who says who I am who says 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.160
 that thing but good here we have the 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.410
 tablet that looks very very pretty we are going to 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.480
 leave it here to see what it is 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.120
 that brings more the box in this case then 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.310
 we have a cardboard nothing more this 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.560
 cardboard I think it does not bring anything not 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.950
 effectively does not bring anything in the part 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.030
 from here we are with 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.550
 instructive good papers that 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.500
 many little things also come in Chinese 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.180
 I suppose that here will come the 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.460
 instructive the guarantee and all this type 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.370
 of little things not in this case this is all 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.360
 in everything in china this I guess it's the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.280
 instructive and everything brings us the 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.740
 dimensions here that you go further what 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.990
 let's see that in the review and here 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.350
 I suppose the cable would come, not the cable 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.470
 to load the evening obviously 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.080
 good 15 7 is a good juice is the cube 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.660
 which is equal to Latin America I do not know why 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.550
 what they sent us then good is 32 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.490
 deposits and is in another of the deposits not 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.280
 I know what change that here brings for usb 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.490
 I do not know if this one is put here or 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.290
 well this would be like that and I guess not like that 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.840
 as you do not not let us risk that 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.220
 explode for a short as we go to 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.470
 have it here with our adapter for 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.570
 load the tablet obviously if you are 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.540
 of Europe, they will not send you 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.480
 respective here the charger with with the 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.730
 stick do not think it is and here we find 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.410
 to good we have an ong cable for the 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.660
 tablet that is appreciated because 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.510
 we will be able to connect both a mouse a 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.640
 keyboard stuffs like that and the usb cable that 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.569
 It feels pretty hard and apparently 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.430
 pretty big we are going to 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.930
 to unravel it because we do not know what 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.310
 So big is good, it's not going to get married 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.620
 see well in the camera but it is 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.450
 quite large is what an arm I 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.219
 enough more good here we have the arm 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.290
 it's more almost all my arm is like this 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:17.199
 the truth is that it is appreciated that 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.789
 He extended the cable we do not have anything else 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.470
 it feels good the box of that color looks 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:22.479
 pretty from some presentation and we have 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.630
 here the tablet that comes wrapped in a 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.880
 little paper and good here I put is we have 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.090
 some specifications like windows 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.430
 8 has intel processor is a screen 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.320
 ips how good we have its dimensions 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.199
 that if I'm not wrong then it's more than hd 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.689
 It is not so thick and it feels very very 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.419
 well to the finish back is like 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:45.429
 like plastic but soft plastic 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.459
 you know it feels nice we have and that a 

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:50.589
 camera and well let's turn on the tablet 

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:52.329
 it does not weigh as much in itself as it weighed more 

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:54.549
 I guess the whole box is left I do not know but 

00:04:52.329 --> 00:04:56.860
 even as the box weighs almost the same as 

00:04:54.549 --> 00:04:58.569
 the tablet until a little bit more we are going to 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.589
 see if we can turn it on to see if it's 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:01.589
 of cargo that hopefully yes 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:05.739
 well here it's already turned on as well as we're going to 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.549

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:08.549
 Take off this little thing 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.440

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:20.350

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.860
 Chinese not like that when guys this would be 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.620
 as I say the unboxing pro more 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.950
 creamy prints good the one that also 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.740

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.670

 start it with windows and all development 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.480
 in this case automatically turned on 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.140
 in android comes in Chinese all the 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:55.600
 Apps seems to bring Android 4.4

 change the operating system and all that 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.560
