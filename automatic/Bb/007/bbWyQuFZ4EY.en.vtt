00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:47.370 
apply highlight to the key points on my
face<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.350> blend<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.530> up<00:02:40.590> using<00:02:40.830> my<00:02:41.040> fingers

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.930 

since<00:02:48.380> this<00:02:48.500> problem<00:02:48.830> I<00:02:49.040> wanted<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.430> use<00:02:49.580> a<00:02:49.610> lip

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
since this problem I wanted to use a lip

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.780 
since this problem I wanted to use a lip
stain<00:02:50.090> so<00:02:50.660> my<00:02:51.350> lip<00:02:51.890> color<00:02:52.070> would<00:02:52.340> last<00:02:52.490> longer

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
stain so my lip color would last longer

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.430 
stain so my lip color would last longer
so<00:02:53.150> I'm<00:02:53.240> using<00:02:53.390> a<00:02:53.600> red<00:02:53.810> lip<00:02:53.990> stain<00:02:54.290> because

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
so I'm using a red lip stain because

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.210 
so I'm using a red lip stain because
that<00:02:54.650> goes<00:02:54.890> really<00:02:55.100> well<00:02:55.190> with<00:02:55.370> my<00:02:55.820> dress<00:02:56.660> and

that goes really well with my dress and

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.400 
that goes really well with my dress and
then<00:02:58.220> I<00:02:58.250> applied<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:59.090> gloss<00:02:59.600> over<00:02:59.840> it<00:03:00.020> so<00:03:00.290> my

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
then I applied a gloss over it so my

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.030 
then I applied a gloss over it so my
lips<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.740> be<00:03:00.890> a<00:03:00.920> little<00:03:01.220> bit<00:03:01.340> glossy<00:03:02.920> so<00:03:03.920> that's

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
lips to be a little bit glossy so that's

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.070
