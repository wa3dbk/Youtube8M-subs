00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.339
 notice that they already see that the 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.339
 white dress 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:27.880
 that gave off little things he means something 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.020
 be re-wearing your white dress and 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.020
 then did not throw it away 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:47.230
 I think she does not know how to translate 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.230
 Energy 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.640
 the negative energy that has been impregnated 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.150
 and today it is being said that he stops 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.150
 negative energy 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:14.610
 I'm not giving my opinion for example 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.610
 when I 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:29.439
 and all that kind of stuff and throw everything 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:36.109
 that he does not care about the other gossip and 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:39.890
 cried that he can not teach to look 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:42.399
 the things that he sent them did not even 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.399
 he gave thanks 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:55.390
 forgiveness is to that person ever to 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.390
 levels costs me nothing 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.060
 in Spanish 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.060
 the dress is the dress 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:22.020
 like this is not flower flower I'm not going to 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.490
 investigate thoroughly because it will return to 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.300
 participate you have to ask 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.300
 forming them 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.400
 arranged that you're going to have already talked 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.400
 with me later and we make mistakes 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.720
 so this size almost makes you be 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.709
 farewell 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.709
 to resign 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.410
 because they were desperate with the use of 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.410
 weather 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.870
 he takes it off 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.700
 that's why he does not win 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:36.810
 and said enough 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.810
 endured the time 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.400
 he says that the time was dictated 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.400
 realistic
