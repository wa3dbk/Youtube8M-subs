let's<00:02:38.510> take<00:02:38.630> a<00:02:38.690> look<00:02:38.810> around<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.140> machine<00:02:39.380> and

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
let's take a look around the machine and

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.030 
let's take a look around the machine and
show<00:02:39.740> you<00:02:39.800> a<00:02:39.920> few<00:02:40.220> more<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.640> its<00:02:40.850> features

really solid rugged feel to the system

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.760 
really solid rugged feel to the system
actually<00:03:04.910> resists<00:03:05.840> fingerprints<00:03:06.260> fairly

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
actually resists fingerprints fairly

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.620 
actually resists fingerprints fairly
well<00:03:06.980> you<00:03:07.610> might<00:03:07.760> muck<00:03:08.000> it<00:03:08.120> up<00:03:08.210> a<00:03:08.330> little<00:03:08.420> bit

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
well you might muck it up a little bit

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.630 
well you might muck it up a little bit
and<00:03:08.930> then<00:03:09.140> it<00:03:09.260> does<00:03:09.440> clean<00:03:09.800> up<00:03:09.950> fairly<00:03:10.220> easily

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
and then it does clean up fairly easily

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.180 
and then it does clean up fairly easily
as<00:03:11.030> well<00:03:11.300> again<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:12.080> rubberized<00:03:12.620> finish<00:03:12.830> so

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
as well again that rubberized finish so

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.830 
as well again that rubberized finish so
we<00:03:13.550> really<00:03:13.790> like<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:13.970> it's<00:03:14.330> really<00:03:14.540> sharp

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
we really like that it's really sharp

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.770 
we really like that it's really sharp
and<00:03:15.200> sort<00:03:15.710> of<00:03:15.800> minimalistic<00:03:16.490> and<00:03:16.780> the

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
and sort of minimalistic and the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.200 
and sort of minimalistic and the
keyboard<00:03:18.110> area<00:03:18.350> is<00:03:18.470> really<00:03:18.800> large<00:03:19.040> nice<00:03:19.430> sort

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.210 
keyboard area is really large nice sort

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.900 
keyboard area is really large nice sort
of<00:03:20.240> textured<00:03:21.260> or<00:03:21.860> I<00:03:21.890> should<00:03:22.100> say<00:03:22.220> beveled<00:03:22.670> key

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
of textured or I should say beveled key

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.480

caps<00:03:23.240> that<00:03:23.570> sort<00:03:24.140> of<00:03:24.280> contour<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.460> your

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:25.490 
caps that sort of contour to your

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.670 
caps that sort of contour to your
fingers<00:03:25.910> you<00:03:26.000> get<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.150> full<00:03:26.450> numpad<00:03:26.960> over<00:03:27.230> here

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
fingers you get a full numpad over here

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.330 
fingers you get a full numpad over here
and<00:03:27.860> of<00:03:28.730> course<00:03:29.030> this<00:03:29.300> is<00:03:29.480> a<00:03:29.510> backlit<00:03:30.230> keyboard

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
and of course this is a backlit keyboard

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.690 
and of course this is a backlit keyboard
so<00:03:31.340> with<00:03:31.910> alien<00:03:32.660> effects<00:03:33.050> you<00:03:33.650> can<00:03:33.890> change<00:03:34.370> the

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
so with alien effects you can change the

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.540 
so with alien effects you can change the
color<00:03:35.510> map<00:03:35.780> of<00:03:36.050> the<00:03:36.410> keyboard<00:03:36.830> in<00:03:37.010> various

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
but we can go ahead and change all these

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.310 
but we can go ahead and change all these
zones<00:03:46.640> over<00:03:47.360> to<00:03:48.230> red<00:03:48.770> and<00:03:49.360> from<00:03:50.360> our<00:03:50.510> cool<00:03:50.780> blue

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.590 
as a result of that and of course on top
here<00:06:16.040> you've<00:06:16.190> got<00:06:16.370> the<00:06:16.520> signature<00:06:17.000> Alienware

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
of the panel set here so the game

physics technology turned on as well so

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.790 
physics technology turned on as well so
you<00:06:57.000> can<00:06:57.150> see<00:06:57.270> in<00:06:57.360> this<00:06:57.450> next<00:06:57.930> scene<00:06:58.110> coming<00:06:58.470> up
