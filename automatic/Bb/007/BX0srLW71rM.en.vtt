up to 30 feet which is going to be the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:30.500 
up to 30 feet which is going to be the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
max of my 27 foot climbing rope so I

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.479 
max of my 27 foot climbing rope so I
threw<00:00:30.929> my<00:00:31.080> throw<00:00:31.349> line<00:00:31.590> over<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.040> 30<00:00:32.279> foot

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
threw my throw line over the 30 foot

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.190 
threw my throw line over the 30 foot
high<00:00:32.520> branch<00:00:32.940> but<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.420> means<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.899> was

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
high branch but that means I was

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.770 
high branch but that means I was
actually<00:00:34.590> above<00:00:35.010> two<00:00:35.309> branches<00:00:35.820> an<00:00:36.030> easy

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
actually above two branches an easy

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.200 
actually above two branches an easy
solution<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.680> isolate<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:39.000> higher

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
solution to isolate the the higher

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.369 
solution to isolate the the higher
branch<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:40.370> take<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.520> second<00:00:42.059> weight<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.510> tie

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
branch is take a second weight and tie

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.350 
branch is take a second weight and tie
it<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.710> end<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:44.100> your<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.550> other<00:00:44.760> side<00:00:45.180> of

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
it to the end of your the other side of

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.380 
it to the end of your the other side of
your<00:00:45.450> throw<00:00:45.690> line<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.200> pull<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.160> up<00:00:47.340> until<00:00:47.610> it

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
your throw line and pull it up until it

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.569 
your throw line and pull it up until it
swings<00:00:48.780> over<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> lower<00:00:49.469> branch<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.129> then

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
swings over the lower branch and then

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.500 
swings over the lower branch and then
let<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.910> lower<00:00:51.149> back<00:00:51.449> down<00:00:52.430> next<00:00:53.430> simply<00:00:54.030> pull

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
let it lower back down next simply pull

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.150 
let it lower back down next simply pull
your<00:00:54.690> throw<00:00:54.930> line<00:00:55.170> up<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.620> over<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> branch

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
your throw line up and over the branch

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.860 
your throw line up and over the branch
that<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.399> isolated<00:00:59.329> so<00:01:00.329> once<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.719> get<00:01:00.809> your

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
that you isolated so once you get your

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.990 
that you isolated so once you get your
climbing<00:01:01.410> line<00:01:01.620> pulled<00:01:02.280> over<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.609> branch<00:01:02.820> you

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
climbing line pulled over the branch you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.960 
climbing line pulled over the branch you
want<00:01:03.210> tie<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> figure<00:01:04.500> eight<00:01:04.799> on<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> bite<00:01:05.159> at<00:01:05.549> the
