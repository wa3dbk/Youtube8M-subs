00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.450 
going to its standard tuning and then
you're<00:00:34.050> going<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.260> want<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.739> distortion<00:00:35.340> on

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460

the<00:00:38.430> third<00:00:38.670> just<00:00:38.969> for<00:00:39.149> me<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:39.660> more<00:00:40.230> simple

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
the third just for me it's more simple

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.810 
the third just for me it's more simple
because<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.040> how<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.160> land<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
because it's how to land it on the

acoustic so you start off with a solo
part<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.210> that's<00:00:45.300> what<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.780> sounds<00:00:46.020> like

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.190 

so<00:03:23.820> right<00:03:24.030> there<00:03:24.270> at<00:03:24.420> that<00:03:24.480> moment<00:03:24.870> you're

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200

you<00:03:30.240> want<00:03:30.390> to<00:03:30.450> do<00:03:31.160> then<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:32.190> go<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:32.520> first

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
you want to do then you go to that first

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.190 
you want to do then you go to that first
fret<00:03:35.300> then<00:03:36.300> you<00:03:36.420> go<00:03:36.540> to<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.720> course<00:03:36.900> which<00:03:37.110> is

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
fret then you go to the course which is

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.040 
fret then you go to the course which is
the<00:03:37.290> exact<00:03:37.500> same<00:03:37.530> thing<00:03:37.920> five<00:03:38.720> one<00:03:39.720> eight

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
the exact same thing five one eight

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.460 
the exact same thing five one eight
three<00:03:41.540> that's<00:03:42.540> pretty<00:03:42.750> much<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.960> entire<00:03:43.230> song

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
three that's pretty much the entire song

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.960 
three that's pretty much the entire song
so<00:03:43.620> this<00:03:43.710> is<00:03:43.800> just<00:03:43.980> a<00:03:44.040> cover<00:03:44.250> it's<00:03:44.490> not<00:03:44.730> really

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
so this is just a cover it's not really

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.000 
so this is just a cover it's not really
like<00:03:45.120> I<00:03:45.360> just<00:03:45.810> know<00:03:46.050> what<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.350> on<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:46.800> it

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
like I just know what the on so it

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.960 
like I just know what the on so it
starts<00:03:47.280> in<00:03:47.370> this<00:03:47.460> fret

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
starts in this fret

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.410 
starts in this fret
whoops<00:03:48.360> this<00:03:48.959> fret<00:03:49.260> and<00:03:49.470> ends<00:03:49.680> on<00:03:49.740> this<00:03:49.890> right

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
whoops this fret and ends on this right

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.630 
whoops this fret and ends on this right
so<00:03:51.420> that's<00:03:51.720> how<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.020> solo<00:03:52.500> goes<00:03:52.770> but<00:03:53.100> no<00:03:53.340> idea

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
so that's how the solo goes but no idea

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.870 
so that's how the solo goes but no idea
I<00:03:53.850> I<00:03:54.780> haven't<00:03:55.140> really<00:03:55.380> spent<00:03:55.770> the<00:03:56.010> time<00:03:56.250> or<00:03:56.580> had

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
I I haven't really spent the time or had

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.180 
I I haven't really spent the time or had
the<00:03:57.030> desire<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.810> do<00:03:58.110> to<00:03:58.380> learn<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:58.830> right<00:03:59.040> now
