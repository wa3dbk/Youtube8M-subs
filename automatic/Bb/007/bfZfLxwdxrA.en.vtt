00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
front end on a hinge sure you slide it

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.109 
front end on a hinge sure you slide it
out<00:01:23.990> yet<00:01:24.990> like<00:01:25.140> these<00:01:25.290> three<00:01:25.530> bladed<00:01:25.799> hooks

comparison<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:46.350> like<00:01:46.619> prime<00:01:46.829> 92<00:01:47.130> showed<00:01:47.460> just

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
comparison but like prime 92 showed just

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.670 
comparison but like prime 92 showed just
kind<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.140> get<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.350> out<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.590> way

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
kind of do that to get it out of the way

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.730 
kind of do that to get it out of the way
and<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.920> looks<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.220> lot<00:01:50.340> better<00:01:50.720> and<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.560> slides

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and it looks a lot better and it slides

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.139 
and it looks a lot better and it slides
in<00:01:52.920> all<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.100> way<00:01:53.220> flip<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.700> down<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:53.909> got

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
in all the way flip that down you got

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.359 
in all the way flip that down you got
like<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.329> guard<00:01:54.540> thing<00:01:54.920> what<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:55.950> forgot<00:01:56.219> to

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
like a guard thing what I forgot to

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.550 
like a guard thing what I forgot to
mention<00:01:56.399> part<00:01:57.060> 1<00:01:57.210> was<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:58.020> came<00:01:58.200> with<00:01:58.350> enough

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
mention part 1 was it came with enough

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.249 
mention part 1 was it came with enough
parts<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.070> could<00:01:59.250> make<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.840> second<00:02:00.840> frame

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
parts that you could make a second frame

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.450 
parts that you could make a second frame
arm<00:02:01.680> for<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> right<00:02:02.399> side<00:02:03.890> it's<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:05.070> good

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
arm for the right side it's a good

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.980 
arm for the right side it's a good
addition<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:06.030> mean<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.270> liked<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.659> didn't<00:02:06.899> do

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
addition I mean I liked it I didn't do

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.960 
addition I mean I liked it I didn't do
it<00:02:07.140> just<00:02:07.259> because<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.680> asymmetrical

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
it just because I like the asymmetrical

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.850 
it just because I like the asymmetrical
look<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.300> mean<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.200> don't<00:02:10.379> see<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.619> along

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
look I mean I don't see that along

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.590 
look I mean I don't see that along
Gundam<00:02:11.190> other

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
Gundam other

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.450 
Gundam other

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
rifle and the other so I kind of like

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.750 
rifle and the other so I kind of like
keeping<00:02:15.680> it<00:02:15.800> different<00:02:16.370> makes<00:02:16.550> it<00:02:16.700> little

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
keeping it different makes it little

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.610 
keeping it different makes it little
quirky<00:02:18.700> next<00:02:19.700> accessory<00:02:20.120> is<00:02:21.040> this<00:02:23.440> which<00:02:24.440> is

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
quirky next accessory is this which is

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.550 
quirky next accessory is this which is
his<00:02:24.830> shield<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.460> beam<00:02:25.910> rifle<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:27.380> Blitz

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
his shield and beam rifle the Blitz

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.970 
his shield and beam rifle the Blitz
Gundam<00:02:27.920> had<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.490> beam<00:02:29.390> saver<00:02:29.770> right<00:02:30.770> beneath

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
Gundam had a beam saver right beneath

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.800 
Gundam had a beam saver right beneath
the<00:02:31.160> barrel<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.700> rifle<00:02:31.730> but<00:02:32.210> being<00:02:32.660> the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
the barrel of the rifle but being the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.750 
the barrel of the rifle but being the
placement<00:02:33.230> hit<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.950> barrel<00:02:34.130> you<00:02:34.550> can't

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
placement hit the barrel you can't

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.640 
placement hit the barrel you can't
really<00:02:35.000> have<00:02:35.210> one<00:02:35.540> because<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.380> barrel<00:02:36.590> is

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
really have one because the barrel is

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.020 
really have one because the barrel is
like<00:02:36.740> on<00:02:36.830> top<00:02:37.040> of<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.250> shield<00:02:37.460> now<00:02:37.670> instead<00:02:37.970> of

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
like on top of the shield now instead of

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.570 
like on top of the shield now instead of
built<00:02:38.480> right<00:02:38.720> inside<00:02:39.070> but<00:02:40.070> I<00:02:40.100> think<00:02:40.310> I<00:02:40.370> like

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
built right inside but I think I like

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.150 
built right inside but I think I like
this<00:02:40.790> design<00:02:41.180> a<00:02:41.240> little<00:02:41.720> or<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.560> lot<00:02:42.680> better<00:02:43.070> i

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
this design a little or a lot better i

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.180 
this design a little or a lot better i
should<00:02:43.370> say<00:02:43.490> because<00:02:44.000> it<00:02:44.210> has<00:02:44.920> like<00:02:45.920> this

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
should say because it has like this

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.400 
should say because it has like this
detailing<00:02:46.880> which<00:02:47.690> makes<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:47.990> look<00:02:48.170> just<00:02:48.200> like

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
detailing which makes it look just like

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.050 
detailing which makes it look just like
a<00:02:48.470> really<00:02:48.770> sharp<00:02:48.950> blade<00:02:49.280> like<00:02:49.610> you<00:02:49.730> can<00:02:49.850> cut

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
a really sharp blade like you can cut

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.160 
a really sharp blade like you can cut
through<00:02:50.210> anything<00:02:50.300> it<00:02:50.690> doesn't<00:02:50.840> need<00:02:51.050> the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
through anything it doesn't need the

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.410 
through anything it doesn't need the
beam<00:02:51.320> saber<00:02:51.620> anymore<00:02:51.980> so<00:02:52.880> I<00:02:52.910> mean<00:02:53.150> it<00:02:53.270> adds

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
beam saber anymore so I mean it adds

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.720 
beam saber anymore so I mean it adds
utility<00:02:54.080> I<00:02:54.140> think<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.470> mobile<00:02:54.650> suit<00:02:54.920> this

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
utility I think to the mobile suit this

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.400 
utility I think to the mobile suit this
red<00:02:56.000> here<00:02:56.510> and<00:02:56.690> here<00:02:56.990> is<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:57.140> sticker<00:02:59.410> really

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
red here and here is a sticker really

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.310 
red here and here is a sticker really
good<00:03:00.590> moment<00:03:00.980> mold<00:03:01.430> how<00:03:02.390> I<00:03:02.420> like<00:03:02.960> the<00:03:03.110> shield

slot<00:03:32.720> so<00:03:32.990> you<00:03:33.020> can<00:03:33.230> still<00:03:33.470> line<00:03:33.680> it<00:03:33.800> up<00:03:33.860> in<00:03:34.070> here

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
slot so you can still line it up in here

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.870 
slot so you can still line it up in here
just<00:03:34.400> as<00:03:34.880> easy<00:03:35.060> as<00:03:35.750> before<00:03:36.200> and<00:03:36.640> I<00:03:37.640> think

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
just as easy as before and I think

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.760 
just as easy as before and I think
having<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.210> three<00:03:38.510> same<00:03:39.050> lengths<00:03:39.350> makes<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.710> a

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
having the three same lengths makes it a

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.350 
having the three same lengths makes it a
little<00:03:39.980> more<00:03:40.070> deadly<00:03:40.580> I<00:03:40.930> mean<00:03:41.930> I<00:03:43.090> don't<00:03:44.090> know

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
little more deadly I mean I don't know

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.940 
little more deadly I mean I don't know
this<00:03:44.840> I<00:03:45.020> don't<00:03:45.380> know<00:03:45.410> I<00:03:45.470> just<00:03:45.560> like<00:03:45.830> this

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
this I don't know I just like this

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.270

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:39.470 
expecting that when I first got this guy

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.710 
expecting that when I first got this guy
I<00:06:39.710> mean<00:06:40.100> I<00:06:40.130> just<00:06:40.310> thought<00:06:40.430> massive<00:06:41.090> backpack

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 
I mean I just thought massive backpack

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.450 
I mean I just thought massive backpack
what<00:06:42.050> does<00:06:42.200> it<00:06:42.229> do

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:43.460 
what does it do

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.890 
what does it do
how<00:06:44.060> does<00:06:44.240> it<00:06:44.360> work<00:06:45.789> and<00:06:46.789> that's<00:06:47.569> really<00:06:47.600> all<00:06:47.810> I

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
how does it work and that's really all I

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.909 
how does it work and that's really all I
can<00:06:48.050> say<00:06:48.199> doesn't<00:06:48.560> have<00:06:48.650> a<00:06:48.710> lot<00:06:48.889> of

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 
can say doesn't have a lot of

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:50.409 
can say doesn't have a lot of
accessories<00:06:49.280> but<00:06:49.610> I<00:06:49.759> feel<00:06:49.940> it<00:06:50.060> doesn't<00:06:50.330> need

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 
accessories but I feel it doesn't need

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:52.180 
accessories but I feel it doesn't need
them<00:06:50.600> because<00:06:50.900> all<00:06:51.169> the<00:06:51.289> ones<00:06:51.440> it<00:06:51.560> has<00:06:51.770> are

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190 
them because all the ones it has are

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.300 
them because all the ones it has are
designed<00:06:53.180> so<00:06:53.479> well<00:06:53.750> for<00:06:53.990> it<00:06:54.169> that<00:06:54.410> it<00:06:55.069> doesn't

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.310 
designed so well for it that it doesn't

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.040 
designed so well for it that it doesn't
need<00:06:55.370> a<00:06:55.430> ton<00:06:56.060> of<00:06:56.090> accessories<00:06:56.690> I<00:06:56.720> mean<00:06:56.900> there's

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
need a ton of accessories I mean there's

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.409 
need a ton of accessories I mean there's
some<00:06:57.199> gonna<00:06:57.380> fer<00:06:57.590> it<00:06:58.580> just<00:06:58.759> has<00:06:58.940> so<00:06:59.210> much<00:06:59.360> going

00:06:59.409 --> 00:06:59.419 
some gonna fer it just has so much going

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.469 
some gonna fer it just has so much going
on<00:06:59.720> that<00:06:59.780> you<00:07:00.020> can't<00:07:00.229> tell<00:07:00.500> what<00:07:01.340> looks<00:07:02.210> best

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 
on that you can't tell what looks best

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:04.870 
on that you can't tell what looks best
with<00:07:02.630> it<00:07:02.750> but<00:07:02.870> I<00:07:02.930> think<00:07:02.960> just<00:07:03.550> when<00:07:04.550> it<00:07:04.669> comes

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 
with it but I think just when it comes

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.800 
with it but I think just when it comes
with<00:07:05.060> this<00:07:05.210> all<00:07:05.449> it<00:07:05.599> really<00:07:05.720> needs<00:07:07.690> the<00:07:08.690> back

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:08.810 
with this all it really needs the back

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:09.939 
with this all it really needs the back
that<00:07:09.020> can<00:07:09.229> be<00:07:09.349> a<00:07:09.380> little<00:07:09.500> back<00:07:09.710> every

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:09.949 
that can be a little back every

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:12.370 
that can be a little back every
symposium<00:07:10.520> could<00:07:10.699> be<00:07:10.819> an<00:07:10.910> issue<00:07:11.380> displaying

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
symposium could be an issue displaying

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.050 
symposium could be an issue displaying
him<00:07:12.530> with<00:07:12.680> the<00:07:12.919> wings<00:07:13.310> up<00:07:13.520> he<00:07:13.669> might<00:07:13.819> need<00:07:14.000> a

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.060 
him with the wings up he might need a

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.640 
him with the wings up he might need a
stand<00:07:14.389> I've<00:07:14.660> never<00:07:14.840> been<00:07:15.050> able<00:07:15.169> to<00:07:15.349> get<00:07:15.470> him<00:07:15.560> to
