00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.040
 the ocu on the cost of their by then goiás in brazil 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.800
 ra 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.800
 so injury session 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.390
 the game based on Robert Zemeckis' new action movie based on his time 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.140
 in the homonymous literary work taken to the cinema also several times we 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.380
 presents a warrior whose achievements and overcoming extreme confrontations 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.270
 they are the order of the day 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.640
 He is a hero willing to free his people from the beast that was in 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.310
 his mother and other creatures 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.640
 and is that this third-person action game does not take off is the sixth time 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.060
 which is even slower than the player vote 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.410
 offers us some of the stations seen in the film as well as other 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.460
 extracted from this outstanding literary work 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.630
 of golf will propose to rid their lands of different rivers 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.630
 whether they are mythological monsters warriors 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.290
 in your adventure 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.430
 he will not be alone 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.949
 because thanks to his most successful exploits in Uranus our cause 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.500
 we trust blindly 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.570
 d this way the theater is a good omen 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.600
 to these warriors bioculture wanted stoppages and we can also give them four 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.850
 basic orders that go from centuries included 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.580
 to move objects for example 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.390
 in the latter case, males will move objects quite calmly 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.090
 resulting in a wait perhaps too eternal for a player 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.490
 along the way we can change our weapon for others that we find and 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.450
 we will learn new combos 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.960
 in final enemies it will be essential to use carnal power 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.399
 an idea missing makes temporarily much stronger 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.090
 at the cost of our lives 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.660
 This power will be fundamental to offer your life bar ending with 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.430
 they finally if we successfully complete the sequence of buttons to press 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.580
 the mini-games are also present in the form of hurd eneas chants 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.640
 we can press a button there was another style of the census revolution 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.459
 pressing the button the precise moment 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.299
 although at first it seems that the game promises a lot is one of those 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.049
 titles that failed to develop was the productivity failures that could 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.299
 have been corrected 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.280
 sudden changes of time of attacks conversations and dialogues little 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:22.359
 interactive 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:24.159
 minigames that god sometimes 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.409
 pretty awkward enemies certain slowness of movements of the characters efe 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.050
 the graphical section offers a remarkable mitación especially with certain 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:34.709
 spaces 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.869
 in general it is the most remarkable aspect of the game 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:41.999
 although the dubbing is good the voices sometimes overlap each other 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.999
 everything in the tutorial where this failure is more evident 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:49.699
 but bolt the video game is also based the homonymous literary work to expand 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:52.129
 and complete the same story 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.040
 Although it is interesting, it does not become as remarkable as the fourth preserve. 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.370
