clause which i haven't seen on NB palm

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.710 
clause which i haven't seen on NB palm
in<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:05.950> while<00:03:06.130> but<00:03:07.030> i<00:03:07.060> do<00:03:07.150> go<00:03:07.330> for<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.510> Fire

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
in a while but i do go for the Fire

in a while but i do go for the Fire
Blast<00:03:07.930> it<00:03:08.290> misses<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:09.040> this<00:03:09.280> is<00:03:09.430> crucial

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
Blast it misses and this is crucial

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.120 
Blast it misses and this is crucial
because<00:03:10.150> this<00:03:11.020> ambipom<00:03:11.350> sticks<00:03:11.800> around<00:03:11.890> for

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
because this ambipom sticks around for

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.190 
because this ambipom sticks around for
the<00:03:12.280> rest<00:03:12.400> of<00:03:12.550> the<00:03:12.640> battle<00:03:12.970> I<00:03:13.150> somehow<00:03:13.810> live<00:03:14.170> a

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
the rest of the battle I somehow live a

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.470 
the rest of the battle I somehow live a
pursuit<00:03:14.710> which<00:03:15.550> is<00:03:15.670> really<00:03:15.880> cool<00:03:16.060> because<00:03:16.270> I

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
pursuit which is really cool because I

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.970 
pursuit which is really cool because I
get<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.780> keep<00:03:16.930> my<00:03:16.990> Chandeleur<00:03:17.560> but<00:03:17.770> I<00:03:17.800> would

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
get to keep my Chandeleur but I would

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.160 
get to keep my Chandeleur but I would
have<00:03:18.100> rather<00:03:18.280> had<00:03:18.580> him<00:03:18.790> dead<00:03:19.060> but<00:03:19.870> I<00:03:19.930> did<00:03:20.080> go

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
have rather had him dead but I did go

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.020 
have rather had him dead but I did go
for<00:03:20.200> Fire<00:03:20.530> Blast<00:03:20.710> again<00:03:21.190> hoping<00:03:21.580> to<00:03:21.700> catch<00:03:21.850> the

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
for Fire Blast again hoping to catch the

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.030 
for Fire Blast again hoping to catch the
ambipom<00:03:22.360> he<00:03:23.020> switches<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:23.380> news<00:03:23.620> flag<00:03:23.860> on

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
ambipom he switches that news flag on

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.590 
ambipom he switches that news flag on
knowing<00:03:24.400> kill<00:03:24.580> resistant<00:03:25.150> which<00:03:25.270> is<00:03:25.420> really

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
knowing kill resistant which is really

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.000 
knowing kill resistant which is really
good<00:03:25.720> for<00:03:25.900> him<00:03:26.020> it<00:03:26.170> still<00:03:26.380> does<00:03:26.530> about<00:03:26.740> half

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
good for him it still does about half

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.250 
good for him it still does about half
which<00:03:27.280> is<00:03:27.400> really<00:03:27.610> nice<00:03:27.850> but<00:03:28.750> I<00:03:28.810> just<00:03:29.050> switch

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
which is really nice but I just switch

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.350 
which is really nice but I just switch
out<00:03:29.440> into<00:03:29.800> my<00:03:29.980> Swampert<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.880> take<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.180> hit

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
out into my Swampert to take the hit

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.910 
out into my Swampert to take the hit
this<00:03:31.510> is<00:03:31.630> a<00:03:31.720> more<00:03:31.870> defensive<00:03:32.380> Swampert<00:03:32.740> with

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
this is a more defensive Swampert with

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.260 
this is a more defensive Swampert with
stealth<00:03:33.190> rock<00:03:33.430> not<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.790> same<00:03:33.970> one<00:03:34.090> in<00:03:34.180> the

stealth rock not the same one in the
previous<00:03:34.600> battle<00:03:35.200> but<00:03:35.800> he<00:03:35.890> goes<00:03:36.070> for<00:03:36.250> you<00:03:36.370> turn

previous battle but he goes for you turn
either<00:03:36.900> which<00:03:37.900> would<00:03:38.080> kill<00:03:38.320> my<00:03:38.670> Chandelure<00:03:39.670> or

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
either which would kill my Chandelure or

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.540 
either which would kill my Chandelure or
get<00:03:41.350> give<00:03:41.560> him<00:03:41.680> switch<00:03:41.890> initiative<00:03:42.400> on<00:03:42.490> the

out<00:05:41.030> here<00:05:41.360> so<00:05:41.540> I<00:05:41.570> leave<00:05:41.870> it<00:05:41.900> in<00:05:42.110> and<00:05:42.320> then

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
out here so I leave it in and then

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.740 
out here so I leave it in and then
predict<00:05:43.130> predicting<00:05:43.700> him<00:05:43.910> to<00:05:44.150> think<00:05:44.510> I'm

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
predict predicting him to think I'm

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.570

going<00:05:45.020> to<00:05:45.140> go<00:05:45.290> for<00:05:45.590> the<00:05:45.620> sucker<00:05:45.890> punch<00:05:46.010> and<00:05:46.430> he

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
going to go for the sucker punch and he

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.310 
going to go for the sucker punch and he
would<00:05:46.730> go<00:05:46.850> for<00:05:47.060> home<00:05:47.210> clause<00:05:47.600> or<00:05:47.960> something

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
would go for home clause or something

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.230 
would go for home clause or something
like<00:05:48.440> that<00:05:48.500> I<00:05:48.830> actually<00:05:49.460> go<00:05:49.700> for<00:05:49.910> the<00:05:50.000> dark

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
like that I actually go for the dark

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.840 
like that I actually go for the dark
pulse<00:05:50.450> on<00:05:50.690> the<00:05:50.840> following<00:05:51.140> turn<00:05:51.640> he<00:05:52.640> switches

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:52.850 
pulse on the following turn he switches

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.030 
pulse on the following turn he switches
out<00:05:53.060> into<00:05:53.420> his<00:05:53.720> hitmontop<00:05:54.530> which<00:05:54.830> would<00:05:54.980> have

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
out into his hitmontop which would have

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.130 
out into his hitmontop which would have
put<00:05:55.160> me<00:05:55.280> at<00:05:55.340> neutral<00:05:55.670> attack<00:05:56.000> I<00:05:56.210> get<00:05:56.870> the<00:05:56.930> dark

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
put me at neutral attack I get the dark

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.840 
put me at neutral attack I get the dark
pulse<00:05:57.320> off<00:05:57.560> and<00:05:57.860> then<00:05:58.040> I<00:05:58.070> do<00:05:58.250> go<00:05:58.580> for<00:05:58.790> the

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
pulse off and then I do go for the

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.660 
pulse off and then I do go for the
hidden<00:05:59.450> power<00:05:59.660> flying<00:06:00.050> on<00:06:00.260> the<00:06:00.350> phone<00:06:00.530> turn<00:06:00.950> to

hidden power flying on the phone turn to

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.490 
hidden power flying on the phone turn to
kill<00:06:01.910> this<00:06:02.150> hitmontop<00:06:02.540> now<00:06:02.900> even<00:06:03.080> though<00:06:03.290> this

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:35.660 
maybe it'll live but unfortunately it

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.090

few

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
few

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.950 
few

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
left is my Schindler now if he wants to

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.820 
left is my Schindler now if he wants to
stay<00:06:50.240> in<00:06:50.449> and<00:06:50.840> prove<00:06:50.990> and<00:06:51.350> mess<00:06:51.650> with

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
stay in and prove and mess with

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.490 
stay in and prove and mess with
confusion<00:06:52.550> he<00:06:52.880> can<00:06:53.120> but<00:06:53.720> obviously<00:06:54.110> he<00:06:54.290> makes

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.500 
confusion he can but obviously he makes

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.070 
confusion he can but obviously he makes
a<00:06:54.620> smart<00:06:54.889> play<00:06:55.160> goes<00:06:55.639> into<00:06:56.060> his<00:06:56.180> ambipom<00:06:56.540> I<00:06:56.900> go

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
a smart play goes into his ambipom I go

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.750 
a smart play goes into his ambipom I go
for<00:06:57.260> energy<00:06:57.620> ball<00:06:57.830> because<00:06:58.160> I<00:06:58.190> did<00:06:58.550> not<00:06:58.580> want

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:58.760 
for energy ball because I did not want

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.000 
for energy ball because I did not want
something<00:06:59.419> to<00:06:59.540> miss<00:06:59.750> and<00:06:59.990> I<00:07:00.410> figured<00:07:00.680> energy

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.010 
something to miss and I figured energy

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.280 
something to miss and I figured energy
ball<00:07:01.190> would<00:07:01.370> have<00:07:01.460> killed<00:07:01.669> flag<00:07:01.970> on<00:07:02.180> anyway<00:07:02.660> so

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.290 
ball would have killed flag on anyway so

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.870 
ball would have killed flag on anyway so
I<00:07:03.320> do<00:07:03.440> go<00:07:03.620> to<00:07:03.650> that<00:07:03.800> but<00:07:04.160> unfortunately<00:07:04.729> his

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 
I do go to that but unfortunately his

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.760 
I do go to that but unfortunately his
scarf<00:07:05.240> logon<00:07:05.660> out<00:07:05.870> speeds<00:07:06.199> my<00:07:06.440> scarf

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:06.770 
scarf logon out speeds my scarf

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.250 
scarf logon out speeds my scarf
Chandelure<00:07:07.280> and<00:07:07.490> he<00:07:07.970> is<00:07:08.060> able<00:07:08.180> to<00:07:08.389> KO<00:07:08.660> me<00:07:08.930> for

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.260 
Chandelure and he is able to KO me for

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.560 
Chandelure and he is able to KO me for
the<00:07:09.380> 10<00:07:09.620> victory<00:07:10.190> though<00:07:10.490> it<00:07:10.639> was<00:07:10.789> a<00:07:10.820> extremely

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:11.570 
the 10 victory though it was a extremely

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.420 
the 10 victory though it was a extremely
close<00:07:11.780> battle<00:07:12.050> and<00:07:12.410> I<00:07:12.500> got<00:07:12.680> to<00:07:12.830> hand<00:07:13.100> it<00:07:13.190> to<00:07:13.250> him

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.430 
close battle and I got to hand it to him

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.460 
close battle and I got to hand it to him
because<00:07:13.729> that<00:07:13.760> was<00:07:14.090> possibly<00:07:15.050> one<00:07:15.139> of<00:07:15.350> the

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.470 
because that was possibly one of the

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.490 
because that was possibly one of the
craziest<00:07:16.039> battles<00:07:16.460> I've<00:07:16.580> ever<00:07:16.729> had<00:07:16.970> um<00:07:17.500> I'm
