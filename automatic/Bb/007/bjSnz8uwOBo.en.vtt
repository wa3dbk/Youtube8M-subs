that that we command again the present
to<00:03:15.280> continue<00:03:20.489> do<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.640> work<00:03:21.850> on<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.840> food

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
to continue do the work on the food

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:34.319 
to continue do the work on the food
resource<00:03:25.320> as<00:03:26.320> we<00:03:26.620> see<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:32.440> wood<00:03:32.940> resource<00:03:33.940> if

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
resource as we see the wood resource if

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.250 
resource as we see the wood resource if
the<00:03:35.670> conference<00:03:36.670> increasing<00:03:37.329> and<00:03:37.810> also<00:03:38.140> the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
the conference increasing and also the

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.770 

now<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:54.030> we<00:03:54.210> have<00:03:56.000> very<00:03:57.000> large<00:03:57.180> amounts<00:03:57.690> of

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.360 
order to build a market back to the code

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.160 
order to build a market back to the code
we<00:04:21.360> can<00:04:21.600> out<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:22.080> disabled<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.710> peasant<00:04:23.610> that

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
in order to put him in a normal flow of

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.410 
in order to put him in a normal flow of
work<00:04:34.950> so<00:04:35.460> we<00:04:35.810> assemble<00:04:36.810> here<00:04:37.050> the<00:04:37.200> code<00:04:38.420> in

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
work so we assemble here the code in

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.360 
work so we assemble here the code in
order<00:04:39.600> to<00:04:39.780> get<00:04:40.350> things<00:04:40.710> back<00:04:40.890> to<00:04:41.220> normal<00:04:43.370> and

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
order to get things back to normal and

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.100 
order to get things back to normal and
now<00:04:44.700> we're<00:04:45.630> gonna<00:04:45.780> see<00:04:46.140> in<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.770> game<00:04:47.010> that<00:04:48.110> the

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
now we're gonna see in the game that the

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.040 
now we're gonna see in the game that the
respective<00:04:51.290> peasant<00:04:52.290> is<00:04:52.500> now<00:04:52.710> out<00:04:53.460> of<00:04:54.060> the
