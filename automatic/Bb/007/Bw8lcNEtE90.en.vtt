Hi everyone and welcome to today's Beauty
Recommended video, I'm Becky from TalkBeckyTalk.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.500
Today I'm going to be answering one of Britain's
Biggest Beauty Questions- how to combat dry,

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.210
chapped lips, and to make sure that you have
the perfect looking plump pout. I was actually

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.420
really excited about taking this kind of challenge
on and answering this question because this

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.570
is something that I get affected by all the
time, particularly when we're in the winter

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.320
but last summer as well, I had incredibly
chapped lips and it was something that really

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.820
affected my confidence because I really felt
like people were just looking at the dry skin

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.070
on my lips and it was horrible. So I've put
together a few things that are hopefully going

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.010
to take you from really dry lips to plump-
looking lips. So, I'm going to start off,

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.010
the first thing is these were my lips this
morning. I woke up in the morning, this is

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.350
a typical morning for me, my lips are quite
dry, I've got quite a lot of dead skin on

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.320
my lips as well, so the first thing you need
to do is get rid of that dry skin. I'm using

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.490
this Lush Bubblegum Lip Scrub, this is a sugar
scrub, so it tastes amazing, it literally

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.189
tastes of bubblegum. And you're going to use
your finger just to massage this, it gets

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.260
a little bit messy, you can just wipe it off
with a wet cloth. That's just going to exfoliate

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.159
the lips which is going to get rid of all
that yucky, yucky dry skin, it doesn't hurt

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.390
as well when you do this. Ok, here is the
top tip to keep them nice and moisturised,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.479
I'm actually going to put a moisturiser on
my lips next, this is the Olay Total Effects

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.110
7-in1 Day Moisturiser. I have raved about
this before in a video, I absolutely fell

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.350
in love with Olay moisturisers when I started
using this, my skin feels so soft when I have

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.130
this on and it does the same thing, if you
out it on your lips. So I'm just going to

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.050
dab a tiny bit of this on my lips, give your
lips a nice little massage, a little treatment,

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.690
and this is really going to help put that
moisture back in our lips because with all

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.409
the product we put on, we forget to moisturise
our lips which is not really something that

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.880
I ever do and my lips feel so soft after doing
this. So once you've spent a little bit of

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.489
time really working that into your lips, you
go onto the rest of your face and moisturise

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.250
your face as usual, again using the Olay moisturiser.
I have noticed such a difference in my skin

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.459
when using this, so many people have been
commenting that my skin has looked a lot brighter

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.710
and honestly it's been down to using this
moisturiser by Olay and one of their other

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.070
ones as well, I am hooked, my skin feels so
incredibly soft after using it. Ok so next

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.280
up, you've got rid of that yucky dryness,
now you're going to make them look pretty,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.291
so the first thing that I'm going to use is
my Max Factor Colour Elixir Lip Liner, this

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:44.190
is actually in Pink Petal, number 2 and I
again have raved about this because I am a

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.270
really big fan of nude lips, I am not always
as daring with colours, so this is perfect

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.290
for me. Nude lip liners are great at giving
you a little bit of definition, plumping those

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.330
lips out and this one glides on so nicely,
I know this is going to last for most of the

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.379
day and I won't need to keep reapplying this
and irritating my lips as I got through the

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.700
day. So that's going to seal in the colour
and give you that nice plump definition. And

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.590
last but not least to finish it off with that
glossy kind of plump look, I'm going to use

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.760
my Max Factor Colour Elixir Lip Gloss, this
is in Radiant Rose, number 15. I actually

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.349
featured one of these lip glosses in my 2014
beauty favourites because I am in love with

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.769
these lip glosses, they glide on so well,
they look so plump when they go on, this one

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.340
actually has a little bit of glitter in, which
I love because when I have dry lips, I want

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.310
my kind of lip gloss to stand out rather than
any dry skin that I might have on my lips,

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.690
so add a little bit of glitter in and that's
going to take any kind of emphasis off the

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.280
dry skin, it's going to make your lips glisten,
look sparkly. This actually tastes quite nice

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.260
as a lip gloss as well and I know this is
going to stay on for a good couple of hours

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.659
as well, I'm not going to have to keep reapplying
every half an hour. So once you've done a

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.989
little bit of TLC on your lips, you can go
ahead and do the rest of your makeup as normal.

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.090
That's the finished look, taking you from
dry, nasty chapped lips to hopefully nice,

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.069
non-chapped, sparkly plump-looking lips. So
I really hope you enjoyed that video, I loved
