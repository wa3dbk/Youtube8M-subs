00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.210
 it 's there the iphone 5s and of course 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.370
 I also make the iPhone 5 a it 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.910
 unboxing video as I have been before 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.590
 for the iphone 5 c did the box 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.929
 if we start with it 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.810
 nothing new when you are 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.430
 the owner of an iphone 5 was the box 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.550
 It really looks very much 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.220
 similar in contrast to the iphone 5 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.039
 c in which was a completely new 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.219
 otherwise presented as packaging 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.280
 always very populous in poplar and 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.890
 shines in here is the good piece 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.410
 the iphone 5 c once you do that 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.480
 compares to the iphone 5 one puts 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.910
 it's almost the same from the outside 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.620
 Looks at the fact that the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.239
 changed home button, of course 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.280
 sting relatively quickly in the eye 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:59.850
 otherwise almost as big and on the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:02.250
 first look as hard if 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.309
 you look at the iphone 15 times 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.000
 we know the nanos sim here again 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.670
 card slot behind the whole of my 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.659
 version in gold there is the whole 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.390
 of course, also normal 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.320
 Note about the black-gold present 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.119
 chosen because I bling on bling 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.689
 are but simply something is new 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.119
 and more you have to think so too 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.830
 do not say off sounding button on top 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.579
 the other side volume 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:35.040
 settings vibration alarm and the 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:37.110
 appropriate connections in the box 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.220
 what we know itself again so 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.700
 again very nicely packaged the instructions 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:48.420
 with some goodies and labels here 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:55.619
 again, of course, the power supply, the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:56.939
 Charging cable and the headphones finished 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.899
 but nothing else changed 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:05.280
 you do not have to go to iphone 5 either 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:09.379
 Great even the device will become a man once 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:13.250
 as always greeted with a hello and 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:16.110
 Let's start with the configuration 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.120
 I click once on German clique 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.290
 then on Germany and you have now 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.599
 the possibility to choose a network 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.860
 after you have connected 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.720
 you decide if you want the 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.150
 want to turn radiolocation services the 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.950
 I do it now I can now 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.610
 configure the iphone as new 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:39.900
 iphone from cloud backup or from one 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.840
 itunes backup i will do it all now 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.120
 recover from an iphone backup 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.370
 sign me up accordingly with mine 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.950
 access data clique once on further 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:56.160
 and then once the 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:58.170
 Terms of use now accept this 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.890
 Setting up your apple id can be some 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.590
 take minutes 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.159
 that we know I can now backup 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.959
 choose 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.090
 I have here as you can see from 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.550
 iphone 5 just two minutes ago 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.470
 a backup made clique on it once 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.599
 and can play it back accordingly 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:19.230
 the settings are now from the 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:21.510
 iCloud restored and in some 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.390
 moments will then be displayed as well 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.390
 much time left to be expected 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.790
 after making the settings 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.710
 were launches the iPhone 5 it falls again 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.030
 first down and then with 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.030
 start the new settings 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.870
 the downloaded settings 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.520
 will now be applied to the iphone 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:57.610
 Here you can see the small progress 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.610
 bar fills up piece by piece 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.940
 the iphone starts again and new 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.220
 also with the desired 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.870
 settings 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:19.130
 I am welcomed here in accordance with 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:28.160
 a hello I once relax my 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:32.870
 sim card can now proceed 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:36.979
 once enter the password and click 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.030
 then on we come to one 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:41.060
 very special point namely the 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.270
 Dust the vita chedi is for this 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.800
 thought that you with your fingerprint 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.020
 can use instead of the code 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.900
 to enter this works currently only 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.419
 on the iphone 5 it on the iphone 5 c 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.180
 and on the iphone 5 you have to continue 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.280
 enter your individual code 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.210
 I'll touch the one again 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.070
 setup know your finger or 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.120
 thumb with which they usually the 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.870
 press home key 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.960
 good question i would say with the 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:18.140
 Here you lift your finger and place it 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:22.520
 Repeats him on the home button and 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:25.990
 up again and again and again 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.990
 up and back 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:46.200
 always up to a complete picture 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.200
 was created change hands 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.880
 always different positions 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.640
 you are ready to succeed 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.080
 Fingerprint can be used to unlock your 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.900
 iphone to be used 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.130
 Now click on continue and 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.080
 enter a code 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.550
 even that is completely new one must at 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.270
 Enter a code at the beginning 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:21.100
 we'll do the 1111 rain here 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.710
 further you really want the code 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:27.070
 Use is often used for this 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:30.360
 video let's take this code and 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.360
 handicapped new one 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.560
 Of course , I can also use the touch id for 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:40.030
 I use purchases what I do 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:44.620
 I register this device with mine 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:47.020
 apple id also i will do that and go 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:51.430
 as you can see, here you go 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:53.950
 reinstalled all my apps 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:57.340
 I have to cloud my ears first 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:07:00.310
 for many more things first 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.110
 some windows must click away once 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:07.480
 enter my password 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:10.330
 then click on ok and can now 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:12.550
 look like the individual programs 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:15.850
 be reloaded making it so again 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:19.920
 looks like i got it from my iphone 5 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.920
 or iphone 50 was used 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.400
 Here I must again some new 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.170
 Enter password 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:37.420
 but that I will not only times 

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:40.920
 do the individual settings and 

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:43.030
 everything you need 

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:45.490
 in the next time I will be some 

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:48.250
 make comparison with the iphone 5 it 

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.780
 the iphone 5 10 and the iphone 5 what the 

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:53.140
 speed is what the operation 

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:54.730
 as far as the individual weights are concerned 

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.380
 So let's see where the 

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.340
 Differences are around you too 

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.130
 good overview of it 

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:03.220
 how much money should you spend for 

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:04.690
 the iphone and to decide 

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.979
 which is really the right one 

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.289
 because maybe you do not have to 

00:08:05.979 --> 00:08:09.930
 necessarily the most expensive 

00:08:07.289 --> 00:08:12.389
 device access i hope my little one 

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:14.460
 unboxing video for the iphone 5 it has 

00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:16.529
 I would like you to be happy if you 

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:20.300
 otherwise my channel would subscribe 

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:20.300
 until next time bye
