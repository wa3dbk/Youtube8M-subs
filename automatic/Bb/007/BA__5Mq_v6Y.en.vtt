00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.750
 a tasting and I fancy making some 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.889
 dates 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:14.010
 I think I'm going to show you two 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:15.540
 types the sweet and the salty can 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.300
 put 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.040
 well what we are going to occupy are two 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.630
 cups of milk cup and a half of flour 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.470
 three eggs 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.739
 a pinch of salt three sugar stops 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.140
 and forty grams of butter or 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.140
 being more or less four tablespoons 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.690
 the sugar is if they are going to be troops 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.960
 salty 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.449
 with ham cheese mushrooms what you 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.180
 go to put if they are salty do not 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:53.949
 put the sugar but if they are going to make 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:57.460
 sweets that go to put banana cheese 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:01.350
 cream strawberries cajeta what will be 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:05.369
 sweet if you put the 40 grams of sugar 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.759
 I'm going to put all these ingredients 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:13.750
 except for the butter that I'm not going to 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:16.810
 put the milk the flour the eggs the 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.729
 sugar and salt in the blender I'm going to 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.110
 Blend until everything is fine 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:26.200
 liquefied already after we liquefied all that 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.409
 we 're going to strain it to make sure it does not 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.840
 there are lumps after we 'll cover it with 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.229
 a piece of plastic and we're going to put it 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.000
 to the refrigerator at least on average 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.440
 time is the minimum but if they can 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.720
 leave two hours better 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.300
 since he was resting for half an hour 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.700
 as I tell you the minimum or flat what 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.090
 what they can do is leave it at night 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.340
 whole do it from the day before and 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.950
 leave it on all night so that it does not 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.900
 are the next day waiting now what 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.710
 we are going to do is that since I rest the 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:04.170
 mix let's take it out of the refrigerator 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:07.020
 let's melt the butter and let's 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.440
 to wait for the butter to grab a 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.000
 little golden color this is a fire very 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.760
 short so you do not burn the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.400
 butter and that is the color that you 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.080
 we must leave for the crepes 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.600
 they remain golden 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.180
 and then after that they will leave 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.960
 to cool your butter about two 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.790
 minutes since it cooled down you can already 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.920
 add to the mix because remember 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.500
 that butter is hot and if 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.450
 they are thrown into the cold mixture as it can 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.180
 that the egg that is in the mixture is 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.980
 cook and it's going to be a disaster so 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.390
 wait for your butter to cool 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:49.120
 the lomenses add it also and ready 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.610
 now they will wait for it to warm up 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.850
 hot pan is going to add you 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.040
 a droplet 2 of oil will clean it 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.100
 with the napkin so it's not 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.030
 too much and since its hot is 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:08.320
 pan are going to take a measure of mixing 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:12.340
 enough measure to cover your 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.100
 pan will not go over because 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.430
 If not, the crepas will be very 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.580
 thick that would be the only thing but try 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:26.140
 to take a measure that covers your pan 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:28.450
 100% so they are well round and 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.590
 that's the good thing about these 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.150
 pans that are for crepes but of 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.239
 they can do it in any 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.390
 pan does not have to be a pan for 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.690
 crepas nothing if you can not you 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.180
 are so round that would be the only thing 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.329
 here we are going to wait 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.959
 more or less to adore the layer that 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:56.340
 is right now in the pan and already after 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.890
 with a little stick they can lift the 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.069
 shore to see check it to see if you already 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.489
 It is golden and is already is already 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:08.100
 simply with your hands or with a shovel 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.620
 as you like it, they turn it 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.850
 and then let's wait like another 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:19.110
 minute more so that it cooks what 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:23.420
 we flipped it we doubled it in half and here 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:26.390
 I'm going to start making a salty cream 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.880
 I made two mixtures to one I put sugar and 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:32.570
 I did not put one on then I 'm going to 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:36.500
 make a Hawaiian type crepe I already put 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:39.260
 grated manchego cheese and I'll start 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.050
 brown the ham a little and on the other 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.870
 side I'm biting a little bit of 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.540
 pineapple also to put then nothing 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.480

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.410
 melted the cheese bends and they catch that 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.960
 the ham and the cheese are baked 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:09.140
 It is already melted because we can already 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.910

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:15.820
