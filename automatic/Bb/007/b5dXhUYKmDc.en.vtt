feet the same way the same caliber of
excellence<00:04:50.629> I<00:04:50.780> guess<00:04:50.960> you<00:04:51.110> could<00:04:51.289> say<00:04:51.319> but<00:04:52.280> the

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
excellence I guess you could say but the

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.129 
excellence I guess you could say but the
feet<00:04:52.610> are<00:04:52.729> just<00:04:52.970> kind<00:04:53.210> of<00:04:53.270> you<00:04:53.810> know<00:04:53.840> they're

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
feet are just kind of you know they're

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.920 
feet are just kind of you know they're
just<00:04:54.319> kind<00:04:54.500> of<00:04:54.590> there<00:04:55.449> also<00:04:56.449> I<00:04:56.479> don't<00:04:56.659> think

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
just kind of there also I don't think

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.850 
just kind of there also I don't think
the<00:04:57.229> feet<00:04:57.530> are<00:04:58.960> the<00:04:59.960> size<00:05:00.139> they<00:05:00.409> should<00:05:00.680> be

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
the feet are the size they should be

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.369 
the feet are the size they should be
meaning<00:05:01.400> to<00:05:01.520> say<00:05:01.729> these<00:05:02.449> are<00:05:02.569> newborn<00:05:03.050> shoes

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:03.379 
meaning to say these are newborn shoes

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:06.249 
meaning to say these are newborn shoes
and<00:05:03.680> they're<00:05:03.919> don't<00:05:04.789> fit<00:05:05.180> very<00:05:05.210> well<00:05:05.509> on<00:05:05.930> her

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 
and they're don't fit very well on her

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.649 
and they're don't fit very well on her
there's<00:05:07.009> plenty<00:05:07.460> of<00:05:07.490> space<00:05:07.819> in<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.150> shoe<00:05:08.419> for

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:08.659 
there's plenty of space in the shoe for

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.439 
there's plenty of space in the shoe for
more<00:05:08.870> flight<00:05:09.259> so<00:05:10.250> I'm<00:05:10.370> thinking<00:05:10.789> that<00:05:10.819> maybe

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
more flight so I'm thinking that maybe

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.300 
more flight so I'm thinking that maybe
her<00:05:12.110> feet<00:05:12.440> are<00:05:12.590> too<00:05:12.770> small<00:05:13.479> but<00:05:14.479> I'll<00:05:14.659> have<00:05:14.840> to

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
her feet are too small but I'll have to

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.909 
her feet are too small but I'll have to
take<00:05:16.310> a<00:05:16.340> little<00:05:16.520> bit<00:05:16.699> deeper<00:05:17.030> into<00:05:17.240> that<00:05:17.360> one<00:05:20.919> I

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
take a little bit deeper into that one I

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:23.619 
take a little bit deeper into that one I
guess<00:05:22.280> the<00:05:22.430> eyelashes<00:05:22.879> are<00:05:22.909> okay<00:05:23.210> I've<00:05:23.389> never

00:05:23.619 --> 00:05:23.629 
guess the eyelashes are okay I've never

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:25.420 
guess the eyelashes are okay I've never
really<00:05:23.870> liked<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:24.229> way<00:05:24.349> Ashton<00:05:24.889> Drake<00:05:25.069> does

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
really liked the way Ashton Drake does

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.930 
really liked the way Ashton Drake does
the<00:05:25.580> eyelashes<00:05:26.620> I<00:05:27.620> felt<00:05:28.069> they<00:05:28.159> could<00:05:28.340> you<00:05:28.909> know

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
the eyelashes I felt they could you know

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.730 
the eyelashes I felt they could you know
make<00:05:29.150> them<00:05:29.270> look<00:05:29.389> more<00:05:29.659> real<00:05:29.840> I<00:05:30.080> don't<00:05:30.440> like

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
make them look more real I don't like

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.339 
make them look more real I don't like
the<00:05:30.889> fact<00:05:31.099> that<00:05:31.219> her<00:05:31.430> head<00:05:31.669> doesn't<00:05:31.969> turn<00:05:32.349> you

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:33.349 
the fact that her head doesn't turn you

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:35.529 
the fact that her head doesn't turn you
know<00:05:33.469> you<00:05:34.099> never<00:05:34.279> realize<00:05:34.550> how<00:05:34.759> much<00:05:34.909> you<00:05:35.120> like

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539 
know you never realize how much you like

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.240 
know you never realize how much you like
I<00:05:35.569> hate<00:05:35.840> to<00:05:35.990> turn<00:05:36.199> into<00:05:36.469> you<00:05:36.560> try<00:05:36.710> to<00:05:36.770> turn<00:05:37.039> it

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
I hate to turn into you try to turn it

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.600 
I hate to turn into you try to turn it
and<00:05:37.370> then<00:05:37.430> you<00:05:37.520> realize<00:05:37.849> it<00:05:38.180> doesn't<00:05:38.870> turn<00:05:39.610> but

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
and then you realize it doesn't turn but

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.019 
and then you realize it doesn't turn but
that's<00:05:40.789> not<00:05:41.150> a<00:05:41.180> big<00:05:41.569> deal<00:05:42.080> breaker<00:05:42.789> the<00:05:43.789> body

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:44.029 
that's not a big deal breaker the body

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:46.749 
that's not a big deal breaker the body
looked<00:05:44.509> to<00:05:44.659> me<00:05:44.810> like<00:05:44.840> it<00:05:45.020> had<00:05:45.199> been<00:05:45.560> repaired

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 
looked to me like it had been repaired

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:50.619 
looked to me like it had been repaired
a<00:05:46.789> couple<00:05:47.479> of<00:05:47.569> times<00:05:48.849> but<00:05:49.849> again<00:05:50.120> she<00:05:50.270> was<00:05:50.389> you
