00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
temporary hold until we're done doing

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.880 
temporary hold until we're done doing

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
the upside down part of our French braid

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.920 
the upside down part of our French braid
so<00:02:19.890> this<00:02:20.489> is<00:02:20.640> what<00:02:20.790> we<00:02:20.910> have<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.360> far<00:02:21.390> for<00:02:21.810> the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
so this is what we have so far for the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.090 
so this is what we have so far for the
top<00:02:22.110> rate<00:02:24.380> okay<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:25.440> for<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.830> bottom<00:02:25.920> part

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
top rate okay so for the bottom part

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.620 
top rate okay so for the bottom part
we're<00:02:26.430> doing<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.670> exact<00:02:26.940> same<00:02:27.150> thing<00:02:27.390> we<00:02:27.510> did

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
we're doing the exact same thing we did

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.060 
we're doing the exact same thing we did
at<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.930> top<00:02:28.080> we're<00:02:28.320> doing<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.620> French<00:02:28.860> braid

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
at the top we're doing a French braid

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.250 
at the top we're doing a French braid
but<00:02:29.280> it's<00:02:29.430> just<00:02:29.670> upside<00:02:30.120> down<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.050> only

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
but it's just upside down so the only

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.260 
but it's just upside down so the only
challenge<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:32.130> getting<00:02:32.340> used<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.790> the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
challenge is is getting used to the

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.020 
challenge is is getting used to the
position<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.930> your<00:02:33.989> hands<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:34.770> take<00:02:35.580> your<00:02:35.760> hair

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
position of your hands so take your hair

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.900 
position of your hands so take your hair
into<00:02:36.570> three<00:02:36.959> sections<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:38.310> easiest<00:02:38.670> way

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
into three sections and the easiest way

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.630 
into three sections and the easiest way
to<00:02:38.940> do<00:02:39.330> this<00:02:39.360> is<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:40.170> when<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:40.980> have<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.400> three

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
to do this is to when you have the three

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.199 
to do this is to when you have the three
sections<00:02:41.940> angle<00:02:42.840> your<00:02:43.050> hands<00:02:43.350> downward<00:02:44.340> so

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
sections angle your hands downward so

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.630 
sections angle your hands downward so
not<00:02:45.870> pointing<00:02:46.560> towards<00:02:46.860> your<00:02:46.980> neck<00:02:47.160> but<00:02:47.340> down

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
not pointing towards your neck but down

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.330 
not pointing towards your neck but down
towards<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.450> floor<00:02:48.840> now<00:02:49.650> take<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:50.070> hair<00:02:50.310> and

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
towards the floor now take the hair and

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.090 
towards the floor now take the hair and
do<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.730> exact<00:02:51.000> same<00:02:51.269> thing<00:02:51.600> take<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.769> middle

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
do the exact same thing take the middle

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.580 
do the exact same thing take the middle
section<00:02:53.400> pull<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.120> under<00:02:54.570> middle<00:02:55.140> section

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
section pull it under middle section

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.729 
section pull it under middle section
pull<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:55.950> under<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.989> then<00:02:57.989> you're<00:02:58.230> gonna<00:02:58.320> take

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
pull it under and then you're gonna take

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.990 
pull it under and then you're gonna take
the<00:02:59.840> hair<00:03:00.840> from<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.440> outside<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:02.640> you're

just going to add that into the outside
section<00:03:05.310> now<00:03:05.700> again<00:03:05.940> this<00:03:06.120> might<00:03:06.299> be<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.480> little

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
section now again this might be a little

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.100 
section now again this might be a little
more<00:03:07.049> challenging<00:03:07.799> just<00:03:08.190> because<00:03:08.989> you<00:03:09.989> know

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
more challenging just because you know

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.380 
more challenging just because you know
it's<00:03:10.230> at<00:03:10.350> an<00:03:10.470> odd<00:03:10.620> angle<00:03:10.790> but<00:03:11.790> it's<00:03:12.090> just<00:03:12.239> gonna

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
it's at an odd angle but it's just gonna

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.910 
it's at an odd angle but it's just gonna
take<00:03:12.630> you<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.810> little<00:03:13.079> bit<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.200> practice<00:03:13.440> and

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
take you a little bit of practice and

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.620 
take you a little bit of practice and
then<00:03:14.100> it'll<00:03:14.190> be<00:03:14.280> just<00:03:14.549> as<00:03:14.730> easy<00:03:15.000> as<00:03:15.329> French

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630

you do not loosen your braids and don't

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.189 
you do not loosen your braids and don't
miss<00:04:34.410> a<00:04:34.710> strand<00:04:35.190> of<00:04:35.310> hair<00:04:35.610> like<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.270> do<00:04:36.389> okay

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
miss a strand of hair like I do okay

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.080 
miss a strand of hair like I do okay
nice<00:04:37.470> so<00:04:37.979> that<00:04:38.789> is<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.599> finished<00:04:40.229> look<00:04:41.090> see

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
nice so that is the finished look see

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
nice so that is the finished look see
the<00:04:42.449> back<00:04:42.840> end<00:04:43.110> of<00:04:43.320> it<00:04:43.530> so<00:04:43.970> again<00:04:44.970> it<00:04:45.930> just

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
the back end of it so again it just

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.960 
the back end of it so again it just
takes<00:04:46.260> a<00:04:46.349> little<00:04:46.470> bit<00:04:46.650> of<00:04:46.710> practice<00:04:47.039> trying<00:04:47.820> to

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
takes a little bit of practice trying to

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.719 
takes a little bit of practice trying to
figure<00:04:48.180> out<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.389> upside-down<00:04:48.810> part<00:04:49.349> of<00:04:49.590> it<00:04:49.800> it

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
figure out the upside-down part of it it

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.360 
figure out the upside-down part of it it
is<00:04:50.789> a<00:04:50.940> lot<00:04:51.240> easier<00:04:51.720> if<00:04:52.050> you<00:04:52.289> don't<00:04:52.530> start<00:04:52.979> with

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
is a lot easier if you don't start with

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.820 
is a lot easier if you don't start with
the<00:04:53.789> braid<00:04:54.210> on<00:04:54.240> the<00:04:54.479> top<00:04:54.720> as<00:04:54.960> well<00:04:55.260> so<00:04:55.620> if<00:04:55.710> you

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
the braid on the top as well so if you

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.640 
the braid on the top as well so if you
just<00:04:56.039> flip<00:04:56.190> all<00:04:56.490> of<00:04:56.639> your<00:04:56.760> hair<00:04:57.000> over<00:04:57.449> braid<00:04:58.260> up
