on

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
on

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.730 
on
alright<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:13.690> there<00:02:13.840> are<00:02:14.050> some<00:02:14.260> things<00:02:14.410> that<00:02:14.620> I

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
alright so there are some things that I

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.220 
alright so there are some things that I
wish<00:02:14.980> it<00:02:15.160> would<00:02:15.310> do<00:02:15.580> like<00:02:15.880> I<00:02:15.940> wish<00:02:16.270> the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
wish it would do like I wish the

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.800 
wish it would do like I wish the
silverfish<00:02:17.980> back<00:02:18.460> ends<00:02:18.940> would<00:02:19.090> move<00:02:19.300> a<00:02:19.660> little

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
silverfish back ends would move a little

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.810 
silverfish back ends would move a little
bit<00:02:19.900> more<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:20.620> you<00:02:20.920> could<00:02:21.040> actually<00:02:21.190> wiggle<00:02:21.670> on

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
bit more so you could actually wiggle on

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.330 
bit more so you could actually wiggle on
back<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.150> forth<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:23.470> wish<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.860> spider<00:02:24.130> was

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
back and forth and I wish the spider was

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.070 
back and forth and I wish the spider was
a<00:02:24.400> little<00:02:24.670> bit<00:02:24.790> more<00:02:24.940> detailed<00:02:25.510> it's<00:02:25.840> pretty

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
a little bit more detailed it's pretty

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.660 
a little bit more detailed it's pretty
well<00:02:26.290> detailed<00:02:26.710> but<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.220> just<00:02:27.340> think<00:02:27.430> they

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
well detailed but I just think they

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.880 
well detailed but I just think they
missed<00:02:27.910> a<00:02:28.210> little<00:02:28.390> bit<00:02:28.660> of<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.930> like<00:02:29.740> the

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
missed a little bit of it like the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.510 
missed a little bit of it like the
things<00:02:30.130> aren't<00:02:30.490> that<00:02:30.520> great<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:32.220> yeah<00:02:33.220> it's

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
things aren't that great and yeah it's

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.610 
things aren't that great and yeah it's
pretty<00:02:33.820> well<00:02:34.060> done<00:02:34.240> but<00:02:34.540> I<00:02:34.720> like<00:02:35.020> it<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.500> have<00:02:35.590> a

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
pretty well done but I like it to have a

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.230 
pretty well done but I like it to have a
little<00:02:35.890> bit<00:02:35.980> more<00:02:36.100> detail<00:02:36.490> especially<00:02:36.850> on<00:02:37.180> the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
little bit more detail especially on the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.970 
little bit more detail especially on the
Selfridge<00:02:37.660> say<00:02:37.960> kind<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.350> texture<00:02:38.740> and<00:02:38.920> they

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
Selfridge say kind of a texture and they

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.180 
Selfridge say kind of a texture and they
kind<00:02:39.160> of<00:02:39.280> missed<00:02:39.520> that<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.780> wish<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:41.290> legs
