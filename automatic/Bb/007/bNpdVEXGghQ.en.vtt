00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.080
 Hello to everyone 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.120
 I am very happy that I can become a part of the Wisła Kraków team 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:35.400
 I've already started training with the team 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.880
 We will try to get promoted to the Champions League together 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.040
 You all know me, welcome to the second time 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.680
 I am glad that I can be with you 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:09.280
 I hope that we will be able to meet this great challenge that is ahead of us - the Champions League 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.520
 Let's hope we'll win 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.940
 I will try to do my best to make it happen 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.720
 I would like to welcome everyone 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.940
 I am glad that I am finally a competitor of the Vistula, because I've been training with her for almost a month 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.880
 Supporters in Riga ... I could not believe it 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.560
 I saw about a thousand Polish fans 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.320
 I felt like we were playing in this stadium. It was amazing 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:59.160
 I hope that I will feel it on Tuesday 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.380
 I've been here for a week, I'm still a new player. I meet everyone, players, club 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.240
 My first impression is very good. I see that Wisła is a great club that has great fans. 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.800
 I can not wait for this season, I hope it will be as good as the previous one 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.640
 Before I came to Wisła, I talked about it with Maor Melikson 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.600
 He explained to me that this is a great club, he has many fans 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.080
 We will play in UEFA competitions and for the Polish championship 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.960
 He introduced me to everyone, he helps me 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.400
 I watched Krakow, I have to admit that it is a very nice city 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:52.240
 Maor told me about Poland and the mentality of Poles 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.960
 I'm glad he's here with me and I'm sure we'll help each other
