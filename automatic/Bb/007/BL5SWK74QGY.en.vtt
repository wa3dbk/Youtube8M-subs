there's<00:00:39.790> a<00:00:39.850> skip<00:00:40.210> in<00:00:40.239> there

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.480 

see<00:00:57.050> I'm<00:00:57.170> skipping<00:00:57.560> the<00:00:57.830> string<00:00:58.130> and<00:00:58.370> I'm

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.810 

fastest<00:01:07.130> sounds<00:01:07.340> like

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.410 

and<00:01:13.690> that's<00:01:13.870> a<00:01:14.050> usual<00:01:14.500> temple<00:01:14.800> for<00:01:14.950> that<00:01:15.070> speed

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and that's a usual temple for that speed

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.380 
and that's a usual temple for that speed
or<00:01:16.420> that<00:01:16.690> rhythm<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:18.280> this<00:01:18.490> drum<00:01:18.880> that's<00:01:19.270> a

or that rhythm for this drum that's a
usual<00:01:19.720> temple<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.640> let<00:01:24.820> me<00:01:24.910> slow<00:01:25.090> it<00:01:25.210> down<00:01:25.240> now

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
usual temple so let me slow it down now

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.120 
usual temple so let me slow it down now
first<00:01:25.869> half<00:01:26.080> of<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.350> rhythm<00:01:26.710> is<00:01:28.710> easy<00:01:29.710> right

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
first half of the rhythm is easy right

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.930 
first half of the rhythm is easy right
now<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.560> second<00:01:33.130> half<00:01:33.280> of<00:01:33.340> this<00:01:33.460> drum<00:01:33.729> is

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
now the second half of this drum is

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.200 
now the second half of this drum is
where<00:01:34.360> you<00:01:34.420> skip<00:01:34.960> then<00:01:35.920> come<00:01:36.220> on<00:01:36.400> and<00:01:36.670> then

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
where you skip then come on and then

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:46.660 
where you skip then come on and then
down<00:01:37.450> this<00:01:37.900> is<00:01:38.080> three<00:01:38.290> and<00:01:38.320> four<00:01:38.619> three

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670

three three the whole straw was put
together<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:56.009> makes<00:01:56.130> more<00:01:56.280> sense<00:01:56.340> when<00:01:57.119> you

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
together it makes more sense when you

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:06.719 
together it makes more sense when you
hear<00:01:57.390> all<00:01:57.479> four<00:01:57.720> beats

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729
