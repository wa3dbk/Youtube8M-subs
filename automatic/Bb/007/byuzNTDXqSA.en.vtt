00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
lower about it and it's really

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.810 
lower about it and it's really
interesting<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.320> see<00:00:49.500> was<00:00:49.739> going<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.430> it's

interesting to see was going and it's

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.760 
interesting to see was going and it's
very<00:00:51.090> possible<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.960> just<00:00:52.260> an<00:00:52.350> employee

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
very possible that is just an employee

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.520 
very possible that is just an employee
at<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:54.030> restaurant<00:00:54.480> not<00:00:54.660> necessarily<00:00:55.350> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
at the restaurant not necessarily the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.869 
at the restaurant not necessarily the
security<00:00:56.129> guard<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.579> could<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:56.760> been<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
security guard it could have been a

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.400 
security guard it could have been a
maintenance<00:00:57.449> man<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.989> lot<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.230> people

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
maintenance man it's a lot of people

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.260 
maintenance man it's a lot of people
think<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.859> new<00:00:59.100> theory<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.879> it's<00:01:00.030> very

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
think this new theory that it's very

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.430 
think this new theory that it's very
possible<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.809> purple<00:01:01.140> guy<00:01:01.230> was<00:01:01.410> a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
possible that the purple guy was a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.020 
possible that the purple guy was a
maintenance<00:01:02.010> man<00:01:02.100> that's<00:01:02.460> how<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:02.699> knew<00:01:02.910> how

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
maintenance man that's how we knew how

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.000 
maintenance man that's how we knew how
to<00:01:03.090> disable<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.600> suits<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.080> so<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:04.920> so

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
to disable the suits and so on and so

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.370 
to disable the suits and so on and so
forth<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.549> very<00:01:05.820> very<00:01:05.970> cool<00:01:06.450> ideas<00:01:06.900> I'm

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
forth so very very cool ideas I'm

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.660 
forth so very very cool ideas I'm
excited<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.860> don't<00:01:07.979> want<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.159> speculate<00:01:08.400> too

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
excited I don't want to speculate too

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.740 
excited I don't want to speculate too
much<00:01:08.820> but<00:01:09.030> what<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.270> want<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.570> talk<00:01:09.659> about

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
much but what I do want to talk about

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.450 
much but what I do want to talk about
the<00:01:09.900> stuff<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:10.380> know<00:01:10.560> what<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:10.890> do<00:01:11.100> get<00:01:11.280> from

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
the stuff we do know what we do get from

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.820 
the stuff we do know what we do get from
this<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.119> bite<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.360> 87<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.320> think<00:01:13.710> it's

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
this is the bite of 87 I think it's

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.170 
this is the bite of 87 I think it's
really<00:01:14.040> exciting<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.610> we're<00:01:14.790> gonna<00:01:14.880> get<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
really exciting that we're gonna get the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.469 
really exciting that we're gonna get the
this<00:01:15.630> might<00:01:15.960> be<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.920> instance<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.610> bite<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.909> 87

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
this might be the instance of bite of 87

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.499 
this might be the instance of bite of 87
or<00:01:18.830> it'll<00:01:19.830> be<00:01:20.009> explaining<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> bite<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.939> 87

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
or it'll be explaining the bite of 87

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.080 
or it'll be explaining the bite of 87
with<00:01:21.600> these<00:01:21.720> new<00:01:22.100> totally<00:01:23.100> nightmare<00:01:23.610> forms

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
with these new totally nightmare forms

with these new totally nightmare forms
of<00:01:24.210> these<00:01:24.530> animatronics<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.310> very

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
of these animatronics this is very

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.280 
of these animatronics this is very
different<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.270> kind<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.630> going<00:01:27.990> back<00:01:28.259> to

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
different it's kind of going back to

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.810 
different it's kind of going back to
what<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.650> were<00:01:28.770> talking<00:01:29.040> about<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.610> five
