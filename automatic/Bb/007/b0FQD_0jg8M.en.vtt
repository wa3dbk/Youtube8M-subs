the<00:00:07.710> updated<00:00:08.309> eyebrow<00:00:08.700> tutorial<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.510> do<00:00:10.320> my

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
the updated eyebrow tutorial I do my

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.289 
the updated eyebrow tutorial I do my
eyebrows<00:00:10.980> different<00:00:11.429> every<00:00:11.669> time<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:12.030> try<00:00:12.269> to

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:12.299 
eyebrows different every time I try to

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:14.989 
eyebrows different every time I try to
find<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.870> best<00:00:13.259> way<00:00:13.589> and<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.070> think<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.700> one

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:14.999 
find the best way and I think this one

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.600 
find the best way and I think this one
is<00:00:15.299> probably<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:16.020> best<00:00:16.230> way<00:00:16.500> because<00:00:17.130> if<00:00:17.490> you

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
is probably the best way because if you

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.360 
is probably the best way because if you
could<00:00:17.820> go<00:00:18.690> back<00:00:18.960> into<00:00:19.140> like<00:00:19.470> some<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.830> my<00:00:19.920> older

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:20.370 
could go back into like some of my older

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.490 
could go back into like some of my older

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
but this is darker than the dip down and

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.020 
but this is darker than the dip down and
plus<00:02:12.390> when<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.870> apply<00:02:13.200> this<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:14.129> dries<00:02:14.790> really

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
plus when you apply this it dries really

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.820 
plus when you apply this it dries really
fast<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:15.989> if<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.290> mess

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
fast so if you mess

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.770 
fast so if you mess
you<00:02:16.950> really<00:02:17.280> can't<00:02:17.520> correct<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.240> so<00:02:18.420> I<00:02:18.600> really

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
you really can't correct it so I really

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.110 
you really can't correct it so I really
like<00:02:19.050> this<00:02:19.230> because<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.710> dries<00:02:19.950> fit<00:02:20.340> fast<00:02:20.760> and

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
like this because it dries fit fast and

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.390 
like this because it dries fit fast and
you<00:02:21.210> really<00:02:21.570> don't<00:02:21.750> have<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.170> put<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.650> brow<00:02:23.370> gel

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
you really don't have to put a brow gel

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.650 
you really don't have to put a brow gel
because<00:02:24.150> this<00:02:24.600> stuff<00:02:25.020> is<00:02:25.170> not<00:02:25.380> going<00:02:25.620> anywhere

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
because this stuff is not going anywhere

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.140 
because this stuff is not going anywhere
and<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:28.050> conceal<00:02:28.530> under<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.160> eyebrow<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.790> even
