00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.830
 worse is about to buy a new car 

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:10.389
 to make a choice 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.599
 he spends all his free time 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.549
 car showrooms 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:16.680
 here today 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.370
 our hero spent a lunch break on 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.370
 finding the right car 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.220
 in the east 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.509
 really made 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:28.569
 and there is 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.449
 Ivan bought a new car 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.120
 before you get behind the wheel 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.530
 our hero decided to study carefully 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.550
 new car 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.550
 like everything suits him 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.890
 all but one 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.600
 mileage on the speedometer 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.610
 shows that the car drove 26 kilometers 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.190
 how is it possible because the car is new 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.270
 who drove it 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.230
 do not despair Ivanov five minutes and Galileo 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.940
 answered your question 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.170
 let's start our investigation right from 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.739
 car factory 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.470
 where they collect exactly the same machine as that 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.760
 our hero 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.210
 body is brought to the factory separately 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.880
 tdi engine and chassis to their 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.240
 descendants of these parts are conditionally 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.370
 make a modern car 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.200
 each part of the machine is delivered to the factory 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.780
 water 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.450
 These are wooden frames for 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.090
 transportation 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.030
 when parts are free from 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.640
 flight 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.869
 they are sent 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.310
 on the assembly 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.909
 as you can see it while the car and can not 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.930
 move yourself 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.930
 they have no wheels 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.000
 so first going chassis 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.010
 chassis part is all-Russian 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.350
 car axles and suspension and wheels 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.360
 and in the movements of the chassis leads engines 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.360
 which are attached to automotive aspen 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.630
 Next comes the most ambitious and 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.340
 responsible stage 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.670
 He calls Savkov website 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.659
 which in German means 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.580
 wedding 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.110
 at this stage the two most connected 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.729
 important parts of the machine 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.619
 chassis and body 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:15.619
 in a word everything falls into place 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.120
 then in the car connect the wires and 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.400
 hoses so that the car can be 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.939
 refuel technical 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.659
 liquids 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.790
 right at the factory in AvtoVAZ poured 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.269
 oil salting and even gasoline 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.899
 what is gasoline for 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:34.369
 right now in a new car 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:37.639
 first turn the ignition key 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.289
 from now on, the car will 

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:41.829
 move around the plant only your 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:42.469
 by the course 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:43.650
 but they are for you 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.769
 will begin to count kilometers 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:47.580
 here they are 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.459
 first two meters 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.989
 don't think nothing is broken 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.450
 now the master will diagnose in 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.159
 car electrical systems 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.510
 if something is wrong 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.859
 the computer will immediately issue an error 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.399
 if everything is in order and the collector will allow 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:06.519
 car move on 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.549
 by the way its thousand more two meters 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:10.899
 and now attention 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.379
 the fun begins 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.779
 car tests she roller you 

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:16.829
 the old 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.680
 the car was tired of the raid and the 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.439
 accelerates to one hundred and twenty kilometers in 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.219
 hour 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.569
 right now you can check how 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.029
 work brake system box 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:30.739
 gears and how the engine behaves on 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.579
 increased speed 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.419
 on this simulator car 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:37.159
 rolls about 10 kilometers 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.429
 do you think 

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:42.539
 if the car passed safely 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:43.749
 roller thousand 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:47.119
 it is passed to the quality control department 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:49.000
 Yuri his colleagues 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.880
 carefully examine each 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.999
 machine off the assembly line 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:55.759
 the controller himself 

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:58.819
 inspects the entire vehicle system 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.759
 so that future drivers that 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:03.399
 called from villages and drove 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:06.669
 by the way and where I went and yuri 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.100
 open secret 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.600
 quality controller sent to 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.180
 special polygon where cars 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.830
 fasten you their natural environment 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:16.779
 habitat 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:17.939
 on the roads 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:20.609
 the road and as we know there are different 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.919
 test polygon consists of ten 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.770
 different coatings 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.580
 single strands digs country potholes 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.629
 other paving stones also have buds 

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:33.479
 tramways and and other delights and 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.249
 roadbed 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:37.909
 hear how tikhonov 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:39.949
 her lory and listens 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:41.060
 his task 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.139
 analyze all background noise 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.800
 who makes the car 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.180
 thanks to bumps and bumps 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.850
 the hearing controller determines the creak 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.419
 cast car body or debunked and 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:54.169
 baltics 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.009
 this cover is made of 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:58.860
 Swiss marble checkers on it 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.300
 check stability 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.539
 brake system and on the radio thousands and dig 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:04.949
 hand brake 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:06.379
 if something is wrong 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:09.240
 the car will be sent by the analytical center 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.479
 for revision 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:12.529
 the length of the landfill is almost 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:14.319
 kilometer during this time 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.409
 car rolls in about 5 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:17.230
 kilometers 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.810
 when he comes back from the landfill 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.690
 2 more 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.529
 considering counting vase 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:26.309
 upon returning graduate waiting 

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:28.719
 yes no no, but we naturally 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:31.639
 body tightness 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.379
 jets of water and imitate 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:35.939
 tropical rain 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:38.189
 if the car pick it up won't get wet 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:41.189
 then ordinary rain will surely endure 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:45.539
 Our four-wheeled heroes are waiting 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.089
 last tests 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:49.650
 trip to Biysk 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.849
 special lamps with warm or cold light 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:54.849
 on the case invisible even the smallest 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:57.150
 body scratches 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.030
 if the controller did not see the car 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.509
 you can safely send salon 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:05.550
 Well, Ivanov is now clear where 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.589
 I took these 26 kilometers and you already 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:10.949
 wanted to return the car turn 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.099
 better calculator and a whole Putin
