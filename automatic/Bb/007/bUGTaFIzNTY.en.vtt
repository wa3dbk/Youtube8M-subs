00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 Hi everybody , I'm good at today's video. 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.020
 I'm going to teach you some hairstyles. 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.650
 Pin up style that I love 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.750
 they are very few and easy to do 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.000
 perfect for all the lengths of 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.820
 hair but especially for those who have 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.320
 medium or short hair so if you 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.820
 You want to learn, just go on. 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.740
 watching the video 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.689
 yesterday I heard my hair with a shampoo 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.730
 and conditioner want hydration 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.789
 intense hair that leaves super hair 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.130
 hydrated and beautiful from root to tip and 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.020
 I also did very happy in my hair yesterday. 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.690
 today he is one of the little ones 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.800
 messy and then you choose if you 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.170
 prefers it wavy plain wrapped to 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.750
 the pinato style I think one on the side 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.120
 coiled look prettier but goes from 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.489
 your preference and now it will start with 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.699
 the hairstyles and I'll start with the two 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.699
 hairstyles that do not need to unravel the 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.590
 volume hair that are the simplest 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.230
 so come on, I'll share the hair 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.030
 on the side 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.619
 this one is very simple but it is one of those that 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.900
 I like the most 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.909
 and then your hair already're the one hand it is 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.159
 with that beautiful fringe you know that 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.040
 I like this look very nice and I'll get it 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:20.549
 a piece of cake here on this other side and I'm going 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:25.590
 twist and fasten here with 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:29.430
 grampinho and ready super super easy 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.439
 simple but has that retro footprint the 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.110
 second hairstyle is perfect for anyone who 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.400
 likes to wear her hair, so I go 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.049
 leave that fringe zone that out 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.110
 I'll hold this hair in the middle of 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:51.390
 I make a good coke in the head. 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:55.850
 Then I'll cheer and I'll make a 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:59.490
 basic coke and learn with spellings 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.740
 and you can either leave it or use the 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.770
 accessory a bandana is a good option 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.770
 because it's pretty classic pnap you can 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.729
 use a red ribbon or any other 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.030
 other color 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.610
 I'm going to use a piece 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.440
 red that I cut myself and I go 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.670
 do the following I 'll spend here is 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:22.000
 make the head and I'll make a ration 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:29.080
 up here so I'll do 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.030
 Give a knot and now I'm going to cross these 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.510
 two little pieces so I'll pass this 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:40.870
 Here and here and I learn here. 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:47.380
 underneath the tape I do not know how to call 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:49.450
 that phrase you can leave or drop 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:55.450
 It bothers me a little more. 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:59.500
 or you can learn with grampinho and the 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.239
 according to the hairstyle that 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.700
 third hairstyle will be that 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:08.860
 famous fence that everyone loves 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.300
 So I'm going to split a fuse here in the 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.569
 front 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.630
 so I 'm going to use a little profit 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.970
 and announces extra firm growth 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.070
 that you know I love and if you 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.750
 will help to give a volume 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:28.360
 So I'll get a little bit here in the 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:32.470
 my hand and I'll come over here in the 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:43.980
 hair to help me with a volume of this 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:48.820
 I'll massage the butt and I 'll go too. 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:54.340
 to divert with more as the round only one 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:57.640
 little and I'm going to get this fuck I 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.769
 I'm going to twist and push a 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.870
 stepped forward and formed this 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:08.500
 and now you just have to learn 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:12.700
 grains and ready I love this bump 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.110
 super easy to do is a grace and 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.630
 Lastly I'll take advantage of this 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.700
 the pet and will hold the hair in a tail 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.110
 horse very tall 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.880
 no secrets with a normal little male 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.490
 and then you can add the 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.950
 accessory or the bandana I 'll tie from the 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.550
 same way I did in the other hairstyle 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:39.290
 Only this time I'm going to pass the tape. 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:41.360
 above the butt clamp, and 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.130
 It's like this, I really hope you 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.800
 have enjoyed reminding you that you can 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.660
 use with or without the band 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.220
 depends on the taste of each 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.470
