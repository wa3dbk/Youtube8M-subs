to<00:00:08.830> you<00:00:08.890> the<00:00:09.040> differences<00:00:09.580> in<00:00:09.730> the<00:00:09.820> features

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
to you the differences in the features

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:18.179 
to you the differences in the features
and<00:00:10.269> benefits<00:00:10.390> of<00:00:10.870> both<00:00:10.990> products<00:00:17.159> there<00:00:18.159> are

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:18.189 
and benefits of both products there are

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:19.739 
and benefits of both products there are
two<00:00:18.429> types<00:00:18.699> of<00:00:18.849> insulation<00:00:19.509> that<00:00:19.689> we

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:19.749 
two types of insulation that we

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:21.329 
two types of insulation that we
primarily<00:00:20.109> use<00:00:20.439> in<00:00:20.739> our<00:00:20.829> homes

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:21.339 
primarily use in our homes

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.929 
primarily use in our homes
the<00:00:21.550> first<00:00:21.820> is<00:00:22.179> fiberglass<00:00:22.839> or<00:00:23.349> blow<00:00:23.890> in<00:00:24.099> this

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
the first is fiberglass or blow in this

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.120 
the first is fiberglass or blow in this
is<00:00:25.179> if<00:00:25.329> you<00:00:25.419> go<00:00:25.599> up<00:00:25.689> into<00:00:25.810> your<00:00:25.989> attic<00:00:26.230> you'll

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
is if you go up into your attic you'll

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.470 
is if you go up into your attic you'll
look<00:00:27.310> up<00:00:27.489> there<00:00:27.730> and<00:00:27.909> it's<00:00:27.999> usually<00:00:28.149> either

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
look up there and it's usually either

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.179 
look up there and it's usually either
yellow<00:00:28.929> or<00:00:28.960> white<00:00:29.259> and<00:00:29.560> it<00:00:29.859> will<00:00:30.039> look<00:00:30.159> like

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
yellow or white and it will look like

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.220 
yellow or white and it will look like
fluff<00:00:30.759> everywhere<00:00:31.509> in<00:00:31.569> the<00:00:31.659> attic<00:00:31.960> and<00:00:32.050> that

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
fluff everywhere in the attic and that

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.189 
fluff everywhere in the attic and that
is<00:00:32.380> blown<00:00:32.680> in<00:00:32.890> fiberglass<00:00:33.309> insulation<00:00:34.199> the

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
is blown in fiberglass insulation the

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:37.470 
is blown in fiberglass insulation the
concept<00:00:35.769> behind<00:00:35.890> this<00:00:36.250> insulation<00:00:36.820> is<00:00:37.180> your

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
concept behind this insulation is your

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.090 
concept behind this insulation is your
attic<00:00:37.840> will<00:00:38.019> get<00:00:38.199> fairly<00:00:38.649> warm<00:00:38.890> in<00:00:39.010> the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
attic will get fairly warm in the

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.669 
attic will get fairly warm in the
summertime<00:00:39.609> the<00:00:40.449> insulation<00:00:41.109> there<00:00:41.379> is<00:00:41.530> to

00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:41.679 
summertime the insulation there is to

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:43.560 
summertime the insulation there is to
separate<00:00:42.129> the<00:00:42.190> heat<00:00:42.370> from<00:00:42.969> the<00:00:43.149> attic<00:00:43.480> and

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
separate the heat from the attic and

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.380 
separate the heat from the attic and
your<00:00:44.109> living<00:00:44.440> space<00:00:44.559> below<00:00:45.070> and<00:00:45.339> thus<00:00:46.210> it

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
your living space below and thus it

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.090 
your living space below and thus it
keeps<00:00:46.600> that<00:00:46.780> heat<00:00:47.050> that's<00:00:47.379> generated<00:00:47.530> in<00:00:48.010> the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
keeps that heat that's generated in the

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.490 
keeps that heat that's generated in the
summertime<00:00:48.579> by<00:00:48.789> the<00:00:48.850> outside<00:00:49.329> in<00:00:49.629> your<00:00:50.109> attic

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
summertime by the outside in your attic

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.950 
summertime by the outside in your attic

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.249 
insulation that we use and a more

insulation that we use and a more
efficient<00:00:57.760> type<00:00:57.910> of<00:00:58.089> insulation<00:00:58.539> is<00:00:58.870> a<00:00:59.190> spray

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
efficient type of insulation is a spray

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.700 
efficient type of insulation is a spray

comes<00:01:03.429> in<00:01:03.640> two<00:01:03.850> pieces<00:01:04.089> and<00:01:04.480> we<00:01:05.200> have<00:01:05.410> this

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
comes in two pieces and we have this

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.680 
comes in two pieces and we have this
nozzle<00:01:05.830> system<00:01:06.250> here<00:01:06.730> that<00:01:06.880> when<00:01:07.360> we<00:01:07.480> pull<00:01:07.660> the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
nozzle system here that when we pull the

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.570 
nozzle system here that when we pull the
trigger<00:01:07.810> it<00:01:08.290> mixes<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.740> two<00:01:09.010> together<00:01:09.190> and

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
trigger it mixes the two together and

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.570 
trigger it mixes the two together and
creates<00:01:09.880> a<00:01:10.060> solid<00:01:10.360> compound<00:01:10.930> for<00:01:11.290> us<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
creates a solid compound for us the

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.370 
creates a solid compound for us the
difference<00:01:12.940> between<00:01:13.030> spray<00:01:13.750> foam<00:01:14.110> and

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
difference between spray foam and

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.080 
difference between spray foam and
blowing<00:01:14.950> is<00:01:15.130> you'll<00:01:15.280> notice<00:01:15.460> in<00:01:15.730> your<00:01:15.760> attic

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
blowing is you'll notice in your attic

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.700 
blowing is you'll notice in your attic
like<00:01:16.210> I<00:01:16.390> was<00:01:16.510> mentioning<00:01:16.690> the<00:01:17.020> blowin<00:01:17.380> is<00:01:17.560> on

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
like I was mentioning the blowin is on

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.560 
like I was mentioning the blowin is on
the<00:01:17.860> ground<00:01:18.160> so<00:01:18.760> it<00:01:18.850> allows<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.240> attic<00:01:19.540> to

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
the ground so it allows the attic to

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.330 
the ground so it allows the attic to
heat<00:01:19.840> up<00:01:19.870> and<00:01:20.230> then<00:01:20.320> it<00:01:20.500> stops<00:01:20.800> that<00:01:21.040> heat<00:01:21.220> in

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
heat up and then it stops that heat in

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.530 
heat up and then it stops that heat in
the<00:01:21.430> Attic<00:01:21.670> from<00:01:21.760> transferring<00:01:22.240> to<00:01:22.420> your

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540

the Attic from transferring to your
living<00:01:22.720> space<00:01:23.760> spray<00:01:24.760> foam<00:01:24.790> on<00:01:25.210> the<00:01:25.360> other

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
living space spray foam on the other

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.110

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.940 
or on your sheathing of your roof and
the<00:01:31.120> concept<00:01:31.690> behind<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:32.140> spray<00:01:32.440> foam<00:01:32.710> is

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
the concept behind the spray foam is

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.800 
the concept behind the spray foam is
instead<00:01:33.280> of<00:01:33.400> letting<00:01:33.760> the<00:01:33.910> heat<00:01:34.120> into<00:01:34.690> the

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
instead of letting the heat into the

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.380 
instead of letting the heat into the
attic<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:35.200> then<00:01:35.860> stopping<00:01:36.250> it<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:37.090> spray

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
attic and then stopping it the spray

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.000 
attic and then stopping it the spray
foam<00:01:37.600> stops<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.140> heat<00:01:38.290> from<00:01:38.410> even<00:01:38.740> getting

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
foam stops the heat from even getting

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.850 
foam stops the heat from even getting
into<00:01:39.730> your<00:01:39.820> attic<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:41.110> is<00:01:41.320> much<00:01:41.620> more

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
into your attic this is much more

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.950 
into your attic this is much more
effective<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:42.610> more<00:01:42.790> efficient<00:01:43.390> as<00:01:43.540> far<00:01:43.570> as

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
effective and more efficient as far as

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.500 
effective and more efficient as far as
energy<00:01:44.470> consumption<00:01:45.040> is<00:01:45.160> concerned<00:01:45.640> because

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
conditioning systems are located in our

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.110 
conditioning systems are located in our
attics<00:01:52.720> so<00:01:53.620> having<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.130> blowin<00:01:54.490> insulation

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
attics so having the blowin insulation

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.850 
attics so having the blowin insulation
while<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.420> is<00:01:55.540> efficient<00:01:56.080> for<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.530> living

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
while it is efficient for the living

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.640 
while it is efficient for the living
space<00:01:57.300> your<00:01:58.300> insulation<00:01:59.170> or<00:01:59.260> your<00:01:59.380> ductwork

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
space your insulation or your ductwork

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.960 
space your insulation or your ductwork
that's<00:02:00.190> on<00:02:00.370> your<00:02:00.550> heating<00:02:00.730> and<00:02:00.880> cooling

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
that's on your heating and cooling

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.600 
that's on your heating and cooling
system<00:02:01.330> is<00:02:01.960> sitting<00:02:02.560> in<00:02:02.710> that<00:02:02.830> incredibly<00:02:03.430> hot

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
system is sitting in that incredibly hot

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.610 
system is sitting in that incredibly hot
attic<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:04.240> you'll<00:02:04.780> notice<00:02:05.140> it<00:02:05.290> doesn't<00:02:05.470> have

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
attic and you'll notice it doesn't have

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.350 
attic and you'll notice it doesn't have
nearly<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.190> same<00:02:06.430> amount<00:02:06.490> of<00:02:06.790> insulation

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
nearly the same amount of insulation

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.060 
nearly the same amount of insulation
around<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.750> ductwork<00:02:08.170> as<00:02:08.349> it<00:02:08.500> does<00:02:08.679> on<00:02:08.979> the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
around the ductwork as it does on the

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.450 
around the ductwork as it does on the
floor<00:02:09.899> by<00:02:10.899> having<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.410> spray<00:02:11.680> foam<00:02:12.010> we<00:02:12.280> can

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
floor by having the spray foam we can

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.030 
floor by having the spray foam we can
reduce<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:13.240> heat

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
reduce the heat

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.440 
reduce the heat
in<00:02:14.099> your<00:02:14.250> attic<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.760> bring<00:02:14.909> the<00:02:15.000> temperature

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
in your attic and bring the temperature

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.140 
in your attic and bring the temperature
down<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.930> what<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.099> does<00:02:17.340> is<00:02:17.549> actually<00:02:17.730> two

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
down and what that does is actually two

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.910 
down and what that does is actually two
parts<00:02:18.450> for<00:02:18.780> us<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.079> first<00:02:19.319> is<00:02:19.590> by<00:02:19.709> reducing

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
parts for us the first is by reducing

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.530 
parts for us the first is by reducing
the<00:02:20.340> heat<00:02:20.489> that's<00:02:20.730> around<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.209> heating<00:02:21.480> and

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
the heat that's around the heating and

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.899 
the heat that's around the heating and
cooling<00:02:21.629> system<00:02:22.319> we<00:02:22.920> make<00:02:23.129> that<00:02:23.310> system<00:02:23.549> more

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
cooling system we make that system more

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.789 
cooling system we make that system more
efficient<00:02:24.450> because<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.260> air<00:02:25.439> and<00:02:25.739> the

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
efficient because the air and the

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.490 
efficient because the air and the
ductwork<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.400> able<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.760> stay<00:02:26.939> colder<00:02:27.390> but<00:02:28.290> also

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
ductwork is able to stay colder but also

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.199 
ductwork is able to stay colder but also
by<00:02:28.859> reducing<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.430> temperature<00:02:29.819> that's<00:02:30.030> in

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
by reducing the temperature that's in

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.330 
by reducing the temperature that's in
the<00:02:30.329> Attic<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:31.290> also<00:02:31.560> is<00:02:31.920> going<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.129> allow<00:02:32.310> that

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
the Attic it also is going to allow that

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.250 
the Attic it also is going to allow that
air-conditioning<00:02:33.299> system<00:02:33.689> to<00:02:33.810> not<00:02:33.900> have<00:02:34.140> to

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
air-conditioning system to not have to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.349 
air-conditioning system to not have to
work<00:02:34.439> as<00:02:34.650> hard<00:02:34.680> because<00:02:35.640> it's<00:02:35.939> not<00:02:36.000> going<00:02:36.269> to

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
work as hard because it's not going to

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.119 
work as hard because it's not going to
be<00:02:36.450> combated<00:02:36.989> not<00:02:37.109> only<00:02:37.409> the<00:02:37.530> living<00:02:37.829> space

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
be combated not only the living space

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.190 
be combated not only the living space
but<00:02:38.400> also<00:02:38.579> that<00:02:38.939> additional<00:02:39.329> heat<00:02:39.540> that's<00:02:39.959> in

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
but also that additional heat that's in

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.589 
but also that additional heat that's in
