00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
let's see we took our headlight

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.090 
let's see we took our headlight
protection<00:00:51.239> kit<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.690> cut<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> front<00:00:52.559> third

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
protection kit and cut the front third

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.220 
protection kit and cut the front third
and<00:00:53.399> we're<00:00:54.149> going<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.300> install<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.780> front

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
and we're going to install the front

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.840 
and we're going to install the front
third<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.860> headlight<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.699> can

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
third of the headlight so that you can

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.700 
third of the headlight so that you can
see<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> before<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.930> after

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.410 

the<00:01:03.130> film<00:01:03.370> goes<00:01:03.580> on<00:01:03.820> with<00:01:04.000> just<00:01:04.210> straight

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
the film goes on with just straight

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.999 
the film goes on with just straight
water<00:01:04.750> and<00:01:05.110> gets<00:01:05.320> squeegeed<00:01:05.830> on<00:01:05.950> as<00:01:06.190> shown

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.069 

and<00:01:12.549> will<00:01:12.670> dry<00:01:12.909> it<00:01:12.969> off<00:01:13.210> so<00:01:13.509> you<00:01:13.600> can<00:01:13.750> see<00:01:13.930> the

and will dry it off so you can see the

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:15.569 
and will dry it off so you can see the
difference<00:01:14.469> you<00:01:14.680> can<00:01:14.829> already<00:01:15.070> see<00:01:15.310> there's<00:01:15.520> a

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
difference you can already see there's a

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:18.090 
difference you can already see there's a
big<00:01:15.789> difference<00:01:15.820> between<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.960> filmed<00:01:17.740> area

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
big difference between the filmed area

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.730 
big difference between the filmed area
and<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.399> non<00:01:18.640> protected<00:01:19.270> area

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.980 

and<00:01:26.100> there's<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.580> nice<00:01:26.820> big<00:01:27.150> close-up<00:01:27.690> shot<00:01:27.960> of

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.880 
and there's a nice big close-up shot of
the<00:01:28.320> difference<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:30.560> now<00:01:31.560> we'll<00:01:31.710> go<00:01:31.860> ahead

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
the difference and now we'll go ahead

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.250 
the difference and now we'll go ahead
and<00:01:32.310> peel<00:01:32.700> back<00:01:32.940> the<00:01:33.240> material<00:01:33.900> we<00:01:34.020> just

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
and peel back the material we just

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.350
