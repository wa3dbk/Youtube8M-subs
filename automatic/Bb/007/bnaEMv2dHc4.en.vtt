00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 hi guys are chi m 2 k trophies e 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:10.620
 this and trophies to the bear of the waste of 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.179
 So do what the trophy says 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.549
 this trophy asks us to change 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.270
 then the car in everything and for everything 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.330
 add a piece in each category 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.920
 that there is internal categories e 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.279
 subcategories that there is inside 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.789
 of the auto modifier then you start 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.099
 with the armor the brakes are passed by 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.620
 spoiler as you see both front and 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.219
 back then to change 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.600
 completely the car and I'm not 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.730
 all available at the beginning of the game 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.070
 but once the robbery is done with 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.600
 Michael and Franklin are very likely 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.550
 most of them are available 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.440
 of the pieces I need so let's move on 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.210
 the cpi then we move on handcuffs 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.020
 here and I'm doing the car I then have 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.180
 used with franklin and I'm still using e 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.680
 without having changed it anymore because 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.500
 they really become polites 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.830
 hallucinating fiat is hallucinating 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.340
 then the grids so choose the one 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.330
 which you prefer that you have available 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.520
 exactly you should do this thing 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.040
 after the blow to the bank so that it is 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.080
 franklin that michael or any 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.570
 player you wanted to do with 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.280
 so on the contrary then it has enough 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.390
 money to do it because the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.900
 machine modifications are 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.659
 very expensive doctor for this machine 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.630
 they are active in sony it seems from 20 and 30 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.310
 mila but I remember for that for a 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.670
 another car that had gone shopping 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.590
 around 80 thousand baal sailing nearby 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.030
 then sweet with xenon and plaques 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.630
 you must also change the horn 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.130
 so don't make the mistake of leaving 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.200
 a little bit because you don't like it 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.960
 changed everything then to the limit it 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.409
 reported as was then the colors of the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.110
 car possible choice between or park 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.520
 according to me the best chrome that there is 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:10.379
 one metallic and metallic colors 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.800
 normal in my opinion and i spa parks that 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:17.600
 you had a shocking way you see it 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.150
 she was so crazy 2 white so after 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.830
 the security keys I recommend 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.440
 add is also the strips 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.510
 because I don't think you want the ministers not 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.050
 pay for it on and for the windows and bol 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.680
 ok, customized miniskirts in 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.870
 carbon 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.370
 the eight always with themselves personalized 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.490
 because I learned that it fills in 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.280
 carbon machine means not having 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:46.540
 plus the color we like spoiler or 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:48.590
 back from tamarro suspensions 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.230
 useless suspensions also to increase 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.280
 machine statistics 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.960
 very useful for transmission 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.050
 machine statistics in fact you have 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:01.550
 an implementation at maximum speed 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:04.550
 remarkable turbo wheels and here you have to do 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.070
 both role types and accessories for 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.930
 wheels is the color of the wheels therefore 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.330
 be very careful with these things 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.910
 don't make the mistake of maybe making one e 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.290
 leave the type of wheels or accessory 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.550
 you have to do every single thing 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:25.640
 so as you can see also here wide 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:27.489
 tuning choice and lowrider muscle tip 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.459
 truly a chance for stuff 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.980
 hallucinating then made the color of 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.500
 rims obviously the one that you most 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.780
 garba of that was not how I see 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.890
 I left it almost normal gray 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.050
 because an assent short here are the 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.780
 tires you have to smoke and also the 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.720
 custom or bulletproof tires 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.540
 what you prefer are the same thing 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.330
 from smoke then I put the blog comic 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.860
 put the bulletproof tires and also 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.370
 personalized because the writing of 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.650
 next to very cool then the 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.080
 window colors slightly 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.209
 obscured va well not that it changes then 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.750
 who knows what 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:14.180
 once you play from the holy cast 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.640
 you will have type 5 seconds pause and then yes 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.419
 he will block the dinghy there he is there 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.419
 we see as a person too
