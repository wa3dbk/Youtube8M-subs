our<00:02:01.700> special<00:02:02.210> attack<00:02:02.450> but<00:02:02.690> I<00:02:02.720> really<00:02:03.080> would

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
our special attack but I really would

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.930 
our special attack but I really would
just<00:02:03.440> rather<00:02:03.770> you<00:02:03.890> surf<00:02:04.250> this<00:02:04.490> it<00:02:04.759> has<00:02:04.910> a

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
just rather you surf this it has a

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.180 
just rather you surf this it has a
little<00:02:05.300> bit<00:02:05.390> more<00:02:05.540> power<00:02:05.690> points<00:02:06.200> and<00:02:06.380> I

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
little bit more power points and I

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.770 
little bit more power points and I
