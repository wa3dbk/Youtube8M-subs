Touch speaker mod that I little video I

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.030 
Touch speaker mod that I little video I
made<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:11.599> this<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.780> actually<00:00:12.960> like<00:00:13.320> almost

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
made the this is actually like almost

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.029 
made the this is actually like almost
retarded<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:15.210> make<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:16.080> say<00:00:16.260> because<00:00:16.770> like

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
retarded to make to say because like

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.929 
retarded to make to say because like
pretty<00:00:17.940> much<00:00:18.000> take<00:00:18.359> two<00:00:18.840> speakers<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.939> hook

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
pretty much take two speakers and hook

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.590 
pretty much take two speakers and hook
it<00:00:21.090> up<00:00:21.240> there<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.810> put<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> little<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:23.600> little

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
it up there I put a little a little

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.359 
it up there I put a little a little
silicone<00:00:25.170> sealant<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.890> wouldn't<00:00:26.160> come<00:00:26.340> off

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
silicone sealant so it wouldn't come off

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.550 
silicone sealant so it wouldn't come off
there<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.330> can<00:00:27.480> see<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.810> little<00:00:27.960> elf<00:00:28.230> or

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
there you can see it a little elf or

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.870 
there you can see it a little elf or
left<00:00:28.800> speaker<00:00:29.390> connects<00:00:30.390> there<00:00:30.689> then<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.260> just

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
left speaker connects there then I just

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.880 
left speaker connects there then I just
hook<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.059> up<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> three<00:00:34.200> wires<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.739> there

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
hook this up to the three wires in there

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.049 
hook this up to the three wires in there
there's<00:00:35.190> another<00:00:35.460> one<00:00:35.670> that's<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> right

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
there's another one that's the right

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.180 
there's another one that's the right
speaker<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:39.200> yeah<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.410> just<00:00:40.500> that's<00:00:41.070> just

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
speaker and yeah it's just that's just

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.840 
speaker and yeah it's just that's just
about<00:00:41.579> it

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
about it

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.540 
about it
and<00:00:42.620> for<00:00:43.620> making<00:00:43.770> like<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.309> little

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
and for making like the little

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.270 
and for making like the little
connection<00:00:45.480> from<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.140> four<00:00:46.500> wires<00:00:46.800> coming

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
connection from the four wires coming

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.410 
connection from the four wires coming
from<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.489> speaker's<00:00:48.050> to<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.200> three<00:00:49.469> wires

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
from the speaker's to the three wires

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.670 
from the speaker's to the three wires
going<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.719> here<00:00:51.930> because<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.350> know<00:00:52.469> they're

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
going in here because you know they're

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.630 
going in here because you know they're
like<00:00:52.800> three<00:00:53.180> little<00:00:54.180> connectors<00:00:54.600> there<00:00:55.640> you

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
like three little connectors there you

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.540 
like three little connectors there you
have<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.910> find<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.329> common<00:00:58.050> like<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> common

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
have to find the common like a common

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.029 
have to find the common like a common
wire<00:01:00.270> like<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> common<00:01:01.079> base<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.739> know<00:01:01.859> like

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
wire like a common base you know like

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.789 
wire like a common base you know like
the<00:01:02.160> negative<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.879> that's<00:01:03.809> usually<00:01:04.110> this

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the negative and that's usually this

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.580 
the negative and that's usually this
ring<00:01:05.580> down<00:01:05.939> here<00:01:06.119> at<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.299> very<00:01:06.330> last<00:01:06.689> one<00:01:06.930> you

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
ring down here at the very last one you

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.950 
ring down here at the very last one you
see<00:01:07.799> right<00:01:08.100> there<00:01:08.240> you<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.420> have<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.720> like

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
see right there you just have to like

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.640 
see right there you just have to like
figure<00:01:10.350> out<00:01:10.549> you<00:01:11.549> have<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.790> somehow<00:01:12.000> test

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
figure out you have to somehow test

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.249 
figure out you have to somehow test
which<00:01:13.650> way<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.240> which<00:01:15.240> wire<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.630> connects<00:01:15.990> in

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
which way it which wire it connects in

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.330 
which way it which wire it connects in
here<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.650> then<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:17.960> solder<00:01:18.960> or<00:01:19.409> just

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
here and then you just solder or just

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.840 
here and then you just solder or just
wrap<00:01:20.549> around<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.119> two<00:01:21.930> wires<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.700> wires

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
wrap around the two wires to the wires

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.240 
wrap around the two wires to the wires
coming<00:01:24.150> from<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> speakers<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:25.140> there<00:01:25.350> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
coming from the speakers in there and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.390 
coming from the speakers in there and
then<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:26.850> solder<00:01:27.659> together<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:29.280> other

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
then you just solder together the other

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.850 
then you just solder together the other
two<00:01:29.640> wires<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.150> each<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:31.229> other<00:01:31.350> two<00:01:31.590> pins

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
two wires to each of the other two pins

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.069 
two wires to each of the other two pins
like<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.820> one<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.150> tip<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.479> usually<00:01:33.869> is

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
like the one on the tip is usually is

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.469 
like the one on the tip is usually is
left<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.460> middle<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.270> right

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
left and one in the middle is the right

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.710 
left and one in the middle is the right
channel<00:01:37.520> so<00:01:38.520> yeah<00:01:38.729> that's<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.119> about<00:01:39.450> it

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
channel so yeah that's just about it

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.880 
channel so yeah that's just about it
and<00:01:40.759> one<00:01:41.759> other<00:01:41.880> thing<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.990> speakers<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.590> used

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and one other thing the speakers I used

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.410 
and one other thing the speakers I used
on<00:01:44.250> here<00:01:44.579> like<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.939> said<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> video

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
on here like I said in the video

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
that I had actually two razors that I

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.190 
that I had actually two razors that I
got<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.890> they<00:01:53.579> were<00:01:53.700> broken<00:01:54.450> well<00:01:55.049> actually

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
got that they were broken well actually

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.420 
got that they were broken well actually
they<00:01:55.470> broke<00:01:55.710> later

unfortunately so these speakers are

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.350 
unfortunately so these speakers are
actually<00:02:00.360> way<00:02:00.659> more<00:02:00.899> powerful<00:02:01.290> than<00:02:01.530> any

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
actually way more powerful than any
