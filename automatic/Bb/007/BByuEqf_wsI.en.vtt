need<00:01:46.299> to<00:01:46.479> remove<00:01:46.719> the<00:01:46.899> back<00:01:47.049> cover<00:01:47.079> in<00:01:47.439> order

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
need to remove the back cover in order

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.130 
need to remove the back cover in order
to<00:01:47.770> apply<00:01:47.979> this<00:01:48.100> LG<00:01:49.030> quick<00:01:49.270> circle<00:01:49.659> case<00:01:49.899> and

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
to apply this LG quick circle case and

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.870 
to apply this LG quick circle case and
this<00:01:50.619> is<00:01:50.770> how<00:01:50.890> it<00:01:50.979> looked<00:01:51.159> like<00:01:51.280> it<00:01:51.460> does<00:01:51.670> have

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
this is how it looked like it does have

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.300 
this is how it looked like it does have
NFC<00:01:52.179> chip<00:01:52.569> is<00:01:52.780> fill<00:01:53.020> inside<00:01:53.439> and<00:01:53.649> this<00:01:54.069> is<00:01:54.189> how

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
NFC chip is fill inside and this is how

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.239 
NFC chip is fill inside and this is how
it<00:01:54.429> will<00:01:54.579> cover<00:01:54.880> it<00:01:55.090> completely<00:01:55.569> and<00:01:56.319> this<00:01:57.039> one

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:57.249 
it will cover it completely and this one

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:59.370 
it will cover it completely and this one
is<00:01:57.429> golden<00:01:57.850> in<00:01:57.969> color<00:01:58.210> so<00:01:58.420> it<00:01:58.569> will<00:01:58.929> give<00:01:59.109> you<00:01:59.229> a

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
of feedback you are looking for you have

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.059 
of feedback you are looking for you have

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
the camera the laser focus is also not

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:21.860 
the camera the laser focus is also not
blocked

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
blocked

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.390 
blocked
you<00:02:21.900> do<00:02:22.019> not<00:02:22.170> have<00:02:22.379> any<00:02:22.590> blockage<00:02:23.010> for<00:02:23.159> the<00:02:23.250> LED

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
you do not have any blockage for the LED

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.430 
you do not have any blockage for the LED
flashes<00:02:24.060> till<00:02:24.239> it<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.450> having<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.870> dual<00:02:25.170> LED

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
flashes till it is having a dual LED

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.410 
flashes till it is having a dual LED
flash<00:02:25.590> on<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.430> front<00:02:26.610> we<00:02:26.730> can<00:02:26.819> see<00:02:27.090> there<00:02:27.269> is<00:02:27.360> a

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
flash on the front we can see there is a

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.360 
flash on the front we can see there is a
proper<00:02:27.599> cut<00:02:27.870> out<00:02:27.989> for<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.260> 80s<00:02:28.620> there<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:29.340> a

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
proper cut out for the 80s there is a

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.030 
proper cut out for the 80s there is a
proper<00:02:29.700> cut<00:02:30.030> out<00:02:30.180> over<00:02:30.420> here<00:02:30.569> for<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.959> front<00:02:31.860> I

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
proper cut out over here for the front I

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.830 
proper cut out over here for the front I
think<00:02:32.519> it<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.640> for<00:02:32.879> the<00:02:32.970> proximity<00:02:33.239> sensor<00:02:33.450> so

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
think it is for the proximity sensor so

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.199 
think it is for the proximity sensor so
you<00:02:33.930> can<00:02:34.080> actually<00:02:34.200> take<00:02:34.500> calls<00:02:34.769> with<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.209> on

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
you can actually take calls with this on

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.930 
you can actually take calls with this on
so<00:02:36.750> one<00:02:37.349> other<00:02:38.159> things<00:02:38.430> which<00:02:38.549> you<00:02:38.640> can<00:02:38.790> do

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
so one other things which you can do

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.430 
so one other things which you can do
with<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:39.209> particular<00:02:39.390> flip<00:02:39.930> cover<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.260> that

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
with this particular flip cover is that

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.259 
with this particular flip cover is that
you<00:02:40.590> can<00:02:40.709> also<00:02:40.860> take<00:02:41.310> voice<00:02:41.610> calls<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:42.000> in<00:02:42.090> case

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
you can also take voice calls so in case

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.030 
you can also take voice calls so in case
you<00:02:42.390> are<00:02:42.420> taking<00:02:42.750> we<00:02:43.079> are<00:02:43.260> getting<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.590> call<00:02:43.769> you

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
you are taking we are getting a call you

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.250 
you are taking we are getting a call you
can<00:02:44.159> actually<00:02:44.280> reject<00:02:44.849> or<00:02:45.000> answer<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.079> call

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
can actually reject or answer the call

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.990 
can actually reject or answer the call
directly<00:02:46.620> from<00:02:46.709> here<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.190> can<00:02:47.220> do<00:02:47.519> that<00:02:47.700> and

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
directly from here you can do that and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.569 
directly from here you can do that and
you<00:02:48.360> can<00:02:48.510> also<00:02:48.659> play<00:02:49.079> music<00:02:49.500> as<00:02:49.650> well<00:02:49.799> so<00:02:50.250> the

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
you can also play music as well so the

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.369 
you can also play music as well so the
music<00:02:50.940> visit<00:02:51.390> will<00:02:51.540> also<00:02:51.840> come<00:02:52.049> in<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.200> circular

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
music visit will also come in a circular

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:53.930 
music visit will also come in a circular
way<00:02:52.709> with<00:02:52.980> which<00:02:53.159> you<00:02:53.250> can<00:02:53.370> control<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.849> music

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
way with which you can control the music

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.240 
way with which you can control the music
you<00:02:54.450> can<00:02:54.599> also<00:02:54.750> go<00:02:55.079> across<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:55.620> photos<00:02:56.069> which

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
you can also go across the photos which

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.910 
you can also go across the photos which
are<00:02:56.400> there<00:02:56.579> in<00:02:56.609> the<00:02:57.060> gallery<00:02:57.569> so<00:02:57.829> apart<00:02:58.829> from

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
are there in the gallery so apart from

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.860 
are there in the gallery so apart from
this<00:02:59.129> you<00:02:59.190> can<00:02:59.310> also<00:02:59.519> track<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.209> LG<00:03:00.690> health
