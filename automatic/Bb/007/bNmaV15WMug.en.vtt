00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.420
 are not like in this video you bens in the 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.610
 make plasticine yourselves at home 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.590
 You will see that it is very simple and 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.790
 materials that should be used are all 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.099
 ingredients that we can find in 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.150
 house so then we can do that 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.579
 with children nothing will happen 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.410
 while they are doing it while 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:25.270
 play that if you put it in your mouth it 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.430
 It's doing damage as you see it is very 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.349
 well it is very manageable we can do 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.759
 Churros in all the ways we want 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.460
 and nothing now let's see the materials 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.230
 and see how it's done I hope you like it 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.010
 to do what we're going to need a 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.350
 cup of flour then a quarter cup 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.280
 of salt is worth 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.940
 a spoonful of oil 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.440
 and then the dyes that we want 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.530
 These are vegetable colorants to sell 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.570
 in any store supermarket for 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.719
 Color cakes so they are good if 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.430
 they will not be toxic to children 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.650
 we will also put a quarter cup of 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.270
 Water 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.120
 to begin what we are going to do 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.370
 let's put the flour inside a 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.900
 container to be able to stir well if 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.010
 you want to know more quantity because you have 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.760
 that double the amounts that I have 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.320
 saying 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.670
 so much if we want to do more we could 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.010
 put the tacos instead of a quarter 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.300
 cup of salt we could put half of 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.860
 the lid 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.630
 what we are going to do now is put salt 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.150
 the room we put because if the children 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.640
 they eat some plasticine they have a 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.680
 so very salty flavor then do not want 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.340
 to repeat for the fact because it is 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:37.200
 basically because of this a quarter 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.939
 of such farce and now that we move a little 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.220
 once we have removed things in the 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.690
 flour 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.030
 we put inside 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.300
 inside the cup of water half of the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.300
 Cup 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.510
 also from the cup and stir 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.980
 we progress inside and we will remove first 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.270
 with the spoon of little we will be the hands 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.270
 and knead we have been in this passion 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.619
 once we've heard it with the spoon 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.660
 we take it out we can put a little bit of 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.500
 flour over where we're going to go more 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.830
 face and we are kneading to get the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.430
 mass that we want 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.430
 all right 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.650
 and now we have the base what we're going to 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.680
 do is put it with a spoonful of 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.480
 oil a little to how slow of this 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.480
 way we will remove the bandage that has 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.900
 we see how we have the drink at half 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.680
 power 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:45.150
 we put and then we will put a little 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.150
 less than 1 tablespoon of oil 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.760
 and as we see here well 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.519
 and we are going to remove 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.879
 we could use our hands too if 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.780
 we want and we'll leave it here for a while and 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.780
 while we are going to chew 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.670
 so we can use our hands too 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.099
 once we have the mass as we see here 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.439
 we will cut I will cut in three 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.520
 pieces to do it with different 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.350
 colors 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.170
 and like I said we have the colors 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.150
 I have I have the blue red and the 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.100
 yellow and what I recommend is that 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.740
 you go putting little by little 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.030
 we put a little hole and 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.580
 we put for example let's start with 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.480
 the blue and then we will remove if 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.330
 we see that it takes a little more 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.950
 color we put more 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.270
 but the truth is that putting a little 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.270
 It will be enough 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.730
 I have made 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.730
 and now I'm going to remove 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:08.240
 here we have removed well but I'm going 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.240
 to put a little more color 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.850
 it is better to do it little by little as I have 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.850
 saying 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.130
 let's see it 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.550
 well here and finished seeing 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.080
 put the color we see the color that has 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.080
 acquired already looks very good 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.760
 It is a clear blue that I have thrown 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:45.080
 more or less this mixture of saunas 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.610
 between 6 and 8 drops of blue dye and nothing 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.290
 also depending on the type of dye 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.510
 we have to put more or less color 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.130
 let's clean all the hands like 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.550
 we have dirty and we will do the other two 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.130
 balls 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.440
 well here we have a result we see 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.150
 that has been very good is very manageable 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.580
 we can make a tree to whatever we want 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.990
 and especially enjoy with children 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.340
 this craft is perfect as it is to 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.380
 principle to play with children already 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.750
 you will see what is happening and doing 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.700
 colors have a great time 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.310
 if you can not find the colors you are looking for 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.460
 you can combine colors with a rod 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.440
 to make green or similar things 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.140
 so I hope that if anything needs 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.320
 our youtube.com page and up 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.320
 soon
