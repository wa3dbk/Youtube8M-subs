 and this is how it looks now in the corridors 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.699
 and the pool is in months 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.859

 a weekend in the hotel every year 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.949
 This was noticed that there are fewer every year 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.289
 but there were hardly any guests 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.300
 was still invested to offer static 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.449

 previous owner worked by the receiver 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.369
 he was asked to keep an eye on things 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.530
 hold 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.689

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.900

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.649
 it is also necessary because it is 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.720
 of course through the years 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.829
 almost nothing in the last 10 years 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.810

 4-star establishment
