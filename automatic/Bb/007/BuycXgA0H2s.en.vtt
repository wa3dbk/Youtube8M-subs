00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.970
 in a historical investigation I really am 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.130
 first-hand sources are very important 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.980
 ie being able to work on multiple texts 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.380
 possible ancient ones are the most 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.210
 coming to the events that tell the most 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.420
 away from any errors due to 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.640
 transcriptions and reworkings 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.739
 the philological image in fact often 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.870
 part to highlight last differences 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.140
 between the original texts and the transcriptions 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:48.170
 successive mauro biglino expert 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.300
 connoisseur of the arms he studied from 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.760
 literal point of view the code 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.440
 the work is more evident 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.660
 ancient recognized by the church 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.300
 Catholic as a reference for the 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.070
 drafting of the old testament 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.430
 without wanting to treat them in any way 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.320
 wait for theological interpretations 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.729
 which are absolutely not among the 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.320
 our skills 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.500
 we go after to flee with him i 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.200
 surprising results of his studies 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.539
 to interview him an already known face of the 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.539
 strained left recent paul chick 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.260
 then, good evening, we are all here 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.510
 at the esoteric library of mind 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.000
 via garibaldi to torino our dress 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.940
 tonight and mauro biglino scholar 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.630
 of the old testament translator of ben 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:39.560
 17 versions of the Masoretic text that the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.580
 text on which its translation is based 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.160
 of the bible 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.460
 the news and discoveries that mauro has 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.600
 done within these these texts 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.680
 these considered sacred by religion 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.830
 they are unbelievable 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.580
 and tonight we are here to do it 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.860
 unraveling the question for mauro is what 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:07.950
 we discovered inside these 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:11.520
 texts discovered and say what we have 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.020
 in short, it is actually like 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.220
 say very long not because I am 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.010
 obviously a lot of things emerged 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.100
 we say that in essence so at least 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.410
 summarize what emerges from 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.030
 literal translation of the text 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.260
 masoretic of the Masoretic code of 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.160
 leningrad than that from which 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.530
 they basically depend 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.260
 all the bibles we have at home that 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.250
 that emerges with some clarity is that 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.080
 the bible does not speak of god 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.690
 the bible is not the old testament not 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.520
 the ancient is a book of religion 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.350
 Testament is one of the many books that 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.440
 humanity wrote in the course of his 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.190
 history is that it tells us precisely the 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.440
 affair of the relationship between a people and a 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.920
 group of individuals 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.390
 even better between a people and a 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.540
 individual belonging to a group of 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.100
 individuals from there then obviously cascading 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.870
 all the rest comes but maybe we'll have 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.850
 way to talk about it then the text 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.160
 masoretic of leningrad the text on which 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.260
 the official translation of 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.160
 bible but this text is definitely not 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.070
 the first of the Jewish tradition which 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.660
 kind of texts precede it and what kind of 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.490
 language 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.680
 the former used to write it e 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.960
 above all what is written is 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.100
 absolutely certain in the translation 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.680
 modern 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.140
 mauro then we say this that the 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.630
 leningrad code the code that is 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.390
 was defined by the maso networks that is dai 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.290
 so-called custodians of tradition among 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.209
 the sixth and ninth century after Christ 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.130
 so let's say that among the biblical codes 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.830
 and I could define it the last that is the 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.480
 more modern and obviously it was 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.250
 preceded by a whole series of others 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.130
 part codes of which were 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.410
 found to with ram rolls of the sea 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.080
 died been preceded by the version 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.230
 Greek of the 70 there is the famous follow yours 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.480
 come and then what we have 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.920
 which is what we then say is 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.600
 become a bit of a reference point 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.330
 official even if in the last ones 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.430
 translation is now also used 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.200
 that is, other codes are compared 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.640
 but let's say that represents a 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.720
 little bit the reference point of 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.970
 all the bibles we have at home 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.710
 to say that that is the certain code 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.810
 secure code the code that contains the 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.210
 truth is absolutely impossible indeed 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.490
 I would say that it is easier to say the opposite 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.680
 in the sense that it is the code on which 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.150
 Jewish theologians have worked before and 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.720
 then theologians also worked 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.700
 Christians and therefore is a code 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.360
 strongly conditioned by ideologies 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.340
 and certainly from the theologies it is more 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.890
 the codes are likely to be more true 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.550
 plus the oldest codes 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:55.220
 I'm using this use this because it is 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.290
 the code instead defined that as 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.890
 say the real one officially 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.560
 so to speak inspired inspired by god 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:06.170
 the bible and in short the old must be 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.300
 Testament is one of the most written books 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:11.750
 rewritten deleted amendments 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.610
 implemented officially disappeared 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.200
 findings of writings that exist in the 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.090
 history of humanity 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.400
 so much so that at some point I own 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.990
 they felt the need to put a 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.910
 fixed point 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.860
 there were various schools including precisely 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.930
 this school of farmed tiberias nets 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.960
 there was the Babylonian school the school 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.360
 Palestinian the Samaritan school that a 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.640
 as if to say they were competing for 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.100
 control of the code and therefore of the 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.290
 significant please say we are 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.930
 sets this school tiberi hanks and la 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.970
 farm school tiberiade nets and 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.370
 so we have this so it is 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.320
 one of the possible bibles for example 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.880
 among these the torah of the maso networks ie 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.070
 then the pentateuch the first five 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.810
 Old Testament Books and the Torah 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.180
 There are at least two thousand Samaritans 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.580
 variants 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.470
 between the torah of the nets and the structure 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.139
 ie adding the Greek version there are 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.370
 at least a thousand variations 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.860
 so actually us with the bible 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.509
 we can pretend 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.490
 that is, we can pretend that the things that 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:12.910
 are written are true they wanted 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.440
 really tell us what it certainly becomes 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.180
 difficult from my point of view 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.100
 basically almost impossible 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.690
 to obtain absolute truths 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.250
 also because the bible the bbc authors 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.370
 they didn't take care of this like I have 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.660
 said before the bible does not speak of god 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.520
 does not talk with how to say about the god 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.340
 transcendental universal et cetera 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.310
 It does not care in any way is 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.259
 was then made to become that 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.840
 character of which the Bible speaks was 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:40.330
 then made to become the god of the god 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.400
 of religion but it was not so for the 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.699
 then authors for the biblical authors 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.470
 when dealing with a biblical code 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:49.900
 it is done being aware of the fact 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:54.130
 that deals with one of the bibles 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.900
 possible but certainly not of that how 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.520
 surely say not of what it is 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.380
 was originally written 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.080
 so much so that in Jerusalem hebrew 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:05.050
 university in 1958 started a 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.639
 project that is called bible 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:10.660
 project that he managed by the teachers 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:14.140
 Jewish university students who have the goal 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:16.090
 for groped to rebuild a bible 

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.670
 as close as possible to the one written in 

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:21.610
 original that nobody knows what they are 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:23.650
 now working precisely from 1958 year 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:26.920
 a forecast of working time of 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:30.300
 another 150 years, that is, two were given 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:34.080
 centuries and therefore between 150 years more or less 

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:36.460
 we might have a bible or a pack 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.720
 perhaps close to what it was 

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.230
 written originally but none 

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.230
 save
