00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.930 
inside of the universe of star citizen
obviously<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:44.129> don't<00:00:44.250> actually<00:00:44.460> know<00:00:44.760> how

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
obviously we don't actually know how

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.369 
obviously we don't actually know how
it's<00:00:45.090> going<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.329> fly<00:00:45.539> or<00:00:45.809> how<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.050> gonna<00:00:46.140> you

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
it's going to fly or how it's gonna you

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.560 
it's going to fly or how it's gonna you
know<00:00:46.530> dogfight<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.879> haven't<00:00:48.120> had<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.270> chance<00:00:48.329> to

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
know dogfight we haven't had a chance to

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.790 
know dogfight we haven't had a chance to
experience<00:00:48.930> any<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.230> those<00:00:49.350> things<00:00:49.530> because

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
experience any of those things because

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.340 
experience any of those things because
simply<00:00:50.579> because<00:00:50.850> we<00:00:50.969> can't<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.899> game<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.230> just

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
simply because we can't the game is just

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.220 
simply because we can't the game is just
too<00:00:52.590> early<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:53.239> but<00:00:54.239> what<00:00:54.360> we<00:00:54.480> can<00:00:54.629> do<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.989> we

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
too early on but what we can do is we

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.290 
too early on but what we can do is we
can<00:00:55.260> look<00:00:55.620> at<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.890> ship<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:57.000> look<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.180> as<00:00:57.270> a

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
can look at it ship we can look it as a

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.520 
can look at it ship we can look it as a
ship<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.780> look<00:00:57.840> at<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> way<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.170> shaped

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
ship we can look at the way it shaped

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.709 
ship we can look at the way it shaped
the<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.430> amount<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.940> people<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.390> can<00:01:00.539> hold

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the the amount of people that I can hold

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.260 
the the amount of people that I can hold
inside<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.289> guns<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.829> has<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.969> size

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
inside the guns that it has and the size

inside the guns that it has and the size
of<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.719> we<00:01:03.780> can<00:01:03.930> speculate<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.619> how<00:01:05.010> people

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
of it and we can speculate on how people

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.179 
of it and we can speculate on how people
will<00:01:06.180> use<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.689> ship<00:01:06.990> when<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> game<00:01:07.920> goes

will use this ship when the game goes
live<00:01:08.580> hell<00:01:08.939> even<00:01:08.970> how<00:01:09.420> people<00:01:09.930> will<00:01:10.020> use<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
live hell even how people will use the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.690 
live hell even how people will use the
ship<00:01:10.500> when<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> dogfighting<00:01:11.130> module<00:01:11.369> goes

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.660 
big things to me that's the sort of
thing<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.989> hidden<00:02:46.200> card<00:02:46.860> trick<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.250> magic

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
thing the hidden card trick the magic

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.900 
thing the hidden card trick the magic
trick<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.569> Avenger<00:02:48.989> has<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:50.700> fact

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
trick that the Avenger has is the fact

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.030 
trick that the Avenger has is the fact
that<00:02:51.000> while<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.599> is<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.690> single-seater<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.500> is

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
that while it is a single-seater it is

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.289 
that while it is a single-seater it is
it's<00:02:53.340> small<00:02:53.819> you<00:02:53.970> know<00:02:54.060> it's<00:02:54.150> not<00:02:54.239> the

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
it's small you know it's not the

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.089 
it's small you know it's not the
smallest<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.900> ships<00:02:55.200> I'm<00:02:55.680> sure<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:55.920> won't<00:02:55.980> be

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
smallest of ships I'm sure it won't be

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.130 
smallest of ships I'm sure it won't be
the<00:02:56.160> quickest<00:02:56.640> but<00:02:56.819> it's<00:02:56.940> it's<00:02:57.150> more<00:02:57.690> compact

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
the quickest but it's it's more compact

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.589 
the quickest but it's it's more compact
and<00:02:58.410> if<00:02:59.370> we<00:02:59.489> come<00:02:59.640> around<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.880> back<00:03:00.060> here<00:03:00.390> we

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
and if we come around the back here we

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.839 
and if we come around the back here we
have<00:03:00.870> these<00:03:01.019> four<00:03:01.079> bays<00:03:01.829> these<00:03:02.340> four<00:03:02.579> sleep

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
have these four bays these four sleep

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.819 
have these four bays these four sleep
phase<00:03:03.120> which<00:03:03.959> can<00:03:04.110> also<00:03:04.230> be<00:03:04.349> used<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.650> carry

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
phase which can also be used to carry

friendlies you know we can have enemies
in<00:03:06.540> there<00:03:06.660> we<00:03:06.780> can<00:03:06.900> lock<00:03:07.110> them<00:03:07.349> down<00:03:07.560> we<00:03:08.040> can

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
in there we can lock them down we can

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.830 
in there we can lock them down we can
have<00:03:08.370> friendly<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.819> just<00:03:09.090> simply<00:03:09.329> using<00:03:09.690> them

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
have friendly is just simply using them

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.020 
have friendly is just simply using them
to<00:03:10.170> be<00:03:10.290> transported<00:03:10.799> in<00:03:11.310> which<00:03:11.519> case<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.880> now
