00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:07.580
 Yes Here is the very first place of the sequence Let's take a look at the I series is 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.600
 The most basic part 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:17.750
 You can not understand why the king has not got the basics 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:24.050
 Another but are you doing to study a little ne sequence also whether the year q 1 to learn the first time sequence from today because 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:27.600
 I don't know only the official or that kind of person by the way 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:32.930
 Let's check again from the beginning , including the meaning 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.930
 That's where the number sequence is like this 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:42.770
 A series of numbers like 13579 is called a sequence 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.910
 There are regularities, as you can see here, which is usually the problem sequence 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.910
 For example, if say in this 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:56.220
 You're are shifted by the whole and say do you increase by Nanbo 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:59.850
 It will have problems with this kind of rule line is treated as a few problems 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:04.230
 How to count the number of rezas is decided 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.260
 After this or saying third this by people year is confusing and or say whether the five names 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:10.280
 Trying to unify the units 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:16.520
 This is the sequence 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:18.750
 Use the Hoten I'm kind of naming it like a 5 th in Reference first four now in single-necked eyes 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:25.230
 If you are called like that 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:27.630
 So please take care of it, for example the sequence of this 149625 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.370
 What is the 4th school ? 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.040
 The fourth said is 16 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:38.370
 Comfortable 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:44.850
 The number of five schools eyes were bitter gourd is Nangang sound Te 9 or say Sutte at 25 appraisal after saying what is or 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:47.430
 Please make sure to check that the old school is the 3rd school or something like that 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.020
 It's not difficult until here 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:56.870
 Little by little from this side 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:02:04.220
 Because I'm something becomes confusing become official North and let's by all means by all means re-confirmation 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:06.350
 In this general public n How difficult is this general public 's expression only where the number sequence of where 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.729
 Will follow to the end of 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.780
 So firmly the idea of the general public 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.940
 Let's master here 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.620
 If you say that there is no general public , you want to know if you say it with a great pop expression 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.780
 I want a corner 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.290
 I like to teach you that 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.770
 So I think what a little confusing is elaborate Let's look at an example of this 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:35.850
 For example, General Koe's is said to be after such a formula 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:39.060
 We elaborate general I say this'm place for a to the teeth of 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.530
 It is this general ー ー not to say how to try this 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.770
 I say that the previous two rides 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:53.540
 It is a formula that tells you the corner zone you want to know 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:55.380
 In other words, if we thought we knew the first school in this sequence, we thought here that n = 1 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.020
 Please substitute and 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.590
 Is such a city Nijo? 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:09.550
 If you want to know it is one that is 1 th 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:12.269
 One day When two or more places in the Resona me to assign a value to this tells us with'm 1 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.269
 It is a formula 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:23.120
 For example, What Go or more are also substituted in here Tara hurt the aim of intention to person 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:26.299
 I'm 4 calculated and the value of the two schools first seen 4 and the 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.360
 Expression that tells us you know compete with this kind of wind 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.770
 That's a general corner 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.840
 By the way 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.620
 There is no sweetness in the first place in this sequence of lines, and everyone is expressed in the style of almost writing 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.100
 Nde and 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:50.300
 One school day because Please give dating 9 This also is where important and say princes 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:55.480
 And, for example, if such a lord and he express in mathematics a 1 or 2 schools ap 2 or 3 schools 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.480
 Also is important point but be sounded to Fu say as 3 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:06.410
 Well, for example, if you want to use the same 43 as you wanted to refer to, you can see the old with 34 or more 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.890
 Are you sure you want to express to what kind of wind this time If you want to know profound 3 You have one more practice 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:13.410
 10 schools eyes 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:14.370
 I wanted to know 10 schools. I put 10 here and the way of expression is 10 schools is like a permanent residence. 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.590
 I write 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:22.770
 The 10th school of a has the same value as the square in the last 20's . 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.800
 100 Te understand or smoked and that will be long 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.150
 It is such a meaning This is a general term 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.449
 ok 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:37.240
 So this problem 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:38.580
 The first term to the fifth term of n = 2 / n -3 and this also means that white has this problem 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:45.990
 If you understand 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:48.780
 Can you'll I archive one school day without any problem by substituting the now 1 to express the wind Tteyuu 1 brother shadow 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:54.360
 You can see -1 in 1-3 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:55.560
 Similarly, even the second school is expressed in a 29 style, and it is ranked 1st in the lower part of the people here in the kneader 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.569
 You know I 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:04.680
 It is same with the ace according to the 33rd subject 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:08.479
 34 th is calculated after the one is also the same for the same high school girl 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.340
 Will complete answer in the wind I mean network 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:15.560
 That is positive 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:19.699
 The sequence of -3 to this anh country is specifically written like this 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.320
 It goes on to Fu I mean Nana' -11 vol. 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:24.249
 You know the number sequence 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.249
 And 

00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:30.899
 -1 Ai Takaaki 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:33.590
 Feeling three items like a four schools first is Takaaki's to 1 draft 

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:37.810
 -3 n school to this 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:43.180
 Like writing a sequence like this 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:46.389
 There are a lot of problems, so please be familiar with such expressions 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:52.720
 The meaning of this is minus 11357 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:55.220
 In general terms there is this kind of Fu in sequence and I n New Komeito is I'm low to the people in the wind a sequence Tteyuu 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:59.500
 If I hold it, I see 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.500
 This sequence is a general term 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:10.780
 You can cope with the problems in the future if you become aware that this kind of sequence is finished 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:16.689
 So I learned how to wear several lines here 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:18.230
 If there is a sequence of hardships or just a few lines, this is a problem only for those who are particularly regular. 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:23.690
 And it'll become 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:28.580
 In it's counting frozen in like a three way, such as after 2nd th counted in I try to write in particular 1 th 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:29.540
 Three schools eyes stew a flower archive say is also firmly holding the Tteyuu'll say like a US 5th 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.600
 Let's get up 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.950
 Because the general public is want corner I want to know their own 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.610
 It is a formula that will teach you 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:45.980
 This Hey Hey and so? Oh not'm think this more than what 's Kore 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:48.080
 If you go to the area where you are staying in the God chaos, you will know what the south port is and what the old days are 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:53.870
 Please understand that 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:57.110
 And when I saw something like this, I saw an elves in general Koe Otome 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:07:01.670
 It is also important to understand what it means 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:04.960
 After that you can find the ruler as you learn the feeling of a cat and do it with no hint 

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.960
 Let's practice well
