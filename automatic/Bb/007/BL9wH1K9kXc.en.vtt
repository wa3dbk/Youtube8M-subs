00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
but an easy way of doing it is measure

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.380 
but an easy way of doing it is measure
the<00:01:47.729> length<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.210> your<00:01:48.360> snake<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:50.610> length

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
and width of your terrarium should be a

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.270 
and width of your terrarium should be a
little<00:01:54.990> bit<00:01:55.170> longer<00:01:55.470> than<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.890> length<00:01:56.100> of

little bit longer than the length of
your<00:01:56.430> snake<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.600> there's<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.840> good<00:01:58.049> basic<00:01:58.619> rule

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
your snake so there's a good basic rule

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.620 
your snake so there's a good basic rule
on<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.399> size<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.880> terrarium<00:02:00.979> snakes<00:02:01.979> are

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
on the size of the terrarium snakes are

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.590 
on the size of the terrarium snakes are
ectothermic<00:02:04.130> they're<00:02:05.130> cold-blooded<00:02:05.479> so<00:02:06.479> they

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
ectothermic they're cold-blooded so they

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.270 
ectothermic they're cold-blooded so they
need<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.869> heat<00:02:07.110> themselves<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.950> warmer
