there's one thing I wanted to show you
before<00:00:06.880> we<00:00:07.180> started<00:00:07.839> planning<00:00:08.139> I<00:00:09.180> always<00:00:10.180> like

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:10.389 
before we started planning I always like

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.400 
before we started planning I always like
to<00:00:10.420> put<00:00:10.750> some<00:00:10.900> rock<00:00:11.170> in<00:00:11.200> the<00:00:12.010> base<00:00:12.219> of<00:00:12.580> the<00:00:12.699> pot

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
to put some rock in the base of the pot

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.240 
to put some rock in the base of the pot
it<00:00:14.410> gives<00:00:15.309> a<00:00:15.520> little<00:00:16.150> better<00:00:16.330> drainage<00:00:17.250> and

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
it gives a little better drainage and

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.370 
it gives a little better drainage and
I'm<00:00:18.400> using<00:00:18.609> white<00:00:18.910> decorated<00:00:19.600> rocks<00:00:19.870> so<00:00:20.170> it'd

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
we're going to stick grow lights under

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.909 
we're going to stick grow lights under
these<00:05:32.930> for<00:05:33.380> a<00:05:33.710> while<00:05:34.400> and<00:05:35.440> till<00:05:36.440> they<00:05:36.560> get<00:05:36.710> up

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
these for a while and till they get up

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.960 
these for a while and till they get up
and<00:05:37.160> going<00:05:38.380> so<00:05:39.380> that's<00:05:39.710> our<00:05:40.010> next<00:05:40.310> phase<00:05:40.550> of

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
and going so that's our next phase of

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.560 
and going so that's our next phase of
our<00:05:41.479> step<00:05:41.870> okay
