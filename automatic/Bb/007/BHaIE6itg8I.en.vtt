Chris Craft Cruiser wakes there and did
a<00:03:12.220> fantastic<00:03:12.430> job<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.239> sounded<00:03:13.690> like<00:03:13.780> there

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
a fantastic job it sounded like there

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.440 
a fantastic job it sounded like there
was<00:03:14.530> no<00:03:14.739> rattling<00:03:15.190> or<00:03:15.340> anything<00:03:15.549> what<00:03:16.209> would

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
was no rattling or anything what would

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.990 
was no rattling or anything what would
have<00:03:16.570> you<00:03:16.600> done<00:03:16.660> there<00:03:17.019> well<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:18.670> stringers

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
have you done there well the stringers

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.400 
have you done there well the stringers
in<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.180> boat<00:03:19.329> are<00:03:19.359> all<00:03:19.570> fiberglass<00:03:19.900> and

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
in the boat are all fiberglass and

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.280 
in the boat are all fiberglass and
they're<00:03:20.819> bonded<00:03:21.819> into<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.269> hull<00:03:22.480> and<00:03:22.780> then

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
they're bonded into the hull and then

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.750 
they're bonded into the hull and then
the<00:03:23.410> hull<00:03:23.560> is<00:03:23.680> bonded<00:03:24.069> to<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.280> deck<00:03:24.489> so

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
the hull is bonded to the deck so

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.729 
the hull is bonded to the deck so
essentially<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.569> boat<00:03:25.780> is<00:03:25.900> one<00:03:26.109> piece<00:03:26.440> and

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
essentially the boat is one piece and

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.160 
essentially the boat is one piece and
then<00:03:27.310> all<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.940> cavities<00:03:28.420> below<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.959> boat

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
then all the cavities below the boat

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.110 
then all the cavities below the boat
below<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.160> deck<00:03:30.400> are<00:03:30.640> filled<00:03:30.940> with

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
below the deck are filled with

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.810 
below the deck are filled with
closed-cell<00:03:31.870> structural<00:03:32.410> foam<00:03:32.620> which<00:03:33.579> has<00:03:33.790> a

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
closed-cell structural foam which has a

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.460 
closed-cell structural foam which has a
couple<00:03:34.060> of<00:03:34.209> benefits<00:03:34.359> one<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:35.019> makes<00:03:35.199> the<00:03:35.320> boat

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
couple of benefits one it makes the boat

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.720 
couple of benefits one it makes the boat
unsinkable<00:03:36.190> but<00:03:36.609> it<00:03:36.729> also<00:03:36.880> makes<00:03:37.209> it<00:03:37.329> very

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
unsinkable but it also makes it very

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.170 
unsinkable but it also makes it very
quiet<00:03:38.140> so<00:03:39.140> there's<00:03:39.680> no<00:03:39.830> waves<00:03:40.099> lap<00:03:40.430> nose<00:03:40.730> no
