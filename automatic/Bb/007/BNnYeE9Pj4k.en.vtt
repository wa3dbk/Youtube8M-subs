00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.740

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
is pretty steep country and just a

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.669 
is pretty steep country and just a
zigzagging<00:00:09.870> through<00:00:10.019> here<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:11.150> I<00:00:12.679> come

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
zigzagging through here and I come

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.609 
zigzagging through here and I come
through<00:00:14.599> come<00:00:15.599> through<00:00:15.809> this<00:00:15.960> next<00:00:16.199> thing<00:00:16.470> and

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
through come through this next thing and

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.470
