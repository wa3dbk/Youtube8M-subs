00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
so so that purple there could be purple

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.830 
so so that purple there could be purple
sorry<00:04:04.320> there's<00:04:05.320> another<00:04:05.620> one

know<00:04:13.959> what<00:04:14.170> it's<00:04:14.410> still<00:04:14.650> not<00:04:14.830> completely

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
know what it's still not completely

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.640 
know what it's still not completely
perfect<00:04:15.430> this<00:04:15.970> one<00:04:16.180> is<00:04:16.359> look<00:04:16.630> at<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:16.840> see<00:04:17.530> that

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650

on a purple that's on a purple and

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.610 
on a purple that's on a purple and
that's<00:04:27.070> on<00:04:27.220> a<00:04:27.250> white<00:04:27.490> face<00:04:28.050> when<00:04:29.050> I<00:04:29.140> still<00:04:29.440> have

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
that's on a white face when I still have

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.620 
that's on a white face when I still have
a<00:04:29.650> theory<00:04:30.130> nobody's<00:04:30.970> gonna<00:04:31.090> like<00:04:31.270> it<00:04:31.479> but

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
a theory nobody's gonna like it but

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.880 
a theory nobody's gonna like it but
we're<00:04:31.780> gonna<00:04:31.900> prove<00:04:32.200> this<00:04:32.320> theory<00:04:32.590> out<00:04:32.770> in

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
we're gonna prove this theory out in

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.780 
we're gonna prove this theory out in
time<00:04:33.130> no<00:04:33.669> one<00:04:33.850> more<00:04:34.060> then<00:04:34.390> we<00:04:34.479> can<00:04:34.540> don't<00:04:35.229> worry

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
time no one more then we can don't worry

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.219 
time no one more then we can don't worry
this<00:04:36.790> still<00:04:37.060> it<00:04:37.210> is<00:04:37.330> where<00:04:37.540> the<00:04:37.660> tiger<00:04:37.870> come

this still it is where the tiger come

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.610 
this still it is where the tiger come
from<00:04:38.470> because<00:04:38.880> she<00:04:39.880> has<00:04:40.060> Sun<00:04:40.300> tired<00:04:40.540> I<00:04:40.990> knew

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
from because she has Sun tired I knew

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.560 
from because she has Sun tired I knew
she<00:04:41.890> was<00:04:42.040> a<00:04:42.070> Sun<00:04:42.370> tiger<00:04:42.760> I<00:04:42.820> knew<00:04:42.970> it<00:04:43.120> was<00:04:43.270> right

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
she was a Sun tiger I knew it was right

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:54.780 
she was a Sun tiger I knew it was right

drop outs so believe that so I know what
this<00:05:04.720> is<00:05:04.990> this<00:05:05.350> is<00:05:05.410> a<00:05:05.590> two<00:05:05.919> line<00:05:06.220> well<00:05:07.000> there's

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
this is this is a two line well there's

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.120 
this is this is a two line well there's
still<00:05:07.330> one<00:05:07.690> more<00:05:07.900> this<00:05:08.140> is<00:05:08.260> a<00:05:08.320> two<00:05:08.530> line<00:05:08.740> deal

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
still one more this is a two line deal

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.640 
still one more this is a two line deal
here<00:05:09.430> and<00:05:10.300> it's<00:05:10.419> exactly<00:05:10.810> working<00:05:11.260> out<00:05:11.500> the

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
here and it's exactly working out the

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.040 
here and it's exactly working out the
way<00:05:11.680> I<00:05:11.830> figured<00:05:12.430> it<00:05:12.520> would<00:05:12.640> work<00:05:12.760> out<00:05:12.990> now<00:05:13.990> we

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
way I figured it would work out now we

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.950 
way I figured it would work out now we
got<00:05:14.350> to<00:05:14.470> breed<00:05:14.620> it<00:05:14.740> to<00:05:14.860> a<00:05:14.890> purple<00:05:15.810> then<00:05:16.810> you're

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
got to breed it to a purple then you're

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:17.850 
got to breed it to a purple then you're
going<00:05:17.050> to<00:05:17.110> see<00:05:17.289> something<00:05:17.530> entirely

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
going to see something entirely

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.540 
going to see something entirely
different

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.620

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.600 
still have a theory it's a laugh and the
reason<00:05:28.870> why<00:05:28.990> we<00:05:29.140> have<00:05:29.320> laughs<00:05:29.620> is<00:05:30.310> because<00:05:31.140> the

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
reason why we have laughs is because the

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.190 
reason why we have laughs is because the
coral<00:05:33.610> globe<00:05:33.820> line<00:05:34.090> has<00:05:34.360> two<00:05:34.600> sides<00:05:34.900> to<00:05:35.170> it

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
coral globe line has two sides to it

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.660 
coral globe line has two sides to it
that's<00:05:35.470> why<00:05:35.620> when<00:05:35.770> you<00:05:35.860> bring<00:05:36.010> it<00:05:36.130> to<00:05:36.220> a<00:05:36.250> purple

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
that's why when you bring it to a purple

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:37.920 
that's why when you bring it to a purple
you<00:05:37.270> get<00:05:37.420> blue

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
you get blue

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.960 
you get blue
I<00:05:37.960> mean<00:05:38.170> orange<00:05:38.530> glow<00:05:38.800> because<00:05:39.490> when<00:05:39.640> you<00:05:39.730> when

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
I mean orange glow because when you when

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.210 
I mean orange glow because when you when
the<00:05:40.090> original<00:05:40.270> animals<00:05:41.050> were<00:05:41.200> bred<00:05:41.470> they<00:05:42.010> got

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
the original animals were bred they got

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.850 
the original animals were bred they got
half<00:05:42.460> orange<00:05:43.210> clothes<00:05:43.630> and<00:05:43.960> half<00:05:44.650> the

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
half orange clothes and half the

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.340 
half orange clothes and half the
original<00:05:44.980> wine<00:05:45.520> and<00:05:45.850> the<00:05:46.510> original<00:05:46.810> line<00:05:47.020> when

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
original wine and the original line when

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.530 
original wine and the original line when
they<00:05:47.470> bred<00:05:47.680> to<00:05:47.890> was<00:05:48.040> a<00:05:48.070> lavender<00:05:48.610> and<00:05:49.000> and<00:05:49.240> then

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
they bred to was a lavender and and then

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.110 
they bred to was a lavender and and then
the<00:05:49.660> dark<00:05:49.960> ones<00:05:50.200> well<00:05:51.130> that's<00:05:51.670> because<00:05:51.910> he

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
the dark ones well that's because he

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.150 
the dark ones well that's because he
brought<00:05:52.300> it<00:05:52.450> to<00:05:52.480> a<00:05:52.570> purple<00:05:53.020> so<00:05:53.740> what<00:05:53.860> I<00:05:53.890> have

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
brought it to a purple so what I have

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.560 
brought it to a purple so what I have
here<00:05:54.460> should<00:05:55.180> be<00:05:55.390> 75%<00:05:56.110> laughs<00:05:56.800> and<00:05:57.280> only<00:05:58.030> 25%

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
here should be 75% laughs and only 25%

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.020 
here should be 75% laughs and only 25%
Purple's<00:05:59.260> because<00:05:59.530> I<00:05:59.560> had<00:05:59.740> basically<00:06:00.430> two

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
Purple's because I had basically two

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.780 
Purple's because I had basically two
white<00:06:01.270> lines<00:06:01.600> and<00:06:01.930> one<00:06:02.260> dark<00:06:03.130> dark<00:06:03.490> caramel

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
white lines and one dark dark caramel

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.300 
white lines and one dark dark caramel
line<00:06:04.120> and<00:06:04.390> that<00:06:04.840> dark<00:06:05.110> caramel<00:06:05.380> line<00:06:05.680> had<00:06:06.280> to

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
line and that dark caramel line had to

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.010 
line and that dark caramel line had to
get<00:06:06.580> away<00:06:06.790> from<00:06:06.850> the<00:06:07.120> two<00:06:07.300> white<00:06:07.510> lines<00:06:07.750> in

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
get away from the two white lines in

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.140 
get away from the two white lines in
order<00:06:08.110> to<00:06:08.320> show<00:06:08.500> its<00:06:08.680> darkness<00:06:08.980> that's<00:06:09.910> why<00:06:10.120> I

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
order to show its darkness that's why I

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.380 
order to show its darkness that's why I
think<00:06:10.450> we<00:06:10.570> only<00:06:10.690> got<00:06:10.900> it<00:06:11.080> in<00:06:11.200> two<00:06:11.470> snakes<00:06:12.390> yeah

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
think we only got it in two snakes yeah

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:18.810 
think we only got it in two snakes yeah
I<00:06:13.690> think<00:06:13.960> there's<00:06:14.170> one<00:06:14.320> more<00:06:14.380> yeah<00:06:17.130> yeah<00:06:18.130> so<00:06:18.550> we

I think there's one more yeah yeah so we

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.480 
I think there's one more yeah yeah so we
so<00:06:19.450> anyway<00:06:19.720> that's<00:06:20.470> a<00:06:20.650> different<00:06:21.040> that's<00:06:21.280> the

what I expected and we'll see how this
works<00:06:44.410> out<00:06:44.590> it's<00:06:44.830> gonna<00:06:44.950> be<00:06:45.010> just<00:06:45.280> like

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
works out it's gonna be just like

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.000 
works out it's gonna be just like
breeding<00:06:46.300> air<00:06:46.420> mochi<00:06:46.810> knows<00:06:46.990> you're<00:06:47.680> gonna<00:06:47.800> be

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.010 
breeding air mochi knows you're gonna be

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.620 
breeding air mochi knows you're gonna be
het<00:06:48.220> they're<00:06:48.550> gonna<00:06:48.640> be<00:06:48.820> had<00:06:49.000> also<00:06:49.390> when<00:06:49.540> you

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 
het they're gonna be had also when you

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.190 
het they're gonna be had also when you
get<00:06:49.750> there

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:50.200 
get there

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.950 
get there
technically<00:06:50.830> a<00:06:50.950> double<00:06:51.520> a<00:06:51.730> double<00:06:52.090> recessive

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 
technically a double a double recessive

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.290 
technically a double a double recessive
snake<00:06:53.440> that<00:06:53.740> worked<00:06:54.220> together<00:06:54.400> which<00:06:54.760> makes<00:06:54.940> a

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
snake that worked together which makes a

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.100 
snake that worked together which makes a
visual<00:06:56.140> snake<00:06:56.410> and<00:06:57.150> so<00:06:58.150> this<00:06:58.300> is<00:06:58.480> this<00:06:58.840> is<00:06:58.960> what

and we're still trying to completely get

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.700 
and we're still trying to completely get
around<00:07:04.060> it<00:07:04.270> but<00:07:04.420> we<00:07:04.510> got<00:07:04.690> we<00:07:05.170> got<00:07:05.200> some<00:07:05.590> more

the adventure for us and it worked out
just<00:07:15.310> about<00:07:15.520> like<00:07:15.700> I<00:07:15.850> thought<00:07:16.120> except<00:07:16.540> I

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:16.660 
just about like I thought except I

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.810 
just about like I thought except I
expected<00:07:17.140> it<00:07:17.230> to<00:07:17.290> be<00:07:17.500> a<00:07:17.740> little<00:07:18.370> darker<00:07:18.790> than
