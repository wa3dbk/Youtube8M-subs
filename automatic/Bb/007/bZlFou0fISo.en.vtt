00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
think is a hobby for them as well yes

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.080 
think is a hobby for them as well yes
you<00:04:03.989> can<00:04:04.140> have<00:04:04.230> teach<00:04:04.530> tricks<00:04:04.950> so<00:04:05.760> it's<00:04:06.000> a

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
you can have teach tricks so it's a

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.400 
you can have teach tricks so it's a

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
so there's a parrot and then they're

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.060
