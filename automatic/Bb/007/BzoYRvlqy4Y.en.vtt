mini V Delrin wheels bearings and bolts
so<00:00:31.860> we'll<00:00:32.009> build<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:33.470> we'll<00:00:34.470> be<00:00:34.500> able<00:00:34.770> to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
so we'll build this and we'll be able to

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.400 
so we'll build this and we'll be able to
ride<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.670> along<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.390> V<00:00:36.570> slot<00:00:36.870> aluminum

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
ride this along the V slot aluminum

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.240 
ride this along the V slot aluminum
extrusion<00:00:38.010> makes<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.790> nice<00:00:38.970> carriage<00:00:42.950> for<00:00:43.950> your

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
extrusion makes a nice carriage for your

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.110 
extrusion makes a nice carriage for your
V<00:00:44.460> slot<00:00:44.760> projects<00:00:46.100> okay<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.309> one<00:00:47.699> of<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> first

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
V slot projects okay so one of the first

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.450 
V slot projects okay so one of the first
things<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.629> want<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.899> notice<00:00:49.230> about<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:50.010> mini

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
things you want to notice about the mini

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.150 
things you want to notice about the mini
V<00:00:50.670> carriage<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.359> that<00:00:51.780> you'll<00:00:52.710> notice<00:00:53.010> these

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
V carriage is that you'll notice these

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.189 
V carriage is that you'll notice these
holes<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:54.149> you'll<00:00:54.359> have<00:00:54.420> two<00:00:54.660> holes<00:00:54.899> on<00:00:55.109> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
holes here you'll have two holes on the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.529 
holes here you'll have two holes on the
top<00:00:55.260> here<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.739> are<00:00:56.190> smaller<00:00:56.579> than<00:00:57.300> these

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
top here that are smaller than these

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.209 
top here that are smaller than these
holes<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> bottom<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.679> the<00:00:58.739> reason<00:00:59.070> for

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
holes on the bottom and the reason for

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.790 
holes on the bottom and the reason for
that<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.570> holes<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.019> bottom<00:01:01.109> will<00:01:01.649> be

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
that is the holes on the bottom will be

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.549 
that is the holes on the bottom will be
the<00:01:01.920> ones<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.190> receive<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.850> eccentric

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
the ones that receive the eccentric

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.750 
the ones that receive the eccentric
bushing<00:01:04.559> see<00:01:05.309> here<00:01:05.790> flip<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.780> over<00:01:07.580> it<00:01:08.580> has<00:01:08.730> a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
bushing see here flip this over it has a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.010 
bushing see here flip this over it has a
small<00:01:09.180> lip<00:01:09.480> on<00:01:09.690> it

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
small lip on it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.010 
small lip on it
and<00:01:10.560> once<00:01:10.800> it's<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.130> place<00:01:14.540> allows<00:01:15.540> us<00:01:15.840> to

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
and once it's in place allows us to

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.460 
and once it's in place allows us to
tighten<00:01:16.470> our<00:01:16.710> wheels<00:01:17.580> against<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> rail<00:01:18.470> so

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
tighten our wheels against the rail so

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.530 
tighten our wheels against the rail so
that's<00:01:19.710> why<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.369> whole<00:01:20.610> area<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.299> open

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
that's why this whole area is open

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.600 
that's why this whole area is open
bigger<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.829> allow<00:01:23.100> for<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:24.000> screw<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.810> move

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
bigger to allow for that screw to move

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.859 
bigger to allow for that screw to move
inside<00:01:27.979> of<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.969> hole<00:01:30.240> as<00:01:30.450> it's<00:01:30.630> being

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
inside of this hole as it's being

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.859 
inside of this hole as it's being
tightened<00:01:32.030> so<00:01:33.030> we're<00:01:33.149> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.450> two<00:01:33.719> of

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
tightened so we're going to have two of

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.569 
tightened so we're going to have two of
those<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.530> eccentric<00:01:35.040> bushing<00:01:35.490> and

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
those to have the eccentric bushing and

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.020 
those to have the eccentric bushing and
two<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.899> the<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.649> standard<00:01:38.490> spacers

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
two that have the the standard spacers

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.480

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.220 

so<00:04:09.459> these<00:04:09.819> you<00:04:10.090> want<00:04:10.269> to<00:04:10.390> not<00:04:10.840> tighten<00:04:11.200> down

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
so these you want to not tighten down

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.319 
so these you want to not tighten down
hard<00:04:11.980> at<00:04:12.129> all<00:04:12.250> because<00:04:12.549> you<00:04:12.879> want<00:04:13.060> to<00:04:13.090> be<00:04:13.209> able

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:13.329 
hard at all because you want to be able

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.689 
hard at all because you want to be able
to<00:04:13.420> adjust<00:04:13.569> them<00:04:15.299> against<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.449> rail<00:04:17.579> so<00:04:18.579> you

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
to adjust them against the rail so you

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.930 
to adjust them against the rail so you
can<00:04:18.880> see<00:04:19.030> this<00:04:19.209> one<00:04:19.479> the<00:04:20.139> divot<00:04:20.530> is<00:04:20.680> facing<00:04:21.220> out

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
can see this one the divot is facing out

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.520 
can see this one the divot is facing out
away<00:04:22.389> from<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.870> standard<00:04:24.600> wheels<00:04:25.600> so<00:04:26.440> I'm

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
away from the standard wheels so I'm

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.719 
away from the standard wheels so I'm
going<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.710> do<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:26.889> same<00:04:27.100> thing<00:04:27.310> with<00:04:27.460> this<00:04:27.669> one

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
going to do the same thing with this one

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.770 
going to do the same thing with this one
just<00:04:28.449> spin<00:04:28.780> this<00:04:28.930> around<00:04:30.240> until<00:04:31.240> it's<00:04:31.389> facing

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
just spin this around until it's facing

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.610 
just spin this around until it's facing
out<00:04:31.930> in<00:04:32.110> this<00:04:32.320> position<00:04:32.949> will<00:04:33.880> create<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.840> the

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
out in this position will create the the

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.340 
out in this position will create the the
largest<00:04:36.100> gap<00:04:36.310> between<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.419> two<00:04:37.600> wheel<00:04:37.990> sets

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
largest gap between the two wheel sets

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.150 
largest gap between the two wheel sets
here<00:04:38.880> which<00:04:39.880> is<00:04:40.060> good<00:04:40.300> because<00:04:40.800> when<00:04:41.800> we<00:04:41.949> go<00:04:42.099> to

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
here which is good because when we go to

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.710 
here which is good because when we go to
apply<00:04:42.699> it<00:04:43.090> to<00:04:43.539> the<00:04:43.800> V<00:04:44.800> slot<00:04:45.270> you'll<00:04:46.270> see<00:04:46.509> it's

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
apply it to the V slot you'll see it's

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.460 
apply it to the V slot you'll see it's
loose<00:04:47.199> on<00:04:47.380> there<00:04:47.590> right<00:04:47.770> now<00:04:47.949> if<00:04:49.110> but<00:04:50.110> if<00:04:50.259> I

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
loose on there right now if but if I

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.730 
loose on there right now if but if I
hold<00:04:50.740> this<00:04:51.099> against<00:04:51.580> here<00:04:51.970> and<00:04:52.150> I<00:04:52.720> slowly<00:04:53.169> turn

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
hold this against here and I slowly turn

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.870 
hold this against here and I slowly turn
these<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:55.949> I<00:04:56.949> keep<00:04:57.190> spinning<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.639> wheel<00:04:57.849> a

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
these and I keep spinning the wheel a

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.520 
these and I keep spinning the wheel a
little<00:04:58.180> bit<00:04:58.330> just<00:04:58.570> to<00:04:58.720> see<00:04:58.750> when<00:04:59.110> I<00:04:59.139> know<00:04:59.259> it's

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
little bit just to see when I know it's

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.980 
little bit just to see when I know it's
not<00:04:59.860> yet<00:05:00.130> the<00:05:00.280> it<00:05:00.880> to<00:05:01.120> be<00:05:01.240> careful<00:05:01.690> note<00:05:01.810> that

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
we're tighten these it can put a lot of

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.779 
we're tighten these it can put a lot of
pressure<00:05:04.590> as<00:05:05.590> soon<00:05:05.889> as<00:05:05.979> I<00:05:06.099> start<00:05:06.430> to<00:05:06.550> feel<00:05:06.759> like

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.409 
know move a sixteenth at a time when you
get<00:05:13.659> close<00:05:13.930> there<00:05:14.260> I<00:05:14.909> can<00:05:15.909> feel<00:05:16.090> kind<00:05:16.330> of

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
get close there I can feel kind of

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.089

spinning<00:05:16.780> out<00:05:16.990> on<00:05:17.199> there<00:05:17.380> a<00:05:17.409> little<00:05:17.680> bit<00:05:17.800> so<00:05:18.039> I

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
spinning out on there a little bit so I

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:24.059 
spinning out on there a little bit so I
want<00:05:18.280> to<00:05:18.340> do<00:05:18.490> this<00:05:18.669> one<00:05:18.880> now

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:24.069 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.999 

once<00:05:25.069> you<00:05:25.220> get<00:05:25.370> this<00:05:25.580> set<00:05:25.939> up<00:05:26.620> the<00:05:27.620> mess<00:05:27.830> with

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
once you get this set up the mess with

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.399 
once you get this set up the mess with
it<00:05:28.099> again<00:05:28.400> but<00:05:29.210> you<00:05:29.330> can<00:05:29.509> always<00:05:29.720> adjust<00:05:30.020> these

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
it again but you can always adjust these

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.969 
it again but you can always adjust these
later

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
later

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.320 
later
so<00:05:31.430> one<00:05:32.360> last<00:05:32.599> step<00:05:32.960> that<00:05:32.990> I<00:05:33.110> like<00:05:33.409> to<00:05:33.530> do<00:05:33.710> is<00:05:34.330> to

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
so one last step that I like to do is to

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.459 
so one last step that I like to do is to
put<00:05:35.479> the<00:05:35.599> wrench<00:05:35.780> under<00:05:36.050> here<00:05:36.199> because<00:05:36.289> we

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:36.469 
put the wrench under here because we

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:37.839 
put the wrench under here because we
remember<00:05:36.650> we<00:05:36.949> didn't<00:05:37.219> tighten<00:05:37.699> these<00:05:37.789> down

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
remember we didn't tighten these down

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:40.629 
remember we didn't tighten these down
yet<00:05:38.300> and<00:05:38.479> just<00:05:38.900> give<00:05:39.530> it<00:05:39.560> a<00:05:39.740> little<00:05:40.039> quarter

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
yet and just give it a little quarter

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:46.270 
yet and just give it a little quarter
turn<00:05:41.319> to<00:05:42.319> make<00:05:42.530> sure<00:05:42.800> it<00:05:42.919> snugs<00:05:43.400> up<00:05:45.039> all<00:05:46.039> right

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
turn to make sure it snugs up all right

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.709 
turn to make sure it snugs up all right
