00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.790 
now we have all this fancy equipment so
that's<00:03:40.000> not<00:03:40.150> sensible<00:03:40.470> but<00:03:41.470> after<00:03:41.710> they

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
finished plucking it by hand there'd be

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.350 
finished plucking it by hand there'd be
tiny<00:03:44.050> pin<00:03:44.620> feathers<00:03:44.860> that<00:03:45.160> were<00:03:45.250> left<00:03:45.400> over<00:03:45.550> so

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
they would put it over an open fire and

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.820 
they would put it over an open fire and
burn<00:03:48.160> it<00:03:48.370> now<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.090> lot<00:03:49.300> of<00:03:49.360> these<00:03:49.420> people<00:03:49.630> a<00:03:49.840> lot

grandparents did the same thing as well

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.340 
grandparents did the same thing as well
so<00:03:56.770> to<00:03:57.370> recreate<00:03:57.790> that<00:03:57.970> same<00:03:58.240> flavor<00:03:58.630> we<00:03:59.140> would

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
so to recreate that same flavor we would

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.000 
so to recreate that same flavor we would
send<00:03:59.680> it<00:03:59.890> over<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.370> over<00:04:01.000> an<00:04:01.060> open<00:04:01.180> fire<00:04:02.010> just

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
send it over the over an open fire just

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.580 
send it over the over an open fire just
to<00:04:03.220> try<00:04:03.580> to<00:04:03.640> recreate<00:04:04.090> that<00:04:04.360> that<00:04:05.050> flavor<00:04:05.350> that

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
to try to recreate that that flavor that

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.440 
to try to recreate that that flavor that
you<00:04:05.650> get<00:04:06.040> from<00:04:06.250> a<00:04:07.120> bygone<00:04:07.990> era<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:09.610> so<00:04:10.330> that's

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
you get from a bygone era and so that's

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.400 
you get from a bygone era and so that's
really<00:04:10.630> do<00:04:10.870> for<00:04:10.990> the<00:04:11.110> customers

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410
