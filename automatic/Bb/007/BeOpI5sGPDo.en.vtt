00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
tips of my rack and then let it dry and

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.960 
tips of my rack and then let it dry and
then<00:01:47.360> probably<00:01:48.360> do<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> second<00:01:48.990> or<00:01:49.110> third<00:01:49.350> coat

then probably do a second or third coat

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.340 
then probably do a second or third coat
just<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.329> then<00:01:51.450> give<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:51.869> half<00:01:52.110> an<00:01:52.229> hour

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
just and then give it like half an hour

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.480 
just and then give it like half an hour
between<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.829> two<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.850> it'll<00:01:54.000> dry<00:01:54.360> and

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
between the two so that it'll dry and

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.060 
between the two so that it'll dry and
then<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.909> should<00:01:57.090> be<00:01:57.210> fine<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.040> a

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
then it should be fine so this is a

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.380 
then it should be fine so this is a
cheap<00:01:59.340> alternative<00:01:59.460> because<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.090> looked<00:02:00.270> on

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
cheap alternative because I looked on

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.709

eBay at the racks and I could have

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.740 
eBay at the racks and I could have

so<00:02:38.160> anyways<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.610> could<00:02:38.790> have<00:02:38.880> done<00:02:38.970> that<00:02:39.150> but

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
so anyways I could have done that but

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.729 
so anyways I could have done that but
I'm<00:02:39.510> doing<00:02:39.720> this<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.019> said<00:02:40.200> eight<00:02:40.410> dollars

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
I'm doing this and said eight dollars

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.180 
I'm doing this and said eight dollars
versus<00:02:41.100> two<00:02:41.250> hundred<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:42.209> think<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.599> alright

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
versus two hundred you think is alright

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.250 
versus two hundred you think is alright
okay<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:44.220> this<00:02:45.680> is<00:02:46.680> kind<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.069> stinky<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:48.260> should

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
okay so this is kind of stinky I should

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.600 
okay so this is kind of stinky I should
probably<00:02:49.410> be<00:02:49.830> doing<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.190> in<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.459> more

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
probably be doing this in a more

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.410 
probably be doing this in a more
ventilated<00:02:51.269> area<00:02:51.630> than<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.870> am<00:02:53.150> but<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.269> get

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
ventilated area than I am but you get

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.449 
ventilated area than I am but you get
the<00:02:54.510> point<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.840> just<00:02:55.049> dab<00:02:55.799> it<00:02:55.950> all<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.250> let<00:02:56.370> it

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
the point you just dab it all and let it

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.509 
the point you just dab it all and let it
dry<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.940> then<00:02:57.620> pry<00:02:58.620> for<00:02:58.830> these<00:02:58.950> ones<00:02:59.160> that<00:02:59.400> are

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
dry and then pry for these ones that are

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.940 
dry and then pry for these ones that are
really<00:02:59.819> bad<00:03:00.030> do<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.049> couple<00:03:01.380> coats<00:03:01.560> but<00:03:01.830> the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
really bad do a couple coats but the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.380 
really bad do a couple coats but the
ones<00:03:02.130> that<00:03:02.370> it's<00:03:02.519> just<00:03:02.670> like<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.850> little<00:03:03.090> tiny

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
ones that it's just like a little tiny

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.580 
ones that it's just like a little tiny
bit<00:03:05.150> maybe<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:06.420> one<00:03:06.660> well<00:03:07.080> pro<00:03:07.410> -<00:03:09.380> that's<00:03:10.380> how

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
bit maybe just one well pro - that's how

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.910 
bit maybe just one well pro - that's how
you<00:03:10.650> do<00:03:10.769> it<00:03:11.000> until<00:03:12.000> it's<00:03:12.269> all<00:03:12.420> done<00:03:12.560> ok<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.590> was

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.920 
afterwards this is with two coats
most<00:03:25.170> of<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.440> tongs<00:03:25.829> or<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.730> prongs<00:03:27.000> look

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
most of the tongs or the prongs look

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.190 
most of the tongs or the prongs look
pretty<00:03:28.500> I<00:03:29.510> can<00:03:30.510> do<00:03:30.600> it<00:03:30.690> right<00:03:30.810> here<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:31.079> you<00:03:31.109> can

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
pretty I can do it right here so you can

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.910 
pretty I can do it right here so you can
see<00:03:31.500> better<00:03:32.000> look<00:03:33.000> pretty<00:03:33.239> covered<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:34.019> so

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
see better look pretty covered and so

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.849 
see better look pretty covered and so
even<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.400> ones<00:03:35.609> that<00:03:35.700> were<00:03:36.000> wide<00:03:36.620> they<00:03:37.620> just

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
even the ones that were wide they just

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.920 
even the ones that were wide they just
kind<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.070> look<00:03:38.220> like<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.400> wider<00:03:38.850> prong<00:03:39.329> now<00:03:39.600> so

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
kind of look like a wider prong now so

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.650 
kind of look like a wider prong now so
nothing<00:03:40.350> should<00:03:40.739> scrape<00:03:41.070> your<00:03:41.459> dishes<00:03:41.660> or

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
nothing should scrape your dishes or

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.550 
nothing should scrape your dishes or
leave<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.530> rough<00:03:43.890> spot<00:03:44.549> from<00:03:45.180> here<00:03:45.570> onto<00:03:46.440> your

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
leave a rough spot from here onto your

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.340 
leave a rough spot from here onto your
dish<00:03:46.970> so<00:03:47.970> it<00:03:48.269> just<00:03:48.420> makes<00:03:48.570> it<00:03:48.720> easier<00:03:49.140> for<00:03:51.350> the

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
dish so it just makes it easier for the

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.449 
dish so it just makes it easier for the
next<00:03:52.380> person<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:53.280> use<00:03:53.459> their<00:03:53.850> dishwasher<00:03:54.420> and

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
next person to use their dishwasher and

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.699 
next person to use their dishwasher and
yeah<00:03:56.459> if<00:03:56.609> a<00:03:57.000> tip<00:03:57.209> was<00:03:57.569> really<00:03:57.900> bad<00:03:58.049> you<00:03:58.680> know

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
yeah if a tip was really bad you know

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.580 
yeah if a tip was really bad you know
you<00:03:58.890> want<00:03:59.160> to<00:03:59.220> seal<00:03:59.459> it<00:03:59.930> not<00:04:00.930> just<00:04:01.170> on<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:01.380> tip

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
you want to seal it not just on the tip

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.539 
you want to seal it not just on the tip
of<00:04:01.769> where<00:04:01.920> it<00:04:02.069> goes

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
of where it goes

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.270 
of where it goes
from<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.090> bottom<00:04:03.420> to<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.660> tip<00:04:04.010> anyway<00:04:05.010> so<00:04:05.069> you

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
from the bottom to the tip anyway so you

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.770 
from the bottom to the tip anyway so you
don't<00:04:05.430> want<00:04:05.579> water<00:04:05.790> coming<00:04:06.180> back<00:04:06.359> in<00:04:06.569> there

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
don't want water coming back in there

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:13.759 
don't want water coming back in there
creating<00:04:07.769> more<00:04:07.890> damage<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.930> so<00:04:10.730> that<00:04:11.730> is<00:04:12.769> my

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
creating more damage and so that is my

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.159 
creating more damage and so that is my
finished<00:04:14.100> product<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:15.090> even<00:04:15.569> some<00:04:15.930> of<00:04:16.049> these

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
finished product and even some of these

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.900 
finished product and even some of these
were<00:04:16.440> kind<00:04:16.680> of<00:04:16.769> rusted<00:04:17.130> out<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:18.060> don't<00:04:18.900> know<00:04:19.169> why

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
were kind of rusted out I don't know why

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.279 
were kind of rusted out I don't know why
