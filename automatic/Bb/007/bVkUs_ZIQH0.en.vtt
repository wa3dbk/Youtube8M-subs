so<00:01:36.430> I<00:01:36.460> knew<00:01:36.729> it<00:01:36.850> was<00:01:36.969> not<00:01:37.119> gonna<00:01:37.240> be<00:01:37.329> easy<00:01:37.539> I

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
so I knew it was not gonna be easy I

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.719 
so I knew it was not gonna be easy I
wasn't<00:01:38.049> happy<00:01:38.170> that<00:01:38.380> way<00:01:38.469> I<00:01:38.500> started<00:01:38.890> off<00:01:39.070> some

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
wasn't happy that way I started off some

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.730 
wasn't happy that way I started off some

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
say he was nervous I'm sure he was but I

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.499 
say he was nervous I'm sure he was but I
really<00:01:42.189> felt<00:01:42.399> like<00:01:42.460> I<00:01:42.610> really<00:01:43.060> played<00:01:43.270> well

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
really felt like I really played well

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.389 
really felt like I really played well
from<00:01:43.659> the<00:01:43.780> start<00:01:44.020> and<00:01:44.530> was<00:01:44.829> able<00:01:44.950> to<00:01:45.130> put<00:01:45.310> him

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
think about it this way but it was the

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.110 
think about it this way but it was the
same<00:02:52.160> thing<00:02:52.430> when<00:02:52.550> I<00:02:52.580> want<00:02:52.790> my<00:02:52.910> first

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
Wimbledon that's what I've always ever

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.860 
Wimbledon that's what I've always ever
wanted<00:02:55.550> was<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.880> win<00:02:56.030> Wimbledon<00:02:56.240> or<00:02:56.480> play<00:02:56.750> at

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
wanted was to win Wimbledon or play at

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.500 
wanted was to win Wimbledon or play at
Wimbledon<00:02:57.020> and<00:02:57.500> I<00:02:57.920> did<00:02:58.130> that<00:02:58.310> in<00:02:58.490> 2003<00:02:59.120> already

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
Wimbledon and I did that in 2003 already

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.900 
Wimbledon and I did that in 2003 already
I<00:02:59.780> came<00:03:00.080> back<00:03:00.230> every<00:03:00.440> other<00:03:00.650> year<00:03:00.950> every<00:03:01.880> year

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
I came back every other year every year

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.910 
I came back every other year every year
and<00:03:02.210> I<00:03:02.450> wanted<00:03:02.870> again<00:03:03.110> and<00:03:03.320> again<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:03.680> again

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
and I wanted again and again and again

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.040 
and I wanted again and again and again
and<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.130> think<00:03:04.310> that's<00:03:04.460> what<00:03:04.730> champions<00:03:05.630> want

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
and I think that's what champions want

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.150 
and I think that's what champions want
to<00:03:06.110> do<00:03:06.200> they<00:03:06.320> can<00:03:06.440> want<00:03:06.620> to<00:03:06.680> come<00:03:06.830> back<00:03:07.010> and

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
to do they can want to come back and

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.920 
to do they can want to come back and
prove<00:03:07.310> themselves<00:03:07.700> over<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.240> over<00:03:08.420> again<00:03:08.510> and

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
prove themselves over and over again and

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.140 
prove themselves over and over again and
