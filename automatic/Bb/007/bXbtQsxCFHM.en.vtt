big<00:00:18.720> change<00:00:19.560> for<00:00:19.920> tuning<00:00:20.220> our<00:00:20.310> videos<00:00:20.580> but

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
big change for tuning our videos but

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.509 
big change for tuning our videos but
anyway<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:22.170> all<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:22.800> for<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.070> does<00:00:23.279> either

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
anyway so all this for you does either

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.340 
anyway so all this for you does either
but<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.240> can<00:00:24.359> see<00:00:24.480> what<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.689> does<00:00:24.779> all<00:00:25.080> around

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
but you can see what it does all around

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.650 
but you can see what it does all around
you<00:00:25.470> in<00:00:25.560> fact<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.039> what<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.400> does<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:27.000> when<00:00:27.510> it

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
you in fact and what it does is when it

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.730 
you in fact and what it does is when it
snows<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.470> causes<00:00:29.039> snow<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:30.210> accumulate<00:00:30.810> it

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
snows it causes snow to accumulate it

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.459 
snows it causes snow to accumulate it
causes<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.250> grow<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.969> more<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.239> snows<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:34.410> you

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
causes to grow the more it snows so you

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.990 
causes to grow the more it snows so you
can<00:00:34.620> see<00:00:34.770> over<00:00:34.800> here<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.280> been<00:00:35.399> we've<00:00:35.969> been

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
can see over here it's been we've been

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.459 
can see over here it's been we've been
letting<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.420> snow<00:00:36.600> for<00:00:36.630> quite<00:00:36.930> quite<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> while

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
letting it snow for quite quite a while

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.280 
letting it snow for quite quite a while
now<00:00:37.579> as<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.820> can<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.030> as<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:39.450> see<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
now as you can and as you can see the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.770 
now as you can and as you can see the
layers<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.219> snow<00:00:41.579> are<00:00:42.000> gradually<00:00:42.629> getting

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
layers of snow are gradually getting

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.520 
layers of snow are gradually getting
higher<00:00:43.910> right<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.719> shall<00:00:45.870> now<00:00:45.930> show<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.379> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
higher right so we shall now show you a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:01:55.180 
higher right so we shall now show you a
time-lapse<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:48.360> snow<00:00:49.010> accumulating

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.010 

when<00:01:56.190> you<00:01:56.310> walk<00:01:56.490> you're<00:01:57.150> walking<00:01:57.630> height<00:01:57.810> is

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
when you walk you're walking height is

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.800 
when you walk you're walking height is
adjusted<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:59.010> why<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.190> is<00:01:59.400> known<00:01:59.520> as<00:01:59.810> indeed

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
adjusted to why this is known as indeed

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.500 
adjusted to why this is known as indeed
it<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.670> dig<00:02:02.880> these<00:02:03.060> up<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.450> think

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
it and you can dig these up and I think

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.240 
it and you can dig these up and I think
you<00:02:03.660> get<00:02:03.840> snowballs<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.620> my<00:02:04.920> kind<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.130> thing

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
you get snowballs and my kind of thing

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.790 
you get snowballs and my kind of thing
has<00:02:05.370> normal<00:02:05.730> what<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.120> also<00:02:06.240> does<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.840> when<00:02:07.710> it

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
has normal what it also does is when it

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.120 
has normal what it also does is when it
stops<00:02:08.160> snowing<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.790> if<00:02:09.240> it's<00:02:09.360> sunny<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:10.590> snow

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
stops snowing and if it's sunny the snow

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.460 
stops snowing and if it's sunny the snow
piles<00:02:11.460> will<00:02:11.730> gradually<00:02:12.180> melt<00:02:12.600> with<00:02:13.140> at<00:02:13.290> about

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
piles will gradually melt with at about

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.730 
piles will gradually melt with at about
half<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:14.010> speed<00:02:14.310> by<00:02:14.610> default<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.270> they<00:02:15.450> grow

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
half the speed by default that they grow

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.930 
half the speed by default that they grow
but<00:02:16.740> they<00:02:17.100> won't<00:02:18.290> melt<00:02:19.290> completely<00:02:19.760> they<00:02:20.760> will

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
but they won't melt completely they will

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.620 
but they won't melt completely they will
leave<00:02:21.150> one<00:02:21.600> layer<00:02:22.380> of<00:02:23.130> snow<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.760> unless<00:02:24.390> you

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
leave one layer of snow on unless you

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.210 
leave one layer of snow on unless you
change<00:02:24.990> it<00:02:25.110> in<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.290> conflict<00:02:25.650> which<00:02:25.770> you<00:02:25.950> can

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
change it in the conflict which you can

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.850 
change it in the conflict which you can
do<00:02:26.540> we've<00:02:27.540> left<00:02:27.750> everything<00:02:28.080> is<00:02:28.290> default<00:02:28.709> of

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
do we've left everything is default of

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.530 
do we've left everything is default of
the<00:02:28.920> minute<00:02:29.810> also<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:31.260> snow<00:02:32.090> will<00:02:33.090> grow

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
the minute also this snow will grow

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.910 
the minute also this snow will grow
indefinitely

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
indefinitely

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.390 
indefinitely
there<00:02:35.100> is<00:02:35.220> no<00:02:35.660> necessary<00:02:36.660> limit<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:38.250> the

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
there is no necessary limit to the

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.370 
there is no necessary limit to the
height<00:02:38.550> of<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:38.820> snow<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.870> have<00:02:39.959> you<00:02:40.080> made<00:02:40.200> it

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
height of this snow so have you made it

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.199 
height of this snow so have you made it
snow<00:02:40.530> for<00:02:41.340> like<00:02:41.490> a<00:02:41.840> week<00:02:43.760> yeah<00:02:44.760> this<00:02:45.000> would<00:02:45.120> be

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
snow for like a week yeah this would be

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.560 
snow for like a week yeah this would be
like<00:02:45.330> up<00:02:45.510> here<00:02:45.540> probably<00:02:47.330> probably<00:02:48.330> even

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
like up here probably probably even

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.910 
like up here probably probably even
higher<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:49.680> James<00:02:49.920> could<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.160> demonstrate

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
higher so James could you demonstrate

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.890 
higher so James could you demonstrate
blowing<00:02:52.920> does<00:02:53.240> concede<00:02:54.240> right<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.620> as<00:02:56.250> you

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
blowing does concede right so as you

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.870 
blowing does concede right so as you
just<00:02:57.900> been<00:02:58.050> informed<00:02:58.320> that<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.880> snow

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
just been informed that the snow

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.350 
just been informed that the snow
accumulates<00:03:00.570> by<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.959> sort<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:02.090> noisy<00:03:03.090> :

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
accumulates by the sort of noisy :

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.030 
accumulates by the sort of noisy :
really<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.620> snow<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:05.100> know<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.570> actual<00:03:06.840> name<00:03:06.989> is

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
really a snow I know the actual name is

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.250 
really a snow I know the actual name is
it's<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.459> actual<00:03:08.730> name<00:03:08.850> is<00:03:08.880> just<00:03:09.150> snow<00:03:09.420> right

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
it's the actual name is just snow right

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.290 
it's the actual name is just snow right
so<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:10.950> can<00:03:11.100> actually<00:03:11.250> pilot<00:03:11.760> ontology<00:03:12.000> you

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
so you can actually pilot ontology you

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.630 
so you can actually pilot ontology you
can<00:03:12.450> do<00:03:12.630> this<00:03:12.810> yourself<00:03:12.989> by<00:03:13.590> getting<00:03:14.220> in<00:03:14.519> your

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
can do this yourself by getting in your

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.290 
can do this yourself by getting in your
inventory<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:16.370> stacking<00:03:17.370> it'll<00:03:17.700> like<00:03:17.850> that

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
inventory and stacking it'll like that

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.300 
inventory and stacking it'll like that
yes<00:03:19.019> apparently<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.769> can<00:03:19.890> do<00:03:19.980> that<00:03:20.100> in

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
yes apparently you can do that in

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.350 
yes apparently you can do that in
vanilla<00:03:21.120> too<00:03:21.590> but<00:03:23.000> yeah<00:03:24.000> we<00:03:24.120> don't<00:03:24.269> know

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
vanilla too but yeah we don't know

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.160 
vanilla too but yeah we don't know
exactly<00:03:24.480> how<00:03:25.760> but<00:03:26.760> yes<00:03:27.540> so<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:28.019> can

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
exactly how but yes so that you can

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.479 
exactly how but yes so that you can
stack<00:03:28.350> that<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.500> size<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.680> like<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.100> we<00:03:29.310> just

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
stack that a size you like and we just

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.800 
stack that a size you like and we just
thought<00:03:29.580> that<00:03:29.700> was<00:03:29.790> pretty<00:03:29.910> cool<00:03:30.060> so<00:03:30.120> probably

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
thought that was pretty cool so probably

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.340 
thought that was pretty cool so probably
mention<00:03:31.080> it<00:03:31.489> but<00:03:32.489> yeah<00:03:32.930> yes<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.080> can<00:03:34.230> also

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
mention it but yeah yes you can also

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.610 
mention it but yeah yes you can also
have<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:35.519> snowfalls<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.900> if<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.380> blocks

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
have the snowfalls and if the blocks

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.870 
have the snowfalls and if the blocks
beneath<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.549> our<00:03:39.120> destroyed<00:03:39.860> indeed<00:03:40.860> oh<00:03:41.070> this

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
beneath it our destroyed indeed oh this

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.390 
beneath it our destroyed indeed oh this
is<00:03:42.000> impossible

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
is impossible

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.559 
is impossible
yeah<00:03:44.170> it<00:03:45.170> does<00:03:45.760> right<00:03:46.790> so<00:03:47.180> we<00:03:47.420> shall

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
yeah it does right so we shall

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.170 
yeah it does right so we shall
demonstrate<00:03:47.780> this<00:03:48.170> by<00:03:50.080> so<00:03:51.879> so<00:03:52.879> do<00:03:52.970> you<00:03:53.060> see

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
demonstrate this by so so do you see

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.449 
demonstrate this by so so do you see
this<00:03:53.510> yeah<00:03:54.409> this<00:03:54.860> block<00:03:55.069> here

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
this yeah this block here

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.110 
this yeah this block here
now<00:03:55.790> this<00:03:56.299> block<00:03:56.510> has<00:03:56.780> snow<00:03:57.440> on<00:03:57.590> it<00:03:57.709> that<00:03:58.120> could

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
now this block has snow on it that could

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.330 
now this block has snow on it that could
well<00:03:59.269> have<00:03:59.390> accumulated<00:03:59.690> if<00:04:00.260> we<00:04:00.799> destroy<00:04:01.159> this

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
well have accumulated if we destroy this

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.190 
well have accumulated if we destroy this
block<00:04:01.640> there<00:04:01.940> should<00:04:02.269> be<00:04:02.629> no<00:04:02.810> snow<00:04:03.019> underneath

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
block there should be no snow underneath

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.720 
block there should be no snow underneath
it<00:04:03.440> but<00:04:03.760> there's<00:04:04.760> no<00:04:04.849> folds<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.709> and<00:04:06.709> are<00:04:07.250> they

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
it but there's no folds and and are they

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.130 
it but there's no folds and and are they
actually<00:04:08.090> accumulate<00:04:08.540> and<00:04:08.720> block<00:04:08.930> underneath

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
actually accumulate and block underneath

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.170 
actually accumulate and block underneath
we<00:04:10.040> could<00:04:10.159> demonstrate<00:04:10.340> this<00:04:10.610> even<00:04:10.879> further

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
we could demonstrate this even further

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.229 
we could demonstrate this even further
by<00:04:11.750> if<00:04:12.019> I<00:04:12.220> just<00:04:13.220> get<00:04:13.610> rid<00:04:13.700> of<00:04:13.790> these<00:04:13.940> blocks

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
by if I just get rid of these blocks

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.189 
by if I just get rid of these blocks
I'll<00:04:14.870> dig<00:04:15.200> a<00:04:15.230> little<00:04:15.379> hole<00:04:15.850> and<00:04:16.850> we<00:04:17.750> go<00:04:18.139> to

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:18.199 
I'll dig a little hole and we go to

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.830 
I'll dig a little hole and we go to
stand<00:04:18.500> down<00:04:18.650> could<00:04:18.949> you<00:04:18.979> stand<00:04:19.250> here<00:04:19.549> dip

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
stand down could you stand here dip

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.659 
stand down could you stand here dip
that's<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:20.959> bit<00:04:21.109> and<00:04:21.440> then<00:04:21.680> if<00:04:21.799> I<00:04:21.859> destroy<00:04:22.340> this

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
that's a bit and then if I destroy this

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.140 
that's a bit and then if I destroy this
block<00:04:22.940> this<00:04:23.210> walk<00:04:23.479> and<00:04:23.710> this<00:04:24.710> walk<00:04:25.150> it

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
block this walk and this walk it

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.500 
block this walk and this walk it
actually<00:04:26.600> has<00:04:26.810> a<00:04:27.050> falling<00:04:27.650> animation<00:04:28.510> div

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
actually has a falling animation div

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.640 
actually has a falling animation div
which<00:04:30.050> is<00:04:30.169> pretty<00:04:30.380> cool<00:04:32.020> so<00:04:33.020> yeah<00:04:33.139> that<00:04:33.470> works

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
which is pretty cool so yeah that works

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.790 
which is pretty cool so yeah that works
and<00:04:33.800> I<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:36.350> ever

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
and I and ever

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.930 
and I and ever
pretty<00:04:37.100> much<00:04:37.190> everything<00:04:37.520> here<00:04:37.850> is

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
pretty much everything here is

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.400 
pretty much everything here is
configurable<00:04:38.479> I<00:04:38.660> mean<00:04:38.780> you<00:04:38.840> can<00:04:38.990> think<00:04:39.229> you

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
configurable I mean you can think you

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.620 
configurable I mean you can think you
can<00:04:39.440> configure<00:04:39.919> how<00:04:40.490> fast<00:04:40.910> it<00:04:41.090> accumulates

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
can configure how fast it accumulates

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.310 
can configure how fast it accumulates
how<00:04:41.810> fast<00:04:42.050> it<00:04:42.199> melts<00:04:42.650> oh<00:04:43.479> another<00:04:44.479> thing<00:04:44.600> it

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
how fast it melts oh another thing it

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.170 
how fast it melts oh another thing it
will<00:04:45.620> go<00:04:46.039> through<00:04:46.840> trees<00:04:48.430> but<00:04:49.430> not<00:04:49.460> to<00:04:50.090> the

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
will go through trees but not to the

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.270 
will go through trees but not to the
same<00:04:50.330> extent<00:04:50.389> that<00:04:51.320> it<00:04:51.440> will<00:04:51.560> fall<00:04:51.800> on<00:04:52.039> the

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
same extent that it will fall on the

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.469 
same extent that it will fall on the
ground<00:04:52.580> so<00:04:52.789> if<00:04:52.880> we<00:04:52.940> look<00:04:53.030> at<00:04:53.120> this<00:04:53.210> tree<00:04:53.450> over

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
ground so if we look at this tree over

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.320 
ground so if we look at this tree over
here<00:04:53.690> you'll<00:04:54.530> notice<00:04:54.800> that<00:04:55.190> there<00:04:55.880> is<00:04:56.060> in<00:04:56.300> fact

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
here you'll notice that there is in fact

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.529 
here you'll notice that there is in fact
snow<00:04:56.960> underneath<00:04:57.770> leaves<00:04:58.400> but<00:04:59.240> you<00:04:59.360> also

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
snow underneath leaves but you also

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:02.980 
snow underneath leaves but you also
notice<00:04:59.990> that<00:05:00.169> it<00:05:00.560> is<00:05:00.590> less<00:05:01.630> problem<00:05:02.630> saturated

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
notice that it is less problem saturated

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.990 
notice that it is less problem saturated
indeed<00:05:03.650> less<00:05:03.830> concentrated<00:05:04.340> than<00:05:04.760> snow

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
indeed less concentrated than snow

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.500 
indeed less concentrated than snow
outside<00:05:05.570> and<00:05:05.900> this<00:05:06.770> is<00:05:07.010> because<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.760> option

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
outside and this is because the option

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
outside and this is because the option
even<00:05:08.690> the<00:05:08.780> bigger<00:05:08.960> employment<00:05:09.410> which<00:05:09.500> is

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
even the bigger employment which is

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.770 
even the bigger employment which is
configured<00:05:10.039> buffle<00:05:10.360> which<00:05:11.360> you<00:05:11.419> can<00:05:11.539> think<00:05:11.690> by

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
configured buffle which you can think by

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.870 
configured buffle which you can think by
the<00:05:11.840> fault<00:05:12.080> to<00:05:12.680> work<00:05:13.310> with<00:05:13.669> leaves<00:05:14.539> and<00:05:15.880> it

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
the fault to work with leaves and it

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.000 
the fault to work with leaves and it
will<00:05:17.090> mean<00:05:17.270> the<00:05:17.660> snow<00:05:18.440> will<00:05:18.770> indeed

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
will mean the snow will indeed

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.339 
will mean the snow will indeed
accumulate<00:05:19.430> blows<00:05:19.900> but<00:05:20.900> with<00:05:21.020> a<00:05:21.050> slightly

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
accumulate blows but with a slightly

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:24.339 
accumulate blows but with a slightly
lower<00:05:21.770> chance<00:05:22.220> than<00:05:23.060> outside<00:05:23.750> of<00:05:24.020> leaves<00:05:24.229> and

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
lower chance than outside of leaves and

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:25.659 
lower chance than outside of leaves and
that<00:05:24.410> makes<00:05:24.620> sense<00:05:24.800> because<00:05:25.010> you<00:05:25.190> do<00:05:25.400> tend<00:05:25.639> to

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
that makes sense because you do tend to

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.719 
that makes sense because you do tend to
see<00:05:25.849> snow<00:05:26.120> underneath<00:05:26.780> trees<00:05:27.110> but<00:05:27.349> unless

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
see snow underneath trees but unless

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.279 
see snow underneath trees but unless
lesser<00:05:28.729> amounts<00:05:29.180> in<00:05:29.419> the<00:05:29.479> wolf<00:05:29.900> because<00:05:30.199> of

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
lesser amounts in the wolf because of

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.760 
lesser amounts in the wolf because of
the<00:05:30.410> wind<00:05:30.590> changes<00:05:31.099> so<00:05:32.090> yeah

the wind changes so yeah

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.680 
the wind changes so yeah
so<00:05:34.400> you<00:05:34.460> can<00:05:34.730> even<00:05:34.850> you<00:05:35.150> can<00:05:35.300> configure<00:05:35.510> that

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
so you can even you can configure that

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.180 
so you can even you can configure that
as<00:05:35.810> well<00:05:35.960> you<00:05:36.050> can<00:05:36.200> configure<00:05:36.800> it<00:05:36.980> to<00:05:37.070> go

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
as well you can configure it to go

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.340 
as well you can configure it to go
through<00:05:37.340> more<00:05:37.520> blocks<00:05:37.760> to<00:05:38.060> land<00:05:38.810> on<00:05:39.170> different

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
through more blocks to land on different

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.050 
through more blocks to land on different
blocks<00:05:39.800> to<00:05:40.130> accumulate<00:05:40.640> different<00:05:40.910> blocks

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
blocks to accumulate different blocks

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.620 
blocks to accumulate different blocks
that<00:05:41.180> kind<00:05:41.510> of<00:05:41.540> thing<00:05:41.720> d<00:05:42.380> um<00:05:43.480> we<00:05:44.480> should

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
that kind of thing d um we should

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.910 
that kind of thing d um we should
probably<00:05:44.660> also<00:05:44.990> mention<00:05:45.170> that<00:05:45.560> there's<00:05:45.770> some

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
probably also mention that there's some

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.480 
probably also mention that there's some
planned<00:05:46.520> future<00:05:46.910> developments<00:05:47.750> regarding

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
planned future developments regarding
