is<00:04:55.270> something<00:04:55.810> that<00:04:55.840> I<00:04:56.080> kind<00:04:56.469> of<00:04:56.500> took<00:04:56.710> out<00:04:56.919> of

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
is something that I kind of took out of

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.070 
is something that I kind of took out of
the<00:04:57.129> book<00:04:57.370> but<00:04:57.639> I<00:04:57.879> feel<00:04:58.240> like<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.599> book<00:04:58.750> does

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
the book but I feel like the book does

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.469 
the book but I feel like the book does
have<00:04:59.319> kind<00:04:59.710> of<00:04:59.770> like<00:04:59.979> an<00:05:00.219> anti-war<00:05:01.180> message

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
have kind of like an anti-war message

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.070 
have kind of like an anti-war message
because<00:05:02.469> while<00:05:03.370> all<00:05:03.699> this<00:05:03.969> is<00:05:04.030> going<00:05:04.330> on<00:05:04.750> on

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
because while all this is going on on

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.219 
because while all this is going on on
the<00:05:05.229> island<00:05:05.860> World<00:05:06.639> War<00:05:06.909> three<00:05:07.389> is<00:05:07.419> happening

the island World War three is happening

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.219 
the island World War three is happening
in<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.650> outside<00:05:08.680> world<00:05:09.520> and<00:05:10.210> you<00:05:10.750> could<00:05:10.990> look

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
in the outside world and you could look

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.790 
in the outside world and you could look
at<00:05:11.500> what's<00:05:11.770> going<00:05:12.009> on<00:05:12.280> on<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.729> island<00:05:13.360> as

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
at what's going on on the island as

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.589 
at what's going on on the island as
being<00:05:14.800> kind<00:05:15.009> of<00:05:15.129> a<00:05:15.250> metaphor<00:05:15.580> for<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.180> war

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
being kind of a metaphor for the war

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.619 
being kind of a metaphor for the war
going<00:05:17.020> on<00:05:17.169> in<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.650> outside<00:05:18.129> world<00:05:18.550> and<00:05:19.000> you

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:19.629 
going on in the outside world and you

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:21.330 
going on in the outside world and you
could<00:05:19.840> even<00:05:20.050> look<00:05:20.259> at<00:05:20.469> it<00:05:20.620> as<00:05:20.860> being<00:05:20.889> the

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
could even look at it as being the

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.640 
could even look at it as being the
reverse<00:05:21.699> like<00:05:22.180> you<00:05:22.330> could<00:05:22.509> look<00:05:22.690> at<00:05:22.930> the<00:05:23.440> world

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
reverse like you could look at the world

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.800 
reverse like you could look at the world
war<00:05:23.949> three<00:05:24.460> which<00:05:24.759> is<00:05:24.789> going<00:05:24.940> on<00:05:25.419> in<00:05:25.690> the

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
war three which is going on in the

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.110 
war three which is going on in the
outside<00:05:25.960> world<00:05:26.620> this<00:05:27.009> being<00:05:27.279> a<00:05:27.430> metaphor<00:05:27.729> for

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
outside world this being a metaphor for

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.040 
outside world this being a metaphor for
what's<00:05:28.300> happening<00:05:28.900> on<00:05:29.169> the<00:05:29.710> island<00:05:29.860> and<00:05:30.729> like

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
what's happening on the island and like

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.930 
what's happening on the island and like
really<00:05:32.050> I<00:05:32.080> feel<00:05:32.469> like<00:05:32.740> what<00:05:33.009> William<00:05:33.400> Golding

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:43.510 
we're all inherently evil like that's
what<00:07:41.690> the<00:07:41.840> devil<00:07:42.050> is<00:07:42.409> supposed<00:07:42.710> to<00:07:42.830> represent

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 
what the devil is supposed to represent

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.610 
what the devil is supposed to represent
when<00:07:43.789> he<00:07:43.940> does<00:07:44.180> show<00:07:44.479> up<00:07:44.690> in<00:07:44.870> this<00:07:44.990> book<00:07:45.349> but

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:45.620 
when he does show up in this book but

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.800 
when he does show up in this book but
like<00:07:46.130> I<00:07:46.280> said<00:07:46.520> it's<00:07:46.669> only<00:07:46.849> in<00:07:47.120> one<00:07:47.389> scene<00:07:47.780> in

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:47.810

like I said it's only in one scene in
the<00:07:48.050> book<00:07:48.349> and<00:07:48.650> it<00:07:49.009> is<00:07:49.250> implied<00:07:49.699> that<00:07:49.759> it<00:07:50.180> could

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:50.360 
the book and it is implied that it could

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.439 
the book and it is implied that it could
just<00:07:50.570> be<00:07:50.810> in<00:07:50.840> this<00:07:51.139> character's<00:07:51.830> head<00:07:52.449> but

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:53.449 
just be in this character's head but

00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:56.320 
just be in this character's head but
yeah<00:07:53.889> like<00:07:54.889> I<00:07:55.009> said<00:07:55.039> more<00:07:55.460> of<00:07:55.610> the<00:07:55.699> Flies<00:07:55.969> is<00:07:56.300> a

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:56.330
