00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:10.030
 how about youtube friends we are with a 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.940
 new video for the channel this video what 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.469
 I do because there are several people 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.330
 subscribers who do not know how to install 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.970
 correctly the clips that I'm 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.270
 going up to the channel that's why I decided to 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.610
 make this video good let's start once 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.340
 downloaded the kit or the kits that you 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.560
 want to unzip it because they are 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.050
 in a point rar file once 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.320
 unzipped the point file rar us 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.170
 there will be a folder called ps3 that 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.020
 folder we copy it to our usb or 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.680
 also called pendrive once copied 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:48.270
 the folder ps3 we will install it in 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.270
 the playstation system 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.580
 once connected the usb to the 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.780
 playstation3 we go to 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.050
 data tools saved from the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.360
 ps3 since this is where we're going to 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.880
 copy the files that we copy to the usb 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.910
 just follow the steps I'm doing 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.650
 to make them much easier once 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.440
 inside data tools 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:24.130
 saved from the ps3 system 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:27.190
 will recognize the usb that we connect later 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.430
 we enter the usb and press triangle 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.590
 and give it to copy and automatically 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.320
 will begin to copy the file to the system 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.070
 playstation 3 once it has been 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.540
 finished copying the file to the bc3 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.460
 we press the circle and leave 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.100
 Saved data tool and 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.540
 we enter the game of pests or 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.540
 called pro evolution soccer 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.810
 once inside the game of pests we 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.960
 we go to the part where it says edit 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.240
 eye I want to clarify to you so that 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.789
 kits that I upload them perfectly 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.610
 they have to have updated super 13 to 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.459
 the latest version as it is in the 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.739
 screen once inside edit us 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.290

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.750
 import equipment then we select the 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.819
 team that you want to import now 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.000
 in this case import the equipment of the 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.370
 Manchester United because this is just 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.230

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.049

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.180
 again we press next then 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.130
 we search and select the team that 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.860
 we want to import the clips that 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.750
 we want to import the kit automatically 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.450
 will send them to the right team so that 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.690

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.030

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.400

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.870
