00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
racing games the fact that they're you

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.170 
racing games the fact that they're you
know<00:00:34.650> pick<00:00:34.920> up<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.190> play<00:00:35.400> really<00:00:35.880> nice<00:00:36.030> and

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
genre and push it really into the next

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.470 
genre and push it really into the next
level<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.760> we've<00:00:44.910> done<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.210> with<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
level and so we've done that with the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.670 
level and so we've done that with the
racing<00:00:45.690> itself<00:00:46.080> we've<00:00:46.320> got<00:00:46.470> a<00:00:46.500> lot<00:00:46.650> of

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
racing itself we've got a lot of

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.340 
racing itself we've got a lot of
real-world<00:00:46.920> physics<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.700> there<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.200> got

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
real-world physics in there so it's got

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.960 
real-world physics in there so it's got
little<00:00:49.410> bit<00:00:49.590> more<00:00:49.680> complexity<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.550> little<00:00:50.879> bit

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
little bit more complexity a little bit

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.610 
little bit more complexity a little bit

want to drive that soapbox racer you
should<00:02:20.670> be<00:02:20.730> able<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.940> compete<00:02:21.780> with<00:02:21.959> my<00:02:22.110> car<00:02:23.360> we

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
should be able to compete with my car we

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.270 
should be able to compete with my car we
made<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.569> so<00:02:24.750> it's<00:02:24.870> all<00:02:24.989> balanced<00:02:25.440> so<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:26.130> may

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
made it so it's all balanced so you may

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.490 
made it so it's all balanced so you may
choose<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.550> have<00:02:26.790> top<00:02:27.090> acceleration<00:02:27.450> on<00:02:28.019> your

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
choose to have top acceleration on your

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.550 
choose to have top acceleration on your
car<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.370> chose<00:02:29.580> tops<00:02:30.000> speed<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.140> they're

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
car and I chose tops speed and they're

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.540 
car and I chose tops speed and they're
sort<00:02:31.739> of<00:02:31.769> on<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.980> opposite<00:02:32.250> ends<00:02:32.430> of<00:02:32.489> the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
sort of on the opposite ends of the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.360 
sort of on the opposite ends of the
spectrum<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.630> can't<00:02:33.870> have<00:02:34.050> both<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.620> so

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
spectrum so you can't have both and so

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.620 
spectrum so you can't have both and so
that's<00:02:35.519> how<00:02:35.700> we<00:02:35.730> made<00:02:36.000> some<00:02:36.150> unique<00:02:36.480> and

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
that's how we made some unique and

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.210 
that's how we made some unique and
differences<00:02:37.019> based<00:02:37.200> on<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.470> type<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.680> driving

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
differences based on the type of driving

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.800 
differences based on the type of driving
whether<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.760> want<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:38.970> have<00:02:39.120> tighter<00:02:39.420> turns

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
whether you want to have tighter turns

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.229 
whether you want to have tighter turns
or<00:02:40.319> looser<00:02:40.769> turns<00:02:41.040> but<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.400> has<00:02:41.519> like<00:02:41.730> better

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
or looser turns but it has like better

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.690 
or looser turns but it has like better
handling<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:43.019> kind<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.290> thing<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:44.250> there's

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
handling that kind of thing so there's

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.250 
handling that kind of thing so there's
differences<00:02:45.090> but<00:02:45.420> everyone<00:02:45.720> we<00:02:45.840> try<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.140> keep

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
differences but everyone we try to keep

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.440 
differences but everyone we try to keep
it<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.440> real<00:02:46.590> even<00:02:47.340> playing<00:02:47.580> field<00:02:47.670> what<00:02:48.239> sort

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
it a real even playing field what sort

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.330 
it a real even playing field what sort
of<00:02:48.510> power-ups<00:02:48.810> see<00:02:49.200> happen<00:02:49.530> again<00:02:49.769> we<00:02:50.160> got<00:02:50.310> a

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
of power-ups see happen again we got a

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.710 
of power-ups see happen again we got a
whole<00:02:50.580> bunch<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.849> different<00:02:50.910> power-ups<00:02:51.360> some

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
whole bunch of different power-ups some
