00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.750
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.020
 me and the nose and we continue 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.779
 record forecasts for the lan asus finals 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.439
 rog dreamleague season 3 but not easy 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.140
 forecast rather analytics and forecasts 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:30.330
 so we only have two matches left and I 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.850
 fully predicted in general some 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.870
 will match natus vincere grand finale 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.079
 turned out and they are waiting for the winner of the pair 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.320
 Ninja in pajamas with virtus.pro 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.469
 obama tibe 105 which is interesting that is to 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.050
 three wins and theoretically teams 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.129
 who will play here and win 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.860
 if very long games will be and if 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.590
 all five games are tense then this team 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.020
 can get to the city just squeezed like 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.600
 Lemon but accordingly if it is 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.330
 a lot of games so here we go 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.290
 Directly to games not recorded 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.500
 against virtus.pro 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.180
 yesterday virtus.pro got rid of them 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.610
 it is simply not possible to peep badly 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.380
 sob puts usb cared much better 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.780
 played much better in all aspects 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.409
 they won the ninja 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.330
 Yesterday I said that virtus pro have 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.909
 the bonus is that they themselves did not appear 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.890
 incomprehensible what they are playing while 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.500
 they got hot but could virtus.pro 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.020
 look look and so on it 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.780
 of course came to some degree at the very 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.790
 business yesterday just virtus.pro were well 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.320
 in all aspects of the game 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.720
 stronger from the peak which is very important 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.829
 so of course today a clear favorite 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.280
 is virtus.pro 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.979
 but it should be understood that here we have a 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.140
 sweden still threads in pajamas this 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.409
 Swedish team to Swedish for them will be 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.710
 hurt besides virtus.pro yesterday very 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.960
 late finished play maybe 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.890
 some problems there with recovery 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.170
 Well, although time 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.530
 sort of like was relaxing enough 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.020
 I hope that they rested well 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.510
 so i will say there are some doubts that 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.010
 today ninjas can start playing better 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.310
 much than yesterday 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.290
 that they can play a lot more 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.959
 sure ground doubts concerns 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.209
 but for virtus.pro but still 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.489
 cool virtus.pro favorite clear favorites 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.709
 must win if not escaped them 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.750
 will win this match well this is something like 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.140
 it happens 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.090
 happens periodically in sports when 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.030
 the outsider wins but what to do 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.580
 these are things for which nothing 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.950
 It is impossible to influence and if I am right 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.260
 in this case, virtus.pro fall 1 grand 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.110
 final ditch and here I said that 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.550
 even if the match can not run against 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.459
 virtus.pro will be just three cards 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.519
 it's all the same already three maps 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.489
 the sensor is unlikely to give will be able to give 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.440
 rather want to give victory 30 here 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.060
 Suppose if virtus.pro will play 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.319
 so there can be very persistent 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.700
 struggle suppose of course the score is 32 and with 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.760
 each new virtus.pro card will be 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.670
 getting tired this will be evening 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.489
 and it is possible that the skull actually 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.579
 can move to the night and have virtus.pro 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.900
 already start as they say melt brains 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.180
 besides virtus.pro themselves constantly 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.480
 probably guys complain about it 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.790
 start drinking some vitamins but often 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.350
 you can hear in the interview there it is a pity well not 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.000
 so that they are so called simply 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.130
 speak as a fact we were already strong 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.140
 tired we could not show there 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.420
 good game your best because we 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.940
 were very tired and this here for example 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.799
 in the summer spoke in an interview about their 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.930
 bad performance on mlg 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:56.430
 so here again virtus.pro can 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:59.850
 turn out to be very tired and I think that 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.760
 na'vi here have virtually every chance 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.950
 to win and very small chance but at 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.530
 virtus.pro or humiliating paratroopers pajamas 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.870
 will get the same situation but they 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.480
 pajamas I think they are generally no chance they 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.940
 frankly weaker on the head than na'vi and 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.519
 virtus.pro on chances there is virtus.pro and 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.750
 yesterday in the match against navi showed that 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:24.330
 they are basically equal m i think they are 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.310
 failed the first peak completely in the first 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.940
 the game and in the third game also started something 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.680
 kink 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.680
 lunkina hardline but all this is not 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.900
 very standard and here it is possible again 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.330
 same because of the peak 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.400
 there they lost yesterday this match but this 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.590
 it doesn't matter anymore so virtus.pro 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.510
 more than they can fight na'vi 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.390
 can win but because of fatigue 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.610
 accumulated here for yesterday's long 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.300
 day and for today this one without the top 5 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:55.050
 match, I think it should be fresh can 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.420
 easy to take yourself away so much victory but 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.700
 in fact all my predictions and 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.650
 I hope Iâ€™m right 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.780
 then I can deliver and achivka that 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.440
 predicted all the results of the whole tournament 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.730
 absolutely every match if not right then 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.610
 it doesn't matter but you don't get angry 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.300
 once again it is a sport and can win here 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.090
 any 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.550
 anybody and i don't guarantee anything i 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.550
 just about 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.320
 I throw in such my vision and 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.630
 some analytics coming from here 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.780
 Seen me on this same tournament 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.940
 well and from some factors to all all 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.970
 thanks who looked to see you soon 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.970
 until
