00:00:13.584 --> 00:00:15.584
 When it is down 'in the living room all the real fun happens? 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.260
 A nursing life is too predictable and sad, 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.000
 even Santa Claus looks like a tourist! 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.390
 The gentle Christmas tones, and cake men and wives

 Out with pixie-hops, out with nettle beer, out with cousin - they're all full of moths! 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.920
 For my sake ka 'in distant boat' Christmas tree and star - 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.060
 I want it in - sound in it - more party and colors the day long, in it.

00:01:17.531 --> 00:01:24.031

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.900
 Why is the hat red when it can be violet? And why is that tip when it can be a cap? 

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:35.324

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.830

 The Christmas we have today kicks off too low a gear - I press the nail all the way while I say: 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.200
 I want it in - song in it - more ramasjang and twenty and bang in it.
