that's<00:04:28.260> something<00:04:28.650> that<00:04:28.770> most<00:04:28.890> people<00:04:29.040> don't

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
that's something that most people don't

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.560 
that's something that most people don't
know<00:04:29.610> either<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:30.030> role<00:04:30.210> that<00:04:30.390> your

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
know either the role that your

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.390 
know either the role that your
grandfather<00:04:31.080> played<00:04:31.350> and<00:04:31.920> I<00:04:31.980> also<00:04:32.130> thought

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
grandfather played and I also thought

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.580 
grandfather played and I also thought
this<00:04:32.580> was<00:04:32.760> such<00:04:32.910> a<00:04:32.940> gruesome<00:04:33.510> detail<00:04:34.020> too<00:04:34.260> and

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
this was such a gruesome detail too and

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.110 
this was such a gruesome detail too and
I<00:04:35.130> think<00:04:35.190> it's<00:04:35.430> something<00:04:35.700> people<00:04:35.850> don't

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
I think it's something people don't

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.970 
I think it's something people don't
think<00:04:36.420> about<00:04:36.540> that<00:04:36.870> when<00:04:37.080> a<00:04:37.110> horrible<00:04:37.710> crime

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
think about that when a horrible crime

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.850 
think about that when a horrible crime
occurs<00:04:38.840> somebody<00:04:39.840> has<00:04:40.050> to<00:04:40.200> go<00:04:40.350> and<00:04:40.500> clean<00:04:40.710> it

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
occurs somebody has to go and clean it

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.220 
occurs somebody has to go and clean it
up<00:04:41.030> somebody<00:04:42.030> has<00:04:42.240> to<00:04:42.390> go<00:04:42.510> in<00:04:42.690> there<00:04:42.870> and<00:04:43.050> take

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
up somebody has to go in there and take

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:44.450 
up somebody has to go in there and take
care<00:04:43.380> of<00:04:43.440> it<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:43.740> as<00:04:43.830> it<00:04:43.950> turns<00:04:44.130> out<00:04:44.250> it<00:04:44.370> was

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
care of it and as it turns out it was

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.670 
care of it and as it turns out it was
your<00:04:44.580> grandfather<00:04:45.150> who<00:04:45.420> did<00:04:45.600> that<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:46.050> then

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.580 
your grandfather who did that and then
later<00:04:46.920> on<00:04:47.070> to<00:04:47.430> read<00:04:47.670> that<00:04:48.030> the<00:04:48.570> Sharon<00:04:49.560> Tate

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
later on to read that the Sharon Tate

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.590 
later on to read that the Sharon Tate
was<00:04:49.890> renting<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:50.370> house<00:04:50.520> and<00:04:50.880> then<00:04:51.090> your

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
was renting the house and then your

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.400 
was renting the house and then your
family<00:04:52.050> was<00:04:52.200> sued<00:04:52.470> for<00:04:52.500> damages<00:04:52.890> to<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.490> house

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
family was sued for damages to the house

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.500 
family was sued for damages to the house
exactly<00:04:55.410> I<00:04:55.560> thought<00:04:56.550> that<00:04:56.730> was<00:04:56.850> it<00:04:57.180> all<00:04:57.300> that

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
exactly I thought that was it all that

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.210 
exactly I thought that was it all that
yeah<00:04:57.870> so<00:04:58.080> your<00:04:58.230> grandfather<00:04:58.530> had<00:04:58.860> to<00:04:58.980> go<00:04:59.070> and

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
yeah so your grandfather had to go and

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.100 
yeah so your grandfather had to go and
clean<00:04:59.430> up<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.970> mess<00:05:00.000> that<00:05:00.210> was<00:05:00.480> left<00:05:00.540> and<00:05:00.960> then

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
clean up the mess that was left and then

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.510 
clean up the mess that was left and then
your<00:05:01.290> families<00:05:01.650> later<00:05:01.860> sued<00:05:02.100> I<00:05:02.190> just<00:05:02.400> thought

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
your families later sued I just thought

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.420 
your families later sued I just thought
that<00:05:02.670> was<00:05:02.760> such<00:05:02.910> a<00:05:02.940> cruel<00:05:03.800> cruel<00:05:04.800> and<00:05:05.070> unkind

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
that was such a cruel cruel and unkind

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.970 
that was such a cruel cruel and unkind
thing<00:05:05.730> it<00:05:06.390> is<00:05:06.600> he<00:05:06.810> you<00:05:07.200> know<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.620> absolute

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
thing it is he you know the absolute

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.590 
thing it is he you know the absolute
worst<00:05:08.580> thing<00:05:08.730> that<00:05:08.850> can<00:05:09.150> happen<00:05:09.270> to<00:05:09.480> a

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
worst thing that can happen to a

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.020 
worst thing that can happen to a
victim's<00:05:09.990> family<00:05:10.410> and<00:05:10.590> and<00:05:11.190> the<00:05:11.490> callousness

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
victim's family and and the callousness

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.970 
victim's family and and the callousness
in<00:05:12.360> which<00:05:12.510> the<00:05:12.660> owner<00:05:13.650> of<00:05:13.890> the<00:05:13.980> house<00:05:14.160> did<00:05:14.430> that

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
in which the owner of the house did that

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.700 
in which the owner of the house did that
to<00:05:16.980> blame<00:05:17.550> them<00:05:17.790> or<00:05:17.940> you<00:05:18.180> know<00:05:18.270> he<00:05:18.420> basically

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
to blame them or you know he basically

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.950 
to blame them or you know he basically
you<00:05:19.710> know<00:05:19.740> blaming<00:05:20.250> the<00:05:20.370> victims<00:05:20.730> and<00:05:21.510> finally

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
you know blaming the victims and finally

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.740 
you know blaming the victims and finally
in<00:05:22.020> a<00:05:22.190> $250,000<00:05:23.190> lawsuit<00:05:23.820> for<00:05:24.060> damages<00:05:24.270> the

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
in a $250,000 lawsuit for damages the

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.290

same<00:05:24.990> during<00:05:25.380> the<00:05:25.650> murders<00:05:26.010> I<00:05:26.220> don't<00:05:27.000> think<00:05:27.210> it

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
same during the murders I don't think it

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.520 
same during the murders I don't think it
gets<00:05:27.390> any<00:05:27.510> worse<00:05:27.660> than<00:05:27.900> that<00:05:27.960> in<00:05:28.140> the<00:05:28.200> vision

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
gets any worse than that in the vision

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.110 
gets any worse than that in the vision
about<00:05:28.770> of<00:05:29.670> a<00:05:29.820> father<00:05:30.090> on<00:05:30.360> his<00:05:30.480> hands<00:05:30.720> and<00:05:30.900> knees

it's just really horrible and he

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.160 
it's just really horrible and he
