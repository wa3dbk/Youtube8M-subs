various<00:00:50.850> drills<00:00:51.120> together<00:00:51.570> which<00:00:51.809> would<00:00:51.960> be

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
various drills together which would be

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.040 
various drills together which would be
pretty<00:00:52.620> quite<00:00:52.890> challenging<00:00:53.390> but<00:00:54.390> very<00:00:54.570> good

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
to match now you no longer have to be

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.799 
to match now you no longer have to be
placed<00:00:58.530> into<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> arena<00:00:59.070> us<00:00:59.879> like<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.660> just

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
placed into the arena us like to just

randomly keep the ball a goalkeeper you

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.039 
randomly keep the ball a goalkeeper you
would<00:01:02.789> put<00:01:02.969> into<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> skill<00:01:03.480> game<00:01:03.510> instead

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
would put into a skill game instead

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.539 
would put into a skill game instead
which<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> lot<00:01:04.739> better<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.040> my<00:01:05.129> opinion<00:01:05.159> as

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
which is a lot better in my opinion as

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.070 
which is a lot better in my opinion as
it<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.030> help<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.330> improve<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.780> your<00:01:06.900> play

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
you're passing the stuff for air but i

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.440 
you're passing the stuff for air but i
think<00:01:11.070> they<00:01:11.280> are<00:01:11.310> trying<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.670> promote<00:01:11.939> manual

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
think they are trying to promote manual

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.170 
think they are trying to promote manual
passing<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.229> play<00:01:13.799> as<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.070> lot<00:01:14.729> of<00:01:14.820> these<00:01:14.909> are

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
passing and play as a lot of these are

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.450 
passing and play as a lot of these are
set<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.659> manual<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.710> depends<00:01:17.130> what<00:01:17.220> people

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
set to manual it depends what people

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.649 
set to manual it depends what people
think<00:01:17.580> about<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.909> i<00:01:17.970> actually<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> good

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
think about that i actually it's a good

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.719 
think about that i actually it's a good
idea<00:01:18.750> as<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.590> makes<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> game<00:01:20.009> more<00:01:20.250> free<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
idea as it makes the game more free to

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.359 
idea as it makes the game more free to
play<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:22.380> basically<00:01:22.470> pick<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> player<00:01:23.189> from

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
play and so basically pick a player from

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.070 
play and so basically pick a player from
your<00:01:23.549> set<00:01:23.729> favorite<00:01:24.090> team<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.509> then<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.930> go

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
your set favorite team and then you go

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.590 
your set favorite team and then you go
on<00:01:25.110> from<00:01:25.470> there<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:26.520> game's<00:01:26.729> chosen<00:01:27.180> few<00:01:27.540> are

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
on from there the game's chosen few are

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.630 
on from there the game's chosen few are
there<00:01:28.110> at<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.320> random<00:01:28.560> initially<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:29.579> then

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
there at a random initially but then

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.039 
there at a random initially but then
they<00:01:29.939> start<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> push<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.509> towards<00:01:30.810> skill

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
they start to push you towards skill

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.929 
they start to push you towards skill
areas<00:01:31.409> you've<00:01:31.770> not<00:01:31.950> made<00:01:32.040> much<00:01:32.250> progress<00:01:32.310> on

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
areas you've not made much progress on

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.969 
areas you've not made much progress on
all<00:01:32.970> like<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.259> i<00:01:34.290> think<00:01:34.380> they<00:01:34.590> go<00:01:34.740> by<00:01:34.920> this

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
all like and so i think they go by this

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.130 
all like and so i think they go by this

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
in game actually Sifl you don't do that

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.660 
in game actually Sifl you don't do that
much<00:01:37.350> thailand<00:01:37.710> dream<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.070> they<00:01:38.400> will<00:01:38.520> put

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
much thailand dream and they will put

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.460 
much thailand dream and they will put
you<00:01:38.759> onto<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.060> skill<00:01:39.390> where<00:01:39.570> skill<00:01:40.140> arena

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
you onto that skill where skill arena

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.800 
you onto that skill where skill arena
which<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.710> pretty<00:01:40.890> cool<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.659> but<00:01:42.659> if<00:01:42.720> you

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
which is pretty cool and but if you

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.270 
which is pretty cool and but if you
don't<00:01:42.960> want<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.229> have<00:01:43.350> them<00:01:43.500> generate<00:01:43.920> for<00:01:44.159> you

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
don't want to have them generate for you

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.590 
don't want to have them generate for you
there<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> skill<00:01:45.119> game<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.450> can

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
there is a skill game you can

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.010 
there is a skill game you can
specifically<00:01:46.200> set<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.810> hub

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
specifically set and that is on the hub

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.859 
specifically set and that is on the hub
manually<00:01:49.860> apparently<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.759> for<00:01:51.540> most<00:01:51.659> players

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869

the<00:01:52.170> bronze<00:01:52.380> challenge<00:01:52.680> will<00:01:52.770> be<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.920> breeze

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
the bronze challenge will be a breeze

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.429 
the bronze challenge will be a breeze
but<00:01:53.640> as<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.970> progress<00:01:54.540> further<00:01:54.899> you'll<00:01:55.229> see

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
but as you progress further you'll see

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.109 
but as you progress further you'll see

you have or by turn the control settings
to<00:02:08.250> manual<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:08.910> they<00:02:09.599> either<00:02:09.780> done<00:02:10.229> by<00:02:10.379> point

system attempts or a time completion so

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.980 
system attempts or a time completion so
I've<00:02:14.070> see<00:02:14.340> yo<00:02:14.910> your<00:02:15.150> arena<00:02:15.360> wait<00:02:15.630> might<00:02:15.840> be<00:02:15.960> a

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
I've see yo your arena wait might be a

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.890 
I've see yo your arena wait might be a
bit<00:02:16.170> longer<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:17.360> but<00:02:18.360> I'm<00:02:18.420> pretty<00:02:18.600> certain

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
bit longer and but I'm pretty certain

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.630 
bit longer and but I'm pretty certain
this<00:02:19.050> would<00:02:19.200> be<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.380> benefit<00:02:20.190> for<00:02:20.370> everyone

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
this would be a benefit for everyone

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.580 
this would be a benefit for everyone
playing<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:21.180> there's<00:02:21.690> also<00:02:21.870> leaderboards

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
playing so there's also leaderboards

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.660 
playing so there's also leaderboards
which<00:02:22.740> can<00:02:22.980> be<00:02:23.070> used<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.280> compare<00:02:23.550> your

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
which can be used to compare your

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.660 
which can be used to compare your
rankings<00:02:24.090> friends<00:02:24.650> globally<00:02:25.650> or<00:02:25.920> like<00:02:26.190> local

rankings friends globally or like local

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.210 
rankings friends globally or like local
and<00:02:26.820> off<00:02:27.660> some<00:02:27.990> incentive<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.800> return<00:02:29.100> to

and off some incentive to return to

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.280 
and off some incentive to return to
complete<00:02:29.520> challenges<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.240> if<00:02:30.450> you're<00:02:30.930> very

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
complete challenges so if you're very

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.110 
complete challenges so if you're very
competitive<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.190> will<00:02:32.340> want<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.610> be<00:02:32.730> top<00:02:33.000> of

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
apparently this is the overall feel
