00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.250 
me just go ahead and say that it is
pitch<00:02:44.570> black<00:02:44.600> out<00:02:45.170> here<00:02:45.500> right<00:02:46.070> now<00:02:46.100> and

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.450 

except<00:02:51.260> for<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.470> little<00:02:51.560> bit<00:02:51.890> of<00:02:51.980> light<00:02:52.160> coming

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
except for a little bit of light coming

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
except for a little bit of light coming
off<00:02:52.640> of<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:53.150> out<00:02:54.080> of<00:02:54.170> that<00:02:54.290> window<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:55.480> I'm

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
off of that out of that window and I'm

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.420 
off of that out of that window and I'm
telling<00:02:57.110> you<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.260> whenever<00:02:57.739> I<00:02:57.890> look<00:02:58.160> at<00:02:58.280> it

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
telling you that whenever I look at it

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.490 
telling you that whenever I look at it
with<00:02:58.580> the<00:02:58.730> naked<00:02:58.880> eyes<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.930> grass<00:03:00.200> that<00:03:00.440> you

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
with the naked eyes that grass that you

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.420 
with the naked eyes that grass that you
see<00:03:00.680> there<00:03:00.860> is<00:03:01.040> completely<00:03:01.850> black<00:03:04.090> so<00:03:06.430> it

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
see there is completely black so it

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.630 
see there is completely black so it
definitely<00:03:10.420> mess<00:03:11.420> with<00:03:11.600> a<00:03:11.630> few<00:03:11.840> settings<00:03:12.200> here

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
definitely mess with a few settings here

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.920 
definitely mess with a few settings here
because<00:03:13.640> if<00:03:13.820> you<00:03:13.940> don't<00:03:14.060> hold<00:03:14.270> it<00:03:14.420> real<00:03:14.630> still

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
because if you don't hold it real still

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.460 
because if you don't hold it real still
when<00:03:15.140> you<00:03:15.230> go

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
when you go

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.420 
when you go
so<00:03:17.470> here<00:03:17.680> you<00:03:17.769> go

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.789 

this<00:03:21.030> might<00:03:21.269> be<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:23.510> view<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.750> I<00:03:24.810> can<00:03:25.019> do<00:03:25.200> I'll

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
this might be a view that I can do I'll

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.800 
this might be a view that I can do I'll
say<00:03:26.459> while<00:03:26.730> I'm<00:03:26.760> working<00:03:27.030> on<00:03:27.269> a<00:03:27.329> gun<00:03:29.810> without

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
say while I'm working on a gun without

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.720 
say while I'm working on a gun without
having<00:03:31.349> to<00:03:31.409> mess<00:03:31.620> with<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.040> camera<00:03:32.489> up<00:03:32.519> here

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
having to mess with the camera up here

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.759 
having to mess with the camera up here
behind<00:03:33.000> me<00:03:33.269> I<00:03:35.030> can<00:03:36.030> just<00:03:36.209> go<00:03:36.540> ahead<00:03:36.569> in<00:03:37.530> all

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
behind me I can just go ahead in all

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.250 
behind me I can just go ahead in all
something<00:03:38.519> far<00:03:39.209> as<00:03:39.359> where<00:03:39.540> I<00:03:39.569> want<00:03:39.840> camera

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
something far as where I want camera

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.640 
something far as where I want camera
down<00:03:40.700> and

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.020 

I<00:03:44.739> can<00:03:45.430> do<00:03:46.950> whatever<00:03:47.950> I<00:03:48.220> need<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.459> do<00:03:48.700> here

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
I can do whatever I need to do here

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.820 
I can do whatever I need to do here
we've<00:03:49.599> got<00:03:49.750> three<00:03:50.079> wide<00:03:50.439> angle<00:03:51.629> on<00:03:52.629> the<00:03:52.780> lens

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.040 

so<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.310> head<00:03:56.700> this<00:03:56.880> off<00:03:57.090> somewhere<00:03:57.690> off<00:03:57.990> the

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
so I head this off somewhere off the

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.309 
so I head this off somewhere off the
side

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
side

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.520 
side
I'll<00:04:00.650> need<00:04:00.859> right<00:04:01.129> there

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.130
