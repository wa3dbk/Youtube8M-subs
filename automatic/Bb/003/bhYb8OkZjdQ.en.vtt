00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.970 
wake up one day and we start wearing
women<00:04:09.419> or<00:04:09.569> men's<00:04:09.780> clothing<00:04:10.139> and<00:04:10.470> we<00:04:10.590> start<00:04:10.859> to

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
women or men's clothing and we start to

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.550 
women or men's clothing and we start to
look<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.400> act<00:04:11.699> that<00:04:12.180> way<00:04:12.389> when<00:04:13.109> that's<00:04:13.349> just

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
look and act that way when that's just

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.140 
look and act that way when that's just
not<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.769> case<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:15.199> I<00:04:16.400> think<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:17.669> it<00:04:17.910> just

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
not the case and I think that it just

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.839 
not the case and I think that it just
comes<00:04:18.359> with<00:04:18.449> the<00:04:19.280> privilege<00:04:20.280> of<00:04:20.519> class

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
comes with the privilege of class

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:25.250 
comes with the privilege of class
systems<00:04:21.359> in<00:04:21.510> America<00:04:22.019> I<00:04:22.229> mean<00:04:23.270> her<00:04:24.270> is<00:04:24.599> able<00:04:24.990> to

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
systems in America I mean her is able to

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.070 
systems in America I mean her is able to
have<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.979> means<00:04:26.220> to<00:04:26.400> just<00:04:26.789> fly<00:04:27.659> to<00:04:27.690> wherever

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
have the means to just fly to wherever

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.780 
have the means to just fly to wherever
and<00:04:28.590> spend<00:04:28.919> as<00:04:29.039> much<00:04:29.219> money<00:04:29.280> as<00:04:29.640> needed<00:04:30.210> to

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
and spend as much money as needed to

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.030 
and spend as much money as needed to
look<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.900> way<00:04:32.050> they<00:04:32.080> would<00:04:32.440> like<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:32.860> look

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
look the way they would like to look

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.000 
look the way they would like to look
when<00:04:33.850> like<00:04:34.540> I<00:04:34.690> said<00:04:34.750> ninety-five<00:04:35.560> percent<00:04:35.740> of

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
when like I said ninety-five percent of

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.120 
when like I said ninety-five percent of
us<00:04:36.130> we<00:04:37.030> don't<00:04:37.150> have<00:04:37.330> that<00:04:37.390> means<00:04:37.870> so<00:04:38.800> that's<00:04:39.010> my

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
us we don't have that means so that's my

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.730 
us we don't have that means so that's my
biggest<00:04:39.730> thing<00:04:40.000> that<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:40.570> felt<00:04:40.960> stuck<00:04:41.410> out<00:04:41.590> the

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
biggest thing that I felt stuck out the

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.510 
biggest thing that I felt stuck out the
most<00:04:41.770> is<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.280> division<00:04:43.060> of<00:04:43.150> class<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:44.520> the

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
most is the division of class and the

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.660 
most is the division of class and the
privilege<00:04:46.090> that<00:04:46.920> this<00:04:48.960> born<00:04:49.960> white<00:04:50.670> male

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
privilege that this born white male

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.810 
privilege that this born white male
white<00:04:52.330> straight<00:04:52.630> male<00:04:53.010> acquires<00:04:54.010> money<00:04:54.520> and

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
white straight male acquires money and

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.050 
white straight male acquires money and
can<00:04:55.330> change<00:04:55.630> like<00:04:56.200> that<00:04:56.230> I<00:04:56.740> don't<00:04:57.700> know<00:04:57.880> the

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
can change like that I don't know the

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.160 
can change like that I don't know the
whole<00:04:58.290> history<00:04:59.290> of<00:04:59.620> her<00:05:00.010> and<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:01.840> small

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
whole history of her and the small

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.530 
whole history of her and the small
details<00:05:02.410> they<00:05:02.890> gave<00:05:03.100> us<00:05:03.580> in<00:05:03.880> the<00:05:04.120> interview

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
details they gave us in the interview

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.700 
details they gave us in the interview
we're<00:05:04.810> pretty<00:05:04.990> much<00:05:05.200> that<00:05:05.880> her<00:05:07.500> didn't<00:05:08.500> have

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
we're pretty much that her didn't have

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.890 
we're pretty much that her didn't have
this<00:05:09.100> spectacular<00:05:09.940> life<00:05:10.180> their<00:05:10.510> whole<00:05:10.690> life

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
this spectacular life their whole life

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.900 
this spectacular life their whole life
and<00:05:11.170> worked<00:05:11.680> really<00:05:11.890> hard<00:05:12.010> to<00:05:12.430> get<00:05:12.550> where<00:05:12.790> they

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
and worked really hard to get where they

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.970 
and worked really hard to get where they
are<00:05:12.940> I<00:05:13.470> find<00:05:14.470> ambition<00:05:15.370> in<00:05:15.610> that<00:05:16.030> and

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
are I find ambition in that and

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:22.290 
are I find ambition in that and
motivation<00:05:17.980> but<00:05:18.460> at<00:05:18.760> the<00:05:19.180> same<00:05:19.420> time<00:05:21.300> there's

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
motivation but at the same time there's

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.170 
motivation but at the same time there's
still<00:05:22.660> a<00:05:22.690> big<00:05:23.370> difference<00:05:24.370> between<00:05:24.790> the

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
still a big difference between the

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.440 
still a big difference between the
average<00:05:25.630> trans<00:05:26.470> women's<00:05:27.090> struggle<00:05:28.090> of

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
average trans women's struggle of

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.010 
average trans women's struggle of
transitioning<00:05:29.260> and<00:05:30.090> hers<00:05:31.170> and<00:05:32.490> their

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
transitioning and hers and their

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.380 
transitioning and hers and their
transition<00:05:35.020> it's<00:05:35.890> a<00:05:36.070> big<00:05:36.280> gap<00:05:36.520> and<00:05:36.790> I<00:05:37.030> think<00:05:37.270> it

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
transition it's a big gap and I think it

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.810 
transition it's a big gap and I think it
should<00:05:37.540> be<00:05:37.600> acknowledged<00:05:38.230> but<00:05:38.680> I<00:05:38.980> also<00:05:39.370> like

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
should be acknowledged but I also like

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.120 
should be acknowledged but I also like
to<00:05:39.850> see<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.390> big<00:05:40.630> realm<00:05:41.440> of<00:05:41.590> things<00:05:41.830> I

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
to see the big realm of things I

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.540 
to see the big realm of things I
