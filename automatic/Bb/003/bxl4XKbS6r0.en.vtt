anymore<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> pedestal<00:01:33.680> this<00:01:34.680> is

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
anymore this is the pedestal this is

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.590 
anymore this is the pedestal this is
where<00:01:36.270> it's<00:01:36.479> split<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.820> can<00:01:38.820> say<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.180> all

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
where it's split I can say I have all

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.630 
where it's split I can say I have all
the<00:01:39.780> segments<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:41.009> be<00:01:41.130> put<00:01:41.400> back

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the segments so it can be put back

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.230 
the segments so it can be put back
together<00:01:41.869> at<00:01:42.869> one<00:01:43.110> time<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> past

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
together at one time in the past

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.539 
together at one time in the past
somebody'd<00:01:45.240> use<00:01:45.479> plumber's<00:01:45.899> tape<00:01:46.399> to<00:01:47.399> hold

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
somebody'd use plumber's tape to hold

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.649 
somebody'd use plumber's tape to hold
the<00:01:47.729> different<00:01:48.180> pieces<00:01:48.360> together<00:01:49.700> but<00:01:50.700> you

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
the different pieces together but you

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.030 
the different pieces together but you
can<00:01:51.840> see<00:01:51.990> they<00:01:52.140> went<00:01:52.290> ahead<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.710> split

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
can see they went ahead and split

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.359 
can see they went ahead and split
somewhere<00:01:53.579> else<00:01:54.979> here<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:57.290> another<00:01:58.290> part<00:01:59.280> of
