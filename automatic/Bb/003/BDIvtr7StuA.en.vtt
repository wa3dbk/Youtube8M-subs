all<00:00:06.600> right<00:00:06.740> now<00:00:08.360> we<00:00:09.360> need<00:00:09.540> to<00:00:09.719> learn<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.900> new<00:00:10.139> cut

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:10.379 
all right now we need to learn a new cut

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:12.740 
all right now we need to learn a new cut
I've<00:00:11.190> already<00:00:11.610> done<00:00:11.790> what<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.059> can<00:00:12.180> do<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.629> the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
I've already done what I can do and the

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.629 
I've already done what I can do and the
pulling<00:00:13.049> cut<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.410> probably<00:00:14.250> going<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.490> leave

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
pulling cut is probably going to leave

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.330 
pulling cut is probably going to leave
some<00:00:14.880> tool<00:00:15.059> marks<00:00:15.330> behind<00:00:15.740> and<00:00:16.740> remember<00:00:17.220> when

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
some tool marks behind and remember when

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.320 
some tool marks behind and remember when
I<00:00:17.369> was<00:00:17.550> talking<00:00:18.000> about<00:00:18.060> scraping<00:00:18.710> and<00:00:19.710> the

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
I was talking about scraping and the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.880 
I was talking about scraping and the
90-degree<00:00:21.330> rule<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:22.259> how<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:22.470> closed<00:00:22.860> that

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
90-degree rule and how I closed that

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.190 
90-degree rule and how I closed that
flute<00:00:23.399> up<00:00:23.610> and<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.419> bottom<00:00:24.720> edge<00:00:24.840> would<00:00:25.020> never

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.200 
flute up and the bottom edge would never

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.979 
flute up and the bottom edge would never
touch<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:26.160> wood<00:00:26.369> at<00:00:26.520> less<00:00:26.700> at<00:00:27.270> more<00:00:27.570> than<00:00:27.720> 90

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:27.989 
touch the wood at less at more than 90

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.019 
touch the wood at less at more than 90
degrees<00:00:28.259> always<00:00:28.619> less<00:00:28.829> you<00:00:29.489> know<00:00:29.579> all<00:00:29.820> that

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
degrees always less you know all that

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.870

conversation<00:00:30.329> was<00:00:30.960> talking<00:00:31.320> about<00:00:31.380> scraping

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
conversation was talking about scraping

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.410 
conversation was talking about scraping
alright<00:00:32.930> now<00:00:33.930> what<00:00:34.200> we're<00:00:34.320> gonna<00:00:34.410> do<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.739> add

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
alright now what we're gonna do is add

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.259 
alright now what we're gonna do is add
cheer<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:37.410> our<00:00:37.440> scraping<00:00:37.890> coat<00:00:38.039> now<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.120> is

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
cheer to our scraping coat now this is

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:42.889 
cheer to our scraping coat now this is
spelled<00:00:39.510> correctly<00:00:40.429> shear<00:00:41.429> meaning<00:00:42.000> scrape

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
spelled correctly shear meaning scrape

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.549 
spelled correctly shear meaning scrape
on<00:00:43.199> a<00:00:43.260> steep<00:00:44.219> slope<00:00:44.809> so<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.140> not<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
on a steep slope so this is not the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.290 
on a steep slope so this is not the
shear<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.190> would<00:00:47.370> be<00:00:47.489> spelled<00:00:47.789> for<00:00:48.030> shearing

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
shear that would be spelled for shearing

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.989 
shear that would be spelled for shearing
scissors<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.350> cutting<00:00:49.649> actions<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.850> things

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:50.999 
scissors and cutting actions and things

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:53.360 
scissors and cutting actions and things
like<00:00:51.179> this<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.749> just<00:00:52.050> means<00:00:52.260> scrape<00:00:53.039> on<00:00:53.309> a

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
like this so this just means scrape on a

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.310 
like this so this just means scrape on a
steep<00:00:53.879> slope<00:00:53.909> so<00:00:54.780> we're<00:00:54.899> gonna<00:00:55.019> take<00:00:55.260> that

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
steep slope so we're gonna take that

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.139 
steep slope so we're gonna take that
same<00:00:55.530> scraping<00:00:56.219> cut<00:00:56.429> we're<00:00:56.640> gonna<00:00:56.730> roll<00:00:56.999> that

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
same scraping cut we're gonna roll that

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.389 
same scraping cut we're gonna roll that

degree<00:01:04.019> peeling<00:01:04.979> action<00:01:05.370> again<00:01:06.000> I'm<00:01:06.120> going<00:01:06.270> to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
degree peeling action again I'm going to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.420 
degree peeling action again I'm going to
use<00:01:06.510> my<00:01:06.810> pencil<00:01:07.590> trick<00:01:08.120> to<00:01:09.120> slice<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.980> fibers

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
use my pencil trick to slice the fibers

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.570 
use my pencil trick to slice the fibers
downhill<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:13.140> with<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.530> scraping<00:01:13.830> action<00:01:14.430> of

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
downhill but with the scraping action of

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.680 
downhill but with the scraping action of
the<00:01:14.970> burr<00:01:15.210> now<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.490> whenever<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
the burr now so whenever I on the

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.970 
the burr now so whenever I on the
outside<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.170> bowl<00:01:19.320> whenever<00:01:19.710> I'm<00:01:19.800> on<00:01:19.860> the

outside of the bowl whenever I'm on the
outside<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.370> bowl<00:01:20.520> I'll<00:01:20.640> always<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:21.000> my

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
outside of the bowl I'll always have my

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.480 
outside of the bowl I'll always have my
handle<00:01:21.480> down<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.560> flute<00:01:22.860> pointing<00:01:23.400> in

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
handle down and the flute pointing in

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.380 
handle down and the flute pointing in
the<00:01:23.580> direction<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.300> the<00:01:24.780> 45<00:01:25.410> degree

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
the direction so that the 45 degree

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.060 
the direction so that the 45 degree
shearing<00:01:27.390> angle<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.990> always<00:01:28.440> going<00:01:28.650> downhill

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
shearing angle is always going downhill

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.730 
shearing angle is always going downhill
we're<00:01:30.060> gonna<00:01:30.150> lower<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.990> handle<00:01:31.350> way<00:01:31.530> down

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
we're gonna lower the handle way down

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.340 
we're gonna lower the handle way down
here<00:01:32.120> and<00:01:33.120> I'm<00:01:33.270> gonna<00:01:33.390> close<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:33.870> flute<00:01:34.110> and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
here and I'm gonna close the flute and

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.160 
here and I'm gonna close the flute and
I'm<00:01:34.830> gonna<00:01:34.950> be<00:01:35.160> on<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.910> 45<00:01:36.360> degree<00:01:36.540> angle<00:01:36.720> with

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
I'm gonna be on a 45 degree angle with

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.770 
I'm gonna be on a 45 degree angle with
the<00:01:37.350> slicing<00:01:38.010> edge<00:01:38.130> now<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> whole<00:01:39.510> new

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
the slicing edge now we have a whole new

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.740 
the slicing edge now we have a whole new
attitude<00:01:40.070> to<00:01:41.070> think<00:01:41.310> about<00:01:41.520> here<00:01:41.760> this<00:01:42.300> is<00:01:42.510> not

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
attitude to think about here this is not

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.200 
attitude to think about here this is not
a<00:01:43.530> cut<00:01:44.130> that's<00:01:44.340> going<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.550> take<00:01:44.760> much<00:01:44.970> wood

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
a cut that's going to take much wood

a cut that's going to take much wood
away<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:46.170> very<00:01:46.470> delicate<00:01:47.060> very<00:01:48.060> deliberate

just ever so gently every part of my
body<00:02:15.239> is<00:02:15.450> just<00:02:15.959> moving<00:02:16.739> with<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.760> tool

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
body is just moving with the tool

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.380 
body is just moving with the tool
so<00:02:19.049> tour<00:02:19.230> us<00:02:19.409> I<00:02:19.620> got<00:02:20.310> some<00:02:20.549> issues<00:02:20.670> here<00:02:21.060> first

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
so tour us I got some issues here first

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.530 
so tour us I got some issues here first
of<00:02:21.510> all<00:02:21.659> I<00:02:22.610> wish<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.730> had<00:02:23.849> a<00:02:23.879> better<00:02:24.090> tool<00:02:24.330> rest

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
of all I wish I had a better tool rest

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.050 
of all I wish I had a better tool rest
because<00:02:24.959> this<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.409> pushing<00:02:25.950> me<00:02:26.069> way<00:02:26.310> away<00:02:26.640> here

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
because this is pushing me way away here

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.660 
because this is pushing me way away here
but<00:02:27.209> we'll<00:02:27.959> have<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.170> deal<00:02:28.379> with<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.680> but

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
but we'll have to deal with that but

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.289 
but we'll have to deal with that but
there's<00:02:29.879> another<00:02:30.120> issue<00:02:30.330> in<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:32.730> shoe<00:02:33.000> scrape

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
there's another issue in the shoe scrape

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.059 
there's another issue in the shoe scrape
that's<00:02:33.540> much<00:02:33.840> much<00:02:34.200> different<00:02:34.409> than<00:02:34.769> any

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
that's much much different than any

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.699 
that's much much different than any
other<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:35.549> tools<00:02:35.849> in<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.870> shoe<00:02:37.079> scrape<00:02:37.409> I

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
other of the tools in the shoe scrape I

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.930 
other of the tools in the shoe scrape I
have<00:02:38.159> the<00:02:38.310> handle<00:02:38.790> down<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:40.440> tool

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
have the handle down and the tool

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.089 
have the handle down and the tool
becomes<00:02:41.940> perpendicular<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.290> tool<00:02:43.530> rest

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
becomes perpendicular to the tool rest

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.970 
becomes perpendicular to the tool rest
I<00:02:44.129> don't<00:02:44.909> tuck<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.450> tool<00:02:45.659> rest<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:46.049> right

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
I don't tuck the tool rest in right

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.759 
I don't tuck the tool rest in right
close<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.610> wood<00:02:47.790> it's<00:02:48.780> always<00:02:49.170> easier<00:02:49.500> to

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
close to the wood it's always easier to

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.190 
close to the wood it's always easier to
get<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.010> handle<00:02:50.340> down<00:02:50.489> if<00:02:50.790> my<00:02:51.510> tool<00:02:51.810> is

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
get the handle down if my tool is

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.680 
get the handle down if my tool is
perpendicular<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.129> tourists<00:02:53.519> now<00:02:54.359> once<00:02:54.540> I

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
perpendicular to the tourists now once I

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.500 
perpendicular to the tourists now once I
come<00:02:54.900> way<00:02:55.079> over<00:02:55.349> here<00:02:55.859> then<00:02:56.489> I<00:02:56.609> find<00:02:56.940> well<00:02:57.480> I

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
come way over here then I find well I

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.630 
come way over here then I find well I
have<00:02:57.750> trouble<00:02:58.049> getting<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.980> handle<00:02:59.280> down<00:02:59.400> the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
have trouble getting the handle down the

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.420 
have trouble getting the handle down the
tourist<00:03:00.060> gets<00:03:00.269> in<00:03:00.420> its<00:03:00.569> own<00:03:00.750> way<00:03:01.160> so<00:03:02.160> I'll<00:03:02.280> have

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
tourist gets in its own way so I'll have

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.369 
tourist gets in its own way so I'll have
to<00:03:02.609> move<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:02.970> to<00:03:03.480> come<00:03:03.659> around<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:03.989> part<00:03:04.290> of

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
to move it to come around that part of

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.890 
to move it to come around that part of
it<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:04.680> while<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.159> tool<00:03:05.420> rest<00:03:06.420> is<00:03:06.659> in<00:03:06.780> this

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
it so while the tool rest is in this

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.449 
it so while the tool rest is in this
position<00:03:07.349> I<00:03:07.470> can<00:03:07.500> only<00:03:07.739> reach<00:03:08.010> maybe<00:03:08.250> the

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
position I can only reach maybe the

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.270 
position I can only reach maybe the
bottom<00:03:08.730> half<00:03:08.909> of<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.409> efficiently<00:03:10.409> if<00:03:11.040> I

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
bottom half of this efficiently if I

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.099 
bottom half of this efficiently if I
stop<00:03:11.609> in<00:03:11.940> one<00:03:12.180> place<00:03:12.510> here<00:03:12.780> it's<00:03:12.900> just<00:03:13.019> gonna

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
stop in one place here it's just gonna

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.080 
stop in one place here it's just gonna
make<00:03:13.319> a<00:03:13.349> divot<00:03:13.829> it's<00:03:13.950> gonna<00:03:14.069> cut<00:03:14.609> a<00:03:14.640> groove<00:03:14.879> in

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
make a divot it's gonna cut a groove in

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.149 
make a divot it's gonna cut a groove in
it<00:03:15.209> if<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.079> go<00:03:16.200> too<00:03:16.260> fast<00:03:16.650> it'll<00:03:16.920> leave<00:03:17.129> a

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
it if I go too fast it'll leave a

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.160 
it if I go too fast it'll leave a
spiraling<00:03:17.760> mark<00:03:18.000> behind<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:18.780> it's<00:03:18.930> just<00:03:19.049> a

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
spiraling mark behind so it's just a

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.399 
spiraling mark behind so it's just a
very<00:03:19.440> slow<00:03:19.859> deliberate<00:03:20.400> pace<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:21.299> tucked<00:03:22.230> my

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
very slow deliberate pace and tucked my

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:23.930 
very slow deliberate pace and tucked my
arms<00:03:22.680> in<00:03:22.859> get<00:03:23.099> in<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.280> comfortable<00:03:23.489> pit

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
arms in get in a comfortable pit

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.740 
arms in get in a comfortable pit
position<00:03:24.840> up<00:03:24.989> on<00:03:25.139> the<00:03:25.260> ball<00:03:25.410> of<00:03:25.620> my<00:03:25.739> feet<00:03:25.980> and

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
position up on the ball of my feet and

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:33.740 
position up on the ball of my feet and
just<00:03:27.750> very<00:03:28.709> gently<00:03:30.470> and<00:03:31.470> if<00:03:31.799> we<00:03:31.950> can<00:03:32.389> see<00:03:33.389> some

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
just very gently and if we can see some

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.569 
just very gently and if we can see some
of<00:03:33.900> these<00:03:33.989> fibers<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.620> see<00:03:34.799> how<00:03:34.980> delicate

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
of these fibers you see how delicate

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.970 
of these fibers you see how delicate
these<00:03:36.060> fibers<00:03:36.510> are<00:03:36.690> I'm<00:03:37.260> not<00:03:37.470> taking<00:03:37.799> much

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
these fibers are I'm not taking much

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.080 
these fibers are I'm not taking much
wood<00:03:38.190> away<00:03:38.430> little<00:03:39.180> tiny<00:03:39.540> angel<00:03:39.989> hairs<00:03:40.200> right

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.589 

and<00:03:45.200> now<00:03:46.200> any<00:03:46.650> of<00:03:46.769> those<00:03:46.889> tool<00:03:47.250> marks<00:03:47.579> and<00:03:47.849> if

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
and now any of those tool marks and if

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.330 
and now any of those tool marks and if
you<00:03:48.690> notice<00:03:49.019> I'm<00:03:49.199> actually<00:03:49.410> going<00:03:49.859> both<00:03:50.310> ways

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
you notice I'm actually going both ways

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.909 
you notice I'm actually going both ways
I'm<00:03:51.209> violating<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:53.090> go<00:03:54.090> downhill<00:03:54.359> rule<00:03:55.079> by

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
I'm violating the go downhill rule by

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.800 
I'm violating the go downhill rule by
moving<00:03:56.370> across<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:56.699> Taurus<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.389> wrong<00:03:57.599> way

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
moving across the Taurus the wrong way

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.069 
moving across the Taurus the wrong way
but<00:03:58.379> the<00:03:58.530> peeling<00:03:59.010> action<00:03:59.430> is<00:03:59.970> peeling<00:04:00.720> it<00:04:00.959> the

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
but the peeling action is peeling it the

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.289 
but the peeling action is peeling it the
correct<00:04:01.319> way<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.400> can<00:04:02.549> actually<00:04:02.819> go<00:04:03.120> the

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
correct way so I can actually go the

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.500 
correct way so I can actually go the
wrong<00:04:03.449> way<00:04:04.129> and<00:04:05.129> in<00:04:05.400> some<00:04:05.579> cases<00:04:05.849> it's<00:04:06.180> even

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
wrong way and in some cases it's even

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.449 
wrong way and in some cases it's even
easier<00:04:07.260> to<00:04:07.410> get<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.560> clean<00:04:07.859> cut<00:04:07.889> going<00:04:08.310> the

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
easier to get a clean cut going the

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.199 
easier to get a clean cut going the
wrong<00:04:08.579> way<00:04:08.639> the<00:04:08.970> way<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:11.730> woods<00:04:11.970> being

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
wrong way the way the the woods being

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.539 
wrong way the way the the woods being
removed<00:04:12.510> okay<00:04:13.019> so<00:04:13.859> now<00:04:14.010> that's<00:04:14.160> a<00:04:14.340> pretty

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
removed okay so now that's a pretty

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.870 
removed okay so now that's a pretty
smooth<00:04:14.989> area<00:04:15.989> right<00:04:16.199> in<00:04:16.229> there<00:04:16.590> I<00:04:16.769> want<00:04:17.669> to<00:04:17.760> get

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
smooth area right in there I want to get

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.060 
smooth area right in there I want to get
the<00:04:18.239> rest<00:04:18.479> of<00:04:18.630> it<00:04:18.780> around<00:04:19.349> here<00:04:19.650> so<00:04:19.799> I<00:04:19.829> got<00:04:19.979> to

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
the rest of it around here so I got to

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.060 
the rest of it around here so I got to
move<00:04:20.160> my<00:04:20.310> tool<00:04:20.489> rust

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.629 

so<00:04:26.070> that<00:04:26.250> I<00:04:26.280> can<00:04:26.550> get<00:04:28.310> perpendicular<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.340> the

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
so that I can get perpendicular to the

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.180 
so that I can get perpendicular to the
tool<00:04:29.850> and<00:04:30.180> still<00:04:30.930> reach<00:04:31.199> this<00:04:31.470> position<00:04:31.680> here

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
tool and still reach this position here

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.029 
tool and still reach this position here
you<00:04:33.180> hear<00:04:33.389> that<00:04:33.570> a<00:04:33.870> little<00:04:34.620> bit<00:04:34.740> of<00:04:34.860> outer

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
you hear that a little bit of outer

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.100 
you hear that a little bit of outer
roundness<00:04:35.520> already<00:04:36.270> from<00:04:36.680> that<00:04:37.680> wood<00:04:37.889> drying

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
roundness already from that wood drying

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.260 
roundness already from that wood drying
all<00:04:40.110> right<00:04:40.259> now<00:04:40.860> the<00:04:40.949> trick<00:04:41.280> here<00:04:41.610> is<00:04:41.639> to<00:04:41.820> go

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
all right now the trick here is to go

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.050 
all right now the trick here is to go
right<00:04:43.139> out<00:04:43.410> soom<00:04:44.370> right<00:04:45.030> out<00:04:45.330> in<00:04:45.630> the<00:04:45.900> plane

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
right out soom right out in the plane

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.890 
right out soom right out in the plane
the<00:04:48.060> angle<00:04:48.990> of<00:04:49.289> that<00:04:49.610> flow<00:04:50.610> of<00:04:50.789> that<00:04:50.910> bowl<00:04:51.180> not

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
the angle of that flow of that bowl not

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.710 
the angle of that flow of that bowl not
I<00:04:52.199> don't<00:04:52.500> I'm<00:04:53.190> not<00:04:53.430> pushing<00:04:53.669> into<00:04:54.060> it<00:04:54.210> to<00:04:54.389> round

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
I don't I'm not pushing into it to round

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.650 
I don't I'm not pushing into it to round
that<00:04:54.870> off<00:04:55.050> so<00:04:55.620> it's<00:04:56.340> a<00:04:56.400> very<00:04:56.639> light<00:04:56.820> cut<00:04:57.090> out

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
that off so it's a very light cut out

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.300 
that off so it's a very light cut out
and<00:04:58.139> back<00:04:58.830> again<00:04:59.250> and<00:04:59.870> back<00:05:00.870> out<00:05:01.260> into<00:05:02.039> the<00:05:02.190> air

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
and back again and back out into the air

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.270 
and back again and back out into the air
spaces<00:05:02.699> and<00:05:03.210> then<00:05:03.360> back<00:05:03.570> out<00:05:03.780> again<00:05:03.900> the<00:05:04.860> trick

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
spaces and then back out again the trick

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.620 
spaces and then back out again the trick
to<00:05:05.550> this<00:05:05.729> is<00:05:06.260> to<00:05:07.260> start<00:05:07.620> a<00:05:07.770> cut<00:05:08.270> go<00:05:09.270> through<00:05:09.600> a

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
to this is to start a cut go through a

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.570 
to this is to start a cut go through a
bad<00:05:09.900> spot<00:05:10.260> where<00:05:10.560> a<00:05:10.590> bump<00:05:10.919> or<00:05:11.070> an<00:05:11.190> undulation

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
bad spot where a bump or an undulation

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.810 
bad spot where a bump or an undulation
is<00:05:11.940> and<00:05:12.320> exit<00:05:13.320> a<00:05:13.410> cut<00:05:13.680> without<00:05:13.919> making<00:05:14.639> of

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
is and exit a cut without making of

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.210 
is and exit a cut without making of
starting<00:05:15.539> in<00:05:15.660> an<00:05:15.780> entry<00:05:16.110> entering<00:05:16.860> an<00:05:16.919> exit

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
starting in an entry entering an exit

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.240 
starting in an entry entering an exit
point<00:05:17.400> and<00:05:17.639> making<00:05:18.330> two<00:05:18.510> more<00:05:18.539> divots<00:05:19.229> so<00:05:19.530> it's

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
point and making two more divots so it's

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.900 
point and making two more divots so it's
very<00:05:20.669> deliberate<00:05:21.360> very<00:05:21.780> soft<00:05:22.229> and<00:05:23.039> I<00:05:23.550> think<00:05:23.789> it

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
very deliberate very soft and I think it

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.370 
very deliberate very soft and I think it
was<00:05:24.000> David<00:05:24.180> Ellsworth<00:05:24.660> that<00:05:24.900> coined<00:05:25.259> the

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
was David Ellsworth that coined the

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.140 
was David Ellsworth that coined the
phrase<00:05:25.410> dance<00:05:25.979> with<00:05:26.160> your<00:05:26.310> lathe<00:05:26.550> because<00:05:27.000> of

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
phrase dance with your lathe because of

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.719 
phrase dance with your lathe because of
this<00:05:27.270> kind<00:05:27.660> of<00:05:27.720> a<00:05:27.840> cut<00:05:28.080> of<00:05:28.310> using<00:05:29.310> your<00:05:29.430> whole

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
this kind of a cut of using your whole

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:30.469 
this kind of a cut of using your whole
body

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
body

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.589 
body
there's<00:05:31.020> no<00:05:31.260> rookie<00:05:32.250> jerkiness<00:05:32.789> of<00:05:33.060> my<00:05:33.240> arms

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
there's no rookie jerkiness of my arms

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.020 
there's no rookie jerkiness of my arms
here<00:05:33.870> at<00:05:33.990> all<00:05:34.139> that<00:05:34.800> little<00:05:35.070> tiny<00:05:35.370> burr<00:05:35.699> on

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
here at all that little tiny burr on

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.750 
here at all that little tiny burr on
there<00:05:36.780> is<00:05:36.990> acting<00:05:37.680> like<00:05:37.710> it's<00:05:38.070> just<00:05:38.280> a<00:05:38.400> little

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
there is acting like it's just a little

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.040 
there is acting like it's just a little
microscopic<00:05:39.599> bowl<00:05:39.960> gouge<00:05:40.260> and<00:05:41.840> it's<00:05:42.840> going<00:05:42.990> to

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
microscopic bowl gouge and it's going to

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.379 
microscopic bowl gouge and it's going to
get<00:05:43.199> worn<00:05:43.470> away<00:05:43.590> really<00:05:43.919> quickly<00:05:44.250> and<00:05:44.520> so<00:05:45.210> we

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
get worn away really quickly and so we

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:47.920 
get worn away really quickly and so we
have<00:05:45.599> to<00:05:45.750> go<00:05:45.840> sharpen<00:05:46.110> often<00:05:46.560> I've<00:05:47.400> already

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
have to go sharpen often I've already

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.240 
have to go sharpen often I've already
scraped<00:05:48.930> this<00:05:49.139> for<00:05:49.349> a<00:05:49.380> little<00:05:49.500> while<00:05:49.620> my<00:05:50.010> tool

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
scraped this for a little while my tool

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.320 
scraped this for a little while my tool
is<00:05:50.400> dull<00:05:50.669> I'm<00:05:50.909> gonna<00:05:51.360> have<00:05:51.599> to<00:05:51.780> go<00:05:51.900> sharpen<00:05:53.330> I'm

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
is dull I'm gonna have to go sharpen I'm

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.570 
is dull I'm gonna have to go sharpen I'm
gonna<00:05:54.570> use<00:05:54.900> the<00:05:55.139> bowl<00:05:55.560> gouge<00:05:55.830> as<00:05:57.289> a<00:05:58.580> scraper

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
gonna use the bowl gouge as a scraper

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.939 
gonna use the bowl gouge as a scraper
and<00:05:59.849> I've<00:05:59.940> got<00:06:00.180> a<00:06:00.360> wide<00:06:00.720> area<00:06:00.750> here<00:06:01.470> to<00:06:01.500> use<00:06:01.919> it

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
and I've got a wide area here to use it

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.860 
and I've got a wide area here to use it
in<00:06:02.250> I<00:06:02.430> can<00:06:02.820> go<00:06:02.940> all<00:06:03.090> the<00:06:03.180> way<00:06:03.300> from<00:06:03.479> the<00:06:03.599> heel

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
in I can go all the way from the heel

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.210 
in I can go all the way from the heel
all<00:06:04.590> the<00:06:04.830> way<00:06:04.949> to<00:06:05.010> the<00:06:05.310> toe<00:06:06.080> as<00:06:07.080> a<00:06:07.139> scraper<00:06:07.530> so<00:06:07.710> I

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
all the way to the toe as a scraper so I

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.460 
all the way to the toe as a scraper so I
break<00:06:08.699> this<00:06:08.849> down<00:06:09.060> in<00:06:09.330> my<00:06:09.570> mind<00:06:10.020> just<00:06:10.110> kind<00:06:10.409> of

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
break this down in my mind just kind of

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.409 
break this down in my mind just kind of
mentally<00:06:10.830> break<00:06:11.430> it<00:06:11.580> into<00:06:11.789> thirds<00:06:12.090> and<00:06:12.270> I'll

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
mentally break it into thirds and I'll

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:16.010 
mentally break it into thirds and I'll
take<00:06:12.630> the<00:06:12.780> front<00:06:12.960> half<00:06:13.909> the<00:06:14.909> front<00:06:15.180> third<00:06:15.449> and

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
take the front half the front third and

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.810 
take the front half the front third and
I'll<00:06:16.260> do<00:06:16.710> a<00:06:16.740> little<00:06:16.889> shear<00:06:17.190> scraping<00:06:17.310> there

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
I'll do a little shear scraping there

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.550 
I'll do a little shear scraping there
and<00:06:18.090> they'll<00:06:18.180> get<00:06:18.360> dull<00:06:18.599> and<00:06:19.139> I'll<00:06:19.260> take<00:06:19.440> the

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
and they'll get dull and I'll take the

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.320 
and they'll get dull and I'll take the
middle<00:06:19.889> of<00:06:20.039> it<00:06:20.159> and<00:06:20.430> that'll<00:06:20.669> get<00:06:20.789> dull<00:06:21.000> and<00:06:21.270> I

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
middle of it and that'll get dull and I

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.879 
middle of it and that'll get dull and I
take<00:06:21.570> down<00:06:21.780> by<00:06:21.960> the<00:06:22.020> heel<00:06:22.349> and<00:06:22.530> that'll<00:06:22.770> get

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
take down by the heel and that'll get

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:25.700 
take down by the heel and that'll get
dull<00:06:23.070> we<00:06:23.820> can't<00:06:24.150> use<00:06:24.449> the<00:06:24.810> the<00:06:25.080> point<00:06:25.409> here

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710
