easily as the brass screws so gently
turn<00:03:03.310> it<00:03:03.460> down<00:03:03.610> in<00:03:03.790> fact<00:03:04.000> it's<00:03:04.240> knurled<00:03:04.750> you

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
turn it down in fact it's knurled you

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.980 
turn it down in fact it's knurled you
can<00:03:05.080> turn<00:03:05.320> it<00:03:05.470> down<00:03:05.500> by<00:03:05.920> hand<00:03:06.310> just<00:03:06.870> until<00:03:07.870> it

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
can turn it down by hand just until it

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.600 
can turn it down by hand just until it
seats<00:03:08.260> then<00:03:08.590> you<00:03:08.680> back<00:03:08.860> it<00:03:09.010> off<00:03:09.130> one<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.580> a

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
seats then you back it off one and a

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
say it again

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.060 
say it again
if<00:04:20.090> you<00:04:20.660> run<00:04:21.380> it<00:04:21.530> and<00:04:22.360> ramp<00:04:23.360> up<00:04:23.540> until<00:04:24.290> you<00:04:24.800> see

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
if you run it and ramp up until you see

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.280 
if you run it and ramp up until you see
your<00:04:25.340> voltage<00:04:25.670> regulator<00:04:26.000> start<00:04:26.540> to<00:04:26.660> charge<00:04:26.960> I

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
your voltage regulator start to charge I

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.010 
your voltage regulator start to charge I
call<00:04:27.920> that<00:04:28.100> a<00:04:28.160> good<00:04:28.400> Idol<00:04:28.730> if<00:04:29.090> it<00:04:29.630> sounds<00:04:29.990> too

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
call that a good Idol if it sounds too

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.450 
call that a good Idol if it sounds too
high<00:04:30.320> for<00:04:30.590> you<00:04:30.710> you<00:04:30.830> don't<00:04:30.920> want<00:04:31.160> to<00:04:31.220> run<00:04:31.370> up

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
high for you you don't want to run up

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.010 
high for you you don't want to run up
that<00:04:31.610> high<00:04:31.820> when<00:04:32.180> you're<00:04:32.330> just<00:04:32.510> starting<00:04:32.780> it

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
that high when you're just starting it

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.140 
that high when you're just starting it
up<00:04:33.170> then<00:04:33.860> but<00:04:34.610> you<00:04:34.820> know<00:04:34.910> back<00:04:35.210> it<00:04:35.420> down<00:04:37.150> you

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
up then but you know back it down you

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.180 
up then but you know back it down you
don't<00:04:38.330> want<00:04:38.510> to<00:04:38.570> run<00:04:38.690> it<00:04:38.810> too<00:04:39.110> slow<00:04:39.590> because

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
don't want to run it too slow because

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.630 
don't want to run it too slow because
these<00:04:40.400> are<00:04:40.640> oil<00:04:40.940> splash<00:04:41.390> engines<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:42.370> if<00:04:43.370> the

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
these are oil splash engines and if the

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.460 
these are oil splash engines and if the
idle<00:04:44.090> is<00:04:44.240> too<00:04:44.480> slow<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:44.780> you<00:04:44.900> let<00:04:45.020> it<00:04:45.140> run<00:04:45.290> that

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
idle is too slow and you let it run that

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.100 
idle is too slow and you let it run that
way<00:04:45.590> for<00:04:45.800> too<00:04:45.980> long<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:47.210> top<00:04:47.450> portion<00:04:47.720> of<00:04:47.990> the

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
way for too long the top portion of the

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.420 
way for too long the top portion of the
cylinder<00:04:48.650> and<00:04:48.830> your<00:04:49.640> valve<00:04:49.910> train<00:04:50.440> is<00:04:51.440> not

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
going to get proper lubrication because

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.909 
going to get proper lubrication because
you<00:04:55.190> won't<00:04:55.310> be<00:04:55.490> splashing<00:04:55.820> the<00:04:56.060> oil<00:04:56.240> enough

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
you won't be splashing the oil enough

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:01.480 
you won't be splashing the oil enough

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
usually figure it at 3,600 under load

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.140 
usually figure it at 3,600 under load
and<00:05:05.140> these<00:05:06.140> are<00:05:06.320> usually<00:05:06.860> adjusted<00:05:07.669> fairly

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
and these are usually adjusted fairly

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.120 
and these are usually adjusted fairly
well<00:05:08.360> from<00:05:08.810> the<00:05:08.990> factory<00:05:09.410> you<00:05:09.590> don't<00:05:09.770> have<00:05:09.980> to

well from the factory you don't have to

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.450 
well from the factory you don't have to
worry<00:05:10.280> about<00:05:10.430> over-revving

holding the float to the body of

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.390 
holding the float to the body of
carburetor<00:05:56.900> just<00:05:57.169> like<00:05:57.410> on<00:05:57.650> the<00:05:57.919> larger

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
carburetor just like on the larger

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.000 
carburetor just like on the larger
engines<00:05:58.880> on<00:05:59.540> the<00:05:59.810> horizontal<00:06:00.320> shaft<00:06:00.530> engines

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
engines on the horizontal shaft engines

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.210 
engines on the horizontal shaft engines
so<00:06:01.750> it's<00:06:02.750> real<00:06:03.020> simple<00:06:03.260> quick<00:06:03.560> easy<00:06:03.740> and<00:06:04.040> basic

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
so it's real simple quick easy and basic

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.820 
so it's real simple quick easy and basic
that<00:06:04.729> is<00:06:04.910> how<00:06:05.090> these<00:06:05.330> carburetors<00:06:05.830> are

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
that is how these carburetors are

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.250 
that is how these carburetors are
initially<00:06:07.520> adjusted<00:06:08.090> and<00:06:08.270> then<00:06:08.870> you<00:06:09.020> just

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
initially adjusted and then you just

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.850 
initially adjusted and then you just
play<00:06:10.040> with<00:06:10.160> them<00:06:10.900> if<00:06:11.900> you<00:06:12.440> start<00:06:12.680> getting

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
play with them if you start getting

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.060 
play with them if you start getting
sputtering<00:06:13.700> or<00:06:13.850> backfiring<00:06:14.500> turn<00:06:15.500> it<00:06:15.680> in

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
sputtering or backfiring turn it in

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.130 
sputtering or backfiring turn it in
if<00:06:16.550> that<00:06:16.940> doesn't<00:06:17.360> clear<00:06:17.600> it<00:06:17.720> it<00:06:17.810> makes<00:06:17.990> it
