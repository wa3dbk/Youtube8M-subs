00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.169 
I'm a little something I like to call
advanced<00:00:05.609> snapping<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.450> I<00:00:06.839> know<00:00:06.899> with<00:00:07.859> a

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:08.179 
advanced snapping and I know with a

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:10.850 
advanced snapping and I know with a
reach<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.510> there's<00:00:09.990> new<00:00:10.139> tools<00:00:10.410> we<00:00:10.559> have<00:00:10.590> you

guys like like to think of like using

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.620 
guys like like to think of like using
the<00:00:13.860> snap<00:00:14.099> tool<00:00:14.400> as<00:00:14.580> ik<00:00:14.849> i'm<00:00:15.299> going<00:00:15.420> to<00:00:15.480> make<00:00:15.599> a

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
the snap tool as ik i'm going to make a

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.220 
the snap tool as ik i'm going to make a
ramp<00:00:16.220> make<00:00:17.220> perfectly<00:00:17.730> 45-degree<00:00:18.720> ramp<00:00:18.960> off

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
ramp make perfectly 45-degree ramp off

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.450 
ramp make perfectly 45-degree ramp off
this<00:00:19.380> thing<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:19.980> going<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.160> be<00:00:20.279> awesome

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
this thing and it's going to be awesome

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.000 
this thing and it's going to be awesome
because<00:00:20.789> it's<00:00:21.000> perfect<00:00:21.420> but<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:22.109> problem<00:00:22.920> with

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
because it's perfect but a problem with

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.370 
because it's perfect but a problem with
this<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.550> if<00:00:24.359> you're<00:00:24.480> doing<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.840> it's<00:00:25.140> hard

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
this is I if you're doing this it's hard

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.009 
this is I if you're doing this it's hard
to<00:00:25.670> get<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:26.820> between<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.180> 45<00:00:27.570> but<00:00:27.810> still

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
to get it in between the 45 but still

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.640 
to get it in between the 45 but still
have<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.199> be<00:00:28.289> perfectly<00:00:28.920> like<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> flat<00:00:30.439> or<00:00:31.439> like

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
have it be perfectly like a flat or like

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.240 
have it be perfectly like a flat or like
perfectly<00:00:32.399> 45<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> different

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
perfectly 45 but have it on a different

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.750 
perfectly 45 but have it on a different
angle<00:00:35.250> around<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.260> x-axis<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.730> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
angle around the x-axis so this is a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.170 
angle around the x-axis so this is a
tool<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.450> i<00:00:39.719> am<00:00:39.930> i<00:00:40.170> use<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.860> i<00:00:40.920> like<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.030> call

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
tool that i am i use and i like to call

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.869 
tool that i am i use and i like to call
it<00:00:42.239> advanced<00:00:42.629> snapping<00:00:43.290> because<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.789> kind<00:00:44.789> of

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
it advanced snapping because a kind of

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.000 
it advanced snapping because a kind of
takes<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.360> snapping<00:00:45.899> engine<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.559> takes<00:00:46.800> to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
takes the snapping engine and takes to

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.549 
takes the snapping engine and takes to
only<00:00:47.219> level<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:48.300> start<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.050> out<00:00:49.110> here<00:00:49.379> i'm

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
only level so start it out here i'm

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.100 
only level so start it out here i'm
going<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> go<00:00:49.890> into<00:00:50.510> walls<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.870> i'm<00:00:51.960> going<00:00:52.050> to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
going to go into walls and i'm going to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.410 
going to go into walls and i'm going to
spawn<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> Coliseum<00:00:52.680> wall<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.309> begging<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.910> this

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
spawn a Coliseum wall is begging it this

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.819 
spawn a Coliseum wall is begging it this
will<00:00:54.570> easily<00:00:54.840> demonstrate<00:00:55.410> what<00:00:55.530> I'm<00:00:55.620> trying

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
will easily demonstrate what I'm trying

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
to show you and start out here by

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.119 
to show you and start out here by
turning<00:00:59.219> our<00:00:59.430> snap<00:00:59.730> off<00:00:59.969> all<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> way<00:01:01.129> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
turning our snap off all the way and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.820 
turning our snap off all the way and
then<00:01:02.370> getting<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.750> wall<00:01:03.930> as<00:01:04.409> close<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:04.799> we

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
then getting the wall as close as we

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.359 
then getting the wall as close as we
want<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.640> angle<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.090> need<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:07.369> want

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
want to the angle that we need so I want

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.649 
want to the angle that we need so I want
to<00:01:08.460> make<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.760> want<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.060> flat<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.479> i'm<00:01:09.570> gonna

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
to make I want this flat so i'm gonna

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.050 
to make I want this flat so i'm gonna
get<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.930> close<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.530> then<00:01:10.979> i'm<00:01:11.369> going<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.580> set

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
get this close and then i'm going to set

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.520 
get this close and then i'm going to set
my<00:01:12.090> snap<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.659> 90<00:01:12.960> which<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.320> going<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.470> make

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
my snap to 90 which is going to make

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.440 
my snap to 90 which is going to make
perfectly<00:01:14.070> flat<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.850> i'm<00:01:15.060> going<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.240> set<00:01:15.420> it

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
perfectly flat and i'm going to set it

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.770 
perfectly flat and i'm going to set it
back<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.780> off<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.409> now<00:01:17.220> holding<00:01:18.090> down<00:01:18.210> our<00:01:18.509> i

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
back to off so now holding down our i

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.190 
back to off so now holding down our i
can<00:01:19.229> make<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.490> object<00:01:21.030> spin<00:01:21.299> around<00:01:21.689> its<00:01:22.049> axis

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
can make the object spin around its axis

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.340 
can make the object spin around its axis
and<00:01:22.909> have<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.119> still<00:01:24.630> be<00:01:24.799> perfectly<00:01:25.799> flat<00:01:26.159> so

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
and have it still be perfectly flat so

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.840 
and have it still be perfectly flat so
that's<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.439> good<00:01:28.590> tool<00:01:28.799> it's<00:01:29.100> not<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.579> can<00:01:29.729> use

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
that's a good tool it's not you can use

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.889 
that's a good tool it's not you can use
it<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.090> anything

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
it on anything

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:33.910 
it on anything
I'll<00:01:32.899> show<00:01:33.049> you<00:01:33.110> what<00:01:33.229> happen<00:01:33.590> if<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:33.890> just

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
I'll show you what happen if you just

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.060 
I'll show you what happen if you just
you<00:01:34.640> know<00:01:34.729> I<00:01:35.110> have<00:01:36.110> my<00:01:36.140> snap<00:01:36.560> tool<00:01:36.799> on<00:01:37.159> 9d<00:01:38.049> and<00:01:39.070> I

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
you know I have my snap tool on 9d and I

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.069 
you know I have my snap tool on 9d and I
made<00:01:40.219> it<00:01:40.340> flat<00:01:40.579> and<00:01:40.789> you<00:01:41.420> can<00:01:41.570> only<00:01:41.659> spend<00:01:41.990> it

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
made it flat and you can only spend it

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.319 
made it flat and you can only spend it
that<00:01:42.439> much<00:01:42.619> but<00:01:42.890> you<00:01:43.610> know<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:43.789> can<00:01:43.939> I<00:01:44.090> guess

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
that much but you know you can I guess

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.450 
that much but you know you can I guess
you<00:01:44.450> could<00:01:44.479> go<00:01:44.929> into<00:01:45.110> your<00:01:45.350> smaller<00:01:45.770> snaps<00:01:46.130> but

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
you could go into your smaller snaps but

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.550 
you could go into your smaller snaps but
it's<00:01:47.060> easier<00:01:47.360> for<00:01:47.390> me<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.659> get<00:01:47.869> more<00:01:48.140> precise

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
it's easier for me to get more precise

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.380 
it's easier for me to get more precise
out<00:01:48.829> of<00:01:48.920> what<00:01:49.039> I<00:01:49.069> want<00:01:49.340> if<00:01:49.579> I<00:01:49.850> just<00:01:50.119> turn<00:01:50.270> the

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
out of what I want if I just turn the

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.760 
out of what I want if I just turn the
snap<00:01:50.569> off<00:01:50.780> all<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.079> way<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:51.439> that<00:01:51.619> also

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
snap off all the way and that also

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.200 
snap off all the way and that also
brings<00:01:52.009> problems<00:01:52.340> when<00:01:52.909> you're<00:01:53.000> trying<00:01:53.119> to

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
brings problems when you're trying to

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.209 
brings problems when you're trying to
make<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.390> ramp<00:01:53.630> or<00:01:53.899> something<00:01:54.229> you<00:01:54.920> always<00:01:55.100> get

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
make a ramp or something you always get

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.410 
make a ramp or something you always get
kind<00:01:55.429> of<00:01:55.460> sideways<00:01:57.250> so<00:01:58.250> more<00:01:58.700> practical<00:01:59.270> use

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
kind of sideways so more practical use

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.730 
kind of sideways so more practical use
of<00:01:59.450> this<00:01:59.689> I<00:01:59.929> guess<00:02:00.259> what

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.490 

so<00:02:07.740> I'm<00:02:07.890> going<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.129> set<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.360> about<00:02:09.899> here

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
so I'm going to set this like about here

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.580 
so I'm going to set this like about here
and<00:02:11.390> since<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.510> want<00:02:12.720> this<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.900> end<00:02:13.200> up<00:02:13.349> being<00:02:13.530> a

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
and since I want this to end up being a

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.290 
and since I want this to end up being a
45<00:02:14.040> i'm<00:02:14.220> actually<00:02:14.370> going<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.670> go<00:02:14.700> backwards

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
45 i'm actually going to go backwards

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.290 
45 i'm actually going to go backwards
and<00:02:17.120> now<00:02:19.129> now<00:02:20.129> that<00:02:20.310> it's<00:02:20.430> perfect<00:02:20.819> on<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:21.000> 45

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
and now now that it's perfect on the 45

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.850 
and now now that it's perfect on the 45
i'm<00:02:21.599> going<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.840> turn<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.110> off<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:26.390> still<00:02:27.390> spins

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
i'm going to turn it off and still spins

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.940 
i'm going to turn it off and still spins
perfect<00:02:29.870> because<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.989> way<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.440> the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
perfect because the way that the the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.759 
perfect because the way that the the
engine<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.640> spinning<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:33.629> engine<00:02:34.410> spins

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
engine the spinning that engine spins

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.870 
engine the spinning that engine spins
the<00:02:34.980> object<00:02:35.430> is<00:02:35.610> if<00:02:36.290> it's<00:02:37.290> very<00:02:37.610> precise<00:02:38.610> on

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
the object is if it's very precise on

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.190 
the object is if it's very precise on
the<00:02:38.910> fact<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.329> you're<00:02:40.250> making<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.599> spin<00:02:42.599> in<00:02:42.930> a

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
the fact that you're making it spin in a

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.140 
the fact that you're making it spin in a
certain<00:02:43.349> direction<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:44.040> if<00:02:44.459> you're<00:02:44.610> pretty

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
certain direction and if you're pretty

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.569 
certain direction and if you're pretty
much<00:02:45.239> right<00:02:45.720> on<00:02:46.160> you'll<00:02:47.750> stick<00:02:48.750> with<00:02:48.780> that

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
much right on you'll stick with that

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.059 
much right on you'll stick with that
spinning<00:02:50.579> around<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.879> x-axis<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:52.680> know<00:02:52.799> I

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
spinning around the x-axis so you know I

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.119 
spinning around the x-axis so you know I
hope<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:54.269> actually<00:02:54.629> comes<00:02:54.750> in<00:02:54.980> handy<00:02:55.980> for

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
hope this actually comes in handy for

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.539 
hope this actually comes in handy for
some<00:02:56.489> people<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:57.769> use<00:02:58.769> this<00:02:58.920> tool<00:02:59.190> mainly

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
some people and I use this tool mainly

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.259 
some people and I use this tool mainly
with<00:02:59.670> like<00:02:59.849> dishes<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:01.190> an<00:03:02.190> audition<00:03:02.640> summary

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
with like dishes and an audition summary

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.140 
with like dishes and an audition summary
but<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.540> know<00:03:03.660> it's<00:03:03.900> under<00:03:04.230> decorative<00:03:05.150> or

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
but you know it's under decorative or

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.460 
but you know it's under decorative or
now<00:03:06.420> that's<00:03:06.599> under<00:03:06.870> buildings

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
now that's under buildings

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.050 
now that's under buildings
I<00:03:08.560> don't<00:03:09.190> know<00:03:09.250> what<00:03:09.400> it's<00:03:09.550> under<00:03:09.790> Thunder

I don't know what it's under Thunder
