00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.610 
recently a former CIA veteran of 35
years<00:00:05.339> came<00:00:05.790> out<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.120> said<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:06.299> Roswell<00:00:07.049> did

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
years came out and said that Roswell did

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.430 
years came out and said that Roswell did
indeed<00:00:08.220> exist<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:08.940> his<00:00:09.059> proof<00:00:09.269> was<00:00:09.599> when<00:00:10.290> he

intelligence<00:00:15.360> collection<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:16.020> guess<00:00:16.320> it's<00:00:16.529> an

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
intelligence collection I guess it's an

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.970 
intelligence collection I guess it's an
area<00:00:17.130> where<00:00:17.460> it's<00:00:17.640> super<00:00:18.080> top<00:00:19.080> secret<00:00:19.109> and

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
area where it's super top secret and

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.429 
area where it's super top secret and
vaulted<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.670> when<00:00:21.180> he<00:00:21.300> was<00:00:21.420> in<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.720> area<00:00:21.990> he

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
vaulted and when he was in that area he

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.769 
vaulted and when he was in that area he
came<00:00:22.650> across<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:23.220> brown<00:00:23.519> cardboard<00:00:24.060> box<00:00:24.420> that

though<00:02:43.240> I'll<00:02:43.780> say<00:02:44.050> first<00:02:44.290> off<00:02:44.500> I<00:02:44.680> believe<00:02:45.430> in

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
though I'll say first off I believe in

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.770 
though I'll say first off I believe in
the<00:02:45.730> same<00:02:45.940> way<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.210> you<00:02:46.360> do<00:02:46.510> that<00:02:46.630> it's

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
the same way that you do that it's

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.600 
the same way that you do that it's
almost<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:47.170> certainty<00:02:47.380> that's<00:02:47.800> somewhere<00:02:48.250> I

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
almost a certainty that's somewhere I

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.390 
almost a certainty that's somewhere I
mean<00:02:48.790> there<00:02:48.970> just<00:02:49.000> don't<00:02:49.540> this<00:02:50.070> billions<00:02:51.070> and

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
mean there just don't this billions and

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.910 
mean there just don't this billions and
billions<00:02:51.640> of<00:02:52.000> galaxies<00:02:52.480> yeah<00:02:53.140> yeah<00:02:53.470> we've

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
billions of galaxies yeah yeah we've

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.170 
billions of galaxies yeah yeah we've
found<00:02:54.310> new<00:02:54.400> evidence<00:02:54.430> actually<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:55.000> think<00:02:55.060> it

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
found new evidence actually I think it

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.100 
found new evidence actually I think it
was<00:02:55.270> linked<00:02:55.510> in<00:02:55.570> the<00:02:55.660> article<00:02:55.900> that<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.050> were

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
was linked in the article that you were

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.380 
was linked in the article that you were
talking<00:02:56.350> about<00:02:56.530> about<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.430> fact<00:02:57.730> that<00:02:57.910> we<00:02:58.120> now

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
talking about about the fact that we now

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.940 
talking about about the fact that we now
have<00:02:58.420> fairly<00:02:59.110> good<00:02:59.230> certainty<00:02:59.470> that<00:02:59.800> their

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
have fairly good certainty that their

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.280 
have fairly good certainty that their
plants<00:03:00.310> are<00:03:00.430> on<00:03:00.520> most<00:03:00.790> yes<00:03:01.420> ours<00:03:01.660> yeah<00:03:02.140> like

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
plants are on most yes ours yeah like

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.570 
plants are on most yes ours yeah like
it's<00:03:02.410> not<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.560> rare<00:03:02.800> thing<00:03:02.830> like<00:03:03.220> we<00:03:03.340> were<00:03:03.430> July

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
it's not a rare thing like we were July

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.100 
it's not a rare thing like we were July
thought<00:03:03.760> right<00:03:04.150> but<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.420> thing<00:03:04.600> is<00:03:04.630> is<00:03:04.930> that

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
thought right but the thing is is that

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.800 
thought right but the thing is is that
media<00:03:06.010> sci-fi<00:03:06.700> our<00:03:06.880> whole<00:03:07.030> lives<00:03:07.240> has<00:03:07.540> taught

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
media sci-fi our whole lives has taught

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.540 
media sci-fi our whole lives has taught
us<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:08.110> imagine<00:03:08.800> that<00:03:08.860> aliens<00:03:09.220> are<00:03:09.250> gonna<00:03:09.430> be

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
us to imagine that aliens are gonna be

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.850 
us to imagine that aliens are gonna be
like<00:03:09.820> us<00:03:10.030> even<00:03:10.780> Prometheus<00:03:11.350> which<00:03:11.560> is<00:03:11.710> like

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
like us even Prometheus which is like

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.010 
like us even Prometheus which is like
this<00:03:12.010> new<00:03:12.210> retelling<00:03:13.210> of<00:03:13.300> what's<00:03:13.540> me<00:03:13.720> like<00:03:13.870> to

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
this new retelling of what's me like to

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.990 
this new retelling of what's me like to
know<00:03:14.110> sense<00:03:14.560> well<00:03:15.070> that's<00:03:15.100> who<00:03:15.340> I<00:03:15.370> selected

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
know sense well that's who I selected

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.180 
know sense well that's who I selected
yeah<00:03:16.150> even<00:03:16.570> in<00:03:16.660> Prometheus<00:03:17.260> like<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.739> aliens

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
yeah even in Prometheus like the aliens

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.430 
yeah even in Prometheus like the aliens
wear<00:03:18.489> helmets<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.360> they<00:03:19.570> use<00:03:19.810> steering

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
wear helmets and they use steering

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.050 
wear helmets and they use steering
wheels<00:03:20.709> like<00:03:21.070> why<00:03:21.280> would<00:03:21.459> we<00:03:21.580> imagine<00:03:21.970> that

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
wheels like why would we imagine that

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.520 
wheels like why would we imagine that
because<00:03:22.330> life<00:03:22.510> evolved<00:03:22.989> somewhere<00:03:23.290> else<00:03:23.410> in

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
because life evolved somewhere else in

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.410 
because life evolved somewhere else in
the<00:03:23.590> universe<00:03:23.800> they're<00:03:24.430> wearing<00:03:24.700> shoes<00:03:25.060> and

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
the universe they're wearing shoes and

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.180 
the universe they're wearing shoes and
stuff<00:03:25.690> well<00:03:25.959> I<00:03:25.989> think<00:03:26.170> we're<00:03:26.440> products<00:03:26.920> of<00:03:27.100> our

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
stuff well I think we're products of our

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.910 
stuff well I think we're products of our
environment<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:28.030> life<00:03:28.989> forms<00:03:29.350> evolved

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
environment and life forms evolved

the aliens with that head and the scary

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.770 
eyes because they creep me out also a

called<00:03:46.989> reptilian<00:03:47.440> theory<00:03:47.709> that<00:03:48.010> reptilians

once ruled this planet like a dice is a
very<00:03:52.570> no<00:03:53.260> not<00:03:53.500> but<00:03:54.250> this<00:03:54.400> is<00:03:54.520> a<00:03:54.550> theory<00:03:54.940> that

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
very no not but this is a theory that

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.940 
very no not but this is a theory that
well<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:55.900> guess<00:03:56.140> you<00:03:56.260> could<00:03:56.410> say<00:03:56.530> if<00:03:56.709> you<00:03:56.800> were

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
well I guess you could say if you were

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.380 
well I guess you could say if you were
looking<00:03:57.070> at<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.370> evolution<00:03:57.580> of<00:03:57.940> reptilian

looking at the evolution of reptilian

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.460 
looking at the evolution of reptilian
theory<00:03:58.690> just<00:03:58.930> like<00:03:59.050> you<00:03:59.170> look<00:03:59.260> at<00:03:59.380> the

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
theory just like you look at the

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.790 
theory just like you look at the
evolution<00:03:59.739> of<00:04:00.480> primates<00:04:01.480> this<00:04:02.050> is<00:04:02.260> a<00:04:02.290> theory

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
evolution of primates this is a theory

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.440 
evolution of primates this is a theory
you<00:04:03.070> can<00:04:03.220> google<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.670> it's<00:04:03.850> actually<00:04:03.970> quite

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
you can google it it's actually quite

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:16.849 
you can google it it's actually quite

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
alien expert and there is a theory out

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.950 
alien expert and there is a theory out
there<00:04:24.699> with<00:04:24.970> reptilian<00:04:25.270> theory<00:04:25.720> which<00:04:25.840> is

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
there with reptilian theory which is

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.290 
there with reptilian theory which is
quite<00:04:26.139> interesting<00:04:26.650> that<00:04:26.979> it's<00:04:27.490> there's<00:04:27.880> two

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
quite interesting that it's there's two

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.550 
quite interesting that it's there's two

the<00:04:32.800> primates<00:04:33.250> you're<00:04:33.639> just<00:04:33.789> right

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
the primates you're just right

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.879 
the primates you're just right
spider-man<00:04:34.630> I<00:04:34.660> know<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.410> then<00:04:35.590> there's<00:04:35.770> the

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889 
spider-man I know and then there's the

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:38.490 
spider-man I know and then there's the
reptilian<00:04:36.460> theory<00:04:37.240> they<00:04:37.360> believe<00:04:37.600> that<00:04:37.750> yes

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
reptilian theory they believe that yes

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.550 
reptilian theory they believe that yes
they<00:04:39.070> say<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.490> media<00:04:39.820> is<00:04:40.259> run<00:04:41.259> by<00:04:41.500> the

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
they say the media is run by the

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.400 
they say the media is run by the
reptilians<00:04:42.190> that<00:04:42.460> George<00:04:43.180> Bush<00:04:43.419> is<00:04:43.599> reptilian

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
reptilians that George Bush is reptilian

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.020 
reptilians that George Bush is reptilian
and<00:04:44.650> they<00:04:45.099> have<00:04:45.310> all<00:04:46.919> these<00:04:47.919> components<00:04:48.190> ok

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
and they have all these components ok

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.730 
and they have all these components ok
well<00:04:49.240> that's<00:04:49.330> ridiculous<00:04:49.900> and<00:04:50.229> clearly<00:04:50.590> not

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
well that's ridiculous and clearly not

00:04:50.740 --> 00:05:04.740 
well that's ridiculous and clearly not
true<00:05:01.169> Stephen<00:05:02.169> Hawking<00:05:02.530> says<00:05:03.340> that<00:05:03.759> if<00:05:04.150> aliens

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
and Vedas we should be really scared

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.129 
and Vedas we should be really scared
because<00:05:06.250> they<00:05:06.490> have<00:05:06.699> the<00:05:07.090> power<00:05:07.750> or<00:05:08.110> the

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.170 
ability the brainpower to come there
it's<00:05:11.139> likely<00:05:11.530> because<00:05:11.830> they<00:05:12.070> really<00:05:12.910> like

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
it's likely because they really like
