three combiner teams from Energon
however<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.070> still<00:00:38.250> better<00:00:38.700> than

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
however it is still better than

since<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:44.399> know<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.700> actually<00:00:45.180> does

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
since you know it actually does

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.170 
since you know it actually does
everything<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.960> combiner<00:00:46.350> supposed<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.860> do

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
everything a combiner supposed to do

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.950 
everything a combiner supposed to do
instead<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.360> being<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.719> Megazord<00:00:49.289> or

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
instead of just being a Megazord or

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.549 
instead of just being a Megazord or
whatever<00:00:51.960> um<00:00:52.559> i<00:00:53.300> just<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.840> confess<00:00:55.260> that

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
whatever um i just like to confess that

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.889 
whatever um i just like to confess that
i<00:00:55.620> am<00:00:55.920> probably<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.489> worst<00:00:56.850> tour<00:00:57.210> reviewer<00:00:57.570> on

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
i am probably the worst tour reviewer on

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.500 
i am probably the worst tour reviewer on
youtube<00:00:58.469> because<00:00:59.250> i<00:00:59.399> was<00:00:59.699> just<00:00:59.730> talking<00:01:00.090> for<00:01:00.480> i

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
youtube because i was just talking for i

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.900 
youtube because i was just talking for i
guess<00:01:00.719> about<00:01:00.899> 15<00:01:01.469> minutes<00:01:01.800> reviewing<00:01:02.399> this

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
guess about 15 minutes reviewing this

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.899 
guess about 15 minutes reviewing this
thing<00:01:03.559> without<00:01:04.559> realizing<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.400> never<00:01:05.670> hit

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
thing without realizing I never hit

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.789 
thing without realizing I never hit
record<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.750> anyway<00:01:08.240> on<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.020> review<00:01:10.290> and

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
record so anyway on with the review and

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.230 
record so anyway on with the review and
the<00:01:11.400> least<00:01:11.790> bestest<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.200> guy<00:01:14.240> basically

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
unknown Jets as legs he'd have to be

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.859 
unknown Jets as legs he'd have to be
standing<00:02:04.530> out<00:02:04.829> about<00:02:05.430> right<00:02:05.790> there<00:02:06.180> doing<00:02:06.810> a

that in a line of combiners where they

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.660 
that in a line of combiners where they
had<00:02:21.690> unconvincing<00:02:22.690> feet<00:02:23.020> and<00:02:23.230> hands<00:02:23.740> this<00:02:24.490> is

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
had unconvincing feet and hands this is

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.960 
had unconvincing feet and hands this is
the<00:02:24.790> least<00:02:25.030> convincing<00:02:25.660> of<00:02:25.810> them<00:02:26.050> all<00:02:26.970> really

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
the least convincing of them all really

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.910 
the least convincing of them all really
if<00:02:28.150> you<00:02:28.660> don't<00:02:28.900> have<00:02:29.140> any<00:02:29.350> of<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.530> Energon

if you don't have any of the Energon

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.470 
if you don't have any of the Energon
combiners<00:02:30.490> get<00:02:31.120> this<00:02:31.330> guy<00:02:31.510> last<00:02:31.900> if<00:02:32.260> at<00:02:32.500> all<00:02:33.480> so

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
combiners get this guy last if at all so

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.230 
combiners get this guy last if at all so
anyway<00:02:36.270> that's<00:02:37.270> pretty<00:02:38.080> much<00:02:38.170> it
