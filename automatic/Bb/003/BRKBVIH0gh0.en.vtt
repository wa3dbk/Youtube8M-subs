wanted to answer a really common
question<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.880> people<00:00:12.000> ask<00:00:12.540> which<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.440> how<00:00:14.130> to

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
question that people ask which is how to

question that people ask which is how to
consistently<00:00:15.330> progress<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:16.020> weight<00:00:16.289> on

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
consistently progress in weight on

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.130 
consistently progress in weight on
smaller<00:00:16.949> isolation<00:00:17.640> exercises<00:00:18.180> they'll<00:00:18.960> say

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
smaller isolation exercises they'll say

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.290 
smaller isolation exercises they'll say
things<00:00:19.380> like<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:20.279> know<00:00:20.369> obviously<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.970> can't

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
things like you know obviously you can't

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.019 
things like you know obviously you can't
just<00:00:21.359> keep<00:00:21.720> adding<00:00:22.050> five<00:00:22.980> pounds<00:00:23.460> every<00:00:23.760> few

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
just keep adding five pounds every few

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.150 
just keep adding five pounds every few
weeks<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.390> exercises<00:00:25.289> like<00:00:25.439> side<00:00:25.710> lateral

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
weeks to exercises like side lateral

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.609 
weeks to exercises like side lateral
raises<00:00:26.400> or<00:00:26.670> bicep<00:00:27.090> curls<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:28.170> how<00:00:28.410> am<00:00:28.560> I

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
raises or bicep curls so how am I

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.290 
raises or bicep curls so how am I
supposed<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.010> achieve<00:00:29.160> progressive<00:00:29.970> overload

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
supposed to achieve progressive overload

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.110 
supposed to achieve progressive overload
on<00:00:30.720> those<00:00:30.990> exercises<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> good

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
on those exercises so this is a good

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.479 
on those exercises so this is a good
question<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.510> ask<00:00:33.630> but<00:00:34.559> as<00:00:34.829> far<00:00:35.219> as<00:00:35.340> I'm

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
question to ask but as far as I'm

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.250 
question to ask but as far as I'm
concerned<00:00:35.910> there's<00:00:36.090> really<00:00:36.239> no<00:00:36.660> big

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
concerned there's really no big

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.580 
concerned there's really no big
difference<00:00:37.770> between<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.340> basic<00:00:38.850> concept<00:00:39.420> of

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
difference between the basic concept of

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.369 
difference between the basic concept of
progression<00:00:40.590> when<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.399> comes<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:42.379> small

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
progression when it comes to small

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.459 
progression when it comes to small
isolation<00:00:44.070> exercises<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:45.030> comparison<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.989> big

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
isolation exercises in comparison to big

isolation exercises in comparison to big
compound<00:00:47.010> lifts<00:00:47.370> your<00:00:48.120> primary<00:00:48.539> focus<00:00:48.809> is

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
compound lifts your primary focus is

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.840 
compound lifts your primary focus is
still<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.530> just<00:00:49.739> gradually<00:00:50.309> increase<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
still to just gradually increase the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.729 
still to just gradually increase the
weight<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.449> use<00:00:51.690> over<00:00:51.899> time<00:00:52.320> and

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
weight that you use over time and

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.220 
weight that you use over time and
assuming<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.789> you're<00:00:53.910> training<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.629> you're

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
assuming that you're training and you're

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.139 
assuming that you're training and you're
eating<00:00:55.469> properly<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.520> should<00:00:56.730> be<00:00:56.850> able<00:00:57.000> to

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
eating properly you should be able to

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.290 
eating properly you should be able to
achieve<00:00:57.410> consistent<00:00:58.410> ongoing<00:00:58.890> progress<00:00:59.300> as

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
achieve consistent ongoing progress as

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.389 
achieve consistent ongoing progress as
long<00:01:00.359> as<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.780> continue<00:01:01.050> training<00:01:01.590> however

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
long as you continue training however

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.250 
long as you continue training however
there<00:01:02.730> are<00:01:02.879> two<00:01:03.149> very<00:01:03.420> important<00:01:03.960> things<00:01:04.199> to

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
there are two very important things to

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.950 
there are two very important things to
keep<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.619> mind<00:01:04.830> here<00:01:05.070> first<00:01:05.729> off<00:01:05.939> an<00:01:06.150> isolation

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
keep in mind here first off an isolation

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.679 
keep in mind here first off an isolation
exercise<00:01:07.470> only<00:01:07.770> involves<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> use<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.880> one

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
exercise only involves the use of one

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.840 
exercise only involves the use of one
single<00:01:10.020> muscle<00:01:10.320> group<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.189> obviously<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
single muscle group and so obviously the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.149 
single muscle group and so obviously the
overall<00:01:12.299> rate<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.630> progression<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.650> going<00:01:14.100> to

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
overall rate of progression is going to

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.399 
overall rate of progression is going to
be<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> lot<00:01:14.580> slower<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.420> more<00:01:15.570> gradual<00:01:16.229> and

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
be a lot slower and more gradual and

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.350 
be a lot slower and more gradual and
because<00:01:17.040> all<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.580> stress<00:01:18.000> from<00:01:18.210> those

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
because all the stress from those

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.109 
because all the stress from those
exercises<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.380> being<00:01:19.650> directed<00:01:20.189> at<00:01:20.340> just<00:01:20.820> one

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
exercises is being directed at just one

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.450 
exercises is being directed at just one
muscle<00:01:21.570> group<00:01:21.600> small<00:01:22.259> increases<00:01:22.860> are<00:01:23.159> still

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
muscle group small increases are still

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.399 
muscle group small increases are still
going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.759> very<00:01:24.030> significant<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.900> can't

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
going to be very significant I can't

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.160 
going to be very significant I can't
give<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:26.070> direct<00:01:26.400> parallel<00:01:27.030> here<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:27.990> for

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
give a direct parallel here but for

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.390 
give a direct parallel here but for
example<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.619> could<00:01:28.799> say<00:01:28.860> something<00:01:29.220> like

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
example you could say something like

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.090 
example you could say something like
maybe<00:01:30.240> two<00:01:30.600> extra<00:01:31.049> reps<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> tricep

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
maybe two extra reps on a tricep

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.710 
maybe two extra reps on a tricep
extension<00:01:32.220> is<00:01:32.820> going<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.329> benefit<00:01:33.630> your

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
extension is going to benefit your

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.219 
extension is going to benefit your
triceps<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.430> same<00:01:35.729> way<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.329> five<00:01:36.840> extra

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
triceps in the same way that five extra

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.020 
triceps in the same way that five extra
pounds<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.710> deadlift<00:01:38.189> would<00:01:38.460> benefit<00:01:38.880> your

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
pounds on a deadlift would benefit your

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.420 
pounds on a deadlift would benefit your
back<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.479> legs<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.829> really<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
back and legs so you really have to

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.420 
back and legs so you really have to
lower<00:01:41.700> your<00:01:41.869> expectation<00:01:42.869> for<00:01:43.079> how<00:01:43.590> quickly

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
lower your expectation for how quickly

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.600 
lower your expectation for how quickly
those<00:01:44.670> isolation<00:01:45.329> exercises<00:01:45.899> are<00:01:46.549> going<00:01:47.549> to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
those isolation exercises are going to

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.340 
those isolation exercises are going to
increase<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.090> weight<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.540> recognize<00:01:49.320> that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
increase in weight and recognize that

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.830 
increase in weight and recognize that
any<00:01:49.740> progression<00:01:50.250> at<00:01:50.430> all<00:01:50.670> even<00:01:51.540> if<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.780> just

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
any progression at all even if it's just

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.530 
any progression at all even if it's just
a<00:01:52.049> single<00:01:52.380> rep<00:01:52.799> or<00:01:53.040> even<00:01:53.369> half<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.850> rep<00:01:54.030> that

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
a single rep or even half a rep that

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.810 
a single rep or even half a rep that
still<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.110> significant<00:01:55.829> again<00:01:56.549> because

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
still is significant again because

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.580 
still is significant again because
you're<00:01:56.969> only<00:01:57.149> using<00:01:57.479> one<00:01:57.869> single<00:01:58.320> muscle

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
you're only using one single muscle

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.590 
you're only using one single muscle
group<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.700> second<00:02:00.090> thing<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.360> remember

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
group and the second thing to remember

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.990 
group and the second thing to remember
is<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.560> anytime<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.340> increase<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.969> weight

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
is that anytime you increase the weight

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.810 
is that anytime you increase the weight
on<00:02:03.479> an<00:02:03.750> isolation<00:02:04.320> exercise<00:02:04.829> you're<00:02:05.729> gonna

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
on an isolation exercise you're gonna

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.969 
on an isolation exercise you're gonna
feel<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.479> increase<00:02:06.990> way<00:02:07.320> more<00:02:07.560> heavily

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
feel that increase way more heavily

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.430 
feel that increase way more heavily
because<00:02:08.729> it's<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.119> much<00:02:09.330> bigger<00:02:09.690> percentage

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
because it's a much bigger percentage

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.290 
because it's a much bigger percentage
jump<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.819> comparison<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.660> increasing<00:02:13.080> the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
jump in comparison to increasing the

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.810 
jump in comparison to increasing the
wait<00:02:13.420> on<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.720> big<00:02:14.110> compound<00:02:14.650> exercise<00:02:15.100> for

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
wait on a big compound exercise for

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.180 
wait on a big compound exercise for
example<00:02:16.110> if<00:02:17.110> you're<00:02:17.290> performing<00:02:17.650> side

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
example if you're performing side

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.550 
example if you're performing side
lateral<00:02:18.730> raises<00:02:18.970> with<00:02:19.420> 20<00:02:19.840> pound<00:02:20.050> dumbbells

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
lateral raises with 20 pound dumbbells

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.860 
lateral raises with 20 pound dumbbells
and<00:02:20.890> then<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.730> increase<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.240> 22<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:22.810> a<00:02:22.840> half

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
and then you increase to 22 and a half

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.740 
and then you increase to 22 and a half
pound<00:02:23.380> dumbbells<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:24.850> are<00:02:25.090> increasing<00:02:25.660> the

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
pound dumbbells you are increasing the

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.320 
pound dumbbells you are increasing the
total<00:02:26.050> weight<00:02:26.350> lifted<00:02:26.770> by<00:02:26.890> five<00:02:27.220> pounds<00:02:27.910> which

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
total weight lifted by five pounds which

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.800 
total weight lifted by five pounds which
is<00:02:28.360> actually<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:29.100> 25%<00:02:30.100> increase<00:02:30.420> whereas<00:02:31.420> if

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
is actually a 25% increase whereas if

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.930 
is actually a 25% increase whereas if
you<00:02:31.930> were<00:02:31.960> performing<00:02:32.590> deadlifts<00:02:33.250> with<00:02:33.370> 200

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
you were performing deadlifts with 200

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.120 
you were performing deadlifts with 200
pounds<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:34.570> then<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:35.140> added<00:02:35.350> five<00:02:35.650> pounds

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
pounds and then you added five pounds

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.740 
pounds and then you added five pounds
the<00:02:36.220> increase<00:02:36.580> there<00:02:36.610> would<00:02:36.970> only<00:02:37.090> be<00:02:37.270> two<00:02:37.420> and

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
the increase there would only be two and

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.200 
the increase there would only be two and
a<00:02:37.780> half<00:02:38.020> percent<00:02:38.320> which<00:02:39.190> is<00:02:39.220> ten<00:02:39.610> times<00:02:39.820> less

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
a half percent which is ten times less

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.600 
a half percent which is ten times less
so<00:02:40.540> let<00:02:40.930> me<00:02:40.990> give<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.260> a<00:02:41.290> couple<00:02:41.560> tips<00:02:41.950> on<00:02:42.220> this

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
so let me give you a couple tips on this

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.240 
so let me give you a couple tips on this
particular<00:02:43.120> issue<00:02:43.320> first<00:02:44.320> off<00:02:44.500> if<00:02:44.680> jumping<00:02:45.100> up

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
particular issue first off if jumping up

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.760 
particular issue first off if jumping up
to<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.460> next<00:02:45.790> set<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.150> weights<00:02:46.530> on<00:02:47.530> an

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
to the next set of weights on an

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.040 
to the next set of weights on an
isolation<00:02:48.400> exercise<00:02:48.880> feels<00:02:49.240> too<00:02:49.450> heavy<00:02:49.480> for

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
isolation exercise feels too heavy for

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.770 
isolation exercise feels too heavy for
you<00:02:50.230> then<00:02:50.980> what<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:51.520> want<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.790> do<00:02:51.940> is<00:02:52.120> focus<00:02:52.450> on

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
you then what you want to do is focus on

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.420 
you then what you want to do is focus on
increasing<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.440> number<00:02:53.800> of<00:02:53.950> reps<00:02:54.280> that

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
increasing the number of reps that

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.070 
increasing the number of reps that
you're<00:02:54.550> performing<00:02:55.060> first<00:02:55.300> and<00:02:55.540> foremost

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
you're performing first and foremost

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.560 
you're performing first and foremost
before<00:02:56.980> you<00:02:57.430> try<00:02:57.610> to<00:02:57.640> go<00:02:57.850> ahead<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.210> add<00:02:58.330> more

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
before you try to go ahead and add more

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.140 
before you try to go ahead and add more
weight<00:02:58.630> so<00:02:59.410> instead<00:02:59.890> of<00:02:59.950> trying<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.430> increase

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
weight so instead of trying to increase

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.330 
weight so instead of trying to increase
the<00:03:01.330> weight<00:03:01.510> on<00:03:01.750> for<00:03:02.530> example<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:02.920> dumbbell

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
then increase the way from there or if

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.890 
then increase the way from there or if
you<00:03:12.400> get<00:03:12.520> to<00:03:12.640> ten<00:03:12.910> reps<00:03:13.150> on<00:03:13.300> a<00:03:13.330> side<00:03:13.600> lateral

isolation lifts in the same way that you

slowly and that's totally fine because

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.080 
slowly and that's totally fine because
