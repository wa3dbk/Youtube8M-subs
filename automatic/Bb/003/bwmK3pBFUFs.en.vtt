00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:06.059
 let's start making the wings of the 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.390
 angel we folded the ends of the clean 

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:11.960
 pipes to the center and we are going to join 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.960
 this way 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.519
 [Music] 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.500
 when we have it that way we are giving shape 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.500
 to the wings 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.250
 lists we continue with the next step 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.660
 we join the pipes clean by one of the 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.660
 extremes 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.500
 to make the dress we begin to 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.930
 roll it up and we open each time a 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.940
 little bit more the circle so that 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.780
 to finish we stayed like a dock in 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.780
 tail shape 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.280
 [Music] 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.390
 ah 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.400
 [Music] 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.000
 ah 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.000
 i 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.550
 we arrange it well and we already have the 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.550
 dress 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.950
 the next step is to stick the wings to the 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.020
 upper part of the dress 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.890
 you can use hot silicone or 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.890
 fast glue 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.500
 we have already made half of the little angel 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.410
 Now we make the angel's hair with 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.480
 a clean pipes of another tone 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.670
 we're hitting the poliespÃ¡n ball 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.670
 with silicone or with real glue 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.110
 at the point where the neck of the 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.270
 angelito crosses the ball with a punch 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.270
 or something similar that you have at home 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.420
 to put the head in our little angel 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.270
 let's use a piece of cleaner 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.690
 pipes we put it around the neck area 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.230
 we take it out by the middle of the wings and 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.230
 we hooked 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.080
 we painted the face of the angel and by 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.830
 hole we have made we put it through 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.830
 he cleans pipes 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:29.510
 now we make the crown making a 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.510
 circle with the remainder of clean pipes 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.640
 we cut what's left and we put the 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.640
 crown 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.249
 [Music] 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.670
 and finally we take a piece of 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:04.010
 ribbon tie or tie and tie it to 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.010
 the crown to hang the little angel 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.180
 and with this we have already finished our 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.310
 angel for Christmas tree stand 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.180
 get to work and create your own 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.180
 Christmas decorations 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.760
