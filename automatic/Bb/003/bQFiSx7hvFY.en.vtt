00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.850
 franz opportunity we have this not that 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:12.220
 There are 300 arrives because it does not give an image that 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:14.580
 after doing an analysis to the fault 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.060
 here 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.199
 we turn it on 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.570
 We know it's working because 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:26.020
 book and there in the background we can see 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.660
 the letters 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.220
 start phones and the internet like this or 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.680
 when the good comes out that first 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.230
 we know that it also lights because there 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.640
 As you can see the vibrator 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.750
 move something that we give to the button 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.030
 turned on and they see it it turned on but already 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.380
 we try another screen still does not give 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.500
 image and looking in google and placing 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.930
 the boat louis fault 300 then 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.090
 we can analyze here that tells us that 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.210
 for that doubt should work light 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.280
 have two lines on line 3 that line 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.040
 red that makes contact to which a point of 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.040
 test to test point from here 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.870
 and what are these 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.340
 Three of these points is the first 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.910
 if this has continued marking of 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.360
 here to point 3 of the connector is 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:31.100
 marking but point 4 which is the line 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.900
 blue and it arrives that still to a coil then 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.869
 one capacitor makes contact with another 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.470
 capacitor that line if it's not 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.660
 arriving 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.670
 but here is an error because here 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.700
 mark 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.659
 that comes out of the condenser and comes out 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.170
 here of this part of the urine then 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.470
 how do we know if that fails very easy 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.760
 we take the multimeter then on the scale 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.020
 of continuity measurement 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.840
 acn attached 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.260
 to place it here 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.929
 let's analyze the contacts 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:13.620
 here we see that that test point 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:17.000
 and here according to the plan has to have 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.390
 continuity here point 3 there we see it 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.380
 but point 4 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.240
 have continuity here supposedly is 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.120
 the capacitor according to the plan that's 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.010
 wrong because this negative part of 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.860
 this filter has to have contains here 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.990
 this filter to this urine here or here 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.100
 even it was given but it does not have 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.320
 continuity 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.460
 the last continuity is after 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.070
 enter that the component 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.040
 and it's a voltage that gives you the 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.570
 voltage if it's coming to take off 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.210
 even up here but from here to 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.430
 there it is until the connector is not 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.300
 past that voltage the line is broken 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.950
 we want to make a jumper to that line 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.300
 let's make a jumper, let's use a 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.260
 thread 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.260
 a copper wire 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.960
 the karting 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.960
 well sharp 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.890
 a translation of a plan to line 4a 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.890
 let go of this warmth 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.490
 I had already applied a little cross 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.760
 before to be successful in welding 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.760
 I marisol 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:39.050
 and ready here and only 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.050
 now we are going to form the other point here 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.100
 make it urine 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.260
 already soldier there and if all right 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.700
 of the phone should give us light in the 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.690
 display 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.690
 If it happens 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:18.170
 the anvil was badly made 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.170
 and very probably more geometric 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.410
 resolved 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.080
 to release it well 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.070
 it is believed or wrongly done that the soldier more 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.070
 on the tape 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.510
 and now yes 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.629
 all right 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:32.840
 and we have giving birth Now 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.520
 the image perfectly service the 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.200
 Arauca professional technical service in 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.200
 mobile telephony and mobile devices
