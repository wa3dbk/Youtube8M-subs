00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
by hon Africans and I think this project

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.630 
by hon Africans and I think this project
of<00:01:03.930> course<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.320> was<00:01:04.470> really<00:01:04.769> into<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> project

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
of course I was really into the project

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.820 
of course I was really into the project
because<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.000> curated<00:01:06.540> part<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.409> I

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
because I curated part of it and I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.679 
because I curated part of it and I
worked<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.280> her<00:01:08.430> Africans<00:01:08.909> very<00:01:09.090> closely<00:01:09.479> I

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
worked with her Africans very closely I

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.310 
worked with her Africans very closely I
admired<00:01:10.200> also<00:01:10.830> how<00:01:11.400> he<00:01:11.460> was<00:01:11.880> trying<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.020> fight

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
admired also how he was trying to fight

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.420 
admired also how he was trying to fight
something<00:01:13.909> so<00:01:14.909> problematic<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:16.110> big<00:01:16.380> with<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
something so problematic so big with the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.530 
something so problematic so big with the
power<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.880> creativity<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:20.060> that's<00:01:21.060> also<00:01:21.330> I

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
power of creativity and that's also I

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.240 
power of creativity and that's also I
think<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.960> was<00:01:22.140> one<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.530> main<00:01:22.740> reasons

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
think that was one of the main reasons

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.590 
think that was one of the main reasons
why<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.430> bought<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.939> because<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.390> really

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
why I bought it because I really

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:33.460 
why I bought it because I really
believed<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.830> his<00:01:26.040> story

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.710 
the ones that I have here now in my home

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
Iranian photographer and one of Leander

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.070 
Iranian photographer and one of Leander
early<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.560> an<00:01:44.220> Argentinean<00:01:44.940> photographer<00:01:45.810> and

I paid for the total portfolio by then I

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:59.690 
I paid for the total portfolio by then I
think<00:01:49.619> 2000<00:01:50.460> euros<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.930> work<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.500> Sharon<00:01:59.310> Nash

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
think 2000 euros the work of Sharon Nash

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.150 
think 2000 euros the work of Sharon Nash
out<00:01:59.940> it's<00:02:00.270> without<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.690> title<00:02:01.050> actually<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.070> a

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
out it's without a title actually it's a

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.950 
out it's without a title actually it's a
very<00:02:02.190> strong<00:02:02.700> image<00:02:03.060> because<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.600> in<00:02:03.720> black

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
very strong image because it's in black

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.290 
very strong image because it's in black
and<00:02:04.110> white<00:02:04.289> it<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> very<00:02:05.670> strong<00:02:05.970> image

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
and white it is a very strong image

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.469 
and white it is a very strong image
because<00:02:06.660> she<00:02:06.869> doesn't<00:02:07.380> only<00:02:07.920> use<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:09.060> image

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
because she doesn't only use the image

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.350 
because she doesn't only use the image
it<00:02:09.899> doesn't<00:02:09.929> only<00:02:10.440> use<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.060> photograph<00:02:12.060> but

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
it doesn't only use the photograph but

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.140 
it doesn't only use the photograph but
she<00:02:12.510> also<00:02:12.720> uses<00:02:13.110> text<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.980> for<00:02:14.430> me<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.760> idea

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
she also uses text and for me the idea

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.020 
she also uses text and for me the idea
of<00:02:15.330> connecting<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.380> very<00:02:17.040> much<00:02:17.280> related<00:02:17.700> also

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
of connecting is very much related also

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.150 
of connecting is very much related also
to<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.510> topic<00:02:18.989> of<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.320> series<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.100> the

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
to the topic of the series and the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.640 
to the topic of the series and the
project<00:02:20.550> that<00:02:20.670> I've<00:02:20.820> worked<00:02:20.850> on<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:21.989> for<00:02:22.410> me<00:02:22.530> it

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
project that I've worked on so for me it

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.400 
project that I've worked on so for me it
also<00:02:22.800> has<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.220> apart<00:02:24.000> from<00:02:24.239> that<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.600> think<00:02:24.989> it's

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
also has a apart from that I think it's

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.350 
also has a apart from that I think it's

collecting as a strategy or collecting

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.920

as<00:03:55.620> an<00:03:55.740> investment<00:03:56.250> and<00:03:56.640> most<00:03:57.450> of<00:03:57.600> the<00:03:57.690> time

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
as an investment and most of the time

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.710 
as an investment and most of the time
the<00:03:58.410> things<00:03:58.740> that<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.010> buy<00:03:59.340> are<00:03:59.730> also<00:04:00.150> connected

the things that I buy are also connected

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.200 
the things that I buy are also connected
to<00:04:00.930> my<00:04:01.380> work<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:02.070> I<00:04:02.400> know<00:04:02.520> the<00:04:02.970> photographer

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
to my work so I know the photographer

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.410 
to my work so I know the photographer
personally<00:04:04.140> or<00:04:04.440> I<00:04:04.470> worked<00:04:05.340> with<00:04:05.489> someone<00:04:06.030> or

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
personally or I worked with someone or

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.690 
personally or I worked with someone or
it's<00:04:06.660> part<00:04:06.959> of<00:04:07.020> an<00:04:07.140> exhibition<00:04:07.410> I<00:04:07.800> curated<00:04:08.280> I

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
it's part of an exhibition I curated I

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.100 
it's part of an exhibition I curated I
think<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.150> only<00:04:09.300> way<00:04:09.660> to<00:04:09.800> collect<00:04:10.800> is<00:04:11.220> a<00:04:11.250> very

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
think the only way to collect is a very

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.990 
think the only way to collect is a very
personal<00:04:13.110> way<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:14.160> think<00:04:14.580> you<00:04:14.970> should

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
personal way and I think you should

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.510 
personal way and I think you should
always<00:04:15.300> buy<00:04:15.720> what<00:04:16.080> you<00:04:16.200> really<00:04:16.470> like<00:04:16.799> or

always buy what you really like or

or starting collector to go out there go

or starting collector to go out there go

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
to exhibitions go to fairs and try even

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.930 
to exhibitions go to fairs and try even
if<00:05:22.330> you<00:05:22.510> don't<00:05:22.690> buy<00:05:22.960> anything<00:05:23.290> try<00:05:24.280> to<00:05:24.340> see<00:05:24.730> as

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
if you don't buy anything try to see as

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.760 
if you don't buy anything try to see as
much<00:05:25.180> as<00:05:25.360> possible<00:05:25.840> because<00:05:25.990> that's<00:05:26.260> the<00:05:26.440> only

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
much as possible because that's the only

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.930 
much as possible because that's the only
way<00:05:26.920> to<00:05:27.220> make<00:05:27.820> a<00:05:28.360> difference<00:05:29.110> between<00:05:29.940> types

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
way to make a difference between types

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.150 
way to make a difference between types
of<00:05:31.210> works<00:05:31.510> but<00:05:31.840> also<00:05:32.050> between<00:05:32.650> what<00:05:33.010> has

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
of works but also between what has

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.310 
of works but also between what has
quality<00:05:33.730> and<00:05:33.910> what<00:05:34.030> is<00:05:34.180> not

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
quality and what is not

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:43.710 
quality and what is not
I<00:05:41.460> think<00:05:42.460> photography<00:05:43.030> is<00:05:43.150> a<00:05:43.180> very<00:05:43.480> good

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
I think photography is a very good

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.990 
I think photography is a very good
medium<00:05:43.930> to<00:05:44.200> start<00:05:44.710> with<00:05:44.950> as<00:05:45.310> a<00:05:45.340> collector

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
medium to start with as a collector

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.390 
medium to start with as a collector
because<00:05:46.180> it's<00:05:46.990> medium<00:05:47.560> of<00:05:47.680> course<00:05:47.920> everyone

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
because it's medium of course everyone

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.640 
because it's medium of course everyone
can<00:05:48.640> relate<00:05:48.970> to<00:05:49.240> everyone<00:05:49.600> makes<00:05:49.990> photographs

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
can relate to everyone makes photographs

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.550 
can relate to everyone makes photographs
everyone<00:05:51.430> looks<00:05:52.210> at<00:05:52.390> photographs<00:05:52.750> and<00:05:53.230> daily

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
everyone looks at photographs and daily

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.380 
everyone looks at photographs and daily
life<00:05:53.770> so<00:05:54.370> it's<00:05:54.520> something<00:05:54.910> that's<00:05:55.090> very<00:05:55.150> close

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.390 
life so it's something that's very close

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.470 
life so it's something that's very close
to<00:05:55.690> home<00:05:56.170> and<00:05:56.470> at<00:05:56.980> the<00:05:57.040> same<00:05:57.370> time<00:05:57.700> it<00:05:58.120> has<00:05:58.330> to

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.480 
to home and at the same time it has to

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.510 
to home and at the same time it has to
do<00:05:58.600> with<00:05:58.750> reality<00:05:58.990> most<00:05:59.680> of<00:05:59.890> the<00:05:59.980> time<00:06:00.190> it's<00:06:00.400> a

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
do with reality most of the time it's a

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.090 
do with reality most of the time it's a
reflection<00:06:00.970> of<00:06:01.240> reality<00:06:01.480> so<00:06:02.050> it's<00:06:02.560> something

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
reflection of reality so it's something

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.660 
reflection of reality so it's something
that's<00:06:03.400> pretty<00:06:04.090> easy<00:06:04.450> to<00:06:04.930> understand<00:06:05.560> and<00:06:05.980> I

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 
that's pretty easy to understand and I

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:11.640 
that's pretty easy to understand and I
think<00:06:06.900> as<00:06:07.900> a<00:06:07.960> third<00:06:08.410> that<00:06:08.980> it's<00:06:10.440> if<00:06:11.440> you

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
think as a third that it's if you

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.160 
think as a third that it's if you
compare<00:06:12.070> it<00:06:12.100> to<00:06:12.250> other<00:06:12.400> disciplines<00:06:13.240> like<00:06:13.690> art

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.170 
compare it to other disciplines like art

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.790 
compare it to other disciplines like art
or<00:06:14.500> design<00:06:14.790> it's<00:06:15.790> not<00:06:16.270> that<00:06:16.510> costly<00:06:16.840> so<00:06:17.500> a<00:06:17.530> lot

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
or design it's not that costly so a lot

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.740 
or design it's not that costly so a lot
