and the goalkeeper Lillis and as you can
see<00:02:23.080> we've<00:02:23.350> got<00:02:23.380> 98<00:02:24.040> chemistry<00:02:24.850> because

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
see we've got 98 chemistry because

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.450 
see we've got 98 chemistry because
basically<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.230> left-wing<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:26.860> think<00:02:27.070> Grahame

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
basically the left-wing I think Grahame

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.770 
basically the left-wing I think Grahame
is<00:02:27.580> he<00:02:27.670> called<00:02:27.940> it<00:02:28.120> just<00:02:28.330> doesn't<00:02:28.570> have<00:02:28.750> that

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
is he called it just doesn't have that

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.300 
is he called it just doesn't have that
nine<00:02:29.140> chem<00:02:29.380> because<00:02:29.560> it's<00:02:29.680> in<00:02:29.740> a<00:02:29.770> left<00:02:30.010> wing

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
nine chem because it's in a left wing

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.400 
nine chem because it's in a left wing
formation<00:02:30.640> opposition<00:02:31.540> sorry<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:32.110> hopefully

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
formation opposition sorry so hopefully

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.990 
formation opposition sorry so hopefully
and<00:02:32.830> we're<00:02:32.980> gonna<00:02:33.070> get<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.280> left<00:02:33.460> forward<00:02:33.760> card

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
and we're gonna get a left forward card

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.300 
and we're gonna get a left forward card
as<00:02:34.240> soon<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.750> we'll<00:02:35.200> get<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.470> 99<00:02:35.860> chem<00:02:36.040> team

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
as soon and we'll get a 99 chem team

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.710 
as soon and we'll get a 99 chem team
eventually<00:02:36.580> salissa<00:02:37.030> we<00:02:37.120> really<00:02:37.330> really<00:02:37.510> sick

however he does go and scores well Ben
Zia<00:03:39.460> and<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:40.060> wasn't<00:03:40.360> happy<00:03:40.450> about<00:03:40.540> that

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
Zia and I wasn't happy about that

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.210 
Zia and I wasn't happy about that
because<00:03:40.900> that<00:03:41.050> goal<00:03:41.410> looked<00:03:41.560> really<00:03:41.920> really

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
because that goal looked really really

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.340 
because that goal looked really really
stupid<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:43.180> you<00:03:43.270> know<00:03:43.450> I<00:03:43.630> think<00:03:44.110> a<00:03:44.260> normal

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
stupid and you know I think a normal

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.540 
stupid and you know I think a normal
goalkeeper<00:03:44.800> would<00:03:44.920> have<00:03:45.040> probably<00:03:45.190> you<00:03:45.520> know

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
goalkeeper would have probably you know

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.860 
goalkeeper would have probably you know
got<00:03:45.820> a<00:03:45.850> hand<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.210> that<00:03:46.240> or<00:03:46.390> something<00:03:46.630> cuz<00:03:46.810> I

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
got a hand to that or something cuz I

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.210 
got a hand to that or something cuz I
don't<00:03:46.930> think<00:03:47.110> that<00:03:47.320> is<00:03:47.380> really<00:03:47.590> legit<00:03:47.950> however

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
don't think that is really legit however

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.310 
don't think that is really legit however
look<00:03:48.460> at<00:03:48.670> that<00:03:48.850> from<00:03:49.060> Scott<00:03:49.390> Boden<00:03:49.780> what<00:03:50.080> a

each<00:04:24.610> of<00:04:24.730> his<00:04:24.790> defense<00:04:25.120> is<00:04:25.240> very<00:04:25.450> very

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
each of his defense is very very

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:26.730 
each of his defense is very very
difficult<00:04:25.660> to<00:04:26.080> defend

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
difficult to defend

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.890 
difficult to defend
like<00:04:26.979> this<00:04:27.220> he<00:04:27.520> does<00:04:27.789> punch<00:04:28.479> out<00:04:28.690> their<00:04:28.780> goal

because<00:05:12.789> basically<00:05:13.060> this<00:05:13.509> guy<00:05:13.720> says<00:05:13.960> no<00:05:14.199> I

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
because basically this guy says no I

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.710 
because basically this guy says no I
think<00:05:14.830> he<00:05:15.190> raged<00:05:15.460> I'm<00:05:15.759> not<00:05:15.970> sure<00:05:16.030> what<00:05:16.539> it

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
think he raged I'm not sure what it

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.909 
think he raged I'm not sure what it
seems<00:05:17.020> weird<00:05:17.259> that<00:05:17.349> it's<00:05:17.530> fair<00:05:17.590> after<00:05:17.740> that

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
seems weird that it's fair after that

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.309 
seems weird that it's fair after that
goal<00:05:18.159> he<00:05:18.460> raged<00:05:18.729> and<00:05:19.030> you<00:05:19.449> think<00:05:19.690> we<00:05:19.750> win<00:05:20.020> but

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 
goal he raged and you think we win but

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.439 
goal he raged and you think we win but
unfortunately<00:05:21.009> we<00:05:21.069> don't<00:05:21.250> so<00:05:21.639> he<00:05:21.819> raged<00:05:22.090> and

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
unfortunately we don't so he raged and

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:24.300 
unfortunately we don't so he raged and
we<00:05:22.750> have<00:05:22.840> to<00:05:22.930> do<00:05:23.020> the<00:05:23.139> final<00:05:23.289> all<00:05:23.680> over<00:05:24.039> again

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
we have to do the final all over again

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.249 
we have to do the final all over again
and<00:05:24.490> I<00:05:24.880> mean<00:05:25.060> it<00:05:25.240> was<00:05:25.389> so<00:05:25.419> even<00:05:25.960> in<00:05:26.020> that<00:05:26.139> match

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
and I mean it was so even in that match

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:27.839 
and I mean it was so even in that match
that<00:05:26.440> it<00:05:26.530> could<00:05:26.650> have<00:05:26.740> swung<00:05:26.889> either<00:05:27.159> way<00:05:27.370> so<00:05:27.430> I

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
that it could have swung either way so I

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:29.550 
that it could have swung either way so I
don't<00:05:28.630> know<00:05:28.690> if<00:05:28.750> I'm<00:05:28.870> happy<00:05:29.139> about<00:05:29.229> that<00:05:29.319> or

Nikki<00:06:47.050> knows<00:06:47.169> Boden<00:06:47.530> but<00:06:47.650> that<00:06:47.740> wasn't<00:06:47.980> that

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.070 
Nikki knows Boden but that wasn't that

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.409 
Nikki knows Boden but that wasn't that
wasn't<00:06:48.130> worth<00:06:48.430> missing<00:06:48.790> the<00:06:48.850> series<00:06:49.090> I<00:06:49.180> think

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:49.419 
wasn't worth missing the series I think

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:51.240

Graham<00:06:49.930> here<00:06:50.169> though<00:06:50.350> unfortunately<00:06:51.160> not

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:51.250 
Graham here though unfortunately not

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.530

talking<00:06:51.550> away<00:06:51.639> that<00:06:51.850> go<00:06:52.030> I<00:06:52.060> think<00:06:52.180> I<00:06:52.330> still

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:52.540 
talking away that go I think I still

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.020 
talking away that go I think I still
took<00:06:52.870> a<00:06:53.050> step<00:06:53.470> too<00:06:53.830> far<00:06:53.860> really<00:06:54.430> and<00:06:54.760> they

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030 
took a step too far really and they

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.190 
took a step too far really and they
couldn't<00:06:55.480> get<00:06:55.540> the<00:06:55.660> shot<00:06:55.810> away<00:06:55.900> properly

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:56.200 
couldn't get the shot away properly

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.260 
couldn't get the shot away properly
whether<00:06:56.860> he<00:06:57.010> does<00:06:57.190> go<00:06:57.340> is<00:06:57.460> go<00:06:57.490> making<00:06:57.880> it<00:06:58.000> 22

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.270 
whether he does go is go making it 22

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.060 
whether he does go is go making it 22
and<00:06:58.750> that<00:06:59.260> this<00:06:59.410> is<00:06:59.470> not<00:06:59.680> looking<00:06:59.800> good<00:06:59.950> for

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:00.070 
and that this is not looking good for

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.980 
and that this is not looking good for
the<00:07:00.400> anger<00:07:00.669> did<00:07:00.910> score<00:07:01.150> that<00:07:01.330> goal<00:07:01.540> and<00:07:01.780> here

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:01.990 
the anger did score that goal and here
