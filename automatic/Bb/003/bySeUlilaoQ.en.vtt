00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.410
 Hello and welcome here you are there from the man of the center vl and 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.820
 Today we have for you ten special vehicles simulator from the house 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.519
 astragon 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.380
 in special vehicles simulator waiting for a colorful pile of mobile pedestals only 

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:34.280
 to be taken care of by you 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.350
 no matter if police cars buses 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.580
 Cars what the CAS or ambulance 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.540
 The Special Vehicle Simulator offers everything the simulator will get by the end of March 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.120
 so far 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.800
 and I find it embarrassingly accurate in the city gets out 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.500
 that is what we are allowed to do sometimes special vehicles uncertain 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.440
 besides, we just become 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.560
 We take directly to the police car go on Temposünder 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.500
 but care 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.970
 that sounds like promising so much again 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.610
 yet we have not let our beautiful packaging facts be intimidating 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.330
 finally in the game and first carefully the accelerator pedal 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.210
 if that view of police is going to grab us in the month, we're still stuck in the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.820
 bone 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.460
 but we can give the all-clear 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.220
 the physics engine test reasonably usable this time and no more 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.970
 so completely turned off 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.440
 but the optics seem so strangely familiar 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.530
 certainly plays 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.380
 it's almost a case for us 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.200
 but she was not fought for parallels with the Fall Simulator 2010 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.430
 and Game not necessarily the license plate on our glossy 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.340
 Polished police have gone 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.620
 At least the police car finally has functioning systems with numbers 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.410
 and those for the drivers respond 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.410
 even if they are not very clever 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.920
 she was afraid of the worst 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.050
 but the special vehicle simulator does a lot better than its predecessor 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.620
 even if that does not mean it did well 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.560
 the graphics are not quite dewy and driving 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.880
 like on a real street does not want to adjust properly 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.549
 realistic driving behavior just different 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.389
 At least the scope of the simulation was right 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:19.449
 astragon after special vehicles simulator a friendly fleet 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:20.319
 donated 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.079
 And if that's not enough, it can easily be your own 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.749
 Locomotives play tomorrow 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:30.499
 This way, new mission can be done or not done 

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:34.749
 a guide and a map of the girls on the CD included 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.620
 we would have found it more beautiful 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.779
 you would have integrated a pretty Mini Med into the game 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:44.419
 because that is the orientation to the political realities difficult 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.510
 passengers not sitting in the bus drive through the area with the race car 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.749
 organize races in the Hessenstraße 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:54.749
 and everyone suddenly enjoyed the truck 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:04.619
 in the hospital bed to keep francs 

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:08.929
 according to their will, the tax rate after 883 is the roads 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:15.279
 The special vehicles simulator offers both a mission to the moon as well 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:19.319
 a free ride mode that does not differ greatly from each other 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:21.720
 to emphasize positively 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.899
 the water watch pushed 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:28.629
 as it also allows us to fall into a gesture situation the sample hand to 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.629
 "I have to drive safely onto the street here 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:36.039
 It is also pleasant that you have the action plan for the setting 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.279
 can make so that you did not put on an appreciation 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:47.119
 All in all, the witness confirmed accordingly received loaded 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:50.159
 but it exists 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:54.029
 As always, the entire test is at the analysts' meeting 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.979
 we say goodbye to you at this point 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:00.199
 until the next time since then but like TV
