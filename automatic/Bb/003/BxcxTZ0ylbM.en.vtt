00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
that's how it looks completed it's

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.259

pretty<00:04:03.409> much<00:04:03.470> a<00:04:03.709> complete<00:04:04.189> reversal<00:04:04.730> of<00:04:05.060> what

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
pretty much a complete reversal of what

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.119 
pretty much a complete reversal of what
you've<00:04:05.450> just<00:04:05.480> done<00:04:05.959> and<00:04:06.739> that<00:04:06.859> would<00:04:06.980> make<00:04:07.069> a

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
you've just done and that would make a

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.710 
you've just done and that would make a
lot<00:04:07.430> more<00:04:07.579> sense<00:04:07.639> than<00:04:08.150> it<00:04:08.329> feels<00:04:08.419> quite

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
lot more sense than it feels quite

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.659 
lot more sense than it feels quite
different<00:04:09.109> I'll<00:04:09.230> be<00:04:09.530> worried<00:04:09.739> if<00:04:09.829> it<00:04:09.950> was<00:04:10.069> so
