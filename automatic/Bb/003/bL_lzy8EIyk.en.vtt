00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.790
 hello that such little friends and friends 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.610
 youtube I am dark ozz vtm and good in this 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.400
 thing is something a little video about the 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.740
 windows 10 update is worth 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.410
 as you know the update 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.290
 it left yesterday that was July 29 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.720
 of 2015 today we are at July 30, 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.790
 2015 and many people have had 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:50.400
 problems when trying to update your 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.400
 windows 10 system because when 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.079
 you make the reservation and everything tells us that 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.400
 we have to wait a certain time 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.079
 because they are doing in groups and this 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.870
 kind of things go as you can see here 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.780
 are you are part of the biggest event of 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.280
 update and all these things and that 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.649
 are doing it in groups so that 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.830
 the system is saturated and things like that are worth 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:16.259
 but I was here yesterday waiting 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.960
 that my update arrives is 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.310
 investigating on the internet been doing 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.860
 almost everything to be able to have my windows 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.530
 10 since it's been a day that we're going to 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.130
 give it is fine 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.500
 I found a way that there are two 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.159
 forms when you go to your windows 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.159
 day 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.350
 when you are going to upload your play here 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.110
 as friends to the updates will be 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.560
 views automatically and there is no 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.830
 ok there are times here there is some error 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.710
 that error is because when we 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.600
 let's look for updates we get 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.300
 an error that can not be searched for 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.160
 here what we have a problem a 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.100
 problem about the configuration of 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.290
 Internet vale is the most common problem 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.480
 since I had that problem and then I've 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.510
 had another little thing we're going to see how it 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.860
 fix these problems of what we're going 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.630
 to do 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.460
 between internet networks 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.460
 from internet and shared resources 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.090
 and good to be here we are connecting 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.850
 a network on the internet and let's go to the 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.360
 part 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.820
 lower left that says options for 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.880
 internet, let's click there and go 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.210
 to go as you see this window we are going to 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.160
 give connections and here in the option 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.710
 of age configuration let's give it 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.990
 click and here in this little box 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.170
 let's activate the box that says 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.940
 detect the configuration 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.700
 automatically if you are already 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.910
 activated let's remove we accept 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.550
 and then we open again and we put this 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.240
 thing is worth as it was already good and we left 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.820
 as it was if you do not have it checked 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.190
 to have to mark lavalle I do not 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.900
 already one of this demanded to accept 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.920
 everything and they're going to have to start looking 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.470
 your update to base everything 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.240
 perfectly fine but there is something else 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.540
 when we go to our windows 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.540
 of day 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.340
 and we are going to look 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.739
 Updates look for them in all this 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.140
 time and everything and do not know any 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.420
 update on windows 10 is worth this 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.489
 it's another problem I've been waiting for already 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.739
 that as you saw that little one 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.510
 window a moment ago tells me that 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.720
 I have to wait ok I do not want 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.720
 be waiting for you to be the 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.569
 system and when he wants it I already 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.800
 I want to have my windows installed like this 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:01.630
 we have to do some things better 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.630
 first let's see to close this 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:09.719
 we have to go to our local disk 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.750
 ok we have to go to windows then 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:16.169
 we have to look here for a folder that 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.449
 it's called distribution software and 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.910
 let's go as we see here several 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:23.880
 folders we will go to download or 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.610
 download in this let's erase everything 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.199
 what's here is worth here in my case there 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.199
 four things we're going to give you to erase 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.700
 and continue 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.070
 once all this is deleted we are going 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.240
 to be perfectly since we are going to 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.650
 do 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.090
 we can go back to everyone and we're going to 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.090
 need this is worth now 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:51.260
 what are we going to have to write a 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:55.080
 code in the valley system execution 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.659
 that we can search here for executing 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.400
 we can open this was going to have a 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:03.240
 small window like the one here 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.699
 or if it's not pressing the windows button and 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.759
 the letter was at the same time and it will come out 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.289
 this box in this box are going to 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:13.289
 have to write what I have written 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.990
 here on twitter that is this little 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:18.810
 code that they will write to execute 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:22.680
 ok here in this case is already placed 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:26.389
 but equally it is there and we are going to give it 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:29.759
 to accept when we give to secrete esteva 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:31.430

 this time we will have to wait for a 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.590
 determined time depends on internet 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:49.940

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:51.560
 about 2 hours to 5 hours that would be the 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.220
 download and installation and the 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.780
 configuration is worth it in this we no longer have 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.220
