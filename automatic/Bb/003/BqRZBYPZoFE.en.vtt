00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.290
 here comes the pescara coach 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.730
 if cosmi the bitterness was part 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.060
 of the exhibition there is the bitterness of 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.910
 this result although surely the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.990
 draw would have been the most result 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.790
 more truthful but mine is clear 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.070
 interpretation may seem like parts 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:33.050
 but you who know me know you know me 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.030
 I almost always express according to what 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.060
 is what the field offers, the field has 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.280
 proposed a game for 40 minutes 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.500
 we have interpreted it well at least for 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.730
 what concerns us 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.180
 leave your hand in the right way e 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.540
 we arrived in a dangerous manner 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.260
 therefore not unrealistic to throw in two or 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.550
 three occasions and where it really was 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.350
 which I compliment the very good the 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.110
 goalkeeper especially on the first why 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.470
 already they are a detour there it was 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.450
 decisive is very good in the beyond though 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.189
 of the occasions that did not materialize mo 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.990
 it seems to me that the team was 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.260
 also interpreting that tactically 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:18.480
 which we had prepared 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:21.060
 then there was the episode where you answer it 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:26.370
 took a walk with your hand on 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.530
 ball and that unfortunately for the I dress 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.210
 I've got the long view. In short, I can 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.850
 see from 80 meters what you don't 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.869
 unfortunately this comes from a gift from 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.970
 nature in other words other defects e 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:44.590
 then we conceded the goal after the goal 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.479
 who can be honest the team is 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.340
 not even nervous because nervousness 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.659
 it would have been legitimate in other words I want 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.460
 say maybe even risking some 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.360
 expulsion that often happens this way 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.020
 when you feel instead 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:07.520
 the second half was little 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.840
 little aware that the Terni area 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.720
 obviously he cared so much about this 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.430
 result and therefore could be maybe 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.250
 not quiet on the result of 1 to 0 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.660
 instead we made life too 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:25.170
 easy from an emotional point of view 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.430
 forum I saw no resignation 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.750
 But I saw a team that didn't 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.209
 he was looking for the right solutions for 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.550
 then equalize the second half a 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.709
 ternano has struggled very little for 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.470
 keep that result that was born in 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.390
 my judgment now I don't want to say in 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.850
 undeserved, however, random way 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.650
 long 0 first time does not fit 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.440
 you have perhaps exaggerated the second half 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.570
 with long launches since there was 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.400
 Sforzini's entry into the field is 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:55.790
 changed something from the point of view 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:03:00.930
 of the phase of possession but look at and 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.800
 when when there is a declaratory sforzini 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.540
 no mandatory no let's say that 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.760
 it would be good to play in depth 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.640
 when you play in depth you miss it 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.860
 someone who concludes and gives weight 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.720
 let's say that close to sforzini 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.670
 they played other players who played 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.370
 however they have characteristics for 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.200
 go inside regardless if an accusation 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.020
 I think he made a great first 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.750
 time and second time we saw little but 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.790
 is not a discourse of sforzini is that 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.890
 the whole team then I among other things 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.200
 I didn't even see maybe I saw 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.090
 some long throw because when you do 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.500
 struggling to build the game does it in 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.820
 very slow 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.620
 often the launch can create 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.970
 in short, difficulties are teams that are 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.670
 in the first five who play 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.700
 constantly with this situation 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.830
 I mean it's no shame that problem 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.630
 we did not and above all those 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.730
 few times we have made it 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.980
 defenders in Terni I was much more 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.770
 good because they have always limited 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.210
 sforzini especially farkas here is this 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.640
 resignation layer 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.570
 I look more I spoke not 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.220
 they designate that the team has fallen 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:13.760
 too much compared to what he had seen 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.400
 the first time and then you know when 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.510
 falls in this way and go to examine 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.270
 the situation from a point of view 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.880
 physical from a point of view, however, me 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:26.450
 I believe at least for the experience that 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.640
 a team implodes all together in the 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.700
 same time, little what he has 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:35.090
 made the pescara today that is the game goes 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.530
 parks and you have to run so it is 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.890
 normal that there is fatigue 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.660
 feeling that the team has jumped 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.370
 down too much compared to what was the 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.680
 difficulty of this game at least me 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.050
 I saw a complicated but not a match 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.250
 impossible at least from above then I repeat 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.570
 I saw it too long and then 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.280
 for the grandstand maybe I saw also 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.640
 worse by the way out of this 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.620
 crisis of results now on the head 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.960
 with his head now I hope that 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:07.340
 to have come out of the big play speech 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.560
 off because we were not in limbo for 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.930
 several matches where a match is won 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.160
 it would have meant returning there not 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.440
 we succeeded 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.440
 I must be honest more for our faults 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:23.870
 and now I hope this situation does not 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:26.599
 determine relaxation but cda maybe 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.310
 that takes that pressure out of us 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:30.590
 win by force to go maybe 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.699
 field to play with more if as it has 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.389
 played for 40 million 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:36.860
 here people are not just us 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:40.099
 until the goal the side saw a 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.960
 less good fish from the outside is that it gave the 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.990
 feeling of a demotivated team that 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.849
 therefore he had no game concepts 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.740
 no longer talk about play offs is not a 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:50.150
 provocation are not real are had 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.340
 you are the union words of us 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.849
 you have to look at it I do the version then 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.830
 can use if today we say the play 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:59.529
 off or we 're not there and I believe 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.280
 that right now you need to be 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:03.990
 realists and find again 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.750
 already in the match with the novara because 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.190
 see at the bottom of the ranking 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.290
 we have drawn with the citadel 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.060
 Sunday really seemed to be there 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.440
 end of the world citadel I would like 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.080
 remember that you can play with us has 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:21.150
 won with siena and today he has won again 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:22.500
 with you tell me in Cesena then 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.940
 you have to be lucky too 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.820
 we drew with the pescara does not have 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.440
 more won with nobody yes it goes be true 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.700
 last matches but today was one 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.510
 lot other than brescia 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:35.130
 brescia we did not repeat today is okay 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.230
 in other words sixth of here to say that the 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.419
 result is liar maybe step by step 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.390
 the coach who then complains the fine 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:43.560
 ternana gol did us not and therefore 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.270
 in short, what he said to the referee 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.720
 to make a referee so angry 

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:51.330
 nothing because unfortunately revised with 19 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.790
 therefore people once less 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.530
 there was the referee so if you do n't want to 

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:58.220
 he saw you he had escaped being 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:01.410
 visited wind the fourth man a 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:03.840
 of the assistant to the referee and some 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:05.850
 I don't know about strange characters 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.430
 around the benches you discover and after 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.530
 a few hours that the prosecutor does not know who 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.000
 are and therefore there is the risk that the 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:14.250
 disqualifies me anyway that I am 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.560
 always at the limit when you see coaches 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.150
 in series that are always outside and not 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.070
 they are never called again look at them 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:23.280
 then later on I will also tell you the name 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.350
 surname I was obviously not loose 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.610
 because I was out of the technical area 

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.860
 I can simply swear on 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.240
 anything more expensive 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.220
 after the heart said war up 

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.500
 now I have been silent from now on 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:37.310
 I get angry obviously replacing the 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:40.530
 word angry with something else though 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:45.490
 it was enough to say 

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:49.630
 but something else has gone but ended 

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:51.460
 my expulsion was okay we 

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.500
 however it is not resigned it seemed to me 

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.050
 place of something almost a coward 

00:07:53.500 --> 00:08:00.190
 at that moment where it seemed to be 

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:01.960
 almost invoked understood however these are 

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.270
 things miri soccer i belong to 

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.820
 another thing I am and resigned no but yes 

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.890
 agents who are very different are resigned 

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:11.460
 more resigned than me and not life 

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:11.460
 from football
