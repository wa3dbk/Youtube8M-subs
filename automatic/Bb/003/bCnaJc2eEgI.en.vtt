00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
right now now if you take the idea of a

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.660 
right now now if you take the idea of a
little<00:01:58.110> bit<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.350> movement<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.009> little<00:01:59.579> bit

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
little bit of the movement a little bit

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.459 
little bit of the movement a little bit
of<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.820> color<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.299> everything<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.110> idea

can throw a little play into it and if
you<00:02:23.620> look<00:02:23.859> at<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.189> line<00:02:24.579> of<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:26.230> haircut<00:02:26.530> it

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
you look at the line of this haircut it

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.369 
you look at the line of this haircut it
goes<00:02:27.700> for<00:02:27.849> shorter<00:02:28.239> into<00:02:28.629> longer<00:02:28.989> movement

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
goes for shorter into longer movement

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.490 
goes for shorter into longer movement
hey<00:02:29.709> if<00:02:30.069> we<00:02:30.370> were<00:02:30.549> to<00:02:30.760> have<00:02:31.030> this<00:02:31.870> haircut<00:02:32.109> let

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
hey if we were to have this haircut let

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.740 
hey if we were to have this haircut let
down<00:02:32.709> it<00:02:33.310> goes<00:02:33.459> shorter<00:02:33.819> into<00:02:34.180> longer<00:02:34.540> very

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
down it goes shorter into longer very

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.949 
down it goes shorter into longer very
much<00:02:34.930> similar<00:02:35.290> yeah<00:02:36.209> similar<00:02:37.209> okay<00:02:37.599> so<00:02:37.659> let's

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
much similar yeah similar okay so let's

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.240 
much similar yeah similar okay so let's
move<00:02:38.109> over<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.469> our<00:02:38.500> next<00:02:38.889> model

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
move over to our next model

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.429 
move over to our next model
yeah<00:02:39.609> we<00:02:39.760> have<00:02:39.879> color<00:02:40.209> progression<00:02:40.810> texture

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
yeah we have color progression texture

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.039 
yeah we have color progression texture
here<00:02:41.859> a<00:02:42.069> shorter<00:02:42.730> version<00:02:43.150> of<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:43.389> but<00:02:43.719> yet<00:02:43.930> the

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
here a shorter version of it but yet the

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.140 
here a shorter version of it but yet the
asymmetry<00:02:44.409> if<00:02:44.889> you<00:02:45.310> look<00:02:45.489> at<00:02:45.579> our<00:02:45.669> concept

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
asymmetry if you look at our concept

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.759 
asymmetry if you look at our concept
model<00:02:46.389> that<00:02:46.480> goes<00:02:46.569> from<00:02:46.720> one<00:02:46.959> side<00:02:47.230> over<00:02:47.620> to

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
model that goes from one side over to

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.710 
model that goes from one side over to
the<00:02:47.859> other<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.519> asymmetry<00:02:48.849> in<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.150> front<00:02:49.480> of

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
the other the asymmetry in the front of

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.379 
the other the asymmetry in the front of
Audra's<00:02:50.260> hair<00:02:50.500> is<00:02:51.069> shorter<00:02:51.669> into<00:02:51.939> longer<00:02:52.239> and

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
Audra's hair is shorter into longer and

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.059 
Audra's hair is shorter into longer and
if<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.599> really<00:02:52.900> look<00:02:53.109> at<00:02:53.230> her<00:02:53.409> hair<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.829> you
