00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
think was the first set was doing the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.639 
think was the first set was doing the
first<00:00:32.579> step<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.329> i<00:00:33.420> was<00:00:33.540> like<00:00:33.719> an<00:00:33.960> adult<00:00:34.440> got

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
first step and i was like an adult got

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:35.930 
first step and i was like an adult got
this<00:00:34.860> i<00:00:34.920> mean<00:00:35.040> he<00:00:35.190> was<00:00:35.340> fighting<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.730> guy<00:00:35.879> who

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
this i mean he was fighting a guy who

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.579 
this i mean he was fighting a guy who
didn't<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> rank<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.989> everything<00:00:37.379> so<00:00:37.530> i

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:37.589 
didn't have a rank and everything so i

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:38.930 
didn't have a rank and everything so i
thought<00:00:37.769> that<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:37.980> was<00:00:38.219> gonna<00:00:38.460> win<00:00:38.670> for<00:00:38.730> sure

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
thought that that was gonna win for sure

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.349 
thought that that was gonna win for sure
so<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:39.749> decided<00:00:39.960> not<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.499> watch<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.359> here

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
one lost the last two and I'm like what

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.979 
one lost the last two and I'm like what
the<00:00:58.890> hell<00:01:00.289> Nadal<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.530> definitely<00:01:02.809> it's<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
the hell Nadal is definitely it's in the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.719 
the hell Nadal is definitely it's in the
low<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.500> think<00:01:04.710> he<00:01:04.769> said<00:01:04.890> alone<00:01:05.190> now<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.370> think

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
low I think he said alone now I think

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.719 
low I think he said alone now I think
it's<00:01:05.940> pretty<00:01:06.540> much<00:01:06.750> done<00:01:06.810> as<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.290> top<00:01:07.580> well<00:01:08.580> he's

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
it's pretty much done as a top well he's

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.440 
it's pretty much done as a top well he's
still<00:01:08.940> a<00:01:08.970> top<00:01:09.240> player<00:01:09.509> but<00:01:10.159> with<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.310> loss<00:01:11.610> in

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
still a top player but with this loss in

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.170 
still a top player but with this loss in
this<00:01:12.899> year's<00:01:13.409> Wimbledon<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.250> mean<00:01:14.759> he<00:01:14.850> didn't

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
this year's Wimbledon I mean he didn't

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.780 
this year's Wimbledon I mean he didn't
again<00:01:16.020> lassie<00:01:16.469> and<00:01:16.649> the<00:01:17.100> most<00:01:17.280> recent<00:01:17.640> one<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
again lassie and the most recent one the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.870
