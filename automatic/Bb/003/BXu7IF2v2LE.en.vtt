while we let them burn Bibles oh and

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.210 
while we let them burn Bibles oh and
make<00:03:01.610> it<00:03:01.790> worse<00:03:02.060> in<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.450> army<00:03:02.870> I<00:03:03.080> guess<00:03:04.070> they

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
make it worse in the army I guess they

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.780 
make it worse in the army I guess they
had<00:03:04.400> some<00:03:04.640> Bibles<00:03:05.410> printed<00:03:06.410> up<00:03:06.530> in<00:03:06.680> Arabic<00:03:07.190> but

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
had some Bibles printed up in Arabic but

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.720 
had some Bibles printed up in Arabic but
that<00:03:08.060> was<00:03:08.240> offensive<00:03:08.660> so<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.710> army<00:03:10.100> had<00:03:10.610> to

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
that was offensive so the army had to

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.510 
that was offensive so the army had to
dispose<00:03:11.030> of<00:03:11.270> them<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.170> he<00:03:12.650> wound<00:03:12.800> up<00:03:13.010> burning

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
dispose of them and he wound up burning

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.100 
dispose of them and he wound up burning
them<00:03:13.640> because<00:03:14.000> since<00:03:14.330> they<00:03:14.480> considered<00:03:15.020> it

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
them because since they considered it

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.740 
them because since they considered it
trash<00:03:15.440> of<00:03:15.740> garbage<00:03:16.190> that's<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.580> way<00:03:16.700> they<00:03:16.910> get
