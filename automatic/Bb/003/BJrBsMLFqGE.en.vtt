00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
the heart rate sensor and it's the same

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.620 
the heart rate sensor and it's the same

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
camera sensor from the s6 so you can

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.390 
camera sensor from the s6 so you can
probably<00:02:51.959> already<00:02:52.470> expect<00:02:52.800> some<00:02:52.950> really

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
probably already expect some really

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.660 
probably already expect some really

finally on the front of course you have

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.260 
finally on the front of course you have

the standard Samsung home button which

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.840 
the standard Samsung home button which
also<00:03:00.420> doubles<00:03:00.870> as<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.260> fingerprint<00:03:02.130> scanner

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
also doubles as a fingerprint scanner

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.940 
also doubles as a fingerprint scanner
just<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.510> recap<00:03:03.840> some<00:03:03.989> of<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.170> internal<00:03:04.680> specs

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
just to recap some of the internal specs

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.220 
just to recap some of the internal specs
you<00:03:05.040> have<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.430> Exynos<00:03:05.880> 7420<00:03:06.390> which<00:03:06.870> is<00:03:06.989> also

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
you have the Exynos 7420 which is also

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.890 
you have the Exynos 7420 which is also
the<00:03:07.410> same<00:03:07.800> as<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.040> s6<00:03:08.850> but<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.480> note<00:03:09.690> 5

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
the same as the s6 but the note 5

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.740 
the same as the s6 but the note 5
features<00:03:10.350> 4<00:03:10.709> gigs<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:11.040> ram<00:03:11.220> instead<00:03:11.459> of<00:03:11.820> 3<00:03:12.120> so

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
features 4 gigs of ram instead of 3 so

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.720 
features 4 gigs of ram instead of 3 so
performance<00:03:13.380> should<00:03:13.530> be<00:03:13.590> just<00:03:14.010> as<00:03:14.130> good<00:03:14.489> as

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
performance should be just as good as

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.300 
performance should be just as good as
the<00:03:15.000> s6<00:03:15.510> if<00:03:15.720> not<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.140> little<00:03:16.530> bit<00:03:16.739> better<00:03:16.920> due<00:03:17.280> to

the s6 if not a little bit better due to

s-pen ejects out of the silo now which I
really<00:03:57.239> like<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:57.690> it's<00:03:57.840> cool<00:03:58.080> and<00:03:58.320> fun<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.709> do

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
really like and it's cool and fun to do

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.160 
really like and it's cool and fun to do
but<00:03:59.519> in<00:03:59.640> a<00:03:59.700> way<00:03:59.880> it<00:04:00.090> makes<00:04:00.330> getting<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.840> S<00:04:00.959> Pen

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
but in a way it makes getting the S Pen

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.840 
but in a way it makes getting the S Pen
out<00:04:01.350> a<00:04:01.410> little<00:04:01.860> slower<00:04:02.130> because<00:04:02.340> there's<00:04:02.700> that

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
out a little slower because there's that

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.580 
out a little slower because there's that
additional<00:04:03.330> step<00:04:03.480> of<00:04:03.750> having<00:04:03.930> to<00:04:04.170> eject<00:04:04.560> the

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
additional step of having to eject the

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.670 
additional step of having to eject the
pen<00:04:04.860> first<00:04:05.190> before<00:04:05.700> pulling<00:04:06.330> it<00:04:06.420> out<00:04:06.600> a<00:04:06.870> step

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
pen first before pulling it out a step

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.020 
pen first before pulling it out a step
that<00:04:07.799> you<00:04:07.920> didn't<00:04:08.070> have<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.280> do<00:04:08.400> before<00:04:08.730> on<00:04:08.880> the
