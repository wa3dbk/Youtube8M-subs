00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.590 
a paper test for you on screen I have
done<00:02:03.290> it<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:04.400> does<00:02:04.640> cut<00:02:04.970> very<00:02:05.360> nicely

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
done it and it does cut very nicely

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.780 
done it and it does cut very nicely
through<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.110> paper<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:06.890> Indiana<00:02:07.430> do<00:02:07.580> two

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
through the paper and Indiana do two

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.249 
through the paper and Indiana do two
different<00:02:07.939> tests<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.539> do<00:02:08.599> the<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:09.140> know

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
different tests I do the you know

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.690 
different tests I do the you know
running<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.799> blade<00:02:09.920> along<00:02:10.129> the<00:02:10.280> top<00:02:10.489> and

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
running the blade along the top and

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.759 
running the blade along the top and
shading<00:02:10.970> little<00:02:11.239> curls<00:02:11.450> off<00:02:11.689> but<00:02:12.379> I<00:02:12.409> also

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
shading little curls off but I also

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.460 
shading little curls off but I also
stick<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.220> blade<00:02:13.400> through<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.849> paper<00:02:14.060> and

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
stick the blade through the paper and

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.430 
stick the blade through the paper and
let<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.590> weight<00:02:15.740> of<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:15.950> blade

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
let the weight of the blade

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.320 
let the weight of the blade
through<00:02:16.710> and<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.040> does<00:02:17.280> actually<00:02:17.550> cut<00:02:18.090> through

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
through and it does actually cut through

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.400 
through and it does actually cut through
it<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.510> know<00:02:18.600> it's<00:02:18.720> not<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.930> way<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.110> store

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
it I know it's not the way to store

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.890 
weighing in at one point two ounces but
it<00:02:23.460> does<00:02:23.640> actually<00:02:23.850> enable<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.720> cut

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
it does actually enable it to cut

it haven't got a ruler to hand but I can
tell<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:53.490> I<00:02:53.580> didn't<00:02:53.820> measure<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.300> the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
tell you that I didn't measure the the

tell you that I didn't measure the the
top<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.410> other<00:02:55.530> day<00:02:55.770> and<00:02:55.980> that's<00:02:56.070> about<00:02:56.310> three

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
top the other day and that's about three

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.900 
top the other day and that's about three
millimeters<00:02:57.570> thick<00:02:58.320> which<00:02:59.100> is<00:02:59.610> actually

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
millimeters thick which is actually

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.460 
millimeters thick which is actually
quite<00:03:00.120> thick<00:03:00.390> for<00:03:00.630> a<00:03:00.660> little<00:03:01.020> folding<00:03:01.320> pocket

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
quite thick for a little folding pocket

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.140 
quite thick for a little folding pocket
knife<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.650> what<00:03:04.800> more<00:03:04.950> we<00:03:05.160> got<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.610> the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
knife so what more we got the the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.000 
knife so what more we got the the
overall<00:03:06.480> length<00:03:06.660> of<00:03:06.870> 86<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.410> 1/8<00:03:07.650> an<00:03:07.860> inch

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
overall length of 86 and 1/8 an inch

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.800 
overall length of 86 and 1/8 an inch
that's<00:03:08.190> about<00:03:08.490> fifteen<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.270> a<00:03:09.750> half

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
that's about fifteen and a half

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.400 
that's about fifteen and a half
centimeters<00:03:10.410> roughly<00:03:11.570> this<00:03:12.570> is<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.780> locking

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
centimeters roughly this is a locking

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.060 
centimeters roughly this is a locking
there's<00:03:13.920> a<00:03:13.980> liner<00:03:14.340> lock<00:03:14.840> mechanism<00:03:16.010> so<00:03:17.010> you

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
there's a liner lock mechanism so you

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.890 
there's a liner lock mechanism so you
just<00:03:17.340> use<00:03:17.490> your<00:03:17.520> thumb<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.880> push<00:03:18.210> away<00:03:18.510> from

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
just use your thumb to push away from

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.340 
just use your thumb to push away from
you<00:03:19.080> really<00:03:19.800> nice<00:03:20.160> strong<00:03:20.610> solid<00:03:21.350> feeling

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
you really nice strong solid feeling

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.840 
you really nice strong solid feeling
lock<00:03:22.680> on<00:03:22.920> that<00:03:23.130> I've<00:03:23.250> got<00:03:23.370> to<00:03:23.459> say<00:03:23.610> there's

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
lock on that I've got to say there's

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.960 
lock on that I've got to say there's
absolutely<00:03:24.420> no<00:03:24.810> blade<00:03:25.200> play<00:03:25.550> whatsoever<00:03:26.550> in

absolutely no blade play whatsoever in
any<00:03:27.240> direction<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:28.080> feels<00:03:28.560> nice<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.250> solid

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
any direction it feels nice and solid

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.310 
any direction it feels nice and solid
you<00:03:30.180> know<00:03:30.330> as<00:03:30.450> if<00:03:30.570> it<00:03:30.720> could<00:03:30.870> take<00:03:31.050> quite<00:03:31.080> a

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
you know as if it could take quite a

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.160 
you know as if it could take quite a
beating<00:03:31.910> as<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:33.150> little<00:03:33.480> sort<00:03:33.660> of<00:03:33.690> pocket<00:03:33.990> knife

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
beating as a little sort of pocket knife

beating as a little sort of pocket knife
folding<00:03:34.500> pocket<00:03:34.740> knife<00:03:36.709> it's<00:03:37.709> got<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.920> small

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
folding pocket knife it's got a small

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.920 
folding pocket knife it's got a small
secondary<00:03:38.700> bevel<00:03:38.910> on<00:03:39.090> there<00:03:39.300> show<00:03:39.510> you<00:03:39.570> that

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
secondary bevel on there show you that

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.050 
secondary bevel on there show you that
blade<00:03:40.260> profile<00:03:40.740> a<00:03:40.770> bit<00:03:40.860> more<00:03:41.190> you<00:03:41.880> can

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
blade profile a bit more you can

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.030 
blade profile a bit more you can
probably<00:03:42.240> see<00:03:42.510> that<00:03:42.630> little<00:03:42.840> blade<00:03:43.140> that

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
probably see that little blade that

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.890 
probably see that little blade that
little<00:03:44.370> bevel<00:03:44.700> along<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.239> bottom<00:03:45.390> there<00:03:45.630> some

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
little bevel along the bottom there some

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.300 
little bevel along the bottom there some
people<00:03:46.020> will<00:03:46.230> be<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:46.380> fan<00:03:46.590> of<00:03:46.739> that<00:03:46.800> someone<00:03:49.310> but

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
people will be a fan of that someone but

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.400 
people will be a fan of that someone but
now<00:03:50.489> all<00:03:50.910> it<00:03:51.090> all<00:03:51.209> looks<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.600> be<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.750> pretty<00:03:52.050> good

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
now all it all looks to be a pretty good
