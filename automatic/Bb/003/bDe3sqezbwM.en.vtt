out of the app you'll have to start

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.940 
out of the app you'll have to start
right<00:00:39.300> at<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.510> beginning<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.079> level<00:00:40.469> again

right at the beginning of it level again

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.720 
right at the beginning of it level again
so<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.399> kind<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.640> sucks<00:00:41.910> um<00:00:44.270> yeah<00:00:45.270> here<00:00:46.079> we<00:00:46.140> go

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
so that kind of sucks um yeah here we go

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:55.000 
so that kind of sucks um yeah here we go
bam<00:00:47.730> bam

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.770 

um<00:00:55.899> this<00:00:56.899> is<00:00:57.050> a<00:00:57.109> really<00:00:57.379> cool<00:00:57.559> sequence<00:00:58.010> here

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
um this is a really cool sequence here

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.990 
um this is a really cool sequence here
I'm<00:00:59.780> not<00:00:59.960> sure<00:01:00.019> many<00:01:00.710> CIA<00:01:01.160> agents<00:01:01.850> that

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
I'm not sure many CIA agents that

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.030 
I'm not sure many CIA agents that
actually<00:01:02.539> do<00:01:02.690> that<00:01:02.839> so<00:01:03.109> this<00:01:03.230> game<00:01:03.440> isn't<00:01:03.649> that

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
actually do that so this game isn't that

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.420 
actually do that so this game isn't that
realistic<00:01:04.720> very<00:01:05.720> much<00:01:05.960> like<00:01:06.229> James<00:01:06.710> Bond<00:01:07.100> on

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
the ground had it looks like lava right

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.960 
the ground had it looks like lava right
now<00:01:09.530> kind<00:01:10.159> of<00:01:10.189> bad<00:01:10.369> lighting<00:01:10.670> effects<00:01:11.030> and
