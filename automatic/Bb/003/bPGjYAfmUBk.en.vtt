00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
syrups with that ice cream base now you

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.190 
syrups with that ice cream base now you
can<00:02:24.980> do<00:02:25.100> this<00:02:25.220> in<00:02:25.430> basically<00:02:26.210> any<00:02:26.450> ratio<00:02:27.020> that

can do this in basically any ratio that

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.440 
can do this in basically any ratio that

a<00:02:29.540> predominant<00:02:30.230> flavoring<00:02:30.800> this<00:02:31.190> is<00:02:31.340> going<00:02:31.520> to

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
a predominant flavoring this is going to

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.280 
a predominant flavoring this is going to
be<00:02:31.730> orange<00:02:32.120> for<00:02:32.300> me<00:02:32.420> in<00:02:32.630> this<00:02:32.780> particular

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
I'm going to be using piping bags to mix

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.930 
I'm going to be using piping bags to mix
the<00:02:51.080> other<00:02:51.230> two<00:02:51.500> flavorings<00:02:52.070> inside<00:02:52.610> of<00:02:52.760> this

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
the other two flavorings inside of this

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.660 
the other two flavorings inside of this
orange<00:02:53.690> sherbert<00:02:54.080> just<00:02:54.650> because<00:02:54.920> if<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.370> use

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
orange sherbert just because if you use

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.570 
orange sherbert just because if you use
the<00:02:56.420> spatula<00:02:57.080> just<00:02:57.680> kind<00:02:57.950> of<00:02:57.980> mix<00:02:58.250> it<00:02:58.370> in<00:02:58.490> there

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
the spatula just kind of mix it in there

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.160 
the spatula just kind of mix it in there
it's<00:02:58.820> going<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.000> end<00:02:59.180> up<00:02:59.300> just<00:02:59.510> bleeding<00:02:59.810> into

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
it's going to end up just bleeding into

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.840 
it's going to end up just bleeding into
all<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.440> other<00:03:00.560> colors<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.220> you<00:03:01.640> won't

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
all the other colors and you won't

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.300 
all the other colors and you won't
really<00:03:01.970> have<00:03:02.300> a<00:03:02.330> defined<00:03:02.800> sherbert<00:03:03.800> so<00:03:03.980> using

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
really have a defined sherbert so using

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.180 
really have a defined sherbert so using
a<00:03:04.370> piping<00:03:04.730> bag<00:03:04.790> is<00:03:05.239> an<00:03:05.540> essential<00:03:06.170> when<00:03:06.800> mixing

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
a piping bag is an essential when mixing

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.610 
a piping bag is an essential when mixing
it<00:03:07.280> in<00:03:07.540> once<00:03:08.540> you're<00:03:08.720> done<00:03:09.110> doing<00:03:09.260> that<00:03:09.470> this

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
it in once you're done doing that this

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.050 
it in once you're done doing that this
is<00:03:09.769> going<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:09.950> go<00:03:10.040> back<00:03:10.280> in<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.519> freezer<00:03:10.730> to
