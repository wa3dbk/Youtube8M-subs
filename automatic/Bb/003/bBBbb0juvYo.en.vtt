00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
would be an easy transition back but

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.330 
would be an easy transition back but
honestly<00:01:06.899> right<00:01:07.290> one<00:01:07.470> high<00:01:07.649> bar<00:01:07.860> was<00:01:08.070> starting

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
to feel comfortable and my weight was

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.660 
to feel comfortable and my weight was
finally<00:01:10.080> starting<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.380> go<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:11.280> switch<00:01:11.490> back

finally starting to go up we switch back
to<00:01:11.700> low<00:01:11.970> bar<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.630> going<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.960> take<00:01:13.200> some

to low bar and it's going to take some
more<00:01:13.530> adjustment<00:01:14.039> here<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.490> feel<00:01:14.970> like<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
more adjustment here so feel like the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.580 
more adjustment here so feel like the

schoolers<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.700> they<00:01:26.789> have<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.030> tendency<00:01:27.179> to

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
schoolers and they have the tendency to

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.480 
schoolers and they have the tendency to
take<00:01:27.659> up<00:01:27.810> all<00:01:27.929> the<00:01:27.960> racks<00:01:28.409> for<00:01:28.770> stupid<00:01:29.460> stuff

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
take up all the racks for stupid stuff

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.399 
take up all the racks for stupid stuff
at<00:01:29.880> least<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.119> my<00:01:30.210> opinion<00:01:30.330> so<00:01:31.080> when<00:01:31.229> there<00:01:31.319> was

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
at least in my opinion so when there was

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.690 
at least in my opinion so when there was
an<00:01:31.470> open<00:01:31.679> rack<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.069> just<00:01:32.250> grabbed<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.640> and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
an open rack I just grabbed it and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.969 
an open rack I just grabbed it and
really<00:01:33.030> kind<00:01:33.149> of<00:01:33.240> did<00:01:33.420> away<00:01:33.569> with<00:01:33.600> my<00:01:33.810> mobility

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
really kind of did away with my mobility

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.200 
really kind of did away with my mobility
now<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> second<00:01:35.520> set<00:01:35.670> here<00:01:35.850> one<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
now in the second set here one of the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.760 
now in the second set here one of the
things<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.509> kind<00:01:36.929> of<00:01:36.990> agitated<00:01:37.110> me<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.590> little

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
things that kind of agitated me a little

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.620 
things that kind of agitated me a little
bit<00:01:37.979> was<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:38.789> is<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> pretty<00:01:39.179> heavy<00:01:39.390> weight

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
bit was this is a pretty heavy weight

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.600 
bit was this is a pretty heavy weight
for<00:01:39.869> me<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.200> right<00:01:40.800> in<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:40.979> middle<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.220> my<00:01:41.310> set

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
for me and right in the middle of my set

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.190 
for me and right in the middle of my set
this<00:01:41.819> kid<00:01:42.060> comes<00:01:42.300> and<00:01:42.509> starts<00:01:42.659> racking

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
this kid comes and starts racking

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.190 
this kid comes and starts racking
weights<00:01:43.409> on<00:01:43.679> my<00:01:43.740> power<00:01:44.490> rack<00:01:44.819> now<00:01:45.569> I<00:01:45.600> know<00:01:45.899> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
weights on my power rack now I know the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.469 
weights on my power rack now I know the

least have the common courtesy to go to
a<00:01:49.860> different<00:01:50.069> rack<00:01:50.340> or<00:01:50.580> wait<00:01:50.880> until<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:51.209 
a different rack or wait until the

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:52.789 
a different rack or wait until the
person<00:01:51.330> was<00:01:51.569> done<00:01:51.690> with<00:01:51.810> their<00:01:51.929> set<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.319> don't

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
person was done with their set I don't

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.590 
person was done with their set I don't
know<00:01:52.890> maybe<00:01:53.130> that's<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.580> me<00:01:53.850> but<00:01:54.390> let<00:01:54.569> me

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600

know maybe that's just me but let me
know<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.869> comments<00:01:55.289> section<00:01:55.319> down<00:01:55.770> below

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:56.069 
know in the comments section down below

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:58.190 
know in the comments section down below
if<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:57.030> think<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.539> a<00:01:57.719> right<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.079> be<00:01:58.110> a

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
if you think I have a right to be a

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.620 
if you think I have a right to be a
little<00:01:58.259> bit<00:01:58.590> agitated<00:01:58.740> now<00:01:59.640> but<00:01:59.880> hurt<00:02:00.060> but

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
little bit agitated now but hurt but

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.660 
little bit agitated now but hurt but
agitated<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.619> here<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.860> see<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.039> last<00:02:02.369> set

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
agitated so here you see the last set

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.850 
agitated so here you see the last set
again<00:02:02.939> third<00:02:03.180> set<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.479> 3<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.560> weight

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
again third set of 3 and this weight

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.709 
again third set of 3 and this weight
felt<00:02:05.250> pretty<00:02:05.520> heavy<00:02:05.789> I'm<00:02:06.060> thinking<00:02:06.600> it's

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
felt pretty heavy I'm thinking it's

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.180 
felt pretty heavy I'm thinking it's
going<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.960> take<00:02:07.140> some<00:02:07.170> time<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.770> really<00:02:07.920> get

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
going to take some time to really get

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.499 
going to take some time to really get
back<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.759> swing<00:02:08.850> of<00:02:08.970> things<00:02:09.090> like<00:02:09.420> i

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
back in the swing of things like i

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.509 
back in the swing of things like i
mentioned<00:02:09.570> to<00:02:09.899> get<00:02:10.049> my<00:02:10.170> form<00:02:10.440> down<00:02:10.679> but<00:02:11.250> once<00:02:11.400> I

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
mentioned to get my form down but once I

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.000 
mentioned to get my form down but once I
do<00:02:11.579> I<00:02:11.730> think<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.269> will<00:02:12.390> really<00:02:12.690> help<00:02:13.019> all<00:02:13.590> that

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
do I think it will really help all that

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.650 
do I think it will really help all that
high<00:02:14.190> bar<00:02:14.400> squatting<00:02:14.760> we<00:02:14.850> did<00:02:15.000> all<00:02:15.209> that<00:02:15.480> work

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
high bar squatting we did all that work

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.630 
high bar squatting we did all that work
capacity<00:02:15.840> we<00:02:16.320> built<00:02:16.590> up<00:02:16.799> and<00:02:17.070> I'm<00:02:17.400> really

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
capacity we built up and I'm really

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.340 
capacity we built up and I'm really
looking<00:02:17.910> forward<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.510> doing<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:19.049> and<00:02:19.200> although

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
looking forward to doing it and although

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.110 
looking forward to doing it and although
again<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:20.010> felt<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.310> little<00:02:20.400> bit<00:02:20.549> awkward<00:02:20.940> I

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
again this felt a little bit awkward I

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.390 
again this felt a little bit awkward I
still<00:02:21.690> felt<00:02:21.900> really<00:02:22.230> strong<00:02:22.590> as<00:02:22.950> far<00:02:23.190> as<00:02:23.280> my

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
still felt really strong as far as my

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.710 
still felt really strong as far as my
leg<00:02:23.640> Drive<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.090> everything<00:02:24.359> else<00:02:24.510> goes

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
leg Drive and everything else goes

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.849 
leg Drive and everything else goes
you'll<00:02:24.900> see<00:02:25.049> I<00:02:25.079> didn't<00:02:25.320> really<00:02:25.440> struggle<00:02:25.829> with

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
you'll see I didn't really struggle with

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.680 
you'll see I didn't really struggle with
these<00:02:26.040> too<00:02:26.280> bad<00:02:26.489> it's<00:02:27.030> just<00:02:27.120> going<00:02:27.329> to<00:02:27.359> be<00:02:27.420> some

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
these too bad it's just going to be some

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:28.970 
these too bad it's just going to be some
mechanics<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:28.200> I'm<00:02:28.350> going<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.530> have<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:28.739> get

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
mechanics that I'm going to have to get

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.490 
mechanics that I'm going to have to get
down<00:02:29.130> going<00:02:29.640> forward<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.810> after<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.260> we<00:02:31.320> then

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
down going forward so after that we then

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.110 
down going forward so after that we then
moved<00:02:31.829> on<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.190> pause<00:02:32.400> squats<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:32.970> it

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
moved on to the pause squats and it

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.569 
moved on to the pause squats and it
called<00:02:33.299> for<00:02:33.390> three<00:02:33.930> sets<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.380> three<00:02:34.769> I<00:02:35.010> only

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
called for three sets of three I only

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.699 
called for three sets of three I only
filled<00:02:35.940> my<00:02:36.209> first<00:02:36.660> actual<00:02:36.989> working<00:02:37.380> set<00:02:37.560> here

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
filled my first actual working set here

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.580 
filled my first actual working set here
of<00:02:37.829> 405<00:02:38.430> each<00:02:39.030> subsequent<00:02:39.570> set<00:02:39.959> afterwards<00:02:40.470> we

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
of 405 each subsequent set afterwards we

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.050 
of 405 each subsequent set afterwards we
bumped<00:02:40.890> up<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.040> weight<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.579> second<00:02:41.910> set

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
bumped up the weight so the second set

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.060 
bumped up the weight so the second set
was<00:02:42.090> at<00:02:42.329> 425<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.320> third<00:02:43.560> set<00:02:43.829> was<00:02:43.950> at

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
was at 425 the third set was at

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.819 
was at 425 the third set was at
four-forty<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:44.730> this<00:02:45.600> felt<00:02:45.840> really<00:02:46.230> good<00:02:46.620> as

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
four-forty and this felt really good as

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.340 
four-forty and this felt really good as
far<00:02:46.859> as<00:02:47.250> my<00:02:47.430> actual<00:02:47.850> form<00:02:48.150> so<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.900> bar<00:02:49.109> as<00:02:49.230> high

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
far as my actual form so the bar as high

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.110 
far as my actual form so the bar as high
as<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.650> can<00:02:49.680> see<00:02:49.950> my<00:02:50.160> torso<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.730> more<00:02:50.910> upright

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
as you can see my torso is more upright

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.150 
as you can see my torso is more upright
and<00:02:51.450> because<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.870> also<00:02:52.260> I'm<00:02:52.799> able<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.010> get

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
and because of that also I'm able to get

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.920 
and because of that also I'm able to get
a<00:02:53.190> little<00:02:53.340> bit<00:02:53.519> better<00:02:53.640> depth<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.660> get<00:02:54.780> some

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
a little bit better depth and I get some

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.569 
a little bit better depth and I get some
pretty<00:02:55.109> good<00:02:55.230> pause<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:55.680> going<00:02:55.950> on<00:02:56.069> here<00:02:56.130> and

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
pretty good pause is going on here and

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.370 
pretty good pause is going on here and
some<00:02:57.269> explosiveness<00:02:57.750> coming<00:02:58.109> out<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.230> the

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
some explosiveness coming out of the

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.409 
some explosiveness coming out of the
hole<00:02:58.560> that's<00:02:59.160> what<00:02:59.340> she<00:02:59.489> said<00:02:59.760> but<00:03:00.150> over<00:03:00.389> all

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
hole that's what she said but over all

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.930 
hole that's what she said but over all
these<00:03:00.690> felt<00:03:01.019> really<00:03:01.410> good<00:03:01.790> although<00:03:02.790> this

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
these felt really good although this

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.930 
these felt really good although this
first<00:03:03.239> set<00:03:03.449> went<00:03:03.570> pretty<00:03:03.840> well<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.320> next<00:03:04.680> two

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
first set went pretty well the next two

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.960 
first set went pretty well the next two
really<00:03:05.300> tough<00:03:05.510> pausing<00:03:06.080> with<00:03:06.200> 425<00:03:06.800> and<00:03:07.280> 440<00:03:07.850> on

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
really tough pausing with 425 and 440 on

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.960 
really tough pausing with 425 and 440 on
my<00:03:08.090> back<00:03:08.330> was<00:03:09.220> extremely<00:03:10.220> challenging<00:03:10.760> but

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
my back was extremely challenging but

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.250 
my back was extremely challenging but
again<00:03:11.240> I'm<00:03:11.420> thinking<00:03:11.750> that's<00:03:11.810> going<00:03:12.050> to<00:03:12.110> pay

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
again I'm thinking that's going to pay

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.170 
again I'm thinking that's going to pay
off<00:03:12.380> quite<00:03:12.650> well<00:03:12.680> in<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.010> end<00:03:13.040> we<00:03:13.730> then<00:03:13.910> moved

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
off quite well in the end we then moved

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.540 
off quite well in the end we then moved
on<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.470> deficit<00:03:15.470> stiff-legged<00:03:15.770> deadlift<00:03:16.310> I'm

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
on to deficit stiff-legged deadlift I'm

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.460 
on to deficit stiff-legged deadlift I'm
showing<00:03:16.760> you<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:17.000> last<00:03:17.270> set<00:03:17.810> i<00:03:17.840> worked<00:03:18.140> up<00:03:18.320> to

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
showing you the last set i worked up to

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.440 
showing you the last set i worked up to
the<00:03:18.950> goal<00:03:19.130> is<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.280> work<00:03:19.490> up<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.790> six<00:03:20.060> rep<00:03:20.270> max

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
the goal is to work up to a six rep max

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.900 
the goal is to work up to a six rep max
and<00:03:20.810> i<00:03:20.870> worked<00:03:21.140> up<00:03:21.320> to<00:03:21.470> 370<00:03:22.190> in<00:03:22.250> this<00:03:22.400> case<00:03:22.610> and

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
and i worked up to 370 in this case and

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.460 
and i worked up to 370 in this case and
although<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.660> weight<00:03:23.840> looks<00:03:24.110> like<00:03:24.320> it's

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
although the weight looks like it's

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.780 
although the weight looks like it's
moving<00:03:24.650> pretty<00:03:24.770> smoothly<00:03:25.310> if<00:03:25.550> you<00:03:25.610> take<00:03:25.760> a

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
moving pretty smoothly if you take a

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.730 
moving pretty smoothly if you take a
look<00:03:26.000> at<00:03:26.090> my<00:03:26.120> face<00:03:26.450> this<00:03:26.690> is<00:03:26.870> really<00:03:27.080> taxing<00:03:27.440> me

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
look at my face this is really taxing me

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.760 
look at my face this is really taxing me
a<00:03:27.770> lot<00:03:28.160> felt<00:03:28.850> pretty<00:03:29.060> good<00:03:29.270> again<00:03:30.050> here<00:03:30.410> grip

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
a lot felt pretty good again here grip

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.620 
a lot felt pretty good again here grip
strength<00:03:30.800> is<00:03:31.280> really<00:03:31.670> holding<00:03:31.820> on<00:03:32.060> quite<00:03:32.420> well

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
strength is really holding on quite well

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.050 
strength is really holding on quite well
I<00:03:32.980> neglected<00:03:33.980> film<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.280> last<00:03:34.490> two<00:03:34.640> exercises

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
I neglected film the last two exercises

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.610 
I neglected film the last two exercises
only<00:03:35.480> because<00:03:35.750> they<00:03:35.900> were<00:03:35.990> body<00:03:36.200> weight<00:03:36.440> one

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
only because they were body weight one

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.410 
only because they were body weight one
so<00:03:36.860> three<00:03:37.040> sets<00:03:37.340> of<00:03:37.430> pullups<00:03:37.640> as<00:03:37.940> many<00:03:38.120> reps<00:03:38.330> as

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
so three sets of pullups as many reps as

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.180 
so three sets of pullups as many reps as
possible<00:03:38.930> than<00:03:39.170> three<00:03:39.440> sets<00:03:39.650> of<00:03:39.740> hanging<00:03:40.010> leg

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
possible than three sets of hanging leg

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.250 
possible than three sets of hanging leg
raises<00:03:40.220> for<00:03:40.760> 15<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.180> 20<00:03:41.300> reps<00:03:41.630> and<00:03:41.870> that'll<00:03:42.140> do

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
raises for 15 to 20 reps and that'll do

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.650 
raises for 15 to 20 reps and that'll do
it<00:03:42.410> so<00:03:42.920> that<00:03:43.040> was<00:03:43.190> my<00:03:43.220> leg<00:03:43.790> day<00:03:43.970> so<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.270> say<00:03:44.480> I

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
it so that was my leg day so to say I

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.910 
it so that was my leg day so to say I
