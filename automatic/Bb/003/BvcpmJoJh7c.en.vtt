 Fast food is to get banned from school starting July 1 Ministry of Agriculture smart

 Snacks in school rules come into force on July 1 in short all fast food in

 Vegetable protein and fruit rich dairy products whole grains of whole rich foods

 Milk allows 100 percent fruit and vegetable juice allowed in high school 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:27.599
 Students 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.460
 Caffeine can be low-calorie soft drinks 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.230
 There is also a whole buncha judged by something like fifty pages when it comes 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.630
 to you 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.190
 Contents Schools Content Sodium Content Sugar Content Fat Calories That Do not 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.420
 Compliance with face fines or loss of funding 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.700
 Not all parents think it's a great idea here is Master Vicky 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.980
 From where I am from this Vicky Master to be honest that is 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.870
 Report from Fox 59 who talk to her said I like the way she did it now 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.210
 Because they are fast food one day a week they are in Plainfield and they are 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.559
 They have a lot of choices to have the things that they will actually eat so they get 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.189
 the food 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.880
 In them by going to the day there are things they will not only 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.000
 Eat they prefer not to eat then eat something they do not like 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.640
 It is really sad that this is so necessary because obesity is an epidemic in childhood 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.810
 It's partly bad habits of parents having 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.610
 Unhealthy food in schools of course does not help, of course there are 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.250
 Social and economic problems right fast food 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.680
 Foods that are particularly good for you are disproportionately cheaper 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.610
 In calories along with the type of desert food where we have 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.600
 Parts of the country where there really is 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.840
 Lot 222 to buy other products of medium, fast food and chain 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.310
 Restaurants so this is such a problem 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.590
 But Louis I'd rather be much 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.549
 The nutritional situation solved and started work on childhood obesity 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.240
 So we can move on to things like the theory of creation being taught in schools 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.130
 Students do worse and worse when it comes to math and right-wing science 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.000
 He wants to repeat prayer at school 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.140
 Standard tests that measure very little 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.129
 Students have real potential for our very huge education issues on the one hand 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.730
 This is a problem in the diet of many children disaster things 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.610
 Much of this is due to much parenting to social and economic 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.180
 We have the problem of childhood obesity on the same hand 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.080
 And I would like to say the other hand is really on the same hand to 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.519
 it's a 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.920
 I was just the most school problems there is this long list of issues in our year 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.470
 Schools. 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.959
 Not to mention private madrasas but I do not even think about it 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:39.569
 Today 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.239
 In there we are connected because we are not teaching children 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.900
 About why these things should not be addressed in about why we take them 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.480
 Away 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.060
 We are just taking them away and I do not think it will be very effective 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.050
 I know it is for 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.209
 It's doubtful how effective it will be first 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.379
 But but again if if anything I think was too 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.730
 Ron that issue I have with this I do not know exactly how effective it will be 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.459
 Be the year 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.800
 I think slipping spend time at school and if they get better habits 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.330
 There can be an effect but in the end 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.180
 What happens outside the school in the long run will dictate how these can 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.640
 Kids do not
