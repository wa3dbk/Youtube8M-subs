00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.120
 the study has laid the foundation stone 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.100
 for my passion for the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.140
 Corporate communication and has me 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.970
 made curious so what is there then 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.130
 also how can i do what i am now 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.210
 I actually learned to study 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.210
 apply 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.340
 my name is tina I got stuck at the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.900
 zeppelin university communications in 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.880
 Herb of management is studying and now 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.280
 i work at unilever location 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.570
 schaffhausen switzerland i am here 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.300
 responsible for the internal 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.820
 communication in the standard that's me 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.500
 I am responsible for the messages 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.020
 the brand unilever as well as the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.739
 sustainability plan for the employees 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.739
 to bring more 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.600
 my interest for 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.100
 communication science is only one 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.900
 cd been really awakened because of me 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.160
 me more concrete with the 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.610
 content has dealt with the 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.630
 different theories and of course 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.190
 also that professors 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.350
 i think that the interdisciplinarity 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.810
 is very useful for later for 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.550
 professional life because you are also from the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.260
 business management different 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.060
 gets to know approaches and me too 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.350
 now in my role in the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.810
 Internet communication much easier 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.640
 falls to understand what makes unilever 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.290
 actually what the pay 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.700
 a lot of what I am presented 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.369
 now in your professional life learning by 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.580
 Just try it and we'll do it 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.580
 other 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.369
 I think what many note students 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.710
 the goal is to have something in common 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.320
 and the trouble is on a target 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.880
 to work up to intervene in 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.100
 third fourth semester we have in 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.140
 framework of the seminar project management 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.060
 a crimininner performed and that 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.350
 I found that very exciting because we did that 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.490
 project from the beginning to the end 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.350
 could accompany 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.390
 everyone has different roles so 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.910
 many of our also played along then 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.209
 at the end of the piece and I was there 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.890
 with two other pr in charge i believe 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.510
 what has given me the time with that 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.590
 I presented very well so I have 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.590
 Do not be afraid to talk to people 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.580
 what you liked first was so good 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.700
 that there are only 30 students per semester 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.720
 And there is one subject for each study subject because I do 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.160
 have seen it as state 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.800
 So universities is that one 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.450
 some 300 others in the lecture hall 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.280
 I think that the cdu is the one sitting 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.310
 right university for those who 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.770
 like to share with others 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.000
 approach the things proactively 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.740
 have no problem your own opinion 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.700
 to represent and also very much in 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.060
 teams work 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.170
 I think who consume only content 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.860
 I do not want for that the newspaper 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.860
 volatile
