 grated coconut butter ingredients 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:33.239

 pinch of salt and like every Sunday

 dressed in coconut for you how rich because 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.020
 that's what we're going to prepare we 're going to 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.360
 mix before you give us all the 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.070
 information all the ingredients of 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.440
 our coconut successes but I want that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.089
 tell me what the properties are and 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.809
 the benefits of sugar 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:53.370
 in our diet 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.559
 good sugar when it is in its state 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.030
 natural is that it has its benefits the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.610
 moment in which you take away the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.750
 nutrients and process them then that 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.930
 what he's going to do is that for you to 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.610
 you can process is going to get your body 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.750
 vitamins minerals and so on and that's why 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.840
 is that people start to have 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.920
 loss of teeth because osteoporosis and 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.630
 other health problems 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.840
 so if we consume the sweeteners 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.670
 in its natural state like sugarcane 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.840
 in dates sugar then there not 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.670
 we have a problem when it is 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.020
 something refined there we start to get into 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.280
 all problems calling to clear 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.569
 all the ingredients and we have a 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.069
 mass with which we are going to make a 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:27.659
 politics but you talked to me about sugar 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:29.609
 As for the kind yes, you know that 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.799
 at the beginning of the last century 21st century 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:34.709
 the average person consumed about 4 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.509
 pounds of sugar forgiveness per year is more or 

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:39.299
 less this amount today we are 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.759
 consuming 170 pounds of sugar per year 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.619
 a human hamlet more or less and you know by 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.909
 what because it is hidden everywhere 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.979
 so you at home have to 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.500
 become the sugar detective 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.709
 look for words that end in or 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.189
 dextrose , maltose fructose is in English 

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:58.289
 is or that is fructose other texts and 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.579
 be very careful because there it is 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.810
 one of the places where sugar is 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.369
 hidden tasty 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.129
 let's put this baked friends and 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.009
 minus 20 minutes and see what a treat 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.599
 we have and the four coconut kisses that 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.190
 we prepared but you told me about 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.840
 sugar of refinement and everything that 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.480
 we can do with if I was telling you 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.829
 that refined sugar is a drug like 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.380
 alcohol or any other much 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.210
 Beware of giving processed sugar to your 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.760
 we have other alternatives we can 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.130
 get date sugar sugar from 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.170
 coconut sugar cane that by 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.750
 example today we cook with cane sugar 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.340
 then you be careful with this 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.660
 and because this can alter the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.120
 behavior and can lead to 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.010
 violent tendencies etc then avoid 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.240
 and it's very addictive that's why it's the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.700
 they put everyone but I'll tell you 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.530
 what is my addiction to cooking the 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.210
 healthy cooking if I'm happy to be 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.310
 here and that's why we are also 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.350
 that you accompany us every Sunday with 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.160
 this important information on how 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.420
 Eat Healthy 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.870
 at the moment many thanks for 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.490
 be with us and we go back to 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.490
 studies here instead of cooking
