the next time I look is buddy maze 3d
this<00:03:38.190> game<00:03:38.459> is<00:03:38.930> a<00:03:39.930> part<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.379> Snapdragon<00:03:41.040> game

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
this game is a part of Snapdragon game

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.830 
this game is a part of Snapdragon game
command<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:41.849> means<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.180> was<00:03:42.209> developed<00:03:42.629> with

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
command that means it was developed with

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.170 
command that means it was developed with
Qualcomm<00:03:43.379> by<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.370> developers<00:03:44.849> of<00:03:44.909> the<00:03:45.000> game

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
Qualcomm by the developers of the game

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.899 
Qualcomm by the developers of the game
so<00:03:45.900> that<00:03:46.109> it<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.260> optimized<00:03:46.769> for<00:03:46.909> Qualcomm

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
so that it is optimized for Qualcomm

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.000 
so that it is optimized for Qualcomm
devices<00:03:48.420> means<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.379> should<00:03:49.409> work<00:03:49.739> perfectly

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
devices means it should work perfectly

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.490 
devices means it should work perfectly
well<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:51.420> we're<00:03:51.840> going<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:52.019> take<00:03:52.079> a<00:03:52.139> look<00:03:52.319> at<00:03:52.470> it

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500
