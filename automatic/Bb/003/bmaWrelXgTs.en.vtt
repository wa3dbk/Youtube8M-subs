of<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.640> tube<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.719> have<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.230> is

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
of the tube and what we have to do is

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.340 
of the tube and what we have to do is
clean<00:01:02.250> out<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.489> chamber<00:01:02.940> clean<00:01:03.930> out<00:01:04.140> those

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
clean out that chamber clean out those

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.260 
clean out that chamber clean out those
roots<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:06.479> can<00:01:06.659> completely

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
roots so that we can completely

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
roots so that we can completely
obliterate<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> space<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.990> having

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
obliterate the space and having

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.830 
obliterate the space and having
obliterate<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> space<00:01:11.369> then<00:01:11.729> we<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.689> it

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
obliterate in the space then we have it

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.679 
obliterate in the space then we have it
successfully<00:01:13.500> restored<00:01:14.460> tooth<00:01:14.880> one<00:01:15.509> thing

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
successfully restored tooth one thing

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.080 
successfully restored tooth one thing
that's<00:01:15.869> very<00:01:15.900> important<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:17.700> fact<00:01:18.030> that
