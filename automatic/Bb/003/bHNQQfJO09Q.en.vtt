00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
stuff automatically gets transferred to

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.600 
stuff automatically gets transferred to
the<00:01:36.780> code<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.259> that's<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.799> pretty<00:01:38.009> nifty<00:01:38.250> trick

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
the code so that's a pretty nifty trick

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.640 
the code so that's a pretty nifty trick
they<00:01:38.759> added<00:01:39.119> there<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.720> don't<00:01:39.960> need<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.200> spend

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
they added there you don't need to spend

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.670 
they added there you don't need to spend
hours<00:01:40.829> again<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.460> manage<00:01:41.759> everything<00:01:42.060> again

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
hours again to manage everything again

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.050 
hours again to manage everything again
so<00:01:43.680> once<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:43.979> open<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.280> up<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.820> of

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
and then you just look for a tab where

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.890 
and then you just look for a tab where
it<00:05:11.070> says<00:05:11.250> it<00:05:11.460> codes<00:05:11.670> for<00:05:11.790> right<00:05:12.180> right<00:05:12.750> here

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
it says it codes for right right here

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.580 
it says it codes for right right here
for<00:05:13.110> example<00:05:13.230> body<00:05:14.190> accout<00:05:14.730> vimeo<00:05:15.600> micro<00:05:16.110> so

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
for example body accout vimeo micro so

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.770 
for example body accout vimeo micro so
apparently<00:05:16.800> that's<00:05:17.130> the<00:05:17.250> theme<00:05:17.490> it<00:05:18.420> will<00:05:18.630> give

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
apparently that's the theme it will give

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.870 
apparently that's the theme it will give
you<00:05:18.870> a<00:05:18.930> little<00:05:19.170> example<00:05:19.290> and<00:05:19.800> then<00:05:19.890> that<00:05:20.490> works

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
you a little example and then that works
