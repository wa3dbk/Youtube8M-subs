00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.070
 I can not think there's a cure 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.820
 requires care 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.440
 it's the album 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.440
 You can watch videos where I'm shooting video. 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.270

 in this action 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.159
 we will see 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.479

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:15.479
 with pcc region I do not know if I can 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.959

 to sesa the pc 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:28.459
 and for being parties if these here to be the beginning pc 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:33.589
 why the people who 

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:35.459

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.030
 Harry had this problem and I thought why his main that everything 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.889
 I was normal 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:44.889

 Now we're going to stop. 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:54.599
 another problem is that it is 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.439
 composed 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.439
 who goes there the usual motto of the computer 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:04.349

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.789
 remember also participate 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:10.069
 around here 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.879
 unavailable 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.879

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:56.689

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.569

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.089
 although it is one megabyte 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:15.409
 to completely leave 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.269
 usual good hand 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.489
 What are you going to win? 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.039
 do not go here the yes and goes total that arrives at the court of chain and syllables 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.699
 therefore it is very easy 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.430
 It's just that it's beeping well 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.669
 with the money and also very easy but 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.669
 if there is any difficulty 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.900
 you can 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.900
 in times when corn 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.460
 It sure was an honor. 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.180
 the profit 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.949
 15 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.900
 and whoever you want 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.830
 no short scientist and a half and a half 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.839
 few names in 1995 the clothes with the team and what I play 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:12.580
 So 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.580
 This was the best of my country 15 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:17.749
