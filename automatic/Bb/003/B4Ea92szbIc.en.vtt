00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 yo viewers of the mega top 10 and welcome 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.350
 with a brand new video 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.099
 today we discuss the top together 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.309
 10 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.040
 most dangerous animals in the world 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.320
 do a like on this video 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.670
 otherwise number two will come to you tonight 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.850
 get it 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.529
 number 10 is the komodo dragon 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.410
 the blood of these animals is not that much 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.910
 what they are called they like birds but also 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.560
 whole water buffalo 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.720
 but wanted to bury a pass 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.610
 Man digging to go from nice 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.140
 sit down 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.910
 they make relatively few fatalities 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.829
 victims what people and commode 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.969
 do not often betray each other in contact 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.309
 come 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.710
 nevertheless I would like to be careful at number 9 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.469
 is it always a fly 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.050
 this fairly large fly lives in africa and 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.300
 loves human blood because people are in it 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.280
 Africa often wear relatively little clothing 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.750
 it's pretty easy to get one 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.210
 tasty meal 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.550
 the tsetse fly can be the african one 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.600
 transmit sleeping sickness and die there 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.900
 each year about 250,000 people in 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.700
 number 8 is the scrub adar case 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.830
 this snake has a very dangerous 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.180
 gift which ensures tissue 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.619
 dies 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.570
 that does not have to be a big problem 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.130
 but these snakes mainly live in it 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.560
 remote areas where few 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.299
 hospitals are like you as a human being 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.810
 immediately who receives your care 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.759
 you die a slow painful death 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.579
 at number 7 find where the brazilian 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.650
 wander spider this spider species is not 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.140
 only very toxic but also still 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.780
 once very aggressive and in addition this is possible 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.520
 little animal very well jump it 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.560
 grip of the Brazilian stray spider 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.619
 causes your breathing muscles 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.329
 stop thinking so you suffocate if you 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.520
 get bitten you have the antidote 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.439
 direct administration of without treatment 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.619
 you are within six hours 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.960
 Spill Death Number 6 being occupied 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.280
 by rewarding toppers 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.869
 Imagine you are nice at one 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.430
 tropical swimming vacation and suddenly 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.290
 this little boy comes next 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.300
 make a swim then you had as lightning 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.340
 comes out of the water because the bite of one 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.910
 blue ring on the bus contains enough gives 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.480
 to kill us 26 adult men and up 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.480
 so far there is no antidote package 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.490
 number 5 is the hippopotamus this 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.050
 animals usually eat plants but 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.660
 apparently they will be terribly over there 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.490
 aggressive of the hippopotamus is known 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.959
 as one of the most dangerous animals 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.370
 in Africa 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.260
 they will warn you without warning 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.050
 attacks and are strong enough to handle 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.820
 destroy complete cars 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.310
 the salt water is on a number four 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.590
 crocodile this ancient predator stands 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.390
 in the food it eats 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.420
 just about everything you come across from 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.190
 water buffalo to sharks and all cypress 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.410
 you have to take advantage of 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.360
 the deadpool is a technique where there is 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.739
 a victim turns upside down and 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.650
 hold under water until 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.470
 this drowned is going to be the top 3 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.570
 inside with the interior tai pan 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.940
 this is the most poisonous snake in the world 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.190
 a single base of this about it 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.060
 generally non-aggressive beer 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.709
 enough to have a hundred people or 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.750
 250,000 people to lay 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.470
 fortunately this snake lives in dense 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.750
 forests 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.970
 there are no fatal ones yet 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.260
 human victims known as you 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.010
 get better 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.600
 your life is over within 45 minutes 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.360
 number 2 one you might not like 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.220
 but mosquitoes were tiny 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.320
 you hear seasons where they can 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.790
 extremely dangerous 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.130
 some are often full of all kinds 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.260
 put bacteria on weird diseases 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.560
 buzzing animal at number 2 in this summit 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:40.290
 ten and become around 700 a year 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.180
 million people sick from a mosquito bite 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.380
 and before that two to three die 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.030
 million 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.730
 the air mainly causes problems 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.320
 warm tropical areas and the sad ones 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.780
 number one of these top 10 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.730
 the people are none of the animals up 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.380
 this list also comes close 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.200
 the number of fatalities 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.590
 that man himself produces over the 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.720
 to be proud of 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.849
 probably not but we are standing 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.879
