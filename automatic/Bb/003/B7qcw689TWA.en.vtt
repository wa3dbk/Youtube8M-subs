00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180 

the<00:00:00.210> way<00:00:00.329> the<00:00:00.510> speech<00:00:00.719> jammer<00:00:00.989> works<00:00:01.410> is<00:00:01.709> it

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
the way the speech jammer works is it

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.519 
the way the speech jammer works is it
plays<00:00:02.460> my<00:00:02.730> own<00:00:02.939> voice<00:00:03.330> back<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:03.959> me<00:00:04.110> and<00:00:04.319> a

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
plays my own voice back to me and a

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.249 
plays my own voice back to me and a
slight<00:00:05.100> delay<00:00:05.580> so<00:00:06.180> it<00:00:06.450> short-circuits<00:00:07.109> your

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
slight delay so it short-circuits your

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.470 
slight delay so it short-circuits your
brain<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:08.340> causes<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:09.000> effect<00:00:09.300> that<00:00:09.389> you

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
brain and causes the effect that you

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.140 
brain and causes the effect that you
discovers<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:11.010> we'll<00:00:11.190> see<00:00:11.370> probably<00:00:11.610> again

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
discovers and we'll see probably again

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.990 
discovers and we'll see probably again
some<00:00:12.570> people<00:00:12.929> are<00:00:13.019> immune<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.410> it<00:00:13.740> so<00:00:14.700> Jordans
