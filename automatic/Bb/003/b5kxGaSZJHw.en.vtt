or something like that and this was made

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.500 
or something like that and this was made
in<00:02:42.910> Cape<00:02:43.210> Cod<00:02:43.540> it's<00:02:43.960> Cape<00:02:44.200> Cod<00:02:44.410> sportswear<00:02:45.130> and

in Cape Cod it's Cape Cod sportswear and

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.940 
in Cape Cod it's Cape Cod sportswear and
I<00:02:46.510> just<00:02:46.900> think<00:02:47.050> that's<00:02:47.140> cool<00:02:47.410> because<00:02:47.590> how

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
I just think that's cool because how

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.800 
I just think that's cool because how
many<00:02:48.010> things<00:02:48.340> are<00:02:48.490> made<00:02:48.640> in<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:48.910> USA<00:02:49.360> anymore

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
so and also I thought it was cool

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.580 
so and also I thought it was cool
because<00:02:52.630> I<00:02:53.020> live<00:02:53.170> in<00:02:53.260> Northern<00:02:53.500> California

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
and my head shots because i am a theater

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.180

minor<00:05:41.390> in<00:05:41.570> college<00:05:41.690> you<00:05:42.500> probably<00:05:42.919> didn't
