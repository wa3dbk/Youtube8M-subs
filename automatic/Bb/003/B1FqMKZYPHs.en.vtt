00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.430
 very good to everyone today here as always 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.920
 with easier 4 and welcome to this 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.810
 video from m 82 to 3 the rifle 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.760
 50 caliber sniper that I had 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.470
 expected a lot I was asking 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.660
 since I was playing batters filtres a 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.250
 half a year or so and taiz and 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.960
 Somehow my daughter listened to me 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.670
 surely a lot of people more than 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.470
 he wanted and he put it like a battle 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.330
 'pick-ups' probably the most powerful 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.970
 in the right hands they obviously are not 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.580
 mine but how to see here is the 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.320
 true a spectacular weapon let's hope 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.090
 that is not energy 2 good probably 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.670
 is going to be narrates the truth because it is 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.589
 a little p we could say be some what 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.330
 others would say maybe not the truth is that 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.729
 comes with very few bullets are very 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.019
 easy to spend as you have already seen 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:52.089
 in this video and probably what 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.580
 are going to keep seeing a little more forgiveness 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.530
 but in the right hands as I said 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.210
 This weapon is exceptional and can change 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.000
 the course of a game especially with 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.290
 key domination with 300 tickets but for 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.580
 those who have not been able to play the beta 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.370
 whatever it is let's talk about a 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.510
 little of the statistics of this weapon 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.880
 starting with the fact that this weapon 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.100
 kill at any distance in any 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.960
 part of the body of a single shot if 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.409
 As you already heard it, I shot it 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.090
 here 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.759
 distance foot I'll kill 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.890
 same and if he hit 600 on the head 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.299
 700 thousand meters will always kill a 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.579
 shot or whatever it is 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.469
 semiautomatic brings about 2 or 3 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.090
 loaders of 11 bullets each one is not 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:29.950
 can recharge obviously like any 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.439
 another one for tele pick up and also makes 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.979
 damage to vehicles being that the cupbearer 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.609
 attack receives 11 damage for each shot 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.349
 probably the helicopter 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:41.259
 transport receive something around 

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:42.700
 11 10 too and up there is all that 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.810
 it would have to be tested with the rest of 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.969
 drought vehicles armored vehicles 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.009
 like what are tanks or tanks against 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:49.239
 infantry does not hurt any but 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.369
 the truth is that we should try it 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:52.869
 against chips and other vehicles more than 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.569
 we're probably going to see when the 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.219
 game is completely finished and 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.020
 also you two variants or two 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:00.789
 versions even if for now one for 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.219
 long distances and others for average and 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.840
 short what is the first the long 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.119
 distances with a look around 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.099
 by 12X or 14 if not me 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.959
 wrong and can be found in the 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.430
 long conquest the way of conquest 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.810
 long here on this map of sick of 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.180
 shanghai and obviously it's the same for 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.430
 we have and the short half can be 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.960
 find in the domination mode 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.160
 or domination 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.650
 when now the ones that are seeing in 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.120
 screen as to finish the video I 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.740
 I'd like to give you some tips on how 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.510
 improve with this weapon obviously to me 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.340
 is missing a lot and how can there be 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.860
 seen throughout the video I'm pretty 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.840
 bad yet to be honest but if 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.520
 well I know something are the tips that you have to 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.840
 give so that there to increase it is another 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.760
 thing but the first one would be 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.410
 positioning as you can always see 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.450
 I'm letting someone go ahead 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.730
 I'm never going to the front myself because I'm going to 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.190
 lose 9 out of 10 times even if it's 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.570
 now until good you are the 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.060
 person who is using it become 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.860
 in a but let's say and have a lot 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.210
 a lot of practice is better to let the 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.400
 rest go ahead that the classes of 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.630
 engineer assault with rules of 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.700
 personal defense go ahead and 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.500
 we go in what is average or 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.240
 long distances as I said in 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.640
 staying behind and providing 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.290
 it was contention as well as knowing very 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.910
 well the environment around our it 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.350
 so that we are playing on the map 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.030
 as you can see here I am playing in 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.680
 domination and yes there is a lot of coverage 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.250
 everywhere there are containers there 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.620
 concrete blocks there are barriers of 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.290
 all bars boxes all that kind of stuff 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.280
 that block my vision so I take 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.080
 part of the saying to capital 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.840
 It is a very good idea and also 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.340
 tranquility and practice but good that 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.810
 it was all for today I hope you have them 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.310
 liked we see you the next welcome 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.310
 to all new subscribers and chau
