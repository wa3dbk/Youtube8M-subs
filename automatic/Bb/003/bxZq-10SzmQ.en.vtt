so<00:02:35.740> yeah<00:02:36.740> I<00:02:37.100> think<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.610> looks<00:02:37.730> more<00:02:38.000> like<00:02:38.210> her

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
so yeah I think that looks more like her

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.590 
so yeah I think that looks more like her
so<00:02:39.490> that's<00:02:40.490> why<00:02:40.640> I'm<00:02:40.760> making<00:02:40.910> this<00:02:41.150> update

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
so that's why I'm making this update

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:48.880 
so that's why I'm making this update
video<00:02:43.750> because<00:02:44.750> um<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:47.320> made<00:02:48.320> her<00:02:48.440> better<00:02:48.650> now
