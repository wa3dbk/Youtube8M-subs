00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.389
 how about passion friends for motor tb 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.200
 Thank you for continuing to see our 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.990
 videos 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.430
 here on youtube we are presenting you is 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.890
 today a revision of a 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.020
 product that we had enough time 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.669
 waiting for the truth many of the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.099
 fans of the cavallino brand 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.439
 rampant 'well they were now so 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.400
 looking for this model and especially in 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.580
 this scale is 194 and is the 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.379
 truth we are partly with a with 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.660
 one with a good flavor and a bad taste 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.430
 mouth in this case of this product 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.190
 specific 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.230
 the good model this is replicating 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.870
 as you come commented and can see by the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.210
 type of packaging does of hot wheels is 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.450
 It is one of the first incursions of 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.460
 the brand hot wheels in the scale 1 to 24 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.559
 since as many of you will have 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.480
 given account is practically what it is 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.210
 hot wheels was only engaged 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:08.220
 to replicate models in scale 143 143 and 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.440
 164 it was practically what it was about 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.990
 that were covering in this case have 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.850
 decided to enter venice 94 and 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.470
 some years ago they came to work in 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.750
 this scale 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.869
 mainly formula cars 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.180
 one or some nascar but nothing more and not 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.890
 the truth was they were products that good 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.660
 that were for necklace for collectors 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.369
 well also given the time in which 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.080
 they were made about ten 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.259
 years that those products stopped coming out 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.670
 we are in 2014 and well not now 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.930
 so nothing to do with quality 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.149
 what are we seeing in today's product 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.070
 day let's talk a little bit of 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.220
 auto in general of the real model of 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.790
 effect is defined is this car 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:50.010
 replaced the 599 make digits 99 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.780
 of the 2006 production within the range 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:56.700
 ferrari este berlinetta appeared in 2012 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.900
 already as now, as a substitute for this 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.150
 model that is moment is considered the 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.420
 an atmospheric engine vehicle brings the 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.210
 12-cylinder engine instead of something else 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.700
 of 6 liters of displacement is the engine 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.340
 most powerful atmospheric has 740 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.680
 horsepower without needing 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.320
 helps like a turbo a super a 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.780
 compressor or something like that is 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.030
 natural aspiration is a flower so 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.040
 is one has reached these standards 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.380
 thanks to the technique that today 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.420
 can have thanks to the electronics and 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.850
 now yes that refinement that can 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.450
 take them now so the electronics 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.400
 Today let 's talk about model 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.220
 of the miniature that we have here as 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.450
 I tell you is one is a first 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.390
 incursion after a long time by 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.690
 part of hot wheels the model is in a 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.090
 basic model and apparently what it is 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.610
 josé luís you are going to be qualities 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.910
 foundation and qualities the link in this 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.100
 scale 124 unfortunately and leave the 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.110
 isolation say it these models and we 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.290
 leave the distaste since they do not open 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.410
 absolutely nothing we do not have opening 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.780
 of doors we do not have opening of 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.250
 trunk engines we do not even have 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.620
 a movement of direction with the 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.810
 flyer but something that is very curious 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.420
 and it 's the best thing maybe we do not get a 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.040
 little the situation is that the quality 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.909
 of the product as we are seeing it already 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.000
 is over 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:27.040
 the article is already here with 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.440
 we the truth is very well 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.840
 detailed that's what it speaks to us it seems 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.720
 the truth a model that even that 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.430
 it serves in some parts but the truth 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.519
 not in the presentation where 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.709
 Mandan is a bubble and now it does not 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.530
 makes a single box is an iron 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.299
 of cardboard at the bottom and with a 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.799
 Bubble at the top that swims 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.250
 more we have disassembled to be able to have 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:53.980
 more more access is easier to take 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.959
 and well, if you can find out 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.480
 then the definition of parts and pieces 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.090
 is very well made and what are lighthouses 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.650
 they are very well reproduced not of the 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.750
 original that we have incorporated some of 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.129
 jet type the back of the skulls 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.680
 they are also well made are pieces 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.060
 independent what is the grill 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.500
 also entity and independent pieces 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:17.979
 is this is more or less emptied by 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.380
 explore by the internal part see is 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.709
 well in detail there are some some 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.080
 elements 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.710
 If you are big about this then nothing 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.419
 more this is the piece of metal with something 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.310
 of black paint to simulate that shot 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:33.740
 of air in the back more or 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.680
 least we have more of these this same 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.500
 plastic parts and some metal 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.870
 painted and with sufficient risks 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.330
 but then nothing else we do not have 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.759
 absolutely nothing else what is the 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.729
 registration if one is one is one piece 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:51.530
 separated what is it was full then 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.020
 a decal from the front 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.030
 equality of the side we see the interior 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.840
 of course there is no steering wheel connected anymore 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:02.300
 that we do not have this address or 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.949
 is even made with axes in the 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.090
 model we move the back wheel and 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.919
 obviously the opposite is going to move 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.070
 model is very basic in the scale the 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.680
 true if it is at the exact point not 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.560
 fall into the excesses of a lleida toys 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.000
 not that there are times in the miser of a 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.740
 distro times the truth is curious that 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.389
 curious to see that precisely in this 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.900
 It was the only brand that was 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:30.500
 reproduction 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.660
 metal models that 94 and I made them 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.370
 with the same quality as always since 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.639
 now yes that the models that I was 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.680
 producing were practically model 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.180
 tips for now yes you think models 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.889
 to assemble and we have these same 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.509
 models but they continue without the armed 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:49.370
 final and in the case of hot wheels then 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:50.930
 we would have practically thought that 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.449
 this type of product life now remains 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.949
 the best as well as a t mile or something 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:57.289
 the style since we do not have opening of 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:59.780
 nothing but good is what's what 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:02.990
 have decided to start over in the 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.389
 sector of the scale 124 in this case the 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.070
 make hot wheels remember that I am 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:09.410
 many more articles can find them 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.870

 We are as a nation by motor cars 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.320
 scale can follow all our 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.729
