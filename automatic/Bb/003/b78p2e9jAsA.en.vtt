00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
change with the printer as well so if we

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.490 
change with the printer as well so if we
go<00:01:38.400> ahead<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.759> open<00:01:38.850> up<00:01:39.150> this<00:01:39.270> printer<00:01:39.720> you

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
go ahead and open up this printer you

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.399 
go ahead and open up this printer you

this last five times longer then an ink
sack<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.920> only<00:01:47.250> need<00:01:47.399> two<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.299> these<00:01:48.750> to

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
sack so you only need two of these to

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.859 
sack so you only need two of these to
actually<00:01:49.560> copy<00:01:49.860> an<00:01:50.240> enchanted<00:01:51.240> book<00:01:51.450> which<00:01:51.689> is

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
actually copy an enchanted book which is

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.899 
actually copy an enchanted book which is
really<00:01:52.110> good<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:53.100> wanted<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.399> add<00:01:53.640> an

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
really good and I wanted to add an

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.499 
really good and I wanted to add an
alternative<00:01:55.430> ink<00:01:56.430> source<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.240> just

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
alternative ink source for this just

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.749 
alternative ink source for this just
because<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.110> did<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.649> for<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> fridge<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.640> I

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
because I did it for the fridge and I

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.880 
because I did it for the fridge and I
thought<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.119> would<00:02:00.210> be<00:02:00.299> good<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:01.079> do<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.259> for

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
thought it would be good to do it for

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.609 
thought it would be good to do it for
the<00:02:02.250> printer<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.180> next<00:02:03.479> thing<00:02:03.659> I've<00:02:03.899> added<00:02:04.320> is

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
the printer the next thing I've added is

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.679 
the printer the next thing I've added is
a<00:02:04.649> new<00:02:04.979> block<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.180> the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
a new block and this is the

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.710 
a new block and this is the
electric-fence<00:02:07.350> now<00:02:08.060> there's<00:02:09.060> kind<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.479> bug

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
electric-fence now there's kind of a bug

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.630 
electric-fence now there's kind of a bug
right<00:02:09.929> now<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.170> rendering<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:11.009> don't<00:02:11.310> know<00:02:11.430> why

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
right now the rendering I don't know why

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.630 
right now the rendering I don't know why
I<00:02:11.970> was<00:02:12.660> working<00:02:13.020> before<00:02:13.170> but

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
I was working before but

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.490 
I was working before but
some<00:02:13.819> reason<00:02:14.180> it's<00:02:14.390> not<00:02:14.510> working<00:02:14.660> now<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:15.170> I'm

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
some reason it's not working now so I'm

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.500 
some reason it's not working now so I'm
gonna<00:02:15.620> have<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:16.040> look<00:02:16.700> into<00:02:16.880> that<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.270> see<00:02:17.480> if

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
gonna have to look into that and see if

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.830 
gonna have to look into that and see if
I<00:02:17.690> can<00:02:17.870> see<00:02:18.650> if<00:02:18.709> I<00:02:18.830> can<00:02:18.950> get<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:19.220> fixed<00:02:19.840> but

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
I can see if I can get that fixed but

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.990 
I can see if I can get that fixed but
yet<00:02:21.020> this<00:02:21.230> electric<00:02:21.800> fence<00:02:22.010> does<00:02:22.610> what<00:02:22.880> it

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
yet this electric fence does what it

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.360 
yet this electric fence does what it
says<00:02:23.030> so<00:02:23.660> if<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:24.050> actually<00:02:24.200> walk<00:02:24.650> into<00:02:24.980> it

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
says so if you actually walk into it

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.240 
says so if you actually walk into it
you'll<00:02:26.270> get<00:02:26.420> electrocuted<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:27.350> eventually

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
you'll get electrocuted and eventually

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.580 
you'll get electrocuted and eventually
die<00:02:28.490> so<00:02:28.850> I'll<00:02:29.030> go<00:02:29.240> ahead<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.660> show<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:30.410> this

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
die so I'll go ahead and show you this

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.360 
die so I'll go ahead and show you this
for<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.040> guys<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:31.400> if<00:02:31.520> I<00:02:31.640> go<00:02:31.820> game-mode<00:02:32.390> 0<00:02:33.370> I'm

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
for you guys so if I go game-mode 0 I'm

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.870 
for you guys so if I go game-mode 0 I'm
in<00:02:34.520> survival<00:02:34.700> now<00:02:35.209> if<00:02:35.840> I<00:02:35.990> go<00:02:36.230> up<00:02:36.470> to<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:37.850> see

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
in survival now if I go up to it you see

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.949 
in survival now if I go up to it you see
oh<00:02:38.560> no<00:02:39.560> uh-oh<00:02:41.350> no<00:02:42.350> I<00:02:42.380> died<00:02:42.860> Oh<00:02:43.330> God<00:02:44.360> where<00:02:44.780> the

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
oh no uh-oh no I died Oh God where the

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.400 
oh no uh-oh no I died Oh God where the
hell<00:02:45.140> am<00:02:45.170> I<00:02:45.730> I'm<00:02:46.730> in<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:47.030> middle<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.660> nowhere

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
hell am I I'm in the middle of nowhere

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.070 
hell am I I'm in the middle of nowhere
great<00:02:49.190> so<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.880> electric<00:02:50.270> fence<00:02:50.510> has<00:02:50.810> got

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
great so the electric fence has got

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.990 
great so the electric fence has got
these<00:02:51.260> same<00:02:51.530> render<00:02:52.010> as<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.489> white<00:02:52.700> fence

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
these same render as the white fence

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.110 
these same render as the white fence
just<00:02:53.360> practically<00:02:54.130> retexture<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.550> little

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
just practically retexture a little

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.970 
just practically retexture a little
thing<00:02:56.540> with<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.900> electric<00:02:57.290> fence<00:02:57.530> is<00:02:57.800> that

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
thing with the electric fence is that

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.120 
thing with the electric fence is that
you<00:02:58.040> can<00:02:58.190> actually<00:02:58.310> jump<00:02:59.150> over<00:02:59.690> it<00:02:59.840> I<00:03:00.019> kind<00:03:01.010> of

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
you can actually jump over it I kind of

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.430 
you can actually jump over it I kind of
wanted<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.459> make<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.269> like<00:03:02.420> that<00:03:02.630> so<00:03:02.959> it<00:03:03.290> would

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
wanted to make it like that so it would

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.600 
wanted to make it like that so it would
be<00:03:03.970> some<00:03:04.970> sort<00:03:05.209> of<00:03:05.739> way<00:03:06.739> around<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:07.580> just

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
be some sort of way around it just

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.410 
be some sort of way around it just
because<00:03:08.290> I<00:03:09.430> didn't<00:03:10.430> want<00:03:10.459> I<00:03:10.910> didn't<00:03:11.239> want<00:03:11.390> it

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
because I didn't want I didn't want it

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.810 
because I didn't want I didn't want it
to<00:03:11.570> be<00:03:11.720> like<00:03:11.959> this<00:03:12.410> is<00:03:12.560> like<00:03:12.830> entirely

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
to be like this is like entirely

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.900 
to be like this is like entirely
impossible<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:15.140> get<00:03:15.350> past<00:03:15.380> so<00:03:15.950> if<00:03:16.220> someone<00:03:16.760> was

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
impossible to get past so if someone was

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.240 
impossible to get past so if someone was
trying<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.269> jump<00:03:17.540> over<00:03:17.690> it<00:03:17.989> they<00:03:18.920> would<00:03:19.100> get

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
trying to jump over it they would get

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.780 
trying to jump over it they would get
electrocuted<00:03:19.700> a<00:03:20.269> good<00:03:20.690> thing<00:03:20.870> about<00:03:20.959> this<00:03:21.320> is

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
electrocuted a good thing about this is

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.550 
electrocuted a good thing about this is
it's<00:03:22.790> kind<00:03:23.030> of<00:03:23.150> unintentional<00:03:23.660> but<00:03:24.170> mobs

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
it's kind of unintentional but mobs

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.740 
it's kind of unintentional but mobs
don't<00:03:25.430> really<00:03:25.700> recognize<00:03:26.060> it<00:03:26.450> so<00:03:26.630> they<00:03:26.720> just

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
don't really recognize it so they just

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.069 
don't really recognize it so they just
walk<00:03:27.079> straight<00:03:27.500> into<00:03:27.739> it<00:03:28.269> which<00:03:29.269> is<00:03:29.450> really

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
walk straight into it which is really

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.030 
walk straight into it which is really
cool<00:03:31.180> now<00:03:32.180> there<00:03:32.390> is<00:03:32.540> one<00:03:33.200> last<00:03:33.440> thing<00:03:33.680> that<00:03:34.010> I

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
cool now there is one last thing that I

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.160 
cool now there is one last thing that I
will<00:03:34.310> talk<00:03:34.489> about<00:03:34.549> and<00:03:35.030> this<00:03:35.180> is<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:35.630> stereo

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
will talk about and this is the stereo

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.750 
will talk about and this is the stereo
if<00:03:36.769> I<00:03:37.100> can<00:03:37.250> get<00:03:37.340> it<00:03:37.430> in<00:03:37.519> the<00:03:37.579> right<00:03:37.730> direction

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
if I can get it in the right direction

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.660 
if I can get it in the right direction
so<00:03:38.390> I<00:03:38.840> actually<00:03:39.260> sit<00:03:39.620> in<00:03:39.680> a<00:03:39.860> live<00:03:40.070> stream<00:03:40.459> that

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
so I actually sit in a live stream that

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.190 
so I actually sit in a live stream that
I<00:03:40.730> was<00:03:40.850> going<00:03:40.970> to<00:03:41.030> get<00:03:41.209> rid<00:03:41.420> of<00:03:41.450> this<00:03:41.630> but<00:03:42.019> I've

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
I was going to get rid of this but I've

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.920 
I was going to get rid of this but I've
decided<00:03:42.860> not<00:03:43.730> to<00:03:43.790> so<00:03:44.150> I've<00:03:44.269> brought<00:03:44.570> it<00:03:44.720> back

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
decided not to so I've brought it back
