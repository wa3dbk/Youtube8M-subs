thing<00:01:28.220> you<00:01:28.340> can<00:01:28.520> do<00:01:28.670> but<00:01:28.939> sometimes<00:01:29.299> you<00:01:29.659> just

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
thing you can do but sometimes you just

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.200 
thing you can do but sometimes you just
have<00:01:29.960> to<00:01:30.079> do<00:01:30.320> it<00:01:30.409> next<00:01:30.740> step<00:01:31.070> in<00:01:31.280> getting

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
have to do it next step in getting

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.020 
have to do it next step in getting
better<00:01:32.390> of<00:01:32.799> photographing<00:01:33.799> large<00:01:34.040> groups<00:01:34.790> is

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
better of photographing large groups is

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.810 
better of photographing large groups is
try<00:01:35.570> to<00:01:35.600> get<00:01:35.869> them<00:01:36.049> on<00:01:36.140> different<00:01:36.469> levels

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
try to get them on different levels

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.520 
try to get them on different levels
three<00:01:37.820> if<00:01:37.969> possible<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:38.659> you<00:01:38.719> get<00:01:38.960> one<00:01:39.259> row<00:01:39.469> of

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
three if possible so you get one row of

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.889 
three if possible so you get one row of
people<00:01:39.920> sitting<00:01:40.340> down<00:01:40.369> row<00:01:40.939> one<00:01:41.450> row<00:01:41.479> people

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
people sitting down row one row people

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.380 
people sitting down row one row people
maybe<00:01:42.680> laying<00:01:43.100> on<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.430> floor<00:01:43.579> and<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.360> other

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
maybe laying on the floor and the other

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.660 
maybe laying on the floor and the other
ones<00:01:44.659> standing<00:01:45.049> up<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:45.469> if<00:01:45.619> you<00:01:45.740> have<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:46.219> bench

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
ones standing up and if you have a bench

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.160 
ones standing up and if you have a bench
at<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:46.880> back<00:01:47.119> maybe<00:01:47.360> you<00:01:47.479> can<00:01:47.689> do<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.840> fourth

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
at the back maybe you can do the fourth

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.260 
at the back maybe you can do the fourth
so<00:01:48.680> very<00:01:49.100> good<00:01:49.310> for<00:01:49.520> large<00:01:49.850> groups<00:01:50.119> of<00:01:50.210> people

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
so very good for large groups of people

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.319 
so very good for large groups of people
and<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:51.350> next<00:01:51.680> idea<00:01:51.979> is<00:01:52.250> to<00:01:52.579> actually<00:01:52.850> try<00:01:53.210> to

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
and the next idea is to actually try to

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:55.899 
and the next idea is to actually try to
shoot<00:01:54.140> from<00:01:54.439> a<00:01:54.649> higher<00:01:55.039> angle<00:01:55.310> so<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:55.670> can

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
shoot from a higher angle so you can

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.899 
shoot from a higher angle so you can
capture<00:01:56.119> everyone<00:01:56.630> is<00:01:57.590> a<00:01:57.979> photographer<00:01:58.280> I

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
capture everyone is a photographer I

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.709 
capture everyone is a photographer I
always<00:01:59.390> avoid<00:02:00.020> the<00:02:00.170> situation<00:02:00.680> having<00:02:00.920> people

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 
always avoid the situation having people

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.450 
always avoid the situation having people
being<00:02:02.719> hidden<00:02:03.049> from<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.500> camera<00:02:03.829> so<00:02:04.009> that's

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
being hidden from the camera so that's

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.459 
being hidden from the camera so that's
why<00:02:04.640> I'm<00:02:04.820> always<00:02:05.119> trying<00:02:05.509> to<00:02:05.630> find<00:02:05.930> a<00:02:06.170> higher

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:06.469 
why I'm always trying to find a higher

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.099 
why I'm always trying to find a higher
spot<00:02:06.859> if<00:02:07.130> you're<00:02:07.189> shooting<00:02:07.579> smaller<00:02:08.450> groups<00:02:08.750> 3

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:09.109

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.900 
to 4 people like a normal average family
get<00:02:12.170> people<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.680> have<00:02:12.890> their<00:02:13.160> heads<00:02:13.430> as<00:02:13.640> close

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
get people to have their heads as close

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.880 
get people to have their heads as close

ground aspera images you just see and

try to have the heads at different

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.259 
try to have the heads at different
levels<00:02:23.329> so<00:02:23.510> you<00:02:23.750> can<00:02:24.049> read<00:02:24.230> them<00:02:24.380> in<00:02:24.500> zigzags

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
levels so you can read them in zigzags

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.060 
levels so you can read them in zigzags
remember<00:02:26.269> if<00:02:26.540> there<00:02:26.930> are<00:02:27.019> small<00:02:27.230> children<00:02:27.590> try

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
remember if there are small children try

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.340 
remember if there are small children try
to<00:02:28.130> crop<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.579> images<00:02:28.910> in<00:02:29.120> such<00:02:29.419> a<00:02:29.449> way

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
to crop the images in such a way

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.130 
to crop the images in such a way
you<00:02:31.160> still<00:02:31.430> keep<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.970> scale<00:02:32.300> so<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:32.870> don't

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
you still keep the scale so you don't

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.080 
you still keep the scale so you don't
want<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.320> see<00:02:33.470> very<00:02:33.980> large<00:02:34.280> people<00:02:34.580> with<00:02:34.880> very

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
want to see very large people with very

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.310 
want to see very large people with very
small<00:02:35.300> children<00:02:35.540> because<00:02:35.960> that's<00:02:36.170> out<00:02:36.290> of

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
small children because that's out of

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.950 
small children because that's out of
scale<00:02:36.740> so<00:02:37.280> if<00:02:37.850> you<00:02:38.090> crop<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.480> image<00:02:38.690> that

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
scale so if you crop the image that

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.690 
scale so if you crop the image that
would<00:02:39.020> be<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.200> good<00:02:39.350> idea<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:40.070> can<00:02:40.280> play<00:02:40.520> with

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
would be a good idea you can play with

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.340 
would be a good idea you can play with
the<00:02:40.760> compositional<00:02:41.360> rules<00:02:41.570> as<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:41.900> can<00:02:42.170> see

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
the compositional rules as you can see

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.530 
the compositional rules as you can see

Humber's and happy with it but I think

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.300 
Humber's and happy with it but I think
it<00:02:53.510> proves<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.870> point<00:02:53.900> rules<00:02:54.800> of<00:02:54.980> composition

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
it proves the point rules of composition

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.290 
it proves the point rules of composition
it's<00:02:55.880> creative<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.960> does<00:02:57.230> fit<00:02:57.680> into<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.550> boxes

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
it's creative it does fit into the boxes

another<00:03:00.080> idea<00:03:00.410> I'm<00:03:00.590> trying<00:03:00.950> always<00:03:01.340> to<00:03:01.580> use<00:03:01.940> is

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
another idea I'm trying always to use is

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.480 
another idea I'm trying always to use is
get<00:03:02.540> people<00:03:02.870> to<00:03:03.020> run<00:03:03.200> towards<00:03:03.650> me<00:03:03.680> for<00:03:04.220> that

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
get people to run towards me for that

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.880 
get people to run towards me for that
you<00:03:04.820> need<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.270> use<00:03:05.540> either<00:03:05.870> time<00:03:06.410> priority

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
you need to use either time priority

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.760 
you need to use either time priority
mode<00:03:07.040> or<00:03:07.310> manual<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:08.300> would<00:03:09.110> recommend<00:03:09.590> a

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
mode or manual I would recommend a

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.000 
mode or manual I would recommend a
shutter<00:03:10.460> speed<00:03:10.640> faster<00:03:11.210> than<00:03:12.010> 250-thousand

shutter speed faster than 250-thousand

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.840 
shutter speed faster than 250-thousand

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
in the continuous burst mode and also

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.800 
in the continuous burst mode and also
it's<00:03:17.030> important<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.660> have<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.320> cell<00:03:19.280> wall

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
it's important to have the cell wall

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.990 
it's important to have the cell wall
autofocus<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.130> camera<00:03:22.130> will<00:03:22.460> follow<00:03:22.820> the

autofocus and camera will follow the

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
five times you ask them to run five

enjoyed this picture the next idea is to

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.240 
enjoyed this picture the next idea is to
try<00:04:11.330> to<00:04:11.390> use<00:04:11.600> some<00:04:11.630> props<00:04:12.020> in<00:04:12.260> this<00:04:12.770> case<00:04:13.040> I

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
try to use some props in this case I

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.250 
try to use some props in this case I
have<00:04:13.460> used<00:04:13.670> the<00:04:13.820> frame<00:04:14.090> nothing<00:04:14.870> new<00:04:15.050> I've

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
have used the frame nothing new I've

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.060 
have used the frame nothing new I've
seen<00:04:15.530> it<00:04:15.650> before

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
seen it before

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.180 
seen it before
but<00:04:16.370> let<00:04:16.940> me<00:04:16.970> tell<00:04:17.239> you<00:04:17.390> it<00:04:17.630> does<00:04:17.840> create<00:04:18.200> a<00:04:18.500> an

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
but let me tell you it does create a an

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.570 
but let me tell you it does create a an
event<00:04:19.340> and<00:04:19.730> people<00:04:20.390> are<00:04:20.630> enjoying<00:04:20.960> it

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
event and people are enjoying it

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
event and people are enjoying it
obviously<00:04:22.580> think<00:04:22.940> about<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.300> composition

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
obviously think about the composition

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.290 
obviously think about the composition
even<00:04:24.050> if<00:04:24.350> you're<00:04:24.470> using<00:04:24.680> this<00:04:25.040> this<00:04:25.820> frame<00:04:26.120> and

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
even if you're using this this frame and

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.150 
even if you're using this this frame and
if<00:04:26.450> you<00:04:26.540> tilt<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:26.990> a<00:04:27.020> little<00:04:27.170> bit<00:04:27.560> on<00:04:27.740> an<00:04:28.010> angle

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
if you tilt it a little bit on an angle

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.270 
if you tilt it a little bit on an angle
it's<00:04:28.520> going<00:04:28.760> to<00:04:28.820> look<00:04:28.940> even<00:04:29.240> better<00:04:30.280> another

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
it's going to look even better another

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.910 
it's going to look even better another
image<00:04:31.850> with<00:04:32.480> a<00:04:32.510> good<00:04:32.720> example<00:04:33.110> I'm<00:04:33.500> not<00:04:33.770> very

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920 
image with a good example I'm not very

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.530 
image with a good example I'm not very
happy<00:04:34.070> because<00:04:34.520> it's<00:04:34.760> starting<00:04:35.000> to<00:04:35.270> be<00:04:35.390> out<00:04:35.510> of

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
happy because it's starting to be out of

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.120 
happy because it's starting to be out of
focus<00:04:35.690> so<00:04:36.110> you<00:04:36.200> need<00:04:36.350> to<00:04:36.440> pay<00:04:36.620> attention<00:04:36.650> on

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
focus so you need to pay attention on

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.950 
focus so you need to pay attention on
that<00:04:37.190> so<00:04:37.670> for<00:04:37.910> this<00:04:38.030> I<00:04:38.240> would<00:04:38.390> recommend<00:04:38.479> a

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
that so for this I would recommend a

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.070 
that so for this I would recommend a
very<00:04:39.229> small<00:04:39.680> aperture<00:04:40.610> but<00:04:41.419> I<00:04:41.479> like<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:41.900> fact

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
very small aperture but I like the fact

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.470 
very small aperture but I like the fact
it's<00:04:42.320> tilted<00:04:42.860> and

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
it's tilted and

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.860 
it's tilted and
the<00:04:43.780> angle<00:04:44.320> is<00:04:44.530> unusual<00:04:45.310> I<00:04:45.520> think<00:04:45.700> it's<00:04:46.330> a<00:04:46.480> very

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
the angle is unusual I think it's a very

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.260 
the angle is unusual I think it's a very
good<00:04:47.110> portrait<00:04:47.770> for<00:04:48.130> a<00:04:48.160> family<00:04:48.670> and<00:04:48.880> I

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
good portrait for a family and I

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.260 
good portrait for a family and I
absolutely<00:04:49.360> love<00:04:50.080> it<00:04:50.460> I'm<00:04:51.460> not<00:04:51.700> sure<00:04:51.940> who's

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
absolutely love it I'm not sure who's

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.380 
absolutely love it I'm not sure who's
