this<00:00:28.790> pile<00:00:29.300> of<00:00:29.540> measurement<00:00:31.540> is<00:00:32.540> the<00:00:33.550> Toyota

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
this pile of measurement is the Toyota

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.350 
this pile of measurement is the Toyota
priors<00:00:37.390> what<00:00:38.390> it<00:00:38.510> is<00:00:38.660> is<00:00:38.870> a<00:00:38.900> hybrid<00:00:39.290> and<00:00:40.360> what

they do in hybrid is give a car a
battery<00:00:45.710> so<00:00:46.610> it<00:00:46.640> becomes<00:00:47.330> more<00:00:48.199> economical<00:00:49.930> so

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
battery so it becomes more economical so

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.590 
battery so it becomes more economical so
they<00:00:51.170> make<00:00:51.379> us<00:00:51.559> believe<00:00:52.059> what<00:00:53.059> the<00:00:53.180> battery

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
they make us believe what the battery

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.069 
they make us believe what the battery
actually<00:00:53.809> does<00:00:54.410> is<00:00:54.769> save<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.400> fuel<00:00:55.940> which<00:00:56.870> is
