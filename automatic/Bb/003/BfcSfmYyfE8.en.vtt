00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:13.580
 it is not in smith i do architect e 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.580
 they also carry out graphic art activities 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:25.070
 I come from Sarajevo 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:28.340
 but away from your country where I have 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.950
 had started business in one 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.560
 multinational as manager of 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.780
 design and architecture was not easy 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.440
 resume the journey in a city where 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.110
 I didn't know anyone didn't talk 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.280
 the Italian, however, was an interesting one 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.280
 challenge that I would repeat 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:54.160
 if you have to love what you do and one 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.530
 great passion that I had as a child 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:02.470
 I was very clear with myself and determined 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:04.839
 that I will make the architect this is a strong one 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.790
 tenacity just a challenge with the 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.560
 difficulties that life occasionally gives you 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.560
 prepares was greater strength 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.380
 I started right from the work 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:20.740
 of objects I was available for 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.759
 participate in various events to be able to 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.549
 let me know why without a car 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:31.869
 promotion definitely can't go 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:35.590
 however, it has been a path that is 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:39.849
 gone just layer by layer man 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.179
 I have created these relationships with 

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:45.969
 customers who have always started from 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:49.989
 more to arrive and to believe in my way 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:52.360
 see the architecture task for me to 

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:55.920
 an architect and really create environments 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.920
 where people are fine 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.240
 I can proudly say that I have 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.909
 tried all the trades because when 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.229
 you can touch yourself with your hands as well 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:13.349
 even more after living with with 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:19.069
 let's enjoy self-esteem say a 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:23.980
 environment as well as being the architect 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:27.170
 the artist was or not by 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:31.420
 forget the role of the mother of 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:36.230
 wife having a family because 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:39.469
 almost a strength activity for 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.950
 the other and become very compatible 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.950
 among them 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:51.450
 to start the business in my case 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:54.760
 I can say that I really started 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.250
 almost nothing symbolically I have to say that 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.610
 the house as a first job was born on one 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.460
 wood plate glued with a piece 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.120
 of white sticker is only charges I have 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:12.010
 fact was the ricci can leave 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:15.100
 completely out of nowhere 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:19.120
 acquires even stronger strength 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.340
 energy and you just have to insist on that 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.850
 which I think every architect should 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.430
 at a certain point in the journey 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:30.220
 professional think of something that 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.100
 leaves as a stamp for a city ​​where 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.130
 he carried out the activity for me would be 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.060
 great to leave a little stamp that 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:43.530
 it would just be a voice where I ask for 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.400
 have common sense and think about every time 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.130
 breaking down barriers 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.310
 architectural is just a good sense that 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.730
 for 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:56.810
 to a person with disabilities living 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:59.530
 and have the greatest gift that it is to be 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.530
 autonomous 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.010
 I in the field of art with these 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.120
 symbols 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.819
 the forms that for me become 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.099
 alphabet the story various moods 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.720
 so these works are born which is a certain one 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:19.390
 sense carry 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.770
 the metaphysical message and a message 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:27.310
 starting from the forms of nature 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:30.630
 architecture rightly has its own 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:34.330
 principles moments where you must respect 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:38.320
 customer the long price etc instead 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.080
 art and freedom and together they me 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.230
 allow you to create a continuo 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.230
 equilibrium
