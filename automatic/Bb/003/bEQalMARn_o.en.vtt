absolutely mind-blowing you guys fought
too<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.340> I'll<00:00:17.970> be<00:00:18.300> reading<00:00:18.660> through<00:00:18.720> that

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
too and I'll be reading through that

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.779 
too and I'll be reading through that
video<00:00:19.109> so<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.289> figured<00:00:19.650> with<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.369> Minecraft

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
video so I figured with the Minecraft

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.849 
video so I figured with the Minecraft
Xbox<00:00:20.910> one<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.570> my<00:00:21.689> Tropius<00:00:22.140> ball<00:00:22.410> while<00:00:22.740> it's

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
Xbox one and my Tropius ball while it's

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.710 
Xbox one and my Tropius ball while it's
being<00:00:23.010> out<00:00:23.220> which<00:00:23.369> are<00:00:23.580> much<00:00:23.910> bigger<00:00:24.150> they

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
being out which are much bigger they

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.720 
being out which are much bigger they
film<00:00:24.900> 25<00:00:25.410> separate<00:00:25.769> maps<00:00:25.949> as<00:00:26.130> opposed<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.550> not

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
film 25 separate maps as opposed to not

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.880 
film 25 separate maps as opposed to not
even<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.970> full<00:00:27.240> map<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:28.170> they<00:00:28.320> do<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.769> know

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
even a full map that they do you know

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.380 
even a full map that they do you know
they're<00:00:29.039> fun<00:00:29.310> calculation<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.029> go<00:00:30.119> through

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
they're fun calculation to go through

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.120 
they're fun calculation to go through
and<00:00:30.630> work<00:00:30.900> out<00:00:31.140> just<00:00:31.170> how<00:00:31.500> many<00:00:31.590> diamonds<00:00:31.980> and

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
and work out just how many diamonds and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.670 
and work out just how many diamonds and
a<00:00:32.189> Minecraft<00:00:32.640> Xbox<00:00:32.759> one<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.390> minecraft<00:00:34.140> ps4

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
a Minecraft Xbox one and minecraft ps4

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.780 
a Minecraft Xbox one and minecraft ps4
world<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.010> that's<00:00:35.130> what<00:00:35.219> we<00:00:35.309> can<00:00:35.430> be<00:00:35.489> doing<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
world so that's what we can be doing to

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.190 
world so that's what we can be doing to
date<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.090> can't<00:00:36.239> be<00:00:36.300> going<00:00:36.390> further<00:00:36.690> maps<00:00:36.930> and

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
date we can't be going further maps and

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.690 
date we can't be going further maps and
I<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.380> be<00:00:37.440> showing<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.800> guys<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.280> insane

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
I can be showing you guys the insane

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.790 
I can be showing you guys the insane
calculations<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.600> actually<00:00:39.899> work<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.320> out<00:00:40.379> so

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
calculations to actually work it out so

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.229 
calculations to actually work it out so
you<00:00:40.860> can<00:00:41.040> follow<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.399> with<00:00:41.550> me<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.850> make<00:00:42.210> sure

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
you can follow it with me and make sure

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.030 
you can follow it with me and make sure
it's<00:00:42.510> correct<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.989> basically<00:00:43.620> let's<00:00:43.860> get<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
it's correct so basically let's get a

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.830 
it's correct so basically let's get a
start<00:00:44.340> then<00:00:44.520> shall<00:00:44.789> we<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.149> um<00:00:45.329> first<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.780> all

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
start then shall we so um first of all

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.299 
start then shall we so um first of all
we<00:00:45.960> need<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.230> work<00:00:46.350> out<00:00:46.559> how<00:00:46.590> many<00:00:46.770> domes<00:00:47.070> there

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
we need to work out how many domes there

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.100 
we need to work out how many domes there
are<00:00:47.430> per<00:00:47.610> chunks<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.719> number<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.960> times

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
are per chunks so the number of times

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.660 
are per chunks so the number of times
per<00:00:49.320> chunk<00:00:49.649> according<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.250> Minecraft

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
per chunk according to the Minecraft

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.479 
per chunk according to the Minecraft
Wiki<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.120> three<00:00:51.539> point<00:00:51.840> zero<00:00:51.899> nine<00:00:52.620> seven<00:00:52.649> so

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
Wiki is three point zero nine seven so

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.220 
Wiki is three point zero nine seven so
that's<00:00:54.030> about<00:00:54.300> as<00:00:54.449> accurate<00:00:54.600> numbers<00:00:55.020> we<00:00:55.110> can

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
that's about as accurate numbers we can

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.450 
that's about as accurate numbers we can
get<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.620> doesn't<00:00:55.890> mean<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.100> free<00:00:56.250> point

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
get that doesn't mean this free point

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.580 
get that doesn't mean this free point
nine<00:00:56.579> zero<00:00:56.789> nine<00:00:57.059> seven<00:00:57.239> per<00:00:57.719> every<00:00:58.020> chunk<00:00:58.230> but

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
nine zero nine seven per every chunk but

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.869 
nine zero nine seven per every chunk but
it<00:00:58.710> does<00:00:58.920> mean<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.430> average<00:00:59.760> you're

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
it does mean that on average you're

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.270 
it does mean that on average you're
gonna<00:01:00.000> get<00:01:00.149> free<00:01:00.480> point<00:01:00.899> one<00:01:01.440> essentially<00:01:02.129> at

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
gonna get free point one essentially at

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.130 
gonna get free point one essentially at
times<00:01:02.550> per<00:01:02.730> chucks<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.180> sometimes<00:01:03.930> well

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
times per chucks so sometimes well

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.570 
times per chucks so sometimes well
sometimes<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.710> have<00:01:04.799> zero<00:01:05.040> some<00:01:05.339> will<00:01:05.489> have

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
sometimes we have zero some will have

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.280 
sometimes we have zero some will have
free<00:01:05.790> point<00:01:06.000> zero<00:01:06.210> nine<00:01:06.390> seven<00:01:06.570> some<00:01:07.170> will

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
free point zero nine seven some will

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.020 
free point zero nine seven some will
have<00:01:07.409> ten<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.860> get<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> point<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:08.939> an

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
have ten you get the point it's just an

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.550 
have ten you get the point it's just an
average<00:01:09.150> game<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:09.869> free<00:01:10.080> point<00:01:10.290> zero<00:01:10.439> nine

seven<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.040> very<00:01:11.280> good<00:01:11.400> number<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.700> go<00:01:11.790> away

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
seven is a very good number to go away

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.690 
seven is a very good number to go away
now<00:01:12.180> how<00:01:12.390> big<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> chunk<00:01:13.290> because<00:01:13.530> if<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.490> if

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
now how big is a chunk because if I if

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.830 
now how big is a chunk because if I if
you<00:01:14.850> have<00:01:15.000> no<00:01:15.150> know<00:01:15.210> what<00:01:15.360> chunker's<00:01:15.689> then

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
you have no know what chunker's then

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.969 
you have no know what chunker's then
you're<00:01:15.960> probably<00:01:16.049> confused<00:01:16.290> by<00:01:16.710> other<00:01:16.830> things

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.679 
you're probably confused by other things
I'm<00:01:17.159> saying<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:17.820> chunk<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.270> sixteen<00:01:18.659> by

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
I'm saying but chunk is a sixteen by

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.570 
I'm saying but chunk is a sixteen by
sixteen<00:01:18.840> area<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.560> minecraft<00:01:19.770> uses<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.430> work

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
sixteen area that minecraft uses to work

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.609 
sixteen area that minecraft uses to work
out<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> lot<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.270> bits<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.600> know<00:01:21.689> stuff<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.049> it

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
out a lot of bits you know stuff like it

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.260 
out a lot of bits you know stuff like it
loads<00:01:22.770> giant<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.250> but<00:01:23.340> biomes<00:01:23.640> per<00:01:23.820> chunk<00:01:24.119> and

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
loads giant and but biomes per chunk and

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.700 
loads giant and but biomes per chunk and
whatnot<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.780> also<00:01:25.020> loads<00:01:25.259> multiplayer

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
whatnot and it also loads multiplayer

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.560 
whatnot and it also loads multiplayer
and<00:01:25.830> per<00:01:26.009> ton<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.490> your<00:01:26.580> saves<00:01:26.820> all<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.210> sort

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
and per ton and your saves all that sort

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.030 
and per ton and your saves all that sort
of<00:01:27.600> stuff<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.140> there's<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> reason<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.890> lot<00:01:28.979> of

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
of stuff so there's a reason a lot of

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.010 
of stuff so there's a reason a lot of
chunk<00:01:29.310> errors<00:01:29.549> happen<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.909> because<00:01:30.030> chunks

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
chunk errors happen is because chunks

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.170 
chunk errors happen is because chunks
are<00:01:31.140> sixteen<00:01:31.500> by<00:01:31.619> sixteen<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.369> every<00:01:32.610> 16<00:01:32.970> flock

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
are sixteen by sixteen so every 16 flock

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.030 
are sixteen by sixteen so every 16 flock
you<00:01:33.210> go<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.630> another<00:01:33.840> chunk<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.860> one

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
you go to another chunk so this is one

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.590 
you go to another chunk so this is one
chunk<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.700> another<00:01:35.970> chunk<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.540> on

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
chunk this is another chunk and so on

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.140 
chunk this is another chunk and so on
and<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:36.810> forth<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.860> regular<00:01:38.640> gameplay<00:01:38.790> doesn't

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
and so forth in regular gameplay doesn't

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.429 
and so forth in regular gameplay doesn't
come<00:01:39.240> up<00:01:39.329> too<00:01:39.479> often<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.320> know

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
come up too often but in the you know

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.960 
come up too often but in the you know
kind<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.710> breaking<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.040> down<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.400> does<00:01:41.759> so

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
kind of breaking it down it does so

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.880 
kind of breaking it down it does so
chunk<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.299> sixteen<00:01:42.720> by<00:01:42.840> sixteen<00:01:42.899> area<00:01:43.590> how

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
chunk is a sixteen by sixteen area how

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.289 
chunk is a sixteen by sixteen area how
many<00:01:44.040> chunks<00:01:44.280> are<00:01:44.460> there<00:01:44.610> per<00:01:44.759> well<00:01:44.939> banks<00:01:45.210> we

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
many chunks are there per well banks we

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.789 
many chunks are there per well banks we
know<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.540> free<00:01:45.720> point<00:01:45.930> zero<00:01:46.170> nine<00:01:46.320> seven<00:01:46.350> per

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
know that free point zero nine seven per

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.109 
know that free point zero nine seven per
chunk<00:01:47.100> but<00:01:47.250> how<00:01:47.399> many<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.640> these<00:01:47.700> chunks<00:01:47.909> are

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
chunk but how many of these chunks are

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.399 
chunk but how many of these chunks are
there<00:01:48.240> per<00:01:48.390> world<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.290> world<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:50.030> 5120<00:01:51.030> by

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
there per world so the world is 5120 by

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.780 
there per world so the world is 5120 by
5120<00:01:52.439> these<00:01:52.799> weights<00:01:53.100> prove<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.640> by

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
5120 these weights prove this is by

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.069 
5120 these weights prove this is by
going<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.090> one<00:01:54.180> of<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.360> edges<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.869> both

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
going to one of the edges in both

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.780 
going to one of the edges in both
directions<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.369> see<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.640> world

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
directions and you can see the world

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.760 
directions and you can see the world
goes<00:01:56.969> from<00:01:57.119> minus<00:01:57.299> two<00:01:57.659> five<00:01:57.899> sixty<00:01:58.350> to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
goes from minus two five sixty to

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.910 
goes from minus two five sixty to
positive<00:01:59.310> two<00:01:59.520> five<00:01:59.759> five<00:01:59.969> nine<00:02:00.240> or<00:02:00.920> 5120

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
positive two five five nine or 5120

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.130 
positive two five five nine or 5120
separate<00:02:02.430> blocks<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:02.880> each<00:02:03.270> direction<00:02:03.570> so

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
separate blocks in each direction so

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.859 
separate blocks in each direction so
it's<00:02:04.259> five<00:02:04.439> 120<00:02:05.009> by<00:02:05.159> five<00:02:05.549> 120<00:02:06.270> blocks<00:02:06.570> long

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
it's five 120 by five 120 blocks long

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.350 
it's five 120 by five 120 blocks long
now<00:02:07.409> we<00:02:07.469> need<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.950> divide<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.640> by<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.209> number

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
now we need to divide this by the number

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.760 
now we need to divide this by the number
of<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.989> blocks<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.470> chunkiness

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
of the blocks and the chunkiness

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.680 
of the blocks and the chunkiness
directions<00:02:11.220> or<00:02:11.489> sixteen<00:02:12.000> and<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.480> gives<00:02:12.629> you

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
directions or sixteen and that gives you

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.940 
directions or sixteen and that gives you
320<00:02:13.590> Chung

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
320 Chung

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.559 
320 Chung
next<00:02:14.160> direction<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:14.670> they're<00:02:14.819> going<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:15.390> way

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
next direction so they're going this way

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.720 
next direction so they're going this way
there's<00:02:15.959> 320<00:02:16.500> separate<00:02:17.129> chunks<00:02:17.310> til<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.640> hit

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
there's 320 separate chunks til you hit

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.430 
there's 320 separate chunks til you hit
the<00:02:17.879> edge<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.150> world<00:02:18.330> going<00:02:18.959> this<00:02:19.230> way

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
the edge of the world going this way

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.290 
the edge of the world going this way
there's<00:02:19.680> 320<00:02:20.099> separate<00:02:20.730> chunks<00:02:20.879> do<00:02:21.090> we<00:02:21.180> hit

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
there's 320 separate chunks do we hit

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.790 
there's 320 separate chunks do we hit
the<00:02:21.420> edge<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.690> world<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.260> now<00:02:22.440> we<00:02:22.500> know

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
the edge of the world so now we know

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.100 
the edge of the world so now we know
that<00:02:23.040> we<00:02:23.220> need<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.400> square<00:02:23.849> 420<00:02:24.599> because<00:02:24.930> it's

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
that we need to square 420 because it's

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.890 
that we need to square 420 because it's
free<00:02:25.319> 20<00:02:25.650> inch<00:02:25.800> direction<00:02:26.220> 320<00:02:26.760> by<00:02:26.879> 320<00:02:27.209> gives

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
free 20 inch direction 320 by 320 gives

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.570 
free 20 inch direction 320 by 320 gives
us<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.620> number<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:29.129> 100<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:31.069> 2400<00:02:32.069> chunks<00:02:32.430> in

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
us the number of 100 and 2400 chunks in

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.479 
us the number of 100 and 2400 chunks in
a<00:02:32.670> Minecraft<00:02:33.300> Xbox<00:02:33.450> one<00:02:34.080> or<00:02:34.230> ps4<00:02:34.560> 12<00:02:35.069> which<00:02:35.400> is

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
a Minecraft Xbox one or ps4 12 which is

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.460 
a Minecraft Xbox one or ps4 12 which is
absolutely<00:02:35.819> massive<00:02:36.239> by<00:02:36.750> itself<00:02:37.080> by<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.349> way

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
absolutely massive by itself by the way

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.630 
absolutely massive by itself by the way
like<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.620> chunk<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.040> pretty<00:02:38.340> big<00:02:38.519> amount

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
like a chunk is a pretty big amount

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.309 
like a chunk is a pretty big amount
there<00:02:38.940> like<00:02:39.120> look<00:02:39.269> at<00:02:39.360> this<00:02:39.480> space<00:02:39.959> head<00:02:40.170> it's

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
there like look at this space head it's

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.050 
there like look at this space head it's
all<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.500> way<00:02:40.560> from<00:02:40.830> down<00:02:41.280> wage<00:02:41.489> bedrock<00:02:41.880> all

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
all the way from down wage bedrock all

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.539 
all the way from down wage bedrock all
the<00:02:42.209> way<00:02:42.299> up<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.630> sky<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.620> there's<00:02:44.040> 100

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
the way up to the sky and there's 100

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.000 
the way up to the sky and there's 100
and<00:02:44.840> 2400<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.930> these<00:02:45.989> in<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.530> world<00:02:46.739> which

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
and 2400 of these in the world which

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.009 
and 2400 of these in the world which
should<00:02:47.250> just<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.700> poor<00:02:48.150> support<00:02:48.360> per<00:02:48.690> second

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
should just a poor support per second

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.570 
should just a poor support per second
that's<00:02:49.110> enough<00:02:49.380> mass<00:02:49.590> number<00:02:49.860> chunks<00:02:50.130> now<00:02:50.519> we

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
that's enough mass number chunks now we

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.800 
that's enough mass number chunks now we
know<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.880> number<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.120> chunks<00:02:51.299> to<00:02:51.480> wealth<00:02:51.660> oh

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
know the number of chunks to wealth oh

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.240 
know the number of chunks to wealth oh
we<00:02:51.989> can<00:02:52.170> multiply<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.590> by<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.920> number<00:02:53.040> of

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
we can multiply this by the number of

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.770 
we can multiply this by the number of
diamonds<00:02:53.610> but<00:02:53.760> chunk<00:02:54.030> which<00:02:54.180> is<00:02:54.329> free<00:02:54.510> point

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
diamonds but chunk which is free point

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.080 
diamonds but chunk which is free point
zero<00:02:54.989> nine<00:02:55.290> seven<00:02:55.530> so<00:02:56.099> if<00:02:56.489> we<00:02:56.700> multiply<00:02:57.030> this

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
zero nine seven so if we multiply this

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.880 
zero nine seven so if we multiply this
then<00:02:57.690> we're<00:02:57.810> gonna<00:02:57.900> get<00:02:58.110> roughly<00:02:58.530> three

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
then we're gonna get roughly three

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.500 
then we're gonna get roughly three
hundred<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.280> seventeen<00:02:59.640> thousand<00:03:00.120> one

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
hundred and seventeen thousand one

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.030 
hundred and seventeen thousand one
hundred<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.019> thirty<00:03:01.319> two<00:03:01.560> point<00:03:01.950> eight

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
hundred and thirty two point eight

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.309 
hundred and thirty two point eight
diamonds<00:03:02.640> per<00:03:02.849> world<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:03.450> obviously<00:03:03.959> this<00:03:04.140> can

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
diamonds per world so obviously this can

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.449 
diamonds per world so obviously this can
go<00:03:04.440> up<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.680> down<00:03:04.769> because<00:03:04.920> there's<00:03:05.220> a<00:03:05.280> little

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
go up and down because there's a little

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.699 
go up and down because there's a little
bit<00:03:05.579> of<00:03:05.610> randomness<00:03:05.790> determining<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.660> but<00:03:06.959> you

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
bit of randomness determining it but you

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.190 
bit of randomness determining it but you
can<00:03:07.860> you<00:03:08.099> know<00:03:08.130> roughly<00:03:08.549> assume<00:03:09.200> 317,000

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
can you know roughly assume 317,000

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.539 
can you know roughly assume 317,000
you're<00:03:10.319> gonna<00:03:10.410> come<00:03:10.620> pretty<00:03:10.950> close<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.400> that

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
you're gonna come pretty close to that

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.940 
you're gonna come pretty close to that
because<00:03:11.849> of<00:03:11.970> how<00:03:12.090> averages<00:03:12.569> works<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.079> roughly

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
because of how averages works so roughly

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.500 
because of how averages works so roughly
three<00:03:14.190> hundred<00:03:14.250> seventeen<00:03:14.790> thousand<00:03:15.239> blocks

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
three hundred seventeen thousand blocks

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.030 
three hundred seventeen thousand blocks
but<00:03:15.630> well<00:03:15.780> but<00:03:15.930> we<00:03:16.049> use<00:03:16.170> our<00:03:16.349> exact<00:03:16.680> number<00:03:16.980> to

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
but well but we use our exact number to

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.160 
but well but we use our exact number to
go<00:03:17.190> thurber<00:03:17.610> steps<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.120> now<00:03:18.569> once<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:18.900> there

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
go thurber steps so now once you there

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.720 
go thurber steps so now once you there
are<00:03:19.260> three<00:03:19.380> hundred<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.769> seventeen<00:03:20.100> thousand

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
are three hundred and seventeen thousand

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.129 
are three hundred and seventeen thousand
blocks<00:03:21.060> off<00:03:21.329> that<00:03:21.540> don't<00:03:21.810> go<00:03:21.930> I'm<00:03:22.049> gonna

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
blocks off that don't go I'm gonna

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.050 
blocks off that don't go I'm gonna
quickly<00:03:22.319> go<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.530> sleep<00:03:22.769> they<00:03:23.430> you<00:03:23.760> can<00:03:23.910> just

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
quickly go to sleep they you can just

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.370 
quickly go to sleep they you can just
mind<00:03:24.269> move<00:03:24.450> an<00:03:24.569> iron<00:03:24.780> pickaxe<00:03:25.019> right<00:03:25.230> down

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
mind move an iron pickaxe right down

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.020 
mind move an iron pickaxe right down
pickaxe<00:03:25.739> and<00:03:25.920> get<00:03:26.010> one<00:03:26.250> diamond<00:03:26.519> per<00:03:26.790> block

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
pickaxe and get one diamond per block

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.250 
pickaxe and get one diamond per block
which<00:03:27.180> give<00:03:27.480> you<00:03:27.600> that<00:03:27.780> many<00:03:28.019> diamonds

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
which give you that many diamonds

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.890 
which give you that many diamonds
however<00:03:29.010> if<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.670> were<00:03:29.819> then<00:03:30.120> use<00:03:30.329> a<00:03:30.359> fortune

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
however if you were then use a fortune

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.809 
however if you were then use a fortune
pickaxe<00:03:31.170> but<00:03:31.319> every<00:03:31.859> single<00:03:32.130> diamond<00:03:32.609> G<00:03:32.730> on

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
pickaxe but every single diamond G on

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.220 
pickaxe but every single diamond G on
the<00:03:32.910> world<00:03:33.090> if<00:03:33.209> you<00:03:33.299> somehow<00:03:33.569> managed<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.989> find

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
the world if you somehow managed to find

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.050 
the world if you somehow managed to find
them<00:03:34.380> all<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.739> then<00:03:35.100> use<00:03:35.280> a<00:03:35.340> fortune<00:03:35.790> free

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
them all and then use a fortune free

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.330 
them all and then use a fortune free
pickaxe<00:03:36.450> you<00:03:36.660> can<00:03:37.109> get<00:03:37.260> one<00:03:37.530> two<00:03:37.859> three<00:03:38.160> or

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
pickaxe you can get one two three or

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.949 
pickaxe you can get one two three or
four<00:03:38.579> diamonds<00:03:38.970> per<00:03:39.120> block<00:03:39.420> it<00:03:39.630> gives<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.870> an

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
four diamonds per block it gives you an

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.410 
four diamonds per block it gives you an
average<00:03:40.079> of<00:03:40.319> 2.2<00:03:40.920> though<00:03:41.100> however<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:41.730> it's

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
average of 2.2 though however so it's

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.699 
average of 2.2 though however so it's
very<00:03:42.569> one<00:03:42.690> point<00:03:42.930> yeah<00:03:43.260> two<00:03:43.410> point<00:03:43.620> two

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
very one point yeah two point two

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:44.870 
very one point yeah two point two
dollars<00:03:43.980> per<00:03:44.130> block<00:03:44.310> meaning<00:03:44.639> that<00:03:44.760> we

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
dollars per block meaning that we

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.460 
dollars per block meaning that we
multiply<00:03:45.239> our<00:03:45.389> previous<00:03:45.750> number<00:03:46.019> by<00:03:46.410> two

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
multiply our previous number by two

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.379 
multiply our previous number by two
point<00:03:47.010> two<00:03:47.220> so<00:03:47.579> a<00:03:47.609> three<00:03:48.030> hundred<00:03:48.150> and

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
point two so a three hundred and

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.569 
point two so a three hundred and
seventeen<00:03:49.049> thousand<00:03:49.590> one<00:03:50.160> hundred<00:03:50.280> thirty

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
seventeen thousand one hundred thirty

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.520 
seventeen thousand one hundred thirty
two<00:03:50.760> point<00:03:51.030> eight<00:03:51.120> times<00:03:51.450> by<00:03:51.930> two<00:03:51.989> point<00:03:52.410> so

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
two point eight times by two point so

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.590 
two point eight times by two point so
this<00:03:52.950> gives<00:03:53.250> us<00:03:53.430> six<00:03:53.730> hundred<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.180> ninety

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
this gives us six hundred and ninety

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.530 
this gives us six hundred and ninety
seven<00:03:55.109> thousand<00:03:55.980> six<00:03:56.430> hundred<00:03:56.639> and<00:03:57.000> ninety

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
seven thousand six hundred and ninety

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.870 
seven thousand six hundred and ninety
two<00:03:57.780> point<00:03:58.109> sixteen<00:03:58.680> Diamonds<00:03:59.250> potential<00:03:59.760> to

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
two point sixteen Diamonds potential to

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.599 
two point sixteen Diamonds potential to
be<00:03:59.970> mined<00:04:00.209> in<00:04:00.450> one<00:04:00.720> world<00:04:01.019> which<00:04:01.260> is

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
be mined in one world which is

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.220 
be mined in one world which is
absolutely<00:04:02.609> insane<00:04:02.819> this<00:04:03.450> absolutely<00:04:03.959> rare

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
absolutely insane this absolutely rare

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.930 
absolutely insane this absolutely rare
resource<00:04:04.620> which<00:04:04.829> you<00:04:05.010> probably<00:04:05.280> in<00:04:05.639> a

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
resource which you probably in a

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.430 
resource which you probably in a
survival<00:04:06.269> world<00:04:06.359> will<00:04:06.690> only<00:04:06.930> encounter<00:04:07.290> maybe

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
survival world will only encounter maybe

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.020 
survival world will only encounter maybe
a<00:04:07.530> hundred<00:04:07.769> off<00:04:08.040> yeah<00:04:08.579> if<00:04:08.790> you're<00:04:09.000> lucky

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
a hundred off yeah if you're lucky

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.670 
a hundred off yeah if you're lucky
you'll<00:04:09.480> get<00:04:09.630> close<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:10.049> a<00:04:10.109> thousand<00:04:10.560> if

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
you'll get close to a thousand if

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.440 
you'll get close to a thousand if
there's<00:04:11.069> lots<00:04:11.310> of<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.549> you<00:04:11.669> can<00:04:11.819> maybe<00:04:12.060> break

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
there's lots of you you can maybe break

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.300 
there's lots of you you can maybe break
into<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.989> ten<00:04:13.200> thousands<00:04:13.859> at<00:04:14.040> if<00:04:14.190> you're

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
into the ten thousands at if you're

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.589 
into the ten thousands at if you're
going<00:04:14.430> absolutely<00:04:14.669> crazy<00:04:14.910> of<00:04:15.180> diamond<00:04:15.389> mining

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
going absolutely crazy of diamond mining

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.800 
going absolutely crazy of diamond mining
there<00:04:15.900> is<00:04:16.019> almost<00:04:17.090> 700,000<00:04:18.090> potential<00:04:18.720> of

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
there is almost 700,000 potential of

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.050 
there is almost 700,000 potential of
these<00:04:18.959> not<00:04:19.620> including<00:04:20.130> jungle<00:04:20.430> temples<00:04:20.760> not

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
these not including jungle temples not

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.820 
these not including jungle temples not
including<00:04:21.539> desert<00:04:21.870> temples<00:04:22.200> just<00:04:22.440> be<00:04:22.530> found

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
including desert temples just be found

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.279 
including desert temples just be found
in<00:04:23.039> the<00:04:23.159> world<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:23.760> yeah<00:04:24.240> that's<00:04:24.479> that's<00:04:24.960> just

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
in the world so yeah that's that's just

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.810 
in the world so yeah that's that's just
ridiculous<00:04:25.770> right<00:04:26.010> there<00:04:26.220> but<00:04:26.370> how<00:04:26.490> you<00:04:26.700> know

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
ridiculous right there but how you know

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.590 
ridiculous right there but how you know
that's<00:04:26.970> some

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
that's some

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.480 
that's some
thousand<00:04:28.140> it's<00:04:28.260> not<00:04:28.440> really<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.710> big<00:04:29.340> enough

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
thousand it's not really a big enough

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.580 
thousand it's not really a big enough
number<00:04:29.700> to<00:04:30.060> really<00:04:30.420> work<00:04:30.660> out<00:04:30.870> by<00:04:30.990> itself<00:04:31.230> so

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
number to really work out by itself so

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.230 
number to really work out by itself so
what<00:04:31.680> I<00:04:31.740> decided<00:04:32.340> I<00:04:32.550> would<00:04:32.610> do<00:04:32.880> is<00:04:33.060> I<00:04:33.210> would

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
what I decided I would do is I would

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.240 
what I decided I would do is I would
take<00:04:33.600> this<00:04:33.810> number<00:04:34.080> of<00:04:34.170> diamonds<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.680> I<00:04:34.980> would

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
take this number of diamonds and I would

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.340 
take this number of diamonds and I would
put<00:04:35.730> them<00:04:35.880> in<00:04:36.090> chests<00:04:36.540> for<00:04:36.690> you<00:04:36.840> so<00:04:37.080> you<00:04:37.140> can

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
put them in chests for you so you can

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.750 
put them in chests for you so you can
get<00:04:37.530> a<00:04:37.560> feel<00:04:37.770> for<00:04:37.800> just<00:04:37.950> how<00:04:38.130> many<00:04:38.310> chests<00:04:38.670> it

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
get a feel for just how many chests it

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.730 
get a feel for just how many chests it
contains<00:04:39.090> so<00:04:39.360> each<00:04:39.930> of<00:04:39.990> these<00:04:40.230> chest<00:04:40.590> is

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
contains so each of these chest is

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.370 
contains so each of these chest is
filled<00:04:41.130> to<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.940> brim<00:04:42.090> with<00:04:42.270> diamond<00:04:42.960> blocks

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
filled to the brim with diamond blocks

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.620 
filled to the brim with diamond blocks
so<00:04:43.740> take<00:04:44.370> all<00:04:44.520> of<00:04:44.550> these<00:04:44.700> diamonds<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.360> pack

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
so take all of these diamonds to pack

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.480 
so take all of these diamonds to pack
them<00:04:45.840> into<00:04:45.990> blocks<00:04:46.380> of<00:04:46.560> nine<00:04:46.800> using<00:04:47.370> a

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
them into blocks of nine using a

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.160 
them into blocks of nine using a
crafting<00:04:47.820> table<00:04:47.970> turn<00:04:48.540> them<00:04:48.690> into<00:04:48.810> a<00:04:48.900> diamond

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
crafting table turn them into a diamond

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.720 
crafting table turn them into a diamond
block<00:04:49.470> like<00:04:49.770> so<00:04:50.100> actually<00:04:50.430> where<00:04:50.550> is<00:04:50.640> the

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
block like so actually where is the

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.310 
block like so actually where is the
diode<00:04:50.880> set<00:04:51.180> over<00:04:51.360> here<00:04:51.540> turn<00:04:51.900> into<00:04:52.140> a<00:04:52.170> diamond

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
diode set over here turn into a diamond

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.900 
diode set over here turn into a diamond
block<00:04:52.500> so<00:04:52.710> nine<00:04:52.950> diamonds<00:04:53.220> per<00:04:53.460> block<00:04:53.730> and

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
block so nine diamonds per block and

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.390 
block so nine diamonds per block and
then<00:04:54.120> stack<00:04:54.540> them<00:04:54.660> into<00:04:54.900> 64<00:04:55.530> stacks<00:04:55.860> and<00:04:56.040> then

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
then stack them into 64 stacks and then

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.660 
then stack them into 64 stacks and then
fill<00:04:56.640> a<00:04:56.670> chest<00:04:57.000> of<00:04:57.120> them<00:04:57.270> you<00:04:57.540> get<00:04:57.720> 22<00:04:58.670> separate

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
fill a chest of them you get 22 separate

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.820 
fill a chest of them you get 22 separate
filled<00:05:00.180> chests<00:05:00.900> that's<00:05:01.080> right<00:05:01.230> completely

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
filled chests that's right completely

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.670 
filled chests that's right completely
full<00:05:02.190> chests<00:05:02.730> of<00:05:03.240> diamond<00:05:03.690> blocks<00:05:04.080> which<00:05:04.470> is

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
full chests of diamond blocks which is

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.160 
full chests of diamond blocks which is
it's<00:05:05.580> ridiculous<00:05:06.090> to<00:05:06.180> even<00:05:06.210> think<00:05:06.690> about<00:05:06.810> when

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
it's ridiculous to even think about when

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.840 
it's ridiculous to even think about when
you<00:05:07.260> really<00:05:07.440> think<00:05:07.620> about<00:05:07.680> it<00:05:07.860> so<00:05:08.190> yet<00:05:08.340> 22

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
you really think about it so yet 22

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.970 
you really think about it so yet 22
entirely<00:05:09.840> full<00:05:10.080> Chester<00:05:10.350> blends<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:10.710> then

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
entirely full Chester blends and then

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.200 
entirely full Chester blends and then
you<00:05:11.160> get<00:05:11.310> a<00:05:11.340> little<00:05:11.580> bit<00:05:11.670> extra<00:05:11.700> because

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
you get a little bit extra because

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.820 
you get a little bit extra because
there's<00:05:12.360> 700,000<00:05:13.050> so<00:05:13.170> you<00:05:13.230> get<00:05:13.440> this<00:05:13.590> many

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
there's 700,000 so you get this many

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.060 
there's 700,000 so you get this many
also<00:05:14.190> so<00:05:14.460> yeah<00:05:15.030> that's<00:05:15.330> just<00:05:15.480> how<00:05:15.990> insane<00:05:16.470> the

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
also so yeah that's just how insane the

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.950 
also so yeah that's just how insane the
diamond<00:05:17.430> number<00:05:17.760> in<00:05:17.910> Minecraft<00:05:18.330> Xbox<00:05:18.390> one<00:05:18.750> and

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
diamond number in Minecraft Xbox one and

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.500 
diamond number in Minecraft Xbox one and
ps4<00:05:19.140> is<00:05:19.560> so<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:20.610> two<00:05:20.760> long<00:05:20.910> did<00:05:21.150> not<00:05:21.300> watch

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
ps4 is so the two long did not watch

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.730 
ps4 is so the two long did not watch

like oh wait I just zoned in you can get
22<00:05:24.960> and<00:05:25.200> 0.4<00:05:26.130> chests<00:05:26.610> full<00:05:26.790> of<00:05:26.940> diamond<00:05:27.540> blocks

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
22 and 0.4 chests full of diamond blocks

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.820 
22 and 0.4 chests full of diamond blocks
if<00:05:27.960> you<00:05:27.990> want<00:05:28.140> to<00:05:28.200> have<00:05:28.290> got<00:05:28.440> that<00:05:28.500> calculation

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
if you want to have got that calculation

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.470 
if you want to have got that calculation
you<00:05:29.130> take<00:05:29.430> number<00:05:29.640> of<00:05:29.700> diamonds<00:05:30.030> you<00:05:30.120> divide

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
you take number of diamonds you divide

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.540 
you take number of diamonds you divide
it<00:05:30.600> by<00:05:30.630> 9<00:05:30.960> you<00:05:31.020> divided<00:05:31.410> by<00:05:31.560> 64<00:05:32.070> for<00:05:32.310> the<00:05:32.370> number

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
it by 9 you divided by 64 for the number

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.160 
it by 9 you divided by 64 for the number
of<00:05:32.640> stacks<00:05:32.820> and<00:05:33.150> then<00:05:33.270> divided<00:05:33.480> by<00:05:33.510> 50<00:05:33.870> for<00:05:34.050> the

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
of stacks and then divided by 50 for the

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.500 
of stacks and then divided by 50 for the
number<00:05:34.410> of<00:05:34.500> slots<00:05:34.740> and<00:05:35.010> HS<00:05:35.370> and<00:05:35.580> yeah<00:05:36.210> that's

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
number of slots and HS and yeah that's

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.610 
number of slots and HS and yeah that's
my<00:05:37.470> mind<00:05:37.710> is<00:05:37.890> blown<00:05:38.100> hopefully<00:05:38.760> your<00:05:38.970> sister
