00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.910
 Seeing flight 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.890
 it has been cut short skyrim has 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.110
 squeezed everything offered by the new 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.029
 the elder scrolls if you are fond of 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.160
 the worlds that bethesda creates does not matter 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.080
 too much the answer sure you're 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.599
 interested in done garde the first 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.369
 expansion of your last rpg with certain 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.410
 delay for your translation we have 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.750
 finally this ambitious tlc in 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.090
 Castilian in our consoles and meets 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.000
 with what promised more hours more 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.000
 more skyrim scenarios and more box 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.150
 practically two campaigns in one that's 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.580
 the powerful offer of bethesda softworks 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.320
 with its expansion if we are those who 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.660
 they like to play again to check 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.400
 the effect of your decisions will suffice 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.470
 that we have a level 10 character 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.239
 so we can start the adventure and 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.250
 in doing so we will be immersed in a 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.229
 vampiric plague of epic proportions 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.240
 in which we can choose the side of 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.240
 the undead or that of their hunters 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.380
 although if we have to recommend a the 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.630
 to be a prince of darkness 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.130
 has more charm and interest in tongue 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.650
 art that of their hunters who give 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.450
 name to the expansion the reasons the 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.580
 history is better and we can also 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.440
 become a luck of the Lord of 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.970
 the darkness that leaves in diapers at 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.950
 that we saw in or biblion as to what 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.960
 being a vampire regards the 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.090
 humans have a good story arc and 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.979
 they offer a powerful weapon like the crossbow 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.780
 but the monstrous creatures of the 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.850
 night they have a fascinating argument to 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.409
 their backs and we will also have 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.020
 powers like a small army of 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.880
 bats the ability to float or the 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.880
 to carry out a brief teleportation 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.980
 in any case in both factions the 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.350
 new scenarios that we visit are 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.240
 fascinating and very varied adding 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.610
 still more sticks to the very complete 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.350
 couple of skyrim locations the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.790
 balance between the parties is again 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.710
 fantastic with the usual 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.930
 puzzle the sections of 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.820
 exploration and some fighting really 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.010
 great in what the points mean 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.090
 highlights of a very interesting expansion 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.090
 and quite unique 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.689
 that yes don gar also has problems and 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.400
 among them are a host of 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.650
 bugs and failures of all kinds of 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.609
 surprising frequency of agreement in 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.650
 that is karim was not a game 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:30.329
 precisely perfect in this sense 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.040
 but to the usual problems of 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.049
 clipping join here a whole series of 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.560
 incidents sometimes quite 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.560
 annoying 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.210
 that yes we must say that the palm is the 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.890
 it takes the comic absence of clothes in the 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.840
 characters or directly the 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.150
 invisibility of some enemies or 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.620
 even from the protagonist himself to these 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.690
 heights bethesda has not yet released 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.430
 a patch to correct these problems 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.430
 but they are expected to do so very soon 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.340
 if you've been wanting more 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.350
 skyrim don keep the perfect addition to 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.390
 despite its multiple box and problems 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.190
 it is a very complete release 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.110
 in terms of duration that has the 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.900
 extra attractive to be able to be a 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.190
 Vampire in the elder scrolls universe 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.530
 good scenarios that are completely 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.600
 new and two quite campaigns 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.220
 different in a must for the 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.220
 times rpg fans are
