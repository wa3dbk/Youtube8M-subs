00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.480
 city ​​suv such a complicated 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.490
 Wortkreation can actually only 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.280
 think of a marketing department 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.799
 in this case it was audi and 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.920
 they want the new q3 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.260
 characterize 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.029
 what that means first times is 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.619
 double inherit and city ​​is 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.689
 actually the same thing is happening 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.840
 So that's the name of the new little cow 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.119
 nesthäkchen city ​​suv but what is that 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.500
 a SUV is a fancy SUV 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.660
 and why had to go to the city 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.759
 right there is the problem with the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.320
 today's so-called suv drives anyway 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.660
 hardly anyone on the ground 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.370
 most are just going to town and 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.800
 that's what the offroad monsters are all about 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.140
 way too big so what is closer than 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.620
 shrink this segment and cars 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.539
 to build 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.940
 who climb at least every canstein 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.980
 audi has looked around the vw group 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.860
 and found the right kit 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.930
 he stands on the platform of vw tiguan 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.430
 just watch it, you actually do it 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.350
 not and the audi designers are too 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.539
 especially proud of him 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.430
 again missed an audi look 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.140
 only that is pretty nice now 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.810
 this is confusable only a q5 or 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.119
 the new q3 becomes clear 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.130
 when the lights are on then you can see 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.900
 that he is new to this 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.020
 confusion is the future 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.159
 Q3 customers probably hardly disturb the Q5 customers 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.290
 that could bother but he has 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.420
 bigger car and a gripe the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.460
 car fans say never change a 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.590
 winning design modern wins something 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.070
 so why should audi look like what 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.710
 to change 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.780
 Who picture somewhat surprising should 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.570
 prefer the chocolate of the same name 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.530
 shopping as a q3 audi is no 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.180
 risk 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.189
 the cow models are successful and 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.049
 that is why the smallest version should be synonymous 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.210
 do nothing differently than the predecessors 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.040
 even the interior appears immediately 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.350
 known even if everything is just one 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.210
 a bit smaller 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.340
 only when you get involved and through 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.020
 the first turns scratching is clear what 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.250
 audi with this new everything else 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.439
 wants to do as before 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.600
 the clearest difference between 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.060
 the youngest sprout and his 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.850
 older brothers can be clearly seen in the 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.430
 drive 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.799
 because this one has a very healthy measure 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.600
 not so hard that it hurts 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.700
 but rather so that it is fun 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.170
 it is tightly tuned is 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.660
 sparkling on the street 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.130
 he leads a bit to gas but 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.110
 you have to be careful here we are in 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.760
 switzerland and the Swiss are 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.790
 something meticulous that the tempolimit 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.870
 insofar as we have to hold back 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.819
 even if the good three are the same 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.350
 restrained one can do everything 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.540
 install what you also for the 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.280
 Big models gets the extra charge 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.110
 is almost infinite and all 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.480
 safety or driver assistance systems 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.220
 are just as available as leather luxury 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.230
 or lit pose boxes 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.300
 Of course, the small one will remain 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.290
 premium even if a shrinks bayer 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.000
 the q3 is the smallest in the world 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.940
 q family but he has one 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.560
 respectable trunk of the a4 avant 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.170
 level and that's because of it 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.420
 deep is the only hook unfortunately it is 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.010
 The loading edge is very high that is called 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.840
 must always over this barrier over 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.250
 if you want to load or unload something 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.830
 That's fine for the muscles though 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.470
 not very comfortable audio 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.760
 therefore a double loading floor can 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.299
 you put in there if you want the 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.400
 cloud though a bit 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.140
 trunk space volume but that opens up 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.239
 all the only thing you can do then 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.200
 still has to pay attention is that here the 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.739
 paint not scratched 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.299
 The marked decision is published 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.160
 But that is also the only job 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.630
 you have to be careful the little one can 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.850
 quite well through the mud 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.560
 he basically feels hunted 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.380
 even off tarred roads yet 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.019
 reasonably helps in our test car 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.640
 Of course, the quattro drive of the 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.859
 but not necessarily series 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.660
 There are also a number of front-wheel drive vehicles 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:41.140
 version first but only in connection 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.370
 with the smallest 140 ps diesel with us 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.290
 is indeed a four-cylinder diesel 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.920
 with two liters capacity under the hood 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:51.579
 but makes 177 ps with it goes in 8 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.130
 3 seconds on 100 topspeed are 212 and 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.019
 consumption is audi with 5 9 liters 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.090
 in the days of switzerland we are with it 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.799
 However, did not get along in everyday life 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.870
 will probably be a seven at most 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.459
 in front of the comma of the onboard computer 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.109
 who really just save fuel 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.510
 wants to be flatter anyway 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.910
 Car grab though audi very special 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.100
 proud of the cw-value of 0 13 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.010
 where is at least best in this 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:19.480
 the much bigger problem is the segment 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:22.510
 Price 29,900 euro costs the basic model 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:25.840
 there are 140 ps and front-wheel drive 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.390
 the allrad wants and a few extras 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.460
 put lands quickly at 40,000 euros 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.570
 our test car even has this brand 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.280
 very easily exceeded 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.320
 Bargain hunters will be somewhere else 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.170
 shopping or at first 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.790
 used to wait 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.890
 after the first drive with the q3 must 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.080
 you say audi has a really good one 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.630
 car put on four wheels 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.520
 calm city suv me personally 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.770
 I would still have a 1 4-liter gasoline engine 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.330
 wish the entry price the 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.550
 basic price a bit more 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.100
 depresses for the more spectacular 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.580
 want for audi has what in store 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.580
 you hear that way 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:11.560
 because this one has a five-cylinder 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:14.020
 turbo with 340 hp under the hood to 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.080
 we know the engine from the tt rs or the 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.570
 rs drives whether it is therefore a rs 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.229
 version for the q3 will be audi 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.840
 still open 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:26.910
 but who looks at this prototype 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.910
 and above all, it sounds 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.360
 he does not doubt that this 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.830
 version on the street comes like her 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.640
 then it will be called sooner 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.640
 incidental
