00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:09.100
 now let's make this complicity 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:14.040
 that has about half an inch of 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.040
 wide here we are going to remove this from here 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.210
 and we can and wet 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.840
 now we are going to roll 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.010
 Y 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:04.230
 in this case they are sheets of paper are 16 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.020
 leaves your paper 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:10.620
 the answers and together and I've cut the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.720
 bandages and well now I will see how it is 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.710
 I get this account on appointment I wish 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.710
 how nice 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.740
 let's see we put the rest here 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.050
 in the middle of the fingers and as always 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.210
 little by little and let dunking 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.650
 strips so that they fall 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.650
 top of each other so 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.060
 once 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.670
 we put a bit more resistol as 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.580
 we can see here does not have the 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:56.430
 enough and we need you to stay 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.430
 in the well- attached strips we put more 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.810
 we continue turning it around like this 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.189
 middle fingers 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.189
 so that we stay like this 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:12.790
 the chubby as straight as we can 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.410
 make the chubby like that and look there like 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.530
 can see we have a little door 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.340
 very pretty 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.500
 and I do not need much fix that we say 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.400
 where you cut the strips more or less well 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.510
 they stay like this 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.020
 very beautiful your accounts look at 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.910
 look 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.340
 forgiveness for the judgments of the gods 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.160
 but as you can see by reviewing records 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.120
 and I'm full of forgiveness that's why you look 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.020
 so let's put it and our toothpick 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.430
 teeth 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.159
 i 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.660
 we will remove the record of our 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:52.910
 fingers 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.790
 Of course you do not 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:00.890
 they get as dirty on my fingers as I 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:05.359
 sorry for that let's see how they can 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.880
 see the resistol is very east and 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.550
 then I have the 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.230
 bridge if you're a little dirty sorry 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:17.760
 that's why what happens is that james 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.760
 fatal in the turn 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.370
 Y 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.550
 what happens is that as I use a lot one does not 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.560
 wants to use expensive to love him so 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.380
 expensive I only need it to do 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.810
 the little fountains as you can see this 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.980
 It also serves what happens is that when 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.980
 you put very little 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.010
 if it stays dry it stays stuck in the 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.770
 hands feel substances stick to the 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:53.540
 source is obviously transformed into 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:56.599
 a good black color but then 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.640
 so little by little is being done 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.810
 black 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.910
 good 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.580
 and there, as you can see, they already have a 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.970
 against beautiful 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:12.330
 already as you can mold the 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:15.120
 precisely the best they can as well 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.430
 very nice already when they put the other 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.269
 layer when I put the last layer of 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.810
 record and well glossy should see well 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.810
 pretty 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.980
 and well that's what it looks like I hope that 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.120
 like 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.490
 look 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.020
