00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 a bit related to the subject already in 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.009
 this other part of the interview speaks 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.799
 of the presence that was a pain of 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.250
 head for him and he for the means of 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.250
 Hugo Sanchez 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.240
 yes 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.760
 today in the press there were many fights 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.580
 many bullshit and I did not know how to handle the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.640
 press is to say sometimes it hurts 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.440
 say it but I did not know to be a little more 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:34.530
 intelligent I be your job I had 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.300
 a supe handle not by certain people is 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.750
 conscious to people who are resentful 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.830
 who always talks more I do not like and a 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.489
 technical director in the selection that 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:46.110
 is in a place far up there is that 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.990
 handle it better and I handle it like a 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.940
 team to the press to the selection of 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.610
 always respect the players respect 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.690
 always because I think he called him 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.730
 one by one 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.640
 he invited them to agree they come all there 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.990
 one that comes to us in one is what you 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.970
 I said they were 23 the 23 well 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:11.030
 I never knew how to understand the press 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.330
 in service I became very much like the one 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.170
 does everything and did not accept the question or the 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.490
 criticism or I did not accept 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.920
 look and why he did not do this is good 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.470
 know well that ubeda also a 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.390
 pressure so we have to get to the insurance 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.799
 towards people we have to get to that 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.500
 place in a few days you will find it 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.920
 you will receive it in your house you will 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.920
 spend nothing 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.760
 for me it's an important match kicks off 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.860
 the championship 3 but I do not play anymore 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.290
 they told me and they play and like me 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.750
 that there is a rivalry there can not be 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.050
 reality but the players are the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.490
 kings who are going to do football or to 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.200
 wrong but there is one there is a reality 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.390
 ricardo then as I predicted it 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.730
 will sound morbid of the purchase of the purchase 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.100
 let's come let's put the cameras 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.570
 on that side opposite will be the 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.570
 game we are going to throw to the bench all 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.119
 time 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.240
 this in an effort that I do not believe that we 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.970
 let's look, do not think they'll say hello 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.210
 that has no problem for me 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.920
 it was a moment of discussion that there was in 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.730
 a moment he as a player I eat 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.310
 technical and maybe he is stronger in his 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.020
 way of thinking about your character and 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.680
 call that has lengthened what happened 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.680
 The Chau passed
