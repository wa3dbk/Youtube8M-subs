00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 
lights first of all I already said it

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.929 
lights first of all I already said it
before<00:06:27.319> really<00:06:27.739> you<00:06:28.039> didn't<00:06:28.219> watch<00:06:28.369> a<00:06:28.489> few<00:06:28.639> it

00:06:28.929 --> 00:06:28.939 
before really you didn't watch a few it

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:32.019 
before really you didn't watch a few it
said<00:06:29.269> that<00:06:29.419> it<00:06:29.599> was<00:06:29.949> there<00:06:30.949> the<00:06:31.249> energy-saving

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:32.029 
said that it was there the energy-saving

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:34.899 
said that it was there the energy-saving
ones<00:06:32.329> so<00:06:32.479> it<00:06:32.599> takes<00:06:32.779> a<00:06:32.809> while<00:06:32.899> to<00:06:32.959> like<00:06:33.909> get

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:34.909 
ones so it takes a while to like get
