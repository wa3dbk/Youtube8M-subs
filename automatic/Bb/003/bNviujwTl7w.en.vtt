holes in it right now he's putting a new
fender<00:00:28.320> on<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.580> when<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> whole<00:00:29.789> bunch<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.150> work

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
fender on it when a whole bunch of work

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.400 
fender on it when a whole bunch of work
to<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.779> race<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.019> start<00:00:31.230> next<00:00:31.439> week<00:00:33.410> it's

to it the race to start next week it's
got<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.649> mechanism<00:00:35.190> here<00:00:35.340> with<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.489> pin<00:00:35.989> when

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
got this mechanism here with a pin when

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.190 
got this mechanism here with a pin when
you<00:00:37.140> pull<00:00:37.350> out<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.770> pin<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:40.890> hatch<00:00:41.129> opens<00:00:42.200> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
you pull out the pin the hatch opens the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.819 
you pull out the pin the hatch opens the
drop<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:44.930> that's<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.110> function<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.680> goes

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
drop it that's the function it goes

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.400 
drop it that's the function it goes
right<00:00:47.129> there<00:00:47.539> it<00:00:48.539> here's<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.870> way<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.140> does

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
right there it here's the way it does

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.430 
right there it here's the way it does
the<00:00:49.590> function<00:00:53.690> that's<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.930> function<00:00:55.320> right

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
the function that's the function right

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.310 
the function that's the function right
there<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.770> pull<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.070> pin<00:00:56.250> out<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.989> that's<00:01:01.170> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
there you pull the pin out so that's the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.329 
there you pull the pin out so that's the
function<00:01:01.530> on<00:01:01.920> each<00:01:02.660> hole<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.500> center<00:01:04.979> has

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
function on each hole in the center has

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.560 
function on each hole in the center has
this<00:01:05.729> lever<00:01:06.619> that<00:01:07.619> holds<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.310> Douro<00:01:08.549> or<00:01:08.820> locks

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
this lever that holds the Douro or locks

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.590 
this lever that holds the Douro or locks
when<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:09.990> open<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.470> lever<00:01:11.060> all<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.119> traits

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
when you open the lever all the traits

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.020 
when you open the lever all the traits
open<00:01:13.610> that's<00:01:14.610> how<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.909> functions<00:01:15.390> right<00:01:15.540> there

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
open that's how it functions right there

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.730 
open that's how it functions right there
it's<00:01:18.030> all<00:01:18.180> aluminum<00:01:20.750> aluminum<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:22.110> got<00:01:22.320> 28

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
it's all aluminum aluminum it's got 28

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.840 
it's all aluminum aluminum it's got 28
holes<00:01:24.740> it's<00:01:25.740> got<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.009> bar<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.369> goes<00:01:26.549> across

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
holes it's got this bar that goes across

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.920 
holes it's got this bar that goes across
to<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.270> other<00:01:27.360> side<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:29.390> same<00:01:30.390> function<00:01:30.810> as

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
to the other side and same function as

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.270 
to the other side and same function as
well

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.670 

so<00:01:35.970> that's<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.660> function<00:01:36.900> right<00:01:37.290> here<00:01:37.500> that's

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
so that's the function right here that's

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.370 
so that's the function right here that's
the<00:01:39.140> how<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.260> opens<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.950> 28<00:01:41.670> holes<00:01:42.380> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the how it opens in the 28 holes the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.870 
the how it opens in the 28 holes the
water<00:01:43.620> runs<00:01:43.920> down<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.310> middle<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:49.670> it's<00:01:50.670> got

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
water runs down the middle and it's got

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.580 
water runs down the middle and it's got
several<00:01:51.300> things<00:01:51.480> here<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.870> water<00:01:52.050> trace<00:01:52.380> go

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
several things here the water trace go

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
gets hot so that's the trailer let me

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.500 
gets hot so that's the trailer let me
show<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.430> guys<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.790> other<00:02:20.910> accessories<00:02:21.270> to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
show you guys the other accessories to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.850 
show you guys the other accessories to
it<00:02:22.610> these<00:02:23.610> are<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.880> water<00:02:24.090> bends<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.860> think

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
it these are the water bends I think

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.720 
it these are the water bends I think
they're<00:02:26.010> solid<00:02:26.520> aluminum<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:28.730> they're

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
they're solid aluminum and they're

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.570 
they're solid aluminum and they're
linked<00:02:30.300> close<00:02:30.480> trailer<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.530> there's<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.280> hole

things you turn them it opens up you

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.759 
things you turn them it opens up you
close<00:03:15.780> them<00:03:15.989> up<00:03:16.700> so<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:17.730> stuff<00:03:18.620> that's<00:03:19.620> the

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769

way that works right there and in the

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.729 
way that works right there and in the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
once they're all inside you put a little

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.780 
once they're all inside you put a little
tie<00:03:29.040> strap<00:03:29.370> there

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
tie strap there

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.090 
tie strap there
Bosse<00:03:30.660> tie<00:03:30.840> strap<00:03:31.140> there<00:03:31.320> you<00:03:31.410> can<00:03:31.530> tie<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:31.860> rig

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
Bosse tie strap there you can tie it rig

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.430 
Bosse tie strap there you can tie it rig
it<00:03:32.160> right<00:03:32.220> here<00:03:32.780> so<00:03:33.780> these<00:03:33.900> are<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.200> Naples

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
it right here so these are the Naples

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.490 
it right here so these are the Naples
crates<00:03:34.920> there<00:03:35.130> should<00:03:35.310> be<00:03:35.400> I<00:03:35.430> think<00:03:35.670> 11<00:03:35.910> or<00:03:36.120> 10

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
crates there should be I think 11 or 10

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.470 
crates there should be I think 11 or 10
depending<00:03:37.500> on<00:03:37.860> who<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.070> driver<00:03:38.220> is

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.110 

so<00:03:42.319> these<00:03:42.440> are<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.650> Naples<00:03:42.830> crates<00:03:43.250> Naples

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
so these are the Naples crates Naples

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.400 
so these are the Naples crates Naples
size<00:03:44.270> 11<00:03:46.060> there's<00:03:47.060> 28<00:03:47.569> crates<00:03:47.930> so<00:03:48.050> each<00:03:48.170> Club

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
size 11 there's 28 crates so each Club

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.960 
size 11 there's 28 crates so each Club
has<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:48.709> corresponding<00:03:49.340> amount<00:03:49.519> of<00:03:49.670> crates

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
has the corresponding amount of crates

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.360 
has the corresponding amount of crates
that<00:03:50.030> they<00:03:50.209> need<00:03:50.950> these<00:03:51.950> are<00:03:52.099> the<00:03:52.190> Naples

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
that they need these are the Naples

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.949 
that they need these are the Naples

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
crates also everything's all aluminum so

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.860 
crates also everything's all aluminum so
they're<00:03:56.959> not<00:03:57.170> heavy<00:03:58.510> so<00:03:59.510> these<00:03:59.630> are<00:03:59.810> the

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
they're not heavy so these are the

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.370 
they're not heavy so these are the
crates<00:04:00.170> right<00:04:00.349> here<00:04:01.989> these<00:04:02.989> are<00:04:03.200> all<00:04:03.290> the

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
guess in the fender welds in the middle

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.780 
guess in the fender welds in the middle
or<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.450> fenders<00:04:11.870> ago<00:04:12.099> milk<00:04:13.099> crates<00:04:13.370> go<00:04:13.580> so
