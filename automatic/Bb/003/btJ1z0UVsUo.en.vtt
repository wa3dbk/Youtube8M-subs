goes in there and that enables the unit
let<00:00:56.690> me<00:00:56.750> see<00:00:56.870> if<00:00:56.960> I<00:00:57.020> can<00:00:57.170> get<00:00:57.230> a<00:00:57.290> close<00:00:57.530> up<00:00:57.560> here

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
let me see if I can get a close up here

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.280 
let me see if I can get a close up here
but<00:01:00.080> let's<00:01:00.920> see<00:01:01.040> that<00:01:01.450> allows<00:01:02.450> you<00:01:02.780> to<00:01:03.020> put

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
but let's see that allows you to put

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.789 
but let's see that allows you to put
your<00:01:03.440> sim<00:01:03.680> card<00:01:03.950> in<00:01:04.040> there<00:01:04.369> and<00:01:05.259> which<00:01:06.259> enables

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
your sim card in there and which enables

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.010 
your sim card in there and which enables
you<00:01:06.890> to<00:01:06.920> call<00:01:07.250> anywhere<00:01:07.759> where<00:01:08.540> you<00:01:08.689> can<00:01:08.840> get<00:01:08.960> a

quick real quick we'll go over the
indicators<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.900> flashing<00:03:23.290> green<00:03:23.590> light

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:23.949 
indicators this flashing green light

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:28.099 
indicators this flashing green light
flashes<00:03:24.729> more<00:03:24.909> quickly<00:03:25.180> when<00:03:25.689> the<00:03:25.810> unit<00:03:26.199> is

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
flashes more quickly when the unit is

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.089 
flashes more quickly when the unit is
trying<00:03:29.109> to<00:03:29.199> get<00:03:29.319> a<00:03:29.349> signal<00:03:29.560> trying<00:03:29.919> to<00:03:29.979> lock

onto<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.400> GSM<00:03:30.759> signal<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.780> when<00:03:31.900> it's

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
onto the GSM signal and when it's

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.409 
onto the GSM signal and when it's

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:34.419 
finally locked onto the signal then it

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:35.879 
finally locked onto the signal then it
blinks<00:03:34.720> more<00:03:34.870> slowly<00:03:35.139> that<00:03:35.379> means<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:35.739> can

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
blinks more slowly that means you can

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.289 
blinks more slowly that means you can
call<00:03:36.040> them<00:03:36.129> to<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.340> unit<00:03:36.639> start<00:03:36.879> monitoring

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:59.369 
probably too high you need to justice
sensitivity<00:03:57.489> turn<00:03:57.879> it<00:03:57.970> down<00:03:58.090> some<00:03:58.389> and<00:03:59.199> then

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
sensitivity turn it down some and then

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.990 
sensitivity turn it down some and then
of<00:03:59.590> course<00:03:59.620> like<00:03:59.979> I<00:04:00.040> mentioned<00:04:00.219> before<00:04:00.340> you

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
of course like I mentioned before you

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.050 
of course like I mentioned before you
have<00:04:01.479> your<00:04:01.859> reports<00:04:02.859> for<00:04:03.099> the<00:04:03.129> microphones

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
have your reports for the microphones

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.080 
have your reports for the microphones
and<00:04:04.359> you<00:04:05.019> have<00:04:05.229> your<00:04:05.469> report<00:04:05.829> on<00:04:06.189> the<00:04:06.280> side<00:04:06.519> for

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
and you have your report on the side for

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.939 
and you have your report on the side for
your<00:04:07.269> AC<00:04:07.509> adapter<00:04:08.109> stick<00:04:08.379> it<00:04:08.469> out<00:04:08.560> on<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.769> side

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
your AC adapter stick it out on the side

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:12.259 
your AC adapter stick it out on the side
over<00:04:08.979> there<00:04:09.370> right<00:04:09.699> here<00:04:10.259> okay<00:04:11.259> and<00:04:11.469> then

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
over there right here okay and then

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.860 
over there right here okay and then
basically<00:04:13.269> that's<00:04:13.810> about<00:04:14.079> it<00:04:14.109> you<00:04:15.599> you<00:04:16.599> plant

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
basically that's about it you you plant

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.040 
basically that's about it you you plant
the<00:04:16.989> unit<00:04:17.349> and<00:04:17.590> and<00:04:19.469> for<00:04:20.469> about<00:04:21.900> three<00:04:22.900> or<00:04:22.930> four

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
the unit and and for about three or four

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.990 
the unit and and for about three or four
days<00:04:23.199> I<00:04:23.530> think<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:23.919> can<00:04:24.130> you<00:04:24.340> can<00:04:24.520> use<00:04:24.849> the

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
days I think you can you can use the

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.180 
days I think you can you can use the
lithium<00:04:25.330> lithium<00:04:25.630> ion<00:04:26.289> battery

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190
