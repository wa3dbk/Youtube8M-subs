00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.549
 if cost and perhaps all of me yes corneas 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.250
 unleashed if these minecraft what disgust of 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.240
 rain 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.240
 at night 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.519
 please everything has to happen 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.690
 when he talks about is my good mother 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.160
 We are Friday if you know it touches 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.960
 tricks of agreement and good to tell you before 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.090
 to start this trick that for the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.439
 next week I will bring 10,000 and 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.119
 tricks of agreement tricks of the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.219
 little ones that for two seconds is worth 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.750
 10 voucher can bring long ago 

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:28.950
 delivered 10 tricks of those and play me 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.349
 Fancy it's worth and the wta you have 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.910
 enough pointed and good I have left 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.170
 still five tricks but I think 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.300
 that gives me time this week to find 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.460
 tricks of those little ones to be able 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.629
 display and well worth the today's 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.970
 I really think it's super curious 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.280
 because it 's like a house will come from a 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.130
 secret way is worth a trick so 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.630
 guaÃ­ba serves you for three servers 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.970
 It takes many things as you see the house 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.370
 it is aimed at the door where 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.920
 it has no doors no doors in 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.870
 These are the houses that I have made here and nothing you 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.739
 you go up here, everything you say 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.870
 low 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.880
 you get off just inside the house is 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.610
 as you go through the wall the doors 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:10.360
 with the main card and 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.850
 and hu is worth it super great 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.320
 wonderful is worth it and nothing we can do 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.330
 proof of how this is done is worth it because 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.170
 It also has its little logic 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.310
 this does not always work ok ok tell you 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.530
 that does not work with all the blocks 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.729
 ok not with the whole block is 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.140
 work with that stone from there by 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.570
 example has not worked for me but yes 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.040
 with all the woods with the watercress things 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.500
 it works with many kinds of blocks 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.540
 ok but not with all of them specifically 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.070
 let's take this one here for example and 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.729
 we are going to do a little house right here 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.440
 It's worth a shabby house worth but shabby 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.119
 valuable I do not want it to be anything of the other 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.119
 I need the world to be shabby 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.110
 with a cube of those disgusting 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.900
 very well 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.900
 we also break there 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.240
 great 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.240
 great 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.910
 very well it is also and there 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.890
 and now we see a text and ready is for 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.170
 what is good and good, because it is still survival 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.550
 so that on Sundays to break the 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.600
 door for example can also 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.300
 serve us for what 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.560
 I do not know on a server, you know that 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.620
 the doors work as the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.380
 it wins in agreement then in some way 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.240
 can you serve that new rafael for 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.550
 enter your house with a door worth 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.500
 you put a secret mechanism or what if x 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.350
 what you want you can invest this 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.150
 for any little thing it's worth getting 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.440
 and to our cube what we are going to generate 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.850
 it's a corner worth 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.700
 I'm going to do here in the corner as you see 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.420
 is about five hundred from the other world and I do 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.720
 it's easy we catch a king trail worth a 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.030
 rail and 90 is worth it and nothing we 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.860
 we put and we put the handle in agreement 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.260
 What I usually do is plug is so 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.530
 a little bit is worth the simple fact of 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.560
 please get it or I do not care 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.450
 I want to do so, well, it covered everything 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.819
 a little left him so that so 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:21.700
 a little bit better and take from here that 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.100
 is what we put a little bit I'm going to buy 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.120
 just a moment 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.040
 and here with our cube the subject behind 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.770
 so when a cube is worth 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:36.080
 prevent you from teleporting there another 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.080
 open cube animal 2 there well 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.860
 and another one 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.150
 well, it appears that all that 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.459
 area then all this we're going to 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.780
 Fill in the voucher it can happen that you have 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.819
 that having all this can happen 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.930
 it may not happen well you also see 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.310
 I'm inside I'm going to put it here 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.310
 I make light because it has not been a fuck 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.000
 I'm already inside as you can see I'm inside 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.000
 of the cube of agreement 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:12.590
 to leave all the same 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.209
 You see ready, what is it that can help us? 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.470
 pass what is happening to me that you 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.209
 it's taking out here before you go 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.940
 putting a bucket a bucket a bucket and you're done 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.100
 of agreement you see to teach us others 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.900
 models that are exactly the same look 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.670
 that this one here is exactly the same 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.880
 I'm going to remove these cubes 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.390
 and beige I appear fit from here not 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.970
 nothing happens 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.790
 a cube here and go is appearing in 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.180
 this next line such 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.520
 and added here ahead without problem you see 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.610
 so this did not work well here this 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.270
 let's try the time 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.270
 you see 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.569
 ah 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.610
 something stuck inside the tile did not 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:56.669
 He liked it maybe is what you see 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.710
 that does not work I do not know and what with this one 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.380
 needs to put in any cube and has 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.020
 worked perfectly you see with all 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.210
 the musicians here that happens gp and then 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.340
 of the output that goes out is the factor by 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.539
 dry and this is the trick today 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.949
 the truth that here seems very 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.020
 interesting is a small book by 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.419
 put it in shape and nothing if you like the 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.110
 light subscribe and nothing tomorrow better 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.110
 see you later
