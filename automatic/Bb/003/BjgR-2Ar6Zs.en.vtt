wasn't<00:00:20.670> going<00:00:21.060> low<00:00:21.390> enough<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:23.150> we<00:00:24.150> ran<00:00:24.330> under

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
wasn't going low enough so we ran under

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.790 
wasn't going low enough so we ran under
this<00:00:24.810> power<00:00:25.500> step<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:27.560> purchase<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.710> from

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
this power step and purchase it from

much<00:00:43.739> much<00:00:43.980> more<00:00:44.219> stable<00:00:44.520> than<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.180> stock<00:00:45.930> one

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.270 
much much more stable than the stock one
and<00:00:47.930> it<00:00:48.930> looks<00:00:49.079> pretty<00:00:49.230> trick<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.829> its<00:00:50.010> kind<00:00:50.219> of

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
and it looks pretty trick to its kind of

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.970 
and it looks pretty trick to its kind of
fun<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.670> pull<00:00:50.850> up<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.120> open<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.329> door

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
comes out but the stunt step was

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.759 
comes out but the stunt step was
actually<00:01:01.199> dangerous<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:03.530> especially<00:01:04.530> if<00:01:04.710> you

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
actually dangerous and especially if you

one<00:01:18.270> does<00:01:18.299> once<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:18.960> folded<00:01:19.619> up<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.810> you

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
one does once it's folded up and you

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.420 
one does once it's folded up and you
know<00:01:21.900> just<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.470> said<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.799> just<00:01:22.979> keep<00:01:23.130> toll

anyway<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:30.750> we<00:01:30.990> had<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.259> carry<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.710> little

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
anyway so we had to carry this little

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.819 
anyway so we had to carry this little
stool<00:01:32.340> around<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.939> order<00:01:33.210> for<00:01:33.390> Joyce<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.930> get

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
stool around in order for Joyce to get

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.649 
stool around in order for Joyce to get
up<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.670> out<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.939> van<00:01:36.119> which<00:01:36.420> was<00:01:36.450> a

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
up in in and out of the van which was a

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.830 
up in in and out of the van which was a
pain<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.470> know<00:01:37.560> sometimes<00:01:37.799> we<00:01:38.130> run<00:01:38.369> over<00:01:38.670> it

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
pain you know sometimes we run over it

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.450 
pain you know sometimes we run over it
sometimes<00:01:39.840> we<00:01:39.990> drive<00:01:40.590> off<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:40.890> leave<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.159> and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
sometimes we drive off and leave it and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.770 
sometimes we drive off and leave it and
so<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.820> well<00:01:42.119> mame<00:01:42.479> we<00:01:42.689> replace<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:44.780> anyway

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
so I well mame we replace and anyway

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.530 
so I well mame we replace and anyway
this<00:01:45.930> is<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.710> think<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.430> built<00:01:48.000> by<00:01:48.180> amp

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
this is a I think this built by amp

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.160 
this is a I think this built by amp
research<00:01:48.869> but<00:01:49.409> they<00:01:49.500> don't<00:01:49.710> build<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:51.170> power

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
research but they don't build a power

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.620 
research but they don't build a power
step<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.829> fit<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.040> van<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.240> has<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.540> be

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
step to fit a van so it has to be

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.630 
step to fit a van so it has to be
modified<00:01:54.810> some<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> brackets<00:01:55.829> FB<00:01:56.130> changed

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
modified some of the brackets FB changed

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.550 
modified some of the brackets FB changed
you<00:01:57.540> know<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.840> type<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.079> thing<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.409> it's<00:01:58.530> a

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
you know that type of thing so it's a

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.950 
you know that type of thing so it's a
little<00:01:58.680> bit<00:01:58.770> more<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.340> think<00:01:59.759> we<00:01:59.969> paid<00:02:00.270> some

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
little bit more I think we paid some

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.670 
little bit more I think we paid some
