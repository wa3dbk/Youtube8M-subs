that's an interesting thing to look at

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.320 
that's an interesting thing to look at
just<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:47.009> look<00:04:47.130> at<00:04:47.310> power<00:04:47.490> consumption<00:04:48.210> of

with<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.270> monitor<00:04:54.690> we're<00:04:55.319> using<00:04:55.560> 4.3<00:04:56.490> amps<00:04:56.849> at

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
with the monitor we're using 4.3 amps at

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.460 
with the monitor we're using 4.3 amps at
12<00:04:57.030> volts<00:04:57.479> so<00:04:57.599> I<00:04:57.630> have<00:04:57.810> this<00:04:57.960> hooked<00:04:58.169> up<00:04:58.289> in

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
12 volts so I have this hooked up in

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.920 
12 volts so I have this hooked up in
line<00:04:58.650> just<00:04:58.680> so<00:04:59.009> we<00:04:59.130> can<00:04:59.250> take<00:05:00.000> a<00:05:00.030> look<00:05:00.240> at<00:05:00.539> the

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
line just so we can take a look at the

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.240 
line just so we can take a look at the
power

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
power

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.730

another<00:05:03.030> thing<00:05:03.300> that's<00:05:03.449> that<00:05:04.440> you<00:05:04.590> should

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
another thing that's that you should

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.909 
another thing that's that you should
think<00:05:04.770> about<00:05:04.949> getting<00:05:05.370> that<00:05:05.569> will<00:05:06.569> make

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
think about getting that will make

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.110 
think about getting that will make
planning<00:05:07.919> your<00:05:08.039> install<00:05:08.340> easier<00:05:08.639> is<00:05:08.789> a<00:05:08.819> little

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
planning your install easier is a little

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.559 
planning your install easier is a little
power<00:05:09.810> brick<00:05:10.169> to<00:05:10.500> put<00:05:10.680> on<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:11.220> table<00:05:11.430> so<00:05:12.270> we

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
power brick to put on the table so we

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.240 
power brick to put on the table so we
have<00:05:12.840> a<00:05:12.870> 5<00:05:13.139> amp<00:05:13.319> brick<00:05:13.590> sitting<00:05:13.919> here<00:05:14.069> on<00:05:14.159> the

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
have a 5 amp brick sitting here on the

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.339 
have a 5 amp brick sitting here on the
table<00:05:14.449> that's<00:05:15.449> powering<00:05:15.750> this<00:05:15.960> whole<00:05:16.110> system

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
table that's powering this whole system

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.559 
table that's powering this whole system
as<00:05:16.740> you<00:05:17.610> can<00:05:17.759> see<00:05:17.880> we're<00:05:18.030> getting<00:05:18.150> really

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
as you can see we're getting really

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:20.899 
as you can see we're getting really
close<00:05:18.780> to<00:05:18.990> hitting<00:05:19.110> the<00:05:19.860> 5<00:05:20.069> amps<00:05:20.430> so<00:05:20.699> while

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
close to hitting the 5 amps so while

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:25.390 
close to hitting the 5 amps so while
we're<00:05:21.030> here<00:05:21.240> on<00:05:21.919> the<00:05:22.919> bench<00:05:23.930> consider<00:05:24.930> using

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
we're here on the bench consider using

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.070 
we're here on the bench consider using
the<00:05:26.400> bench<00:05:26.610> power<00:05:26.849> supply<00:05:27.000> for<00:05:27.360> the<00:05:27.599> Lily<00:05:27.810> but

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
just to offload that off the power

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.709 
just to offload that off the power
supply<00:05:29.759> because<00:05:30.120> we're<00:05:30.270> getting<00:05:30.479> ready<00:05:30.599> to

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 
supply because we're getting ready to

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:34.730 
supply because we're getting ready to
max<00:05:31.560> out<00:05:31.770> our<00:05:31.919> 5<00:05:32.099> amp<00:05:32.340> brick<00:05:32.820> and<00:05:33.469> anything<00:05:34.469> any
