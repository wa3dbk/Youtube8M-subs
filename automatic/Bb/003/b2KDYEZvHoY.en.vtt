00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
these things for every spark plug that

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.230 
these things for every spark plug that
sits<00:01:10.630> on<00:01:10.780> top<00:01:10.960> of<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.230> motor<00:01:11.940> you<00:01:12.940> can<00:01:13.060> see

sits on top of the motor you can see

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:21.480 
sits on top of the motor you can see
that<00:01:16.380> things<00:01:17.380> that<00:01:18.120> just<00:01:19.120> plug<00:01:19.990> to<00:01:20.200> it<00:01:20.490> these

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
that things that just plug to it these

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.280 
that things that just plug to it these
things<00:01:21.730> have<00:01:21.940> some<00:01:22.120> clips<00:01:22.480> on<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:22.780> bottom<00:01:23.170> of

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
things have some clips on the bottom of

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.900 
things have some clips on the bottom of
them<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.700> hold<00:01:25.510> them<00:01:25.690> on<00:01:25.870> but<00:01:26.700> these<00:01:27.700> things

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
them that hold them on but these things

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.120 
them that hold them on but these things
could<00:01:28.210> become<00:01:28.360> very<00:01:28.840> brittle<00:01:29.110> over<00:01:29.440> time<00:01:29.800> and

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
could become very brittle over time and

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.550 
could become very brittle over time and
I'd<00:01:30.220> broken<00:01:30.460> a<00:01:30.730> couple<00:01:30.940> of<00:01:31.240> them<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:32.320> first

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
I'd broken a couple of them the first

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.230 
I'd broken a couple of them the first
time<00:01:32.770> I<00:01:32.800> attempted<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:33.370> do<00:01:33.580> this<00:01:33.730> a<00:01:33.790> couple

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
time I attempted to do this a couple

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.780 
time I attempted to do this a couple
years<00:01:34.450> ago<00:01:34.630> so<00:01:35.020> I<00:01:35.260> had<00:01:35.500> to<00:01:35.710> tie<00:01:36.190> wrap<00:01:36.460> because

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
years ago so I had to tie wrap because

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.050 
years ago so I had to tie wrap because
they<00:01:36.880> kept<00:01:37.090> slipping<00:01:37.420> off<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.700> that's<00:01:39.850> kind

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
they kept slipping off and that's kind

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.400 
they kept slipping off and that's kind
of<00:01:40.090> a<00:01:40.240> bummer<00:01:40.390> when<00:01:40.720> you're<00:01:40.870> going<00:01:41.050> down<00:01:41.260> the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
of a bummer when you're going down the

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.950 
of a bummer when you're going down the
road<00:01:41.590> and<00:01:41.800> one<00:01:41.950> comes<00:01:42.220> off<00:01:42.430> and<00:01:42.730> thing<00:01:43.660> doesn't

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
road and one comes off and thing doesn't

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.480 
road and one comes off and thing doesn't
run<00:01:44.050> too<00:01:44.260> good<00:01:44.470> on<00:01:44.560> seven<00:01:44.980> and<00:01:45.100> six-cylinder

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
run too good on seven and six-cylinder

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.000 
run too good on seven and six-cylinder
so<00:01:46.260> I've<00:01:47.260> kind<00:01:47.530> of<00:01:47.560> had<00:01:47.740> to<00:01:47.860> Jimmy<00:01:48.100> rate<00:01:48.370> I

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
so I've kind of had to Jimmy rate I

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.530 
so I've kind of had to Jimmy rate I
tried<00:01:51.010> looking<00:01:51.190> for<00:01:51.370> them<00:01:51.700> clips<00:01:52.030> but<00:01:52.240> I<00:01:52.270> can't

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
tried looking for them clips but I can't

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.150 
tried looking for them clips but I can't
see<00:01:52.750> no<00:01:52.870> fine<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:53.140> mean<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.470> only<00:01:53.650> other<00:01:53.740> option

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
see no fine I mean the only other option

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.400 
see no fine I mean the only other option
I<00:01:54.940> would<00:01:55.000> have<00:01:55.240> is<00:01:55.420> to<00:01:55.450> put<00:01:55.750> replace<00:01:56.230> the

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
I would have is to put replace the

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.790 
I would have is to put replace the
harness<00:01:56.800> and<00:01:56.950> I'm<00:01:57.040> not<00:01:57.220> really<00:01:58.620> tempted<00:01:59.620> to<00:01:59.680> go

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
harness and I'm not really tempted to go

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.030 
harness and I'm not really tempted to go
through<00:02:00.070> that<00:02:00.280> so<00:02:01.470> there's<00:02:02.470> another<00:02:02.770> guy<00:02:03.010> that

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
through that so there's another guy that

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.820 
through that so there's another guy that
got<00:02:04.000> a<00:02:04.030> video<00:02:04.450> of<00:02:04.720> how<00:02:04.900> to<00:02:04.960> replace<00:02:05.320> a<00:02:05.380> spark

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
got a video of how to replace a spark

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:06.789 
got a video of how to replace a spark
plugs

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
plugs

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.390 
plugs
and<00:02:09.489> one<00:02:10.489> thing<00:02:10.700> I<00:02:10.849> noticed<00:02:10.879> that<00:02:11.360> he<00:02:11.540> did<00:02:11.720> do

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
and one thing I noticed that he did do

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.390 
and one thing I noticed that he did do
was<00:02:13.400> remove<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.970> fuel<00:02:14.180> pump<00:02:14.860> I'm<00:02:15.860> sorry<00:02:16.160> not

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
was remove the fuel pump I'm sorry not

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.589 
was remove the fuel pump I'm sorry not
the<00:02:16.430> fuel<00:02:16.670> pump<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.030> steering<00:02:17.420> power

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
the fuel pump the steering power

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.650 
the fuel pump the steering power
steering<00:02:18.110> pump<00:02:18.760> he<00:02:19.760> moved<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.120> out<00:02:20.209> of<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.480> way

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
steering pump he moved it out of the way

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.890 
steering pump he moved it out of the way
I<00:02:21.220> guess<00:02:22.220> he<00:02:22.550> was<00:02:22.700> following<00:02:23.060> some<00:02:23.390> directions

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
I guess he was following some directions

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.619 
I guess he was following some directions
that<00:02:24.049> I<00:02:24.110> haven't<00:02:24.560> heard<00:02:24.709> of<00:02:24.860> but<00:02:25.099> I<00:02:25.629> haven't

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.289 
that I haven't heard of but I haven't
had<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.870> move<00:02:27.019> it<00:02:27.760> all<00:02:28.760> I've<00:02:28.970> done<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.150> just

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
had to move it all I've done is just

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
for this car there's a couple checks

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.890 
for this car there's a couple checks
that<00:03:47.930> you<00:03:48.109> can<00:03:48.290> do<00:03:50.079> one<00:03:51.079> is<00:03:51.349> -<00:03:51.650> oh<00:03:52.569> man<00:03:53.569> out

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
that you can do one is - oh man out

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.339 
that you can do one is - oh man out
using<00:03:54.829> this<00:03:55.099> procedure<00:03:55.370> here<00:03:56.260> there's<00:03:57.260> a

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
using this procedure here there's a

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.539 
using this procedure here there's a
primary<00:03:57.709> and<00:03:58.250> a<00:03:58.340> secondary<00:03:59.620> the<00:04:00.620> primary<00:04:01.220> is

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
primary and a secondary the primary is

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.710 
primary and a secondary the primary is
just<00:04:02.590> open<00:04:03.590> these<00:04:03.709> two<00:04:04.090> connections<00:04:05.090> up<00:04:05.450> there

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
just open these two connections up there

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.449 
just open these two connections up there
and<00:04:06.079> the<00:04:06.919> secondary<00:04:07.519> is<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:09.769> positive<00:04:10.250> side

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
and the secondary is the positive side

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.000 
and the secondary is the positive side
of<00:04:10.489> this<00:04:10.910> connection<00:04:11.620> you<00:04:12.620> see<00:04:12.829> a<00:04:12.859> little

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
of this connection you see a little

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.249 
of this connection you see a little
b-plus<00:04:13.639> so<00:04:13.940> I<00:04:13.970> guess<00:04:14.329> the<00:04:14.690> right<00:04:15.229> side<00:04:15.709> is<00:04:16.130> the

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:17.259 
b-plus so I guess the right side is the

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:18.780 
b-plus so I guess the right side is the
positive

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
positive

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.870 
positive
and<00:04:19.120> then<00:04:19.510> your<00:04:19.750> negative<00:04:20.170> side<00:04:20.820> on<00:04:21.820> that

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
and then your negative side on that

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.870 
and then your negative side on that
spring<00:04:22.360> down<00:04:22.540> there<00:04:22.840> to<00:04:23.230> omit<00:04:23.530> out<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:27.610> that's

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
spring down there to omit out and that's

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.800 
spring down there to omit out and that's
see<00:04:29.070> what<00:04:30.070> I<00:04:30.100> don't<00:04:30.190> understand<00:04:30.880> is<00:04:31.270> what<00:04:31.660> it's

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
see what I don't understand is what it's

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:39.500 
see what I don't understand is what it's
showing<00:04:32.020> there<00:04:32.650> is<00:04:36.600> not<00:04:37.600> what's<00:04:37.840> listed<00:04:38.080> here

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
showing there is not what's listed here

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.900 
showing there is not what's listed here
point<00:04:40.510> 55<00:04:41.020> ohms<00:04:41.460> how<00:04:42.460> are<00:04:42.520> you<00:04:42.610> supposed<00:04:42.850> to

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
point 55 ohms how are you supposed to

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.380 
point 55 ohms how are you supposed to
show<00:04:43.120> 55<00:04:43.660> ohms<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:45.430> clearly<00:04:45.880> is<00:04:45.970> showing<00:04:46.330> a

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
show 55 ohms and clearly is showing a

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.150 
show 55 ohms and clearly is showing a
different<00:04:46.540> number<00:04:47.050> eight<00:04:47.590> point<00:04:47.920> one<00:04:48.280> four

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
different number eight point one four

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.980 
different number eight point one four
but<00:04:51.160> when<00:04:51.490> I<00:04:51.550> omit<00:04:51.910> out<00:04:52.090> I<00:04:52.120> do<00:04:52.360> get<00:04:52.600> eight<00:04:52.750> point

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
but when I omit out I do get eight point

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.140 
but when I omit out I do get eight point
one<00:04:53.050> four<00:04:53.440> that<00:04:53.650> way<00:04:53.830> so<00:04:53.890> I<00:04:54.330> guess<00:04:55.330> I'm<00:04:55.510> alright

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
one four that way so I guess I'm alright

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.610 
one four that way so I guess I'm alright
so<00:04:58.150> that's<00:04:58.330> when<00:04:58.480> I'm<00:04:58.600> doing<00:04:58.900> diagnosed<00:04:59.380> in<00:04:59.560> a
