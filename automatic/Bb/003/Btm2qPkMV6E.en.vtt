00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:09.350
 Hello everyone, I have an installation 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.350
 doors 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.650
 with hidden hinges one of the doors with 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.680
 three hidden loops now want 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:26.789
 tell about the nuances that arise in 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:31.349
 connection with this circumstance and how i 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:34.270
 figured out a way out 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.629
 since i'm trying now 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:42.030
 go to trim by patterns then 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:46.960
 there is a template set by depth 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.330
 here is the second pattern for the second part 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.290
 burial 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:01:00.690
 don't change on lean part and 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:04.780
 what's the trick when two loops here I have 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.799
 small dimensional template I'm its 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.070
 left 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:13.270
 open the door and set the pattern punched 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:17.520
 when I cut the second loop I set 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:22.299
 here is such a dimensional pattern and then already 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:26.670
 I put the template holder second place 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:31.630
 under the second loop to embed 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:35.230
 the third loop though she will be here at the top 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:40.720
 when he in a row put to the guest or 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:46.110
 as it is now fashionable in the middle you need something 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:48.810
 coming up with two options is the first is 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.860
 set the template cut the first loop 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.360
 then we put a small template 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:01.610
 some short 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:06.050
 if there are two Beijing graveyards above 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.420
 how short and after that still 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.870
 you will need one template that is, you need them 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.530
 there will be two very brief one another on 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.070
 length and 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.070
 and to cut here if 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.640
 middle loop 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.010
 then you can do with one short 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.630
 calculate it so that the loops are on 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:36.950
 equal distance 1 loop 2 loop 3 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:41.060
 loops in this case as agreed with 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.670
 I will place the customer according to GOST 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.400
 there are two loops at the top will and not 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.380
 make two patterns i made one and how 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.430
 I will go out of this situation that is, I 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.350
 I cut the loop I put my usual template 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.350
 I cut the bottom loop 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.620
 after that I am now bungled on 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:05.850
 a quick hand here is such a device I have it 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:08.340
 I attach the template 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.770
 and then rearranging it on this one 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:17.430
 place me and for it turns out around here 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:25.130
 That's the way I decided to get out of this 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:28.340
 situations from this problem now i'm hitting and 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.110
 I will try to remove what happened 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:36.380
 By the way , what's the moment right away 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:40.050
 I have a door now Peskovskaya she is 32 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:44.460
 millimeter thick and in order to 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:49.860
 then my template holder became on 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.790
 box and did not hold the seal or even 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.090
 are paid 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.900
 seals understand anyway on this 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.270
 the box will still have a quarter i 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.010
 for this once already put here I 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:07.230
 gasket I stuck 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.690
 screwed to the template paint holder 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.990
 tape and all I have it in women was 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.750
 worth on this order and willingly boxed 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:20.630
 I put that is at least on the box cat on 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.630
 here no matter the distance will be 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:33.199
 so here it turns out creativity is not 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.199
 sharpness is adjusted 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:30.810
 today have to work on the door without 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.810
 fence
