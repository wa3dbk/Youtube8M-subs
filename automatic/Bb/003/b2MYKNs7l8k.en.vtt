in Halo 3 I already showed you guys one
way<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:15.120> we<00:00:15.179> would<00:00:15.690> use<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.049> merge<00:00:16.260> objects

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
way that we would use to merge objects

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.300 
way that we would use to merge objects
back<00:00:17.039> in<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.250> day<00:00:17.400> um<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.930> kind<00:00:19.140> of

back in the day um and this is kind of

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.210 
back in the day um and this is kind of
the<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.340> main<00:00:21.150> way<00:00:21.539> once<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.619> trick<00:00:23.039> was

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
the the main way once this trick was

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.009 
the the main way once this trick was
figured<00:00:23.580> out<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.970> became<00:00:24.510> kind<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.869> main

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
figured out I became kind of the main

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.750 
figured out I became kind of the main
way<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.199> merging<00:00:25.859> objects<00:00:26.189> basically<00:00:26.609> what<00:00:26.730> it

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
way of merging objects basically what it

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.790 
way of merging objects basically what it
does<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.330> allows<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.050> have<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.199> no<00:00:28.439> clip

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
does is it allows you to have a no clip

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.310 
does is it allows you to have a no clip
or<00:00:29.039> phased<00:00:29.490> object<00:00:30.090> but<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:30.840> not<00:00:31.019> just<00:00:31.170> a

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
or phased object but it's not just a

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.010 
or phased object but it's not just a
simple<00:00:31.650> button<00:00:32.219> push<00:00:32.460> like<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.120> reach<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.840> Halo

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
staff or anything like that

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.500 
staff or anything like that
three<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:37.230> uh<00:01:37.260> just<00:01:38.190> since<00:01:38.640> i'm<00:01:38.850> doing<00:01:39.180> shown

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
three but uh just since i'm doing shown

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.600 
three but uh just since i'm doing shown
you<00:01:39.660> guys<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:40.020> knife<00:01:41.010> can<00:01:41.040> follow<00:01:41.340> with<00:01:41.490> that

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
you guys this knife can follow with that

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.100 
you guys this knife can follow with that
so<00:01:41.790> then<00:01:42.120> you're<00:01:42.300> going<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.510> turn<00:01:42.660> the<00:01:42.810> runtime

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
so then you're going to turn the runtime

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.710 
so then you're going to turn the runtime
minimum<00:01:43.560> up<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.980> three<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:45.420> going<00:01:45.630> to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
minimum up to three and it's going to

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.290 
minimum up to three and it's going to
spawn<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.440> and<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:47.520> basically<00:01:47.729> at<00:01:48.090> least

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
spawn this and it basically at least

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.540 
spawn this and it basically at least
this<00:01:48.630> little<00:01:48.960> clone<00:01:49.260> behind<00:01:50.010> and<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.400> will

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
this little clone behind and that will

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.550 
this little clone behind and that will
disappear<00:01:50.790> pretty<00:01:51.210> soon<00:01:51.540> then<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
disappear pretty soon then this is the

it's<00:02:22.860> just<00:02:23.780> you<00:02:24.780> know<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.170> that's<00:02:25.620> what<00:02:25.800> you'd

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
it's just you know and that's what you'd

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.740 
it's just you know and that's what you'd
have<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.100> do<00:02:26.280> every<00:02:26.730> single<00:02:26.970> object<00:02:27.300> so<00:02:27.690> you

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
have to do every single object so you

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.270 
have to do every single object so you
know<00:02:27.900> you're<00:02:28.110> building<00:02:28.380> map<00:02:28.560> with<00:02:28.770> hundreds

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
know you're building map with hundreds

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.680 
know you're building map with hundreds
and<00:02:29.430> hundreds<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.850> pieces<00:02:30.030> they<00:02:30.390> all<00:02:30.480> need<00:02:30.660> to

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
and hundreds of pieces they all need to

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.420 
and hundreds of pieces they all need to
be<00:02:30.810> merged<00:02:31.110> together<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.040> just<00:02:32.190> sit<00:02:32.370> here

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
be merged together and you just sit here

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.520 
be merged together and you just sit here
and<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.760> just<00:02:32.940> do<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.420> for<00:02:33.450> hours<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.350> hours

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
and you just do it for hours and hours

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.010 
and you just do it for hours and hours
each<00:02:35.040> piece<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:35.730> then<00:02:35.820> you<00:02:36.330> know<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.480> you

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
each piece and then you know and you

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.199 
each piece and then you know and you
can't<00:02:37.380> get<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:37.920> precisely<00:02:38.550> where<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.000> want<00:02:39.180> it

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
can't get it precisely where you want it

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.370 
can't get it precisely where you want it
you<00:02:39.360> think<00:02:39.570> you<00:02:39.660> got<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.900> where<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.200> want<00:02:40.230> it

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
you think you got it where you want it

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.199 
you think you got it where you want it
then<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:41.250> know<00:02:41.340> set<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.700> down<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:41.910> then

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
then you you know set it down and then

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.520 
then you you know set it down and then
you<00:02:42.299> realize<00:02:42.600> it's<00:02:42.810> not<00:02:42.870> quite<00:02:43.260> where<00:02:43.440> you

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
you realize it's not quite where you

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.979 
you realize it's not quite where you
want<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.769> like<00:02:44.040> oh<00:02:44.160> my<00:02:44.459> gosh<00:02:44.850> got<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.870> do<00:02:45.959> it

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
want to like oh my gosh got to do it

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.900 
want to like oh my gosh got to do it
again<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.590> now<00:02:46.890> I'd<00:02:47.070> actually<00:02:47.280> even<00:02:47.640> have<00:02:47.670> to

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
again and now I'd actually even have to

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.520 
again and now I'd actually even have to
start<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.239> new<00:02:48.269> round<00:02:48.570> even<00:02:48.900> believe<00:02:49.350> this

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
start a new round even believe this

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.490 
start a new round even believe this
piece<00:02:49.769> it<00:02:50.040> was<00:02:50.160> just<00:02:50.370> uh<00:02:50.640> is<00:02:50.970> crazy<00:02:51.900> man<00:02:52.170> so

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
when they added in phasing whatnot in

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.610 
when they added in phasing whatnot in
reach<00:02:56.100> that<00:02:56.400> was<00:02:56.580> those<00:02:56.910> huge<00:02:57.239> that<00:02:57.570> was<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.720> big

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
you guys a couple of maps that really

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.130 
you guys a couple of maps that really
use<00:03:04.560> ghost<00:03:05.400> merging<00:03:06.590> or<00:03:07.590> well<00:03:07.860> actually<00:03:08.130> I

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
use ghost merging or well actually I

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.289 
use ghost merging or well actually I
most<00:03:10.140> maps<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.620> see<00:03:10.799> in<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:11.040> game<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.489> that

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
most maps you see in this game I that

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.539 
most maps you see in this game I that
people<00:03:12.600> made<00:03:12.829> would<00:03:13.829> have<00:03:14.070> taken<00:03:14.310> advantage

people made would have taken advantage

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.479 
people made would have taken advantage
of<00:03:15.000> ghost<00:03:15.239> merging<00:03:15.600> most<00:03:15.810> like<00:03:16.489> nice-looking

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
of ghost merging most like nice-looking

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.240 
of ghost merging most like nice-looking
once<00:03:17.670> at<00:03:17.940> least<00:03:18.090> uh<00:03:18.709> but<00:03:19.709> i'm<00:03:19.890> going<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.100> show

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
you one of mine that took a long long

you one of mine that took a long long
time<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.620> make<00:03:22.799> because<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.400> all<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.730> ghost

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
time to make because of all the ghost

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.170 
time to make because of all the ghost
merging<00:03:24.209> we<00:03:24.299> had<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.510> do<00:03:25.250> alright<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:26.459> this<00:03:26.880> map

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
merging we had to do alright so this map

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.720 
merging we had to do alright so this map
is<00:03:27.450> called<00:03:28.049> geometric<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:29.100> it<00:03:29.190> was<00:03:29.280> forged<00:03:29.640> by

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
is called geometric and it was forged by

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.140 
is called geometric and it was forged by
myself<00:03:30.299> and<00:03:30.540> King<00:03:31.019> Arthur<00:03:31.380> 11<00:03:31.799> um<00:03:32.000> so<00:03:33.000> yeah

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.410 
that's how long I've been fortunate for
I<00:03:34.560> forged<00:03:34.950> with<00:03:35.160> King<00:03:35.519> Arthur<00:03:35.850> back<00:03:36.180> in<00:03:36.329> the

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
day you know round table and all that

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.479 
day you know round table and all that
but<00:03:39.180> actually<00:03:39.480> this<00:03:40.019> map<00:03:40.260> is<00:03:40.459> basically<00:03:41.459> just

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
but actually this map is basically just

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.760 
but actually this map is basically just
a<00:03:41.730> really<00:03:42.000> good<00:03:42.209> exam

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
a really good exam

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.800 
a really good exam

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
every single piece on this map was ghost

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.110 
every single piece on this map was ghost

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
he can start to appreciate this map of

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.710 
he can start to appreciate this map of
course<00:03:55.370> this<00:03:55.610> map<00:03:55.820> is<00:03:55.850> tiny<00:03:56.330> it's<00:03:56.570> this

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
course this map is tiny it's this

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.950 
course this map is tiny it's this
interior<00:03:57.140> space<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.880> it<00:03:59.000> was<00:03:59.120> actually<00:03:59.750> not<00:03:59.930> a

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
interior space and it was actually not a

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.170 
interior space and it was actually not a
good<00:04:00.650> choice<00:04:00.890> for<00:04:00.950> something<00:04:01.400> I<00:04:01.640> had<00:04:01.790> to<00:04:01.820> like

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
good choice for something I had to like

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.360 
good choice for something I had to like
film<00:04:02.600> because<00:04:03.140> it's<00:04:03.290> difficult<00:04:03.740> to<00:04:03.980> get<00:04:04.130> the

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
film because it's difficult to get the

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.220 
film because it's difficult to get the
the<00:04:04.610> camera<00:04:05.210> angles<00:04:05.540> and<00:04:05.660> whatnot<00:04:05.930> in<00:04:06.080> here

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
the camera angles and whatnot in here

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.020 
the camera angles and whatnot in here
but<00:04:06.440> uh<00:04:06.470> basically<00:04:07.130> the<00:04:07.310> whole<00:04:07.400> Maps<00:04:07.610> built<00:04:07.880> on

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
but uh basically the whole Maps built on

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.590 
but uh basically the whole Maps built on
a<00:04:08.740> 45-degree<00:04:09.740> slant<00:04:10.130> it's<00:04:10.700> kind<00:04:10.880> of<00:04:11.000> this

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
a 45-degree slant it's kind of this

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.360 
a 45-degree slant it's kind of this
leaning<00:04:12.080> tower<00:04:12.350> and<00:04:12.770> you're<00:04:12.890> on<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.100> inside

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
leaning tower and you're on the inside

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.340 
leaning tower and you're on the inside
it's<00:04:13.550> all<00:04:13.670> trippy<00:04:14.330> and<00:04:14.420> crazy<00:04:14.720> and<00:04:14.990> it<00:04:15.080> gives

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
it's all trippy and crazy and it gives

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.930 
it's all trippy and crazy and it gives
you<00:04:15.440> a<00:04:15.470> headache<00:04:15.560> on<00:04:15.950> that<00:04:16.100> but<00:04:16.610> basically

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
you a headache on that but basically

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.520 
you a headache on that but basically
it's<00:04:17.390> just<00:04:17.630> if<00:04:17.750> you<00:04:17.870> look<00:04:18.080> around<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.410> map

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
it's just if you look around the map

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.470 
it's just if you look around the map
everything<00:04:19.220> was<00:04:19.340> ghost<00:04:19.549> furnace<00:04:20.060> was<00:04:20.150> a<00:04:20.270> pain

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
everything was ghost furnace was a pain

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.450 
everything was ghost furnace was a pain
but<00:04:20.690> it<00:04:20.750> took<00:04:21.080> you<00:04:21.230> I<00:04:21.530> don't<00:04:22.040> know<00:04:22.130> it<00:04:22.340> took

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
but it took you I don't know it took

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.120 
but it took you I don't know it took
freaking<00:04:22.850> forever<00:04:23.000> to<00:04:23.330> me<00:04:23.530> and<00:04:24.530> actually

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
freaking forever to me and actually

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.590 
freaking forever to me and actually
there<00:04:25.520> was<00:04:25.640> another<00:04:25.880> method<00:04:26.270> it's<00:04:26.360> kind<00:04:26.480> of<00:04:26.510> a

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
there was another method it's kind of a

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.680 
there was another method it's kind of a
similar<00:04:26.810> concept<00:04:27.140> as<00:04:27.500> it<00:04:27.650> was<00:04:27.740> called<00:04:27.950> a

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
similar concept as it was called a

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.090 
similar concept as it was called a
Fugees<00:04:29.690> what<00:04:29.900> was<00:04:30.020> called<00:04:30.230> distortion<00:04:30.950> i

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
Fugees what was called distortion i

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.580 
Fugees what was called distortion i
believe<00:04:31.460> by<00:04:31.640> buddha<00:04:31.940> crank<00:04:32.210> um<00:04:32.390> and<00:04:33.290> that<00:04:33.470> was

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
believe by buddha crank um and that was

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.760 
believe by buddha crank um and that was
kind<00:04:33.830> of<00:04:33.860> another<00:04:34.190> really<00:04:34.580> trippy<00:04:35.030> crazy<00:04:35.770> math

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
kind of another really trippy crazy math

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.410 
kind of another really trippy crazy math
like<00:04:37.130> this<00:04:37.340> that<00:04:37.580> just<00:04:37.700> screwed<00:04:38.090> with<00:04:38.390> your

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
like this that just screwed with your

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
head but uh yeah so this map was it

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.630 
head but uh yeah so this map was it
wasn't<00:04:41.810> you<00:04:42.140> know<00:04:42.230> that<00:04:42.860> great<00:04:43.190> up<00:04:43.400> on<00:04:43.520> that

back before I was really putting much

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.630 
back before I was really putting much
design<00:04:52.910> thought<00:04:53.750> into<00:04:54.170> my<00:04:54.290> maps<00:04:54.530> but<00:04:55.100> anyways

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
design thought into my maps but anyways

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.280 
design thought into my maps but anyways
I<00:04:55.670> thought<00:04:56.120> you<00:04:56.210> guys<00:04:56.300> might<00:04:56.510> appreciate<00:04:56.660> that
