00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello today I present you the 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.629
 realization of guillaume have the body 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.300
 being able to jo superior balÃ©jou are 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.400
 in mahogany and I cut the blade in 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.400
 an old 25 mm wood chisel 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.649
 take the video I need you 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:34.839
 presents a little bit the geometry of the 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:37.579
 guillot the one-eyed soul 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:39.649
 guillaume is a plane that will come 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.019
 remove wood from the corners 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.420
 so here to be able to access the angels 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.420
 I'm going to have to have a blade that at the 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.059
 width of the body of the plane the front part 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.820
 and the back are maintained per stay 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.250
 here they are embedded in two 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:00.710
 rabbet I'm going to factories and everything to 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.900
 the hour at the saw then I lose 6.6 the 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.309
 hole for chip evacuation 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.640
 theory it's going really fast 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:11.000
 in practice I have been quite long 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:14.930
 since the setting of the iron is enough 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.750
 delicate a badly trimmed corner with a year 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.820
 which is not really well suited is going 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.250
 to bend in one direction or in 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.020
 the other the plane is impressive 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.890
 I did not believe and in fact it's really 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.070
 blatant so fitting the corner the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.690
 bearing surface of the blade are 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.740
 points that are quite important and 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.740
 that we must not neglect 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.240
 I said earlier the realization 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.070
 rabbets on each side of the plane 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.010
 is a bit of education lack of surface 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.120
 support to guarantee precisely support 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.160
 on each side of the blade I'm going 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.160
 to simply screw up a fall of war 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:49.950
 good it's transformed the rest of the handle 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.099
 in rap very solid law 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.660
 in my opinion will be impeccable to go 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.660
 in the small corners scrape the glue 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.709
 I am now preparing the wood for the 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.709
 achievement of both upper cheek 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.160
 for the collage uses again from the 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:24.090
 glue pu and I'm serving in two directions 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.700
 I press the cheeks on the body and I 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.810
 also press the whole on the 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.810
 reference of the workbench 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.950
 I'm already just delicately discovering the 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.950
 point that will come to fix the blade 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.810
 here is the realization of this little globe 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.720
 and finish the construction is enough 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.250
 simple but it requires little care 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.740
 delicate point for the realization of 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.630
 rabbets cutting the blade 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.490
 finally nothing insurmountable it works 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.770
 well we'll see in time how they 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.010
 evolve thanks again to you for me 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.010
 to follow
