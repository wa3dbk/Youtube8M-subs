00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
today we have a 95 Toyota four-runner

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.660 
today we have a 95 Toyota four-runner
with<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.099> leaky<00:00:08.700> valve<00:00:09.030> cover

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:54.830 

you<00:00:14.060> see<00:00:14.330> the<00:00:14.390> smoke

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.530 

so<00:00:55.350> we<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:55.800> two<00:00:56.160> valve<00:00:56.430> covers<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.970> remove<00:00:57.270> we

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
so we have two valve covers to remove we

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.500 
so we have two valve covers to remove we
have<00:00:57.720> this<00:00:57.960> one<00:00:58.580> which<00:00:59.580> is<00:00:59.790> the<00:00:59.910> driver<00:01:00.180> side

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
have this one which is the driver side

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.090 
have this one which is the driver side
and<00:01:02.899> then<00:01:03.170> we<00:01:03.290> have<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:03.739> passenger<00:01:04.339> side

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.840 

this<00:01:07.610> is<00:01:07.760> a<00:01:07.790> very<00:01:08.090> involved<00:01:08.510> job<00:01:09.580> you<00:01:10.580> must

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
this is a very involved job you must

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.969 
this is a very involved job you must
label<00:01:11.180> everything<00:01:11.900> as<00:01:12.020> you<00:01:12.170> take<00:01:12.380> them<00:01:12.560> off<00:01:12.740> it

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
label everything as you take them off it

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:25.819 
label everything as you take them off it
has<00:01:13.159> a<00:01:13.189> lot<00:01:13.490> of<00:01:13.520> vacuum<00:01:14.060> hoses

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.969 

most<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.579> vacuum<00:01:27.060> hose<00:01:27.329> are<00:01:27.979> emission

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
most of the vacuum hose are emission

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.069 
most of the vacuum hose are emission
related<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:29.939> very<00:01:30.210> important<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.840> they

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
related so it's very important that they

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.429 
related so it's very important that they
go<00:01:31.259> back<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.770> where<00:01:32.009> they<00:01:32.159> came<00:01:32.369> from
