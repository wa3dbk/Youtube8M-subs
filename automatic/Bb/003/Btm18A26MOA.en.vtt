one<00:00:19.859> ghost<00:00:20.699> was<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.060> dreadful<00:00:21.359> game<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:22.050> I'm

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
one ghost was a dreadful game and I'm

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.720 
one ghost was a dreadful game and I'm
really<00:00:22.949> really<00:00:23.130> looking<00:00:23.220> forward<00:00:23.699> to

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
really really looking forward to

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.910 
really really looking forward to
advanced<00:00:24.000> warfare<00:00:24.449> hopefully<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.740> game

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
advanced warfare hopefully the game

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.040 
advanced warfare hopefully the game
lives<00:00:26.250> up<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.400> its<00:00:26.609> expectations<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.539> course<00:00:27.750> I

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
lives up to its expectations of course I

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.870 
lives up to its expectations of course I
don't<00:00:28.650> think<00:00:29.070> they<00:00:29.279> can<00:00:29.340> actually<00:00:29.699> make<00:00:29.849> a

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
don't think they can actually make a

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.939 
don't think they can actually make a
game<00:00:30.300> worse<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.019> call<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.260> duty<00:00:31.470> ghosts<00:00:31.740> which

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
game worse and call of duty ghosts which

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.470 
game worse and call of duty ghosts which
is<00:00:32.099> lucky<00:00:32.250> for<00:00:32.369> them<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:33.180> know<00:00:33.239> they<00:00:33.270> don't

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
is lucky for them you know they don't

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.389 
is lucky for them you know they don't
really<00:00:33.719> have<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.020> don't<00:00:34.860> really<00:00:35.040> have<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.250> do

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
really have to don't really have to do

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.180 
really have to don't really have to do
much<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.730> make<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.880> decent<00:00:36.149> game<00:00:36.450> but<00:00:37.190> hopefully

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
much to make a decent game but hopefully

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.160 
much to make a decent game but hopefully
if<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.430> can<00:00:38.610> if<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:38.910> can<00:00:38.940> aim<00:00:39.300> if<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:39.989> aim<00:00:40.140> a

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
enough to play advanced warfare at

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.930 
enough to play advanced warfare at
eurogamer<00:01:00.930> which<00:01:01.289> was<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:02.550> basically<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
eurogamer which was it's basically the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.630 
eurogamer which was it's basically the
gamescom<00:01:03.650> equivalent<00:01:04.650> or<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.189> English

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
gamescom equivalent or the the English

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.450 
gamescom equivalent or the the English
equivalent<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.240> games<00:01:06.479> come<00:01:06.750> which<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.049> a

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
equivalent to games come which is a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.539 
equivalent to games come which is a
massive<00:01:08.460> German<00:01:08.939> game<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.630> expedition<00:01:10.170> and

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
massive German game and expedition and

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.730 
massive German game and expedition and
when<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.640> played<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.030> there<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.479> kind<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.530> felt

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
when we played it there I kind of felt

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.140 
when we played it there I kind of felt
like<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.979> game<00:01:14.189> or<00:01:14.430> advanced<00:01:14.670> warfare<00:01:15.000> as<00:01:15.090> a

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
like the game or advanced warfare as a

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.320 
like the game or advanced warfare as a
game<00:01:15.360> was<00:01:15.540> more<00:01:15.780> similar<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.610> to<00:01:17.610> black<00:01:17.850> ops<00:01:18.060> 2

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
game was more similar to to black ops 2

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.469 
game was more similar to to black ops 2
than<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.720> was<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:20.850> call<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.119> duty<00:01:21.270> ghosts

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
than it was to to call of duty ghosts

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.359 
than it was to to call of duty ghosts
right<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.900> figure<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.290> basically<00:01:23.070> start

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
right so I figure we basically start

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.950 
right so I figure we basically start
playing<00:01:23.580> some<00:01:23.790> some<00:01:24.240> black<00:01:24.420> ops<00:01:24.570> 2<00:01:24.689> again

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
playing some some black ops 2 again

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.870 
playing some some black ops 2 again
we're<00:01:25.590> gonna<00:01:25.680> get<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.009> get<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.549> way<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.700> how

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
we're gonna get in get in the way of how

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.550 
we're gonna get in get in the way of how
ecology<00:01:27.270> works<00:01:27.509> again<00:01:27.780> get<00:01:27.930> us<00:01:28.020> shot<00:01:28.200> back<00:01:28.380> on

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
ecology works again get us shot back on

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.590 
ecology works again get us shot back on
and<00:01:29.490> then<00:01:29.700> hopefully<00:01:29.939> that'll<00:01:30.180> make<00:01:30.329> us<00:01:30.390> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
and then hopefully that'll make us a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.800 
and then hopefully that'll make us a
bear<00:01:30.780> player<00:01:31.079> for<00:01:31.860> when<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.100> comes<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.720> to<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
bear player for when it comes to to the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.120 
bear player for when it comes to to the
time<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.200> advanced<00:01:34.470> warfare<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.860> released

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
time that advanced warfare is released

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.179 
time that advanced warfare is released
which<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.430> actually<00:01:35.579> 15<00:01:36.240> days<00:01:36.770> from<00:01:37.770> now<00:01:37.829> it's

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
which is actually 15 days from now it's

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.760

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.339 
excited to see how this exco exoskeleton
suit<00:04:52.070> works<00:04:52.250> because<00:04:52.639> I<00:04:52.820> I<00:04:53.300> kind<00:04:53.870> of<00:04:53.930> get<00:04:54.110> there

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
suit works because I I kind of get there

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.469 
suit works because I I kind of get there
the<00:04:54.680> feeling<00:04:55.070> like<00:04:55.280> they<00:04:56.090> could<00:04:56.270> add<00:04:56.449> more

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
the feeling like they could add more

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.240 
the feeling like they could add more
stuff<00:04:56.990> to<00:04:57.259> the<00:04:57.380> exoskeleton<00:04:57.979> suit<00:04:58.159> in

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
stuff to the exoskeleton suit in

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.310 
stuff to the exoskeleton suit in
advanced<00:04:58.460> warfare<00:04:58.820> I<00:04:58.909> think<00:04:59.120> if<00:04:59.570> they<00:04:59.780> do<00:04:59.840> that

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
advanced warfare I think if they do that

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.719 
advanced warfare I think if they do that
if<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:00.740> add<00:05:00.860> some<00:05:01.039> stuff<00:05:01.190> is<00:05:01.340> downloadable

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:01.729 
if the add some stuff is downloadable

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.060 
if the add some stuff is downloadable
content<00:05:02.000> is<00:05:02.419> gonna<00:05:02.630> be<00:05:02.840> it's<00:05:03.650> gonna<00:05:03.770> be<00:05:03.919> pretty
