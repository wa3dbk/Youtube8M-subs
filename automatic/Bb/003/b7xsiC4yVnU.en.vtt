00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello and welcome my name 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.899
 serious and now there is a short 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.349
 headset video and quarters offers her 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.049
 Fund xls is a new little went 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.429
 tells suitably for the xbox 360 me 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.080
 that part is unpacking you 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.850
 The subsequent look is so on 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:27.810
 and wish you now always 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:29.820
 have fun with the video ok and let 's go 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.070
 on the unboxing table we have that 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.540
 your fund xl but there are the rest 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.930
 also a variant for the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.070
 Playstation is called then but pl 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.170
 that surprised me a bit 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.120
 from 12 years the part is free 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.500
 I still have it on a headset 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.539
 not read where to look a bit 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.610
 behind it we see below 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.390
 this green box has the 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.250
 connectivity stereo headset 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.309
 So either you have the TV 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.899
 This TV audio out red and white cinch 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.670
 which see in the middle or maybe have 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.020
 her here for hdmi but adapter 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.340
 for the Xbox does not it definitely 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.250
 with you if you should have him 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.769
 great thing so here are the features 40 mm 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.890
 speaker noise isolated earpieces 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.049
 Highly sensitive microphone with flexible 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.470
 swivel arm the whole parts has one 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.869
 recommended retail price of 49 99 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.310
 will probably be in the next few days too 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.680
 be available to the german market and 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.689
 I cut someone the package now 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.979
 then we'll see what's in there, yes 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.420
 of course, we can already do with the price 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.850
 this is definitely a headset 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.790
 which is almost a beginner we 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.520
 Often know that many things 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.380
 with 100 150 euro so in the area 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.450
 actually are for gaming headsets 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.000
 the wireless variants of turtle beach 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.369
 with ex pay 30 642 for example the 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.649
 are very common and new here now 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.729
 even want a variant below 50 euros since 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.380
 I also often times 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.700
 demand what's good 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.790
 beginner headset and I thought 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.969
 I just look at the xl and 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.250
 here once with the manual 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.119
 So you basically need 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.770
 not really it relative 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.829
 self-explanatory here it does not exist 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.600
 much to do we have several controllers on 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.250
 headphones itself then maybe it is 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.360
 already interesting how is the whole 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.039
 Part is connected but actually 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.659
 also one 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.180
 simple story once we see 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:15.980
 stop the variation on the tv out that 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.109
 means he directs the sound quite normally 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.810
 to your and tv with components 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:24.170
 something is me and then the tv has it 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.120
 an audio on where then almost the issue 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.920
 as a headset over it or with second 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.689
 Variant with the xbox if you have one 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.420
 I should show you adapter 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:33.709
 again at the end of the videos yes here 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.760
 we see the whole part in the 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.049
 Close up here has such a swiveling 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.150
 mike stop I say now let's see 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.060
 These her cups are turning around like this 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.670
 a bit are also soft padded 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.680
 What I noticed positively is that 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.359
 headset had relatively high pages 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.430
 Print that means that is not now 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.950
 necessarily on top of a head on what 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.590
 we see microphone utah not here 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.269
 but the ears are pushing 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.129
 right and left against the ears though 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.659
 with the pleasant pressure and that's me 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.639
 Personally, for example, rather than when 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.260
 it can press on top of the head here 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:09.340
 We for example see the game and the 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.019
 chat volume can be separately on 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.489
 left side set so at the 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.799
 side was the microphone is you have 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.290
 actually all setting options 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.659
 mike new game volume chat volume 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.370
 you can stop variable ever 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:26.299
 after you like the whole thing right now 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.430
 requires the headset has it too 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.870
 about microphone monitoring that means in 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.180
 the moment he's in front of the microphone 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.159
 A little one is listening to you 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.560
 a bit as synonymous in the speaker itself 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:38.060
 Again, that's not how it is 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.769
 at very expensive headsets but at least 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.199
 For example, can you remember if you 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.579
 too much into the microphone 

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.169
 I should say now so if you 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.260
 that increased and then you get that 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:49.239
 also in the headset directly with so 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.810
 Now we see the one here 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.819
 Connection options is of course one 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.220
 rotten headset and the cable 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.439
 then split in two here, so to speak 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.780
 individual areas continue to be the first 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:02.000
 cable that's what's behind in the xbox 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.799
 pad exists and the second cable is made 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.500
 then almost from the end of a usb cable 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:09.409
 and a red and white cinch 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.849
 stereo plug and closes it 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.169
 whole on is actually a simple one 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.819
 So history either with the thing 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.349
 the tv I do not with me 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.329
 can show because I am here on the monitor 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.029
 games but I simply time the 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.900
 variant with the adapter thing I now 

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:23.720
 own 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.070
 You can also buy that as well 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.650
 I can not tell you right now 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.870
 what a device will cost so will be on 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.490
 every case over the hdmi cable 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.350
 connected and plugged in and then 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.289
 we on the other side has the 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.199
 both stereo variants and there are synonymous 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:41.000
 the sound at the same time out so hdmi 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:44.570
 just as now here the sound 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.330
 over the cinch cable so that's it now 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.380
 in the ground already the last thing we are missing 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.870
 we need a bit of electricity here 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.780
 so that the sound is simply amplified 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:57.229
 and we will get us by usb 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.000
 from our xbox if we still have it 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.800
 Of course, we also have to save 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.300
 connect the xbox pad that is this 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.570
 kabel eins shown the peace very briefly 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.180
 But so from the time this is 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.620
 all ready is just a stereo 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.940
 of course you can now headset from 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.220
 spatial did not sound quite that much 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.780
 expect as now with a simulated 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.840
 5.1 but basically it does 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.340
 of course, better sound or one 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.050
 better order than if you only now 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.380
 play on the monitor or on the tv 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.060
 would 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.250
 Of course you can not do that either 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.169
 make mistakes with the 49 euro headset 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.910
 now the absolute high end 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.919
 sound quality to be expected so it is 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.949
 whatever it is supposed to be, it is one 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.110
 beginner headset with microphone quality 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:37.849
 which is about the normal xbox microphone 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.610
 corresponds with a neat 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:42.320
 Processing with a cool look sitting 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.729
 pleasant I have the whole evening now 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.440
 so long played that has me so 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.720
 no annoying or disturbed and we 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.639
 when I had it on my ears from the 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.560
 location and spatial sound 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.039
 just stop at the expensive headsets 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.070
 not ran 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:57.020
 it offers a very loud what i say 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.300
 now on the total volume is 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.520
 absolutely sufficient if you look for 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.370
 a headset in the price range 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.050
 I should be interested in you then 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.419
 Just remember the turtle 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.010
 to compare beach x12 that is so 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.389
 were very small bit more expensive offers 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.490
 but also a bit 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.900
 more headset I'll post you the link 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.240
 to in the video description or 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.740
 you can click directly in the video then 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.510
 you have one in any case 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.270
 direct comparison between two 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:25.190
 beginner models of turtle beach and 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.260
 that's it with today 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.490
 video to xlr I hope it has you 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.000
 very little bit like I say 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.130
 in any case 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.750
 thanks for watching until next 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.560
 times 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.560
 and skin in
