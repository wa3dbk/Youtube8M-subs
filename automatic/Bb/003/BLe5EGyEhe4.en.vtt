things<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.740> think<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.860> should<00:02:05.009> check<00:02:05.160> it<00:02:05.310> out<00:02:05.430> I

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
things I think you should check it out I

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.880 
things I think you should check it out I
don't<00:02:05.729> have<00:02:05.940> a<00:02:05.970> look<00:02:06.500> now<00:02:07.500> for<00:02:07.710> something

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
don't have a look now for something

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.090 
don't have a look now for something
that's<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.429> little<00:02:08.550> more<00:02:08.899> destructive<00:02:09.979> we<00:02:10.979> can

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
that's a little more destructive we can

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.210 
that's a little more destructive we can
add<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:12.209> weather<00:02:12.450> model<00:02:13.380> now<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.070> isn't

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
add the weather model now this isn't

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.190 
add the weather model now this isn't
just<00:02:14.370> about<00:02:14.790> fluffing<00:02:15.420> up<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.690> rain<00:02:15.900> or

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
just about fluffing up the rain or

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.050 
just about fluffing up the rain or
making<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.590> snow<00:02:16.830> look<00:02:17.040> prettier<00:02:17.459> or

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
making the snow look prettier or

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.090 
making the snow look prettier or
anything<00:02:18.270> like<00:02:18.540> that

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
anything like that

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.640 
anything like that
this<00:02:20.100> is<00:02:20.400> about<00:02:20.670> making<00:02:21.410> extreme<00:02:22.410> weather

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
this is about making extreme weather

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.370 
this is about making extreme weather

conditions possible in the world of
Minecraft<00:02:26.570> mainly<00:02:27.570> it's<00:02:27.810> about<00:02:28.050> adding

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
Minecraft mainly it's about adding

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.270 
Minecraft mainly it's about adding
