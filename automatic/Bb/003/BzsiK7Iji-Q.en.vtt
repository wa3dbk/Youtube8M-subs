greenhouse<00:00:16.130> greenhouses<00:00:17.130> use<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:17.880> method

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
greenhouse greenhouses use this method

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.560 
greenhouse greenhouses use this method
and<00:00:18.630> they<00:00:18.720> have<00:00:18.869> an<00:00:18.960> 8<00:00:19.109> mil<00:00:19.350> deep<00:00:19.590> channel

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
and they have an 8 mil deep channel

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.370 
and they have an 8 mil deep channel
that's<00:00:21.570> generally<00:00:21.900> what<00:00:22.050> you'll<00:00:22.170> find

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
that's generally what you'll find

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.929 
that's generally what you'll find
maximum<00:00:23.010> you'll<00:00:23.130> get<00:00:23.279> 10<00:00:23.490> mil<00:00:23.670> these<00:00:23.850> are

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
maximum you'll get 10 mil these are

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.509 
maximum you'll get 10 mil these are
actually<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> 10<00:00:24.449> mil<00:00:24.660> channel<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.890> good<00:00:26.400> today

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
actually a 10 mil channel so good today

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.519 
actually a 10 mil channel so good today
we're<00:00:26.730> just<00:00:26.820> going<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.090> set<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.109> one<00:00:28.170> up<00:00:28.349> as

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
we're just going to set this one up as

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.839 
we're just going to set this one up as
an<00:00:28.650> example<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.220> we're<00:00:29.310> just<00:00:29.369> going<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.640> load

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
an example and we're just going to load

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.640 
an example and we're just going to load
some<00:00:29.880> weights<00:00:30.300> across<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.349> we'll<00:00:31.529> just

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
some weights across it and we'll just

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.290 
some weights across it and we'll just
see<00:00:31.800> how<00:00:31.830> much<00:00:32.160> weight<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.669> can<00:00:32.759> actually<00:00:33.059> take

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
see how much weight it can actually take

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.560 
see how much weight it can actually take
before<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.690> fails<00:00:35.059> also<00:00:36.059> we're<00:00:36.210> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> show

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
before it fails also we're going to show

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.030 
before it fails also we're going to show
you<00:00:36.630> our<00:00:37.610> script<00:00:38.610> blocking<00:00:38.940> method<00:00:39.890> which<00:00:40.890> we

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
you our script blocking method which we

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.350 
you our script blocking method which we
believe<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.640> strongest<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
believe to be the strongest on the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.389 
believe to be the strongest on the
Australian<00:00:42.780> market<00:00:42.930> will<00:00:43.680> also<00:00:44.010> load<00:00:44.219> this

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
Australian market will also load this

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.010 
Australian market will also load this
one<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.640> could<00:00:44.850> wait<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.210> well<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.660> we'll<00:00:45.840> just

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
one I could wait as well and we'll just

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.569 
one I could wait as well and we'll just
demonstrate<00:00:46.140> how<00:00:46.649> much<00:00:46.800> weight<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.190> one<00:00:47.399> can

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
demonstrate how much weight this one can

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.940 
demonstrate how much weight this one can
actually<00:00:47.700> take<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.750> just<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.320> show<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.590> here

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
actually take so just to show you here

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.180 
actually take so just to show you here
just<00:00:50.550> measure<00:00:50.760> it<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.000> which<00:00:51.180> between<00:00:52.190> panel

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
just measure it of which between panel

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.330 
just measure it of which between panel
so<00:00:53.340> that's<00:00:53.489> 720<00:00:54.149> y<00:00:54.890> okay<00:00:55.890> let's<00:00:56.129> see<00:00:56.250> how

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
so that's 720 y okay let's see how

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.029 
so that's 720 y okay let's see how
slightly<00:00:57.059> our<00:00:57.620> strip<00:00:58.620> block<00:00:58.770> method<00:00:59.329> also

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
slightly our strip block method also

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.460 
slightly our strip block method also
will<00:01:02.039> measure<00:01:02.219> between<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.840> dabei<00:01:03.840> here<00:01:04.199> on

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
will measure between the dabei here on

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.380 
will measure between the dabei here on
the<00:01:04.949> slaughter<00:01:05.430> channel<00:01:05.820> method<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.299> you'll

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the slaughter channel method and you'll

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.399 
the slaughter channel method and you'll
notice<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:06.920> say<00:01:07.920> 17<00:01:08.490> y<00:01:08.729> okay<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:09.750> today<00:01:10.140> we're

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
notice it's say 17 y okay so today we're

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.080 
notice it's say 17 y okay so today we're
going<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.740> load<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:10.950> some<00:01:11.250> weights<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.060> it

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
going to just load up some weights on it

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.520 
going to just load up some weights on it
and<00:01:12.390> we'll<00:01:12.510> see<00:01:12.659> how<00:01:12.750> much<00:01:12.869> weight<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.380> can

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
and we'll see how much weight it can

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.149 
and we'll see how much weight it can
actually<00:01:13.650> take

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.210 

I'm<00:01:18.610> gonna<00:01:18.729> start<00:01:19.030> with<00:01:19.150> some<00:01:19.210> 5qi<00:01:19.900> wait<00:01:20.189> okay

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
I'm gonna start with some 5qi wait okay

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:30.609 
I'm gonna start with some 5qi wait okay
so<00:01:21.880> just<00:01:22.119> lie<00:01:22.210> them<00:01:22.420> up<00:01:24.390> okay<00:01:25.500> five<00:01:26.500> kilos
