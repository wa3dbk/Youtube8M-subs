head<00:00:39.719> consider<00:00:40.290> yourself<00:00:40.770> lucky<00:00:40.950> because

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
head consider yourself lucky because

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.639 
head consider yourself lucky because
none<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.450> concerns<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:43.079> except<00:00:43.440> maybe

none of this concerns you except maybe

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.950 
none of this concerns you except maybe
to<00:00:43.800> poke<00:00:44.550> fun<00:00:44.789> at<00:00:44.850> those<00:00:45.059> who<00:00:45.300> make<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> big<00:00:45.780> deal

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
to poke fun at those who make a big deal

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.619 
to poke fun at those who make a big deal
out<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.250> also<00:00:47.730> not<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.090> generalize<00:00:48.600> but

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
out of it and also not to generalize but

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.110 
out of it and also not to generalize but
I<00:00:48.899> think<00:00:49.260> many<00:00:49.620> women<00:00:50.100> with<00:00:50.250> long<00:00:50.489> hair<00:00:50.760> can

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
I think many women with long hair can

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.420 
I think many women with long hair can
relate<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.559> fact<00:00:52.829> I've<00:00:53.129> seen

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
relate to this and in fact I've seen

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.479 
relate to this and in fact I've seen
some<00:00:53.760> solutions<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.539> problem<00:00:54.960> online

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
some solutions to this problem online

this towel but it's still protected but

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.619 
this towel but it's still protected but
a<00:01:01.230> more<00:01:01.469> practical<00:01:01.980> reason<00:01:02.160> for<00:01:02.579> concern<00:01:03.239> is

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
a more practical reason for concern is

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.960 
a more practical reason for concern is
for<00:01:04.019> people<00:01:04.199> who<00:01:04.470> need<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.710> fix<00:01:05.070> their<00:01:05.339> hair<00:01:05.580> to

do anything about it and accept that
your<00:01:43.580> hair<00:01:43.940> will<00:01:44.240> get<00:01:44.420> messed<00:01:44.660> up

number two change your haircut some

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.530 
number two change your haircut some
hairstyles<00:01:49.310> are<00:01:49.520> more<00:01:49.670> resistant<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.330> getting

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
hairstyles are more resistant to getting

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.109 
hairstyles are more resistant to getting
messed<00:01:50.930> up<00:01:51.200> for<00:01:51.500> example<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.670> comb<00:01:52.880> back

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
messed up for example the comb back

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.060 
messed up for example the comb back
hairstyle<00:01:53.690> is<00:01:53.840> already<00:01:54.110> compressed<00:01:54.470> anyway

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
hairstyle is already compressed anyway

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.850 
hairstyle is already compressed anyway
and<00:01:55.880> I<00:01:55.970> think<00:01:56.000> in<00:01:56.509> general<00:01:56.540> any<00:01:57.500> long

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
and I think in general any long

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.920 
and I think in general any long
hairstyle<00:01:58.490> would<00:01:58.729> work<00:01:58.970> too<00:01:59.210> unless<00:01:59.630> you<00:01:59.810> are

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
hairstyle would work too unless you are

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.859 
hairstyle would work too unless you are
going<00:02:00.110> for<00:02:00.440> a<00:02:00.470> puffed<00:02:01.160> up<00:02:01.420> full-bodied<00:02:02.420> glam

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
going for a puffed up full-bodied glam

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.499 
going for a puffed up full-bodied glam
