00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
this should be right there otherwise if

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.459 
this should be right there otherwise if
I<00:00:56.820> did<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.539> would<00:00:57.629> spawn<00:00:58.230> into

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
I did that then it would spawn into

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.779 
I did that then it would spawn into
something<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.280> didn't<00:00:59.460> want<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.760> to

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
exactly the same way that snow golems do

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.210 
exactly the same way that snow golems do

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
stone so don't even bother mining you

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.080 
stone so don't even bother mining you
got<00:02:52.139> this<00:02:52.290> down<00:02:52.680> it's<00:02:53.310> pretty<00:02:53.579> nice<00:02:53.819> it's

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
got this down it's pretty nice it's

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.479 
got this down it's pretty nice it's
pretty<00:02:54.329> sweet<00:02:54.629> but<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.620> do<00:02:55.769> actually<00:02:56.159> require

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
pretty sweet but you do actually require

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.009 
pretty sweet but you do actually require
a<00:02:56.519> bit<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.760> resources<00:02:57.359> to<00:02:57.480> make<00:02:57.659> them<00:02:57.840> because

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
a bit of resources to make them because

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.390 
a bit of resources to make them because
you<00:02:58.139> have<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.319> make<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.769> dispenser<00:02:59.250> and

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
you have to make it the dispenser and

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.280 
you have to make it the dispenser and
smooth<00:02:59.849> stone<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.329> can't<00:03:00.540> use<00:03:00.689> cobblestone

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
smooth stone you can't use cobblestone

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.649 
smooth stone you can't use cobblestone
so<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.280> guess<00:03:02.370> it's<00:03:02.549> kind<00:03:02.939> of<00:03:02.969> worth<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.359> but

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
so I guess it's kind of worth it but

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.509 
so I guess it's kind of worth it but
yeah<00:03:03.959> you<00:03:04.019> can<00:03:04.139> definitely<00:03:04.379> redstone<00:03:05.250> mine

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
yeah you can definitely redstone mine

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.879 
yeah you can definitely redstone mine
the<00:03:05.760> old<00:03:05.939> away<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.659> top<00:03:06.870> but<00:03:07.469> I<00:03:07.709> guess

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
the old away you to the top but I guess

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.399 
the old away you to the top but I guess
we<00:03:08.040> can<00:03:08.189> add<00:03:08.219> that<00:03:08.519> to<00:03:08.700> them<00:03:08.879> bugs<00:03:09.659> list<00:03:10.049> that

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
we can add that to them bugs list that

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.039 
we can add that to them bugs list that
sometimes<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.159> just<00:03:11.370> doesn't<00:03:11.639> do<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:12.689> if

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
sometimes it just doesn't do it so if

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.780 
sometimes it just doesn't do it so if
you<00:03:13.230> guys<00:03:13.379> can<00:03:13.620> find<00:03:13.799> out<00:03:13.950> why<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.370> didn't<00:03:14.730> do

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
you guys can find out why it didn't do

you guys can find out why it didn't do
it<00:03:14.939> or<00:03:15.120> maybe<00:03:15.389> you<00:03:15.540> guys<00:03:15.659> do<00:03:15.900> not<00:03:16.049> know<00:03:16.290> why<00:03:16.799> it

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
it or maybe you guys do not know why it

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.280 
it or maybe you guys do not know why it
doesn't<00:03:17.280> then<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:18.060> would<00:03:18.150> be<00:03:18.299> pretty<00:03:18.870> great

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
doesn't then that would be pretty great

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.869 
doesn't then that would be pretty great
