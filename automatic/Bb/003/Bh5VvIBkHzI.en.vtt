 I had the song a penalty 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.549
 for what has been 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.629
 just the sound 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.269
 the water Mill 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.239
 no not placed correctly 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.799
 all embraced by all respect but one flank players 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.189
 those are so good that just the best can decide but guys of course 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:52.659
 the first competition announcing the winner of this year the winner is coming in now 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.399

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.589
 a surprise which players 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:03.589
 but the two have not regretted a greater share in the victory 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.159

 yes 8 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:29.999
 so 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.520
 this is possible on all kinds of defenses 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.150
 a very big mistake just got in the way 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.150

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:13.749

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:16.749
 that button was 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:23.659
 everyone god no shelter in an attack 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:26.009
 researchers 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.789
 halfway with the ball 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:30.449
 the sports palace 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:31.520
 wooden class 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.969
 8 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:34.139

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.150
 this yields sustained 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.479
 this competition was really not normal for sporting telenet 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.240
 normal with this best technique 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.240
 wouter bos looks at the shooter it has been thought so far 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.629
 so it seems but this one drove in a tent or possibly
