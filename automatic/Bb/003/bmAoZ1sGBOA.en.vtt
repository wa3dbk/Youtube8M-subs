actually pretty cool because it's going

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.910 
actually pretty cool because it's going
to<00:00:29.550> reduce<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.150> lag<00:00:30.330> we<00:00:30.689> see<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.199> Minecraft

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920

Pocket Edition now they change the input

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.180 
Pocket Edition now they change the input
from<00:00:34.380> 20<00:00:34.980> FPS<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:36.239> 60<00:00:36.870> FPS<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.559> you're<00:00:37.920> not<00:00:38.010> be

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
from 20 FPS to 60 FPS so you're not be

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.770 
from 20 FPS to 60 FPS so you're not be
able<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.430> tell<00:00:38.520> by<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.700> video<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
able to tell by the video but to the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.750 
able to tell by the video but to the
gameplay<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.469> actually<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> bit<00:00:41.309> smoother<00:00:41.640> now

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
gameplay is actually a bit smoother now

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.330 
gameplay is actually a bit smoother now
I'm<00:00:41.969> not<00:00:42.329> noticing<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.050> with<00:00:43.260> my<00:00:43.410> eyes<00:00:43.440> but

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
I'm not noticing this with my eyes but

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.680 
I'm not noticing this with my eyes but
everyone's<00:00:44.700> saying<00:00:44.910> it's<00:00:45.120> smoother<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.660> I

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
everyone's saying it's smoother so I

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.240 
everyone's saying it's smoother so I
guess<00:00:46.170> I'll<00:00:46.320> just<00:00:46.350> go<00:00:46.559> along<00:00:46.710> with<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.980> ground

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
guess I'll just go along with the ground

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.250 
guess I'll just go along with the ground
but<00:00:47.370> we'll<00:00:47.520> see<00:00:47.700> how<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:47.910> goes<00:00:48.090> for<00:00:48.899> now<00:00:48.989> it's

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
but we'll see how that goes for now it's

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.900 
but we'll see how that goes for now it's
what<00:00:49.469> they<00:00:49.620> said<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.399> sounds<00:00:50.760> pretty

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910

of like Twitter but I'm he was basically
talking<00:01:44.159> about<00:01:44.549> zero<00:01:44.909> point<00:01:45.270> 12<00:01:45.570> point<00:01:45.930> O<00:01:46.100> more

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
talking about zero point 12 point O more

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.760 
talking about zero point 12 point O more
actually<00:01:47.939> called<00:01:48.270> zero<00:01:48.689> point<00:01:48.960> 12.1<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.680> you

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
actually called zero point 12.1 if you

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.530 
actually called zero point 12.1 if you
guys<00:01:49.890> haven't<00:01:50.100> noticed<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.970> called<00:01:51.240> zero

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
guys haven't noticed it is called zero

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.899 
guys haven't noticed it is called zero
point<00:01:51.780> 12.1<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.649> we<00:01:53.009> finally<00:01:53.549> have<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
point 12.1 and we finally have the

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.780 
point 12.1 and we finally have the
answer<00:01:54.299> as<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.750> why<00:01:54.960> that's<00:01:55.770> because<00:01:56.250> we're<00:01:56.759> a

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
answer as to why that's because we're a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.209 
answer as to why that's because we're a
little<00:01:57.149> bit<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.719> head<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.469> Windows<00:01:58.890> 10

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
little bit of a head of the Windows 10

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.160 
little bit of a head of the Windows 10
version<00:01:59.490> we<00:01:59.759> have<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.880> few<00:02:00.149> more<00:02:00.329> features<00:02:00.509> like

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
version we have a few more features like

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.410 
version we have a few more features like
enchanting<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.890> whatnot<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.280> we're<00:02:03.240> at<00:02:03.390> zero

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
enchanting and whatnot so we're at zero

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.160 
enchanting and whatnot so we're at zero
point<00:02:03.990> 12.1<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.100> Windows<00:02:05.939> 10<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.299> zero<00:02:06.810> point

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
point 12.1 and Windows 10 is zero point

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.770 
point 12.1 and Windows 10 is zero point
12<00:02:07.500> point<00:02:07.860> 0<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.459> order<00:02:08.849> for<00:02:09.000> us<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.360> get<00:02:09.750> a

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
12 point 0 so in order for us to get a

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.870 
12 point 0 so in order for us to get a
full<00:02:10.080> release<00:02:10.470> on<00:02:10.770> zero<00:02:11.069> point<00:02:11.370> 12.1<00:02:12.030> we<00:02:12.480> have

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
full release on zero point 12.1 we have

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.390 
full release on zero point 12.1 we have
wait<00:02:13.240> until<00:02:13.810> Windows<00:02:14.290> 10<00:02:14.650> is<00:02:14.680> fully

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
wait until Windows 10 is fully

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.580 
wait until Windows 10 is fully
compatible<00:02:15.880> so<00:02:16.330> not<00:02:16.510> only<00:02:16.690> do<00:02:16.960> we<00:02:17.110> have<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.470> get

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
all the bugs ironed out but we have to

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.540 
all the bugs ironed out but we have to
wait<00:02:19.420> for<00:02:19.630> Windows<00:02:20.140> 10<00:02:20.440> so<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.710> we<00:02:20.950> can<00:02:21.160> fully

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
wait for Windows 10 so that we can fully

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.370 
wait for Windows 10 so that we can fully
connect<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.090> each<00:02:22.210> other<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.600> it's<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.900> exact

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
connect to each other and it's the exact

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.690 
connect to each other and it's the exact
same<00:02:23.590> game<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:24.970> is<00:02:25.360> that<00:02:25.390> bad<00:02:26.050> news<00:02:26.350> I<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:27.400> it

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
same game so is that bad news I it it

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.300 
same game so is that bad news I it it
probably<00:02:28.210> is<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:28.960> could<00:02:29.350> be<00:02:29.590> I'm<00:02:29.740> not<00:02:29.920> saying

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
probably is it could be I'm not saying

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.370 
probably is it could be I'm not saying
anything<00:02:30.670> yet<00:02:31.000> but<00:02:31.180> I'm<00:02:31.510> not<00:02:31.840> too<00:02:32.050> sure<00:02:32.350> I

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
anything yet but I'm not too sure I

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.770

don't<00:02:32.680> have<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.460> Windows<00:02:33.940> 10<00:02:34.210> device<00:02:34.510> so<00:02:34.750> i

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
don't have a Windows 10 device so i

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.930

really don't know i may be getting one
in<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.120> future<00:02:37.240> but<00:02:37.540> that's<00:02:37.690> a<00:02:37.780> pretty<00:02:37.990> big

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
in the future but that's a pretty big

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.200 
in the future but that's a pretty big
investment<00:02:38.800> i'm<00:02:38.860> so<00:02:39.160> stuck<00:02:39.460> on<00:02:39.640> windows<00:02:40.030> 7

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210

myself but you guys have to let me know
what<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.460> think<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:42.910> also<00:02:43.390> it'll<00:02:43.870> mean<00:02:44.140> that

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
what you think and also it'll mean that

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.720 
what you think and also it'll mean that
you<00:02:44.410> can<00:02:44.590> play<00:02:44.830> with<00:02:44.980> anyone<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:45.400> uses<00:02:45.580> a

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
you can play with anyone that uses a

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.370 
you can play with anyone that uses a
Windows<00:02:46.120> 10<00:02:46.360> device<00:02:46.660> whether<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:47.170> be<00:02:47.350> a

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
Windows 10 device whether that be a

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.860 
Windows 10 device whether that be a
laptop<00:02:47.770> or<00:02:48.220> tablet<00:02:48.280> whatever<00:02:48.910> it<00:02:49.240> is<00:02:49.420> you'll

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
laptop or tablet whatever it is you'll

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.570

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
be able to play with them so that is one

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.010 
be able to play with them so that is one
of<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.760> benefits<00:02:52.150> but<00:02:52.390> honestly<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.900> think

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
of the benefits but honestly I think

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.020 
of the benefits but honestly I think
it's<00:02:53.470> just<00:02:53.560> going<00:02:53.920> to<00:02:54.040> delay<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.640> pocket

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
it's just going to delay the pocket

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.240 
it's just going to delay the pocket
edition<00:02:55.120> release<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.900> little<00:02:56.380> bit<00:02:56.650> longer<00:02:56.920> than

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
edition release a little bit longer than

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.980 
edition release a little bit longer than
we<00:02:57.370> all<00:02:57.550> would<00:02:57.700> like<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:58.240> don't<00:02:58.450> know<00:02:58.540> we'll

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
we all would like I don't know we'll

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.350 
we all would like I don't know we'll
find<00:02:59.290> out<00:02:59.470> as<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.710> time<00:03:00.340> comes<00:03:00.670> but<00:03:00.880> hopefully

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
find out as the time comes but hopefully

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.810 
find out as the time comes but hopefully
you<00:03:01.480> did<00:03:01.720> find<00:03:02.020> this<00:03:02.200> video<00:03:02.440> helpful<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:03.250> little

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
you did find this video helpful a little

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.720 
you did find this video helpful a little
bit<00:03:03.970> of<00:03:04.090> bad<00:03:04.390> news<00:03:04.420> but<00:03:04.690> i<00:03:05.440> think<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.340> update

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
bit of bad news but i think the update

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.020 
bit of bad news but i think the update
still<00:03:07.180> is<00:03:07.510> really<00:03:08.200> really<00:03:09.030> realistically

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
still is really really realistically

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.850 
still is really really realistically

going to come out in a few weeks I don't
doubt<00:03:12.070> it<00:03:12.130> so<00:03:12.430> hopefully<00:03:12.760> we<00:03:12.910> can<00:03:13.090> give<00:03:13.240> we<00:03:13.630> can
