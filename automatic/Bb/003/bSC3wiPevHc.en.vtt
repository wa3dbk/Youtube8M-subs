00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.440 

so<00:06:01.480> I<00:06:01.510> am<00:06:02.350> using<00:06:02.380> a<00:06:02.980> bamboo<00:06:03.220> steamer<00:06:03.550> so<00:06:04.330> I've

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 
so I am using a bamboo steamer so I've

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.360 
so I am using a bamboo steamer so I've
placed<00:06:04.600> a<00:06:04.960> parchment<00:06:05.470> paper<00:06:05.650> in<00:06:05.980> the<00:06:06.130> steams

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
placed a parchment paper in the steams

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.400 
placed a parchment paper in the steams
because<00:06:06.760> of<00:06:06.880> the<00:06:06.940> juices<00:06:07.150> the<00:06:07.330> steamer<00:06:08.260> will

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
because of the juices the steamer will

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.500 
because of the juices the steamer will
not<00:06:08.560> get<00:06:08.740> spoilt<00:06:09.010> so<00:06:09.130> I<00:06:09.160> use<00:06:09.370> this<00:06:09.640> paper<00:06:10.000> one

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
not get spoilt so I use this paper one

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.570 
not get spoilt so I use this paper one
by<00:06:10.690> one<00:06:10.900> we'll<00:06:11.140> be<00:06:11.170> keeping<00:06:11.530> our<00:06:11.800> mousse<00:06:12.220> in

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
by one we'll be keeping our mousse in

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.740 
by one we'll be keeping our mousse in
this<00:06:12.880> in<00:06:13.240> the<00:06:13.420> steamer<00:06:14.940> so<00:06:15.940> now<00:06:16.090> I'll<00:06:16.420> tell<00:06:16.720> you

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
this in the steamer so now I'll tell you

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.520 
this in the steamer so now I'll tell you
the<00:06:17.400> second<00:06:18.400> method<00:06:18.520> this<00:06:18.910> is<00:06:18.970> the<00:06:19.120> most

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
the second method this is the most

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.490 
the second method this is the most
common<00:06:20.530> shape<00:06:20.770> novels<00:06:21.580> the<00:06:22.150> spin<00:06:22.420> shoot<00:06:22.630> and<00:06:23.410> I

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
common shape novels the spin shoot and I

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.110 
common shape novels the spin shoot and I
think<00:06:23.710> this<00:06:23.830> is<00:06:23.980> the<00:06:24.070> easiest<00:06:24.430> one<00:06:24.820> to<00:06:25.750> make

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
think this is the easiest one to make

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.570 
think this is the easiest one to make
you<00:06:28.120> can<00:06:28.330> just<00:06:28.570> pinch<00:06:29.050> and<00:06:29.500> remove<00:06:29.740> the<00:06:29.950> excess

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
you can just pinch and remove the excess

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.770 
you can just pinch and remove the excess
metal<00:06:31.080> so<00:06:32.080> this<00:06:32.260> is<00:06:32.380> the<00:06:32.470> second<00:06:32.770> one<00:06:33.660> for<00:06:34.660> the

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
metal so this is the second one for the

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.620 
metal so this is the second one for the
third<00:06:35.020> one<00:06:35.260> pinch<00:06:36.010> the<00:06:36.640> opposite<00:06:37.390> sides

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:37.630 
third one pinch the opposite sides

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.600 
third one pinch the opposite sides
together<00:06:39.300> now<00:06:40.300> put<00:06:40.690> it<00:06:40.810> on<00:06:41.050> the<00:06:41.320> slab<00:06:41.590> and<00:06:41.950> get

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
together now put it on the slab and get

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.730 
together now put it on the slab and get
the<00:06:42.730> other<00:06:42.880> two<00:06:43.210> remaining<00:06:43.900> sides<00:06:44.170> are<00:06:44.500> just

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
the other two remaining sides are just

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.430 
the other two remaining sides are just
together<00:06:44.830> and<00:06:45.280> pinch<00:06:45.640> it<00:06:45.760> in<00:06:45.940> the<00:06:46.060> center<00:06:46.480> now

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
together and pinch it in the center now

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
close it nicely and here is our third

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.590 
close it nicely and here is our third
shape<00:06:58.200> so<00:06:59.200> the<00:06:59.590> last<00:06:59.800> one<00:07:00.040> is<00:07:00.250> my<00:07:00.580> favorite<00:07:01.030> for

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:01.600 
shape so the last one is my favorite for

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.880 
shape so the last one is my favorite for
this<00:07:01.900> just<00:07:02.740> fill<00:07:03.580> it<00:07:03.840> then<00:07:04.840> lift<00:07:05.290> to<00:07:05.440> close<00:07:05.680> it

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:05.890

this just fill it then lift to close it
close<00:07:06.790> all<00:07:07.030> the<00:07:07.150> ends<00:07:07.360> once<00:07:08.170> the<00:07:08.470> ends<00:07:09.100> are

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.190

close all the ends once the ends are
properly<00:07:09.490> flourished<00:07:10.000> you<00:07:10.720> just<00:07:10.870> have<00:07:10.990> to

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 
properly flourished you just have to

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.640 
properly flourished you just have to
join<00:07:12.010> the<00:07:12.190> tips<00:07:12.730> together<00:07:13.240> and<00:07:13.720> then<00:07:13.900> pinch<00:07:14.500> it

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:14.650

so<00:07:14.920> this<00:07:15.700> is<00:07:15.910> another<00:07:16.240> way<00:07:17.190> this<00:07:18.190> also<00:07:18.430> looks

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:18.669 
so this is another way this also looks

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:21.350 
so this is another way this also looks
pretty

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.840 

so<00:07:22.360> our<00:07:22.990> muumuus<00:07:23.500> are<00:07:23.740> also<00:07:23.919> ready<00:07:24.250> to<00:07:24.340> go<00:07:24.610> in

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:24.850 
so our muumuus are also ready to go in

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.530 
so our muumuus are also ready to go in

15 to 20 minutes I have taken a walk but

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.130 
15 to 20 minutes I have taken a walk but
not<00:07:38.650> required<00:07:39.220> like<00:07:39.550> you<00:07:39.640> can<00:07:39.790> take<00:07:39.970> any<00:07:40.360> big

you can take any other steamer also one
thing<00:07:45.580> to<00:07:45.700> be<00:07:45.790> kept<00:07:46.000> in<00:07:46.120> mind<00:07:46.150> while<00:07:46.570> selecting

thing to be kept in mind while selecting

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.690 
thing to be kept in mind while selecting
the<00:07:47.290> vessel<00:07:47.590> is<00:07:47.680> that<00:07:47.860> it<00:07:48.100> should<00:07:48.340> be<00:07:48.460> bigger

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:48.700 
the vessel is that it should be bigger

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.550 
the vessel is that it should be bigger
than<00:07:48.850> the<00:07:48.970> steamer<00:07:49.240> so<00:07:49.690> the<00:07:50.140> steam<00:07:50.380> doesn't

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 
than the steamer so the steam doesn't

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.800 
than the steamer so the steam doesn't
escape<00:07:51.010> the<00:07:51.820> water<00:07:52.000> dries<00:07:52.270> out<00:07:52.450> you<00:07:52.570> can<00:07:52.720> have

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:52.810 
escape the water dries out you can have

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.430 
escape the water dries out you can have
no<00:07:52.960> water<00:07:53.460> so<00:07:54.460> now<00:07:54.610> it's<00:07:54.850> been<00:07:55.060> 20<00:07:55.570> minutes<00:07:55.600> we

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.440 
no water so now it's been 20 minutes we

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.020 
no water so now it's been 20 minutes we
will<00:07:56.620> open<00:07:56.890> the<00:07:57.040> Momo's<00:07:57.340> and<00:07:57.580> see<00:07:57.700> how<00:07:57.880> it

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.030 
will open the Momo's and see how it

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.850 
will open the Momo's and see how it
looks<00:07:58.240> you<00:07:58.510> can<00:07:58.870> see<00:07:59.050> the<00:07:59.169> filling<00:07:59.500> in<00:07:59.590> from

00:07:59.850 --> 00:07:59.860 
looks you can see the filling in from

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.000 
looks you can see the filling in from
inside<00:08:00.070> slightly<00:08:00.850> it's<00:08:01.240> not<00:08:01.450> white<00:08:02.290> now<00:08:02.590> so<00:08:02.830> it

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.010 
inside slightly it's not white now so it

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:04.800 
inside slightly it's not white now so it
means<00:08:03.220> the<00:08:03.520> matter<00:08:03.700> is<00:08:03.880> not<00:08:04.000> drawn<00:08:04.300> at<00:08:04.600> this
