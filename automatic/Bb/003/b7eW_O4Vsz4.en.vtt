00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:11.790
 a murderous will from 1 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.969
 you wanted to say you knew one thing 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.350
 What people are late for what it is 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.650
 exactly 1 we could 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.650
 what do you think a bun 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.980
 No 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.540
 his shot over there on the other bank there 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.310
 I see people on the roof of a house 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.640
 give me the binoculars I want too 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.640
 they need something like that until now they are gone 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.580
 was there really a madness of jos 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.440
 the son met little man 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.330
 that was definitely a job 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.500
 do you think you have a sample estimate 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:16.060
 come organized 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:18.250
 mysterious do you mean the numbers have something 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.810
 to mean yes I think the Sagittarius 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.740
 I noticed when we clicked on this 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.740
 communicate something 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.860
 a secret code is what does it mean then 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.630
 as exactly three in each case need 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.490
 we inspector mediterranean well informed 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.900
 say I believe that the Sagittarius of 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.210
 abducted the other men and 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.020
 was forced to shit what to hold 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.760
 you from this theory inspector me 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.040
 have been in evidence for that 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.259
 weight was kidnapped and a fire 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.610
 was also reported but mister inspector 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.679
 they have not yet 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.350
 properly looked at the river below or 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.420
 in the river below or in the river below or 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.250
 Unfortunately today I see children here alone 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.050
 Most of my employees were 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.300
 Fired it is finally kidnapping 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.009
 Quiet I give this calculator ins 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.479
 fire this is a suggestion or 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.479
 Come on, give me that 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:30.650
 Sulfuric acid is an acid 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.069
 concentrated sulfuric acid not as 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:38.030
 here we have hydrochloric acid and me 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:41.150
 add a strip of magnesium to it 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:48.040
 immediate onset of gas evolution shows 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.040
 Again, the reaction is not very good 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:58.250
 the old one would be stupid and dream 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:01.959
 the ethic in the mist express the sell 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.959
 one calculator today 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.220
 I just do not get it natural 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.230
 not because it is not 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.489
 encrypted message is this 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.489
 calculator there is only someone 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:18.200
 thrown out properly thrown and you 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.790
 call me inspector with al 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.639
 gore me again during the 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.229
 wartime so nasty if this man 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.389
 really how you think about shitting 

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:28.099
 has been forced and a message 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:32.030
 wanted to leave something for you 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.349
 thanks for it for a ps3 after only 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.729
 one of his weekly purchases 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.359
 summed up and the comma 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.359
 to forget 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.560
 sutum is the river that sees from above 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.480
 Like a calculator, the flow 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:54.090
 how does traffic flow there is one 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:56.590
 saint means street 162 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.030
 I'm just admit and why must 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.680
 I rent a calculator and you 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.989
 drive through the area because we 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.180
 All fight through because of age 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.780
 detective or why does he have you? 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.780
 no car 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.220
 the lowered st 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.209
 in that you have one 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.260
 chance of survival 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.260
 that's what I'm saying 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:34.020
 So there is a curve that looks different 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.970
 it is not out of here 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.850
 and here it should not be too 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.800
 Not be 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.720
 we are also here unfortunately too 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.370
 After all, influence can not be precise 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.210
 how a calculator would look like 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.210
 something else 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:16.849
 I drove the whole street 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:18.939
 now has a more ss I know 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.939
 exactly 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.289
 ugh
