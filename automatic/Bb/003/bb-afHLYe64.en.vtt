first row is the most crucial to install

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.520 
first row is the most crucial to install
is<00:02:13.430> because<00:02:13.760> each<00:02:14.000> row<00:02:14.360> after<00:02:14.600> it<00:02:14.959> follows<00:02:15.380> the

is because each row after it follows the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
even a little bit all rows will be off
