look<00:04:31.750> at<00:04:31.840> the<00:04:31.900> recovery<00:04:32.290> honor<00:04:32.440> I<00:04:32.880> think<00:04:33.880> he

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
look at the recovery honor I think he

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.520 
look at the recovery honor I think he
has<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.120> longest<00:04:34.450> recovery<00:04:35.110> on<00:04:35.200> v-trigger

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
has the longest recovery on v-trigger

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.170 
has the longest recovery on v-trigger
from<00:04:35.830> when<00:04:35.950> I<00:04:35.980> tested<00:04:36.250> I<00:04:36.550> know<00:04:36.610> that<00:04:36.850> from<00:04:37.000> full

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
from when I tested I know that from full

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.180 
from when I tested I know that from full
screen<00:04:37.480> kami<00:04:38.110> can<00:04:38.320> react<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.710> his<00:04:38.830> v-trigger

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
screen kami can react to his v-trigger

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.760 
screen kami can react to his v-trigger
with<00:04:39.790> our<00:04:39.940> own<00:04:40.120> v-trigger<00:04:40.570> activation<00:04:41.530> and

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
with our own v-trigger activation and

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.140 
with our own v-trigger activation and
then<00:04:41.890> punished<00:04:42.250> with<00:04:42.520> like<00:04:42.760> drill<00:04:43.000> or

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
then punished with like drill or

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.340 
then punished with like drill or
something<00:04:43.180> like<00:04:43.450> that<00:04:43.540> and<00:04:43.810> like<00:04:43.870> ryu<00:04:44.200> can

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
something like that and like ryu can

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.830 
something like that and like ryu can
super<00:04:44.650> it<00:04:44.770> i<00:04:44.800> think<00:04:44.970> so<00:04:45.970> it's<00:04:46.330> a<00:04:46.450> long<00:04:46.630> time

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
super it i think so it's a long time

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.830 
super it i think so it's a long time
right<00:04:47.140> it's<00:04:47.530> not<00:04:47.710> it's<00:04:47.950> not<00:04:48.100> a<00:04:48.160> super<00:04:48.850> fast

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
right it's not it's not a super fast

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.230 
right it's not it's not a super fast
startup<00:04:50.260> on<00:04:50.380> the<00:04:50.470> beach<00:04:50.620> trigger<00:04:50.830> and<00:04:51.610> that's

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
startup on the beach trigger and that's

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.760 
startup on the beach trigger and that's
pretty<00:04:52.419> much<00:04:52.540> it<00:04:52.690> for<00:04:52.840> birdie<00:04:53.169> to<00:04:53.229> be<00:04:53.440> honest

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
pretty much it for birdie to be honest

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.590 
pretty much it for birdie to be honest
he's<00:04:53.860> a<00:04:53.890> pretty<00:04:54.100> simple<00:04:54.340> character<00:04:54.700> and<00:04:55.030> keep

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
he's a pretty simple character and keep

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
he's a pretty simple character and keep
in<00:04:55.720> mind<00:04:55.840> a<00:04:55.900> lot<00:04:55.990> of<00:04:56.110> these<00:04:56.200> things<00:04:56.440> will

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
in mind a lot of these things will

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.350 
in mind a lot of these things will
probably<00:04:56.950> change<00:04:57.190> closer<00:04:57.820> to<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.090> real<00:04:58.180> game

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
probably change closer to the real game

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.490 
probably change closer to the real game
