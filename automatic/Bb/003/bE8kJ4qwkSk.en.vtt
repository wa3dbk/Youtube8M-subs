00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
tug-of-war essentially for that fit set

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.209 
tug-of-war essentially for that fit set
in<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.390> end<00:01:25.509> the<00:01:25.600> Buckeyes<00:01:25.960> really<00:01:26.920> got<00:01:27.100> the

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
job done really it's a very close when

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.020 
job done really it's a very close when
saying<00:01:29.259> tomorrow<00:01:29.710> number<00:01:30.310> ten<00:01:30.520> Lewis<00:01:30.850> comes

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
saying tomorrow number ten Lewis comes

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.149 
saying tomorrow number ten Lewis comes
to<00:01:31.179> Columbus<00:01:31.600> so<00:01:32.079> the<00:01:32.200> Buckeyes<00:01:32.530> bath<00:01:32.920> bring

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
to Columbus so the Buckeyes bath bring

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.580 
to Columbus so the Buckeyes bath bring
the<00:01:33.219> a<00:01:33.399> game<00:01:33.429> for<00:01:33.909> another<00:01:34.240> straight<00:01:34.719> day<00:01:35.109> and

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
the a game for another straight day and

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.499 
the a game for another straight day and
after<00:01:36.100> today<00:01:36.249> I<00:01:36.369> think<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.700> Buckeyes<00:01:37.060> this<00:01:37.390> is

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
after today I think the Buckeyes this is

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.179 
after today I think the Buckeyes this is
a<00:01:37.600> position<00:01:38.079> where<00:01:38.229> they<00:01:38.380> had<00:01:38.649> trouble<00:01:39.069> but

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
a position where they had trouble but

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:40.919 
a position where they had trouble but
they<00:01:39.310> rebounded<00:01:39.909> and<00:01:40.149> that<00:01:40.359> will<00:01:40.509> certainly

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
they rebounded and that will certainly

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.069 
they rebounded and that will certainly
help<00:01:41.170> them<00:01:41.380> tomorrow<00:01:41.890> but<00:01:42.819> Tim<00:01:43.539> as<00:01:43.719> you<00:01:43.749> said

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
help them tomorrow but Tim as you said

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.459
