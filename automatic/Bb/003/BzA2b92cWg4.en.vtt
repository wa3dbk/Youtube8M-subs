that<00:00:19.320> are<00:00:19.410> pretty<00:00:19.529> obvious<00:00:19.650> like<00:00:20.160> deer<00:00:20.609> or<00:00:20.820> elk

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
Park Service in particular because bats

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.240 
Park Service in particular because bats
are<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.539> common<00:00:46.379> they<00:00:46.530> actually<00:00:46.950> are<00:00:47.039> very

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
are so common they actually are very

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.420 
are so common they actually are very
widespread<00:00:47.899> they<00:00:48.899> show<00:00:49.140> up<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.500> buildings<00:00:50.070> and

like<00:00:52.680> caves<00:00:53.180> Park<00:00:54.180> Service<00:00:54.510> really<00:00:54.840> cares

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
like caves Park Service really cares

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.400 
like caves Park Service really cares
about<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:56.120> not<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.149> because<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.780> their

to<00:03:40.800> hibernation<00:03:41.430> they<00:03:41.670> need<00:03:42.330> areas<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:42.990> are

to hibernation they need areas that are

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.740 
to hibernation they need areas that are
deeper<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.560> colder<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:44.970> they<00:03:45.090> can<00:03:45.270> drop<00:03:45.510> their

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
deeper and colder so they can drop their

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.540 
deeper and colder so they can drop their
body<00:03:45.930> temperatures<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:46.740> remain<00:03:46.980> in<00:03:47.160> torpor

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
body temperatures and remain in torpor

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.280 
body temperatures and remain in torpor
and<00:03:47.730> so<00:03:48.240> there's<00:03:48.420> a<00:03:48.480> whole<00:03:48.720> different<00:03:49.110> set<00:03:49.260> of

and so there's a whole different set of

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.140 
and so there's a whole different set of
caves<00:03:49.590> in<00:03:49.800> our<00:03:49.920> park<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.460> they<00:03:50.670> can<00:03:50.850> choose
