00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.810 
together like that is one and there's
two<00:04:14.330> notice<00:04:15.330> that<00:04:15.620> they<00:04:16.620> both<00:04:16.890> go<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.400> different

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
two notice that they both go a different

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.949 
two notice that they both go a different
way<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.690> make<00:04:18.840> it<00:04:19.050> actually<00:04:19.980> fly<00:04:20.220> around<00:04:20.959> then

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
way to make it actually fly around then

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:33.439 
way to make it actually fly around then
you<00:04:21.989> can<00:04:22.260> attach<00:04:22.620> them

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.749 

right<00:04:34.169> there<00:04:35.150> so<00:04:36.150> there<00:04:36.659> it<00:04:36.749> is<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:37.169> mini

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
right there so there it is the mini

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:44.809 
right there so there it is the mini
slave<00:04:38.759> one<00:04:42.620> there<00:04:43.620> isn't<00:04:44.339> really<00:04:44.490> any

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
slave one there isn't really any

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:52.399 
slave one there isn't really any
features<00:04:45.620> actually<00:04:47.689> but<00:04:49.639> yeah<00:04:51.080> that's<00:04:52.080> really

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:52.409 
features actually but yeah that's really

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:55.939 
features actually but yeah that's really
it<00:04:52.710> like<00:04:52.979> this<00:04:53.789> thing<00:04:54.419> used<00:04:54.990> to<00:04:55.169> be<00:04:55.349> a<00:04:55.379> chair

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
it like this thing used to be a chair

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:57.589 
it like this thing used to be a chair
I'll<00:04:56.189> just<00:04:56.339> take<00:04:56.490> off<00:04:56.669> some<00:04:56.879> pieces<00:04:56.999> to<00:04:57.389> show

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
I'll just take off some pieces to show

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:16.040 
I'll just take off some pieces to show
you<00:04:57.659> what<00:04:58.289> he<00:04:58.379> used<00:04:58.620> to<00:04:58.740> be<00:05:09.860> trippin

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.529 

so<00:05:16.710> if<00:05:16.800> you<00:05:16.949> can<00:05:17.159> use<00:05:17.310> some<00:05:17.340> music<00:05:18.120> or<00:05:18.300> yelling

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
so if you can use some music or yelling

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:20.629 
so if you can use some music or yelling
in<00:05:18.780> the<00:05:18.900> background<00:05:19.080> and<00:05:19.530> it's<00:05:20.250> just<00:05:20.460> my

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
first a lego creator armchair but I

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.969 
first a lego creator armchair but I
added<00:05:33.539> a<00:05:33.659> few<00:05:33.870> pieces<00:05:34.610> and<00:05:35.610> i<00:05:36.270> took<00:05:36.330> this<00:05:36.990> right

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
added a few pieces and i took this right

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:45.379 
added a few pieces and i took this right
off<00:05:39.080> put<00:05:40.080> it<00:05:41.150> right<00:05:42.150> there<00:05:43.759> put<00:05:44.759> on<00:05:44.940> the

off put it right there put on the
holographic<00:05:47.569> orange<00:05:48.569> stats<00:05:49.050> for<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:49.500> fire<00:05:49.800> at

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
holographic orange stats for the fire at

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.490 
holographic orange stats for the fire at
the<00:05:50.520> back<00:05:50.990> like<00:05:52.099> that<00:05:53.719> and<00:05:54.719> i<00:05:54.810> knew<00:05:55.110> it<00:05:55.349> was

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
the back like that and i knew it was

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.820 
the back like that and i knew it was
missing<00:05:56.159> something<00:05:57.110> the<00:05:58.110> side<00:05:58.469> wings<00:06:00.229> so<00:06:01.229> it

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
missing something the side wings so it

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.100 
missing something the side wings so it
like<00:06:02.099> you<00:06:02.460> just<00:06:02.520> stood<00:06:02.879> up<00:06:02.940> perfectly<00:06:03.810> well

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
like you just stood up perfectly well

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.309 
like you just stood up perfectly well
before<00:06:04.469> so<00:06:05.159> yeah<00:06:05.550> so<00:06:06.300> I<00:06:06.330> added<00:06:06.659> these<00:06:07.020> side

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:07.319 
before so yeah so I added these side

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:14.689 
before so yeah so I added these side
wings<00:06:07.650> and<00:06:08.210> now<00:06:09.210> it<00:06:09.569> looks<00:06:09.659> more<00:06:11.780> like<00:06:12.780> a<00:06:13.699> slave

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:14.699 
wings and now it looks more like a slave

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:19.309 
wings and now it looks more like a slave
one<00:06:16.430> so<00:06:17.430> yeah<00:06:17.909> that's<00:06:18.210> not<00:06:18.539> mainly<00:06:18.960> it<00:06:19.050> I'll

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:19.319 
one so yeah that's not mainly it I'll

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:22.279 
one so yeah that's not mainly it I'll
see<00:06:19.500> you<00:06:19.650> guys<00:06:19.680> later<00:06:19.830> bye
