00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.730
 How about friends, I'm Ricardo Dominguez and 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.709
 we are in grace style in this 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.500
 program you will learn that style 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:18.140
 it's not something you're born with, it's something 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.500
 that is learned in time and in 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.500
 path 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.430
 this time we are going to talk about the 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.150
 black suits or dark suits in 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.040
 general because look at the clear suits 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.070
 must be left for stations 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.830
 spring and summer for the day but if 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.170
 the mood of you does not match with colors 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.630
 clear or you have to go to a 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.360
 dinner or some formal event like a 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.180
 work meeting better you resort to 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.470
 the basic colors and what are the 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.900
 basic colors black gray oxford and 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.020
 marine and why resort to these 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.720
 basic colors you will see these colors 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.300
 they are firm and they have a 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.810
 very important force of attraction and 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.360
 power but if we talk about power the black 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.670
 is the true color of power these 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.220
 basic colors apart from owning that 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.649
 own internal strength lend themselves very 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.899
 well to be combined with different 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.790
 colors and textures of shirts and ties 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.700
 and that is a great advantage 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.790
 Now, if you decide to send 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.300
 a suit or a tailored jacket that would be 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.470
 the most appropriate choose a tissue 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.060
 have a horizontal plot because I 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.120
 It gives much more depth and gives more 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.310
 strength to the garment already made and 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.920
 remember very well that the joke of a 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.840
 sack is to make it look thinner not 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.840
 that fattens it that has to emphasize 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.760
 you see your tailor now well 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.430
 you decide me better to buy a suit 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.400
 made a sack already done anyway 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.890
 go with your tailor to fit 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.320
 perfectly so that the bag will 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.660
 wrap up to you and allow this 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.030
 ease of moving perfectly without 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.970
 that you feel trapped by the sack 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.160
 but if you decide better instead of 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.940
 use a normal fabric without one of wool and 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.300
 silk look very well that has a shine 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.420
 very light very subtle almost imperceptible 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.210
 in the distance because a thin tissue of 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.790
 wool and silk generated 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.710
 up close a very intense brightness and very 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.720
 strong that is a big attack hit to 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.480
 ti attraction and attention if we go to 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.600
 combine black with black or gray with gray 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.730
 or marine with marine would have to mix 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.440
 very well the textures I will explain 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.820
 to you why wool and cotton are given 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.100
 they absorb the shades differently 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.860
 in such a way that if you want to use 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.730
 a suit wears with black with a sweater 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.130
 black below , make sure that the 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.290
 texture is very different if it is the base 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.570
 of the goal bag you a sweater 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.630
 cashmere or pure wool or a 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.010
 100% pure cotton t-shirt as soon as 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.220
 to color shirts do not have 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.130
 problem 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.370
 in such a way that if you decide 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.100
 move to these basic colors will have 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.410
 you assured the presence and the 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.840
 attention of the people with whom you are 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.510

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.820
 relationship friends that's all for today
