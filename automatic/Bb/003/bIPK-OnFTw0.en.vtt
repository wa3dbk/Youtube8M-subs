00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.790
 Voykovskaya 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.780
 and understand us the message that there is already 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.240
 nothing left 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.939
 and get the meaning here is absolutely not what I 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.840
 whom everyone took out and so on but not 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.730
 less there is still a huge amount 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.039
 interesting photos from here which 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.020
 show when the opposite but 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.269
 actually the only way to check 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.039

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.619

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.379

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.379
 much more more a crash with anyone facial 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.120
 fire escape we could not find and 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.580
 so the only entrance to this building 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:16.530
 notice a small vaginal opening 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:19.220
 little we imbued with medicine 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.220
 main entrance 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.850
 and when we raise the building from the other side 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.850
 chances of the riders 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:39.730

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:34.420

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.470
