could make you also have to know where
to<00:01:59.679> look<00:01:59.830> and<00:02:00.130> when<00:02:00.460> to<00:02:00.610> look<00:02:00.729> there<00:02:01.000> got<00:02:01.600> to<00:02:01.630> be

to look and when to look there got to be

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.630 
to look and when to look there got to be
in<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:01.990> friction<00:02:02.229> friction<00:02:02.860> zone<00:02:03.250> and<00:02:03.460> have

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
in the friction friction zone and have

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.830 
in the friction friction zone and have
to<00:02:03.759> be<00:02:03.850> using<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:04.179> little<00:02:04.270> bit<00:02:04.450> of<00:02:04.539> that<00:02:04.600> rear

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
to be using a little bit of that rear

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.480 
to be using a little bit of that rear
brake<00:02:05.140> or<00:02:05.649> you'll<00:02:05.830> never<00:02:05.979> make<00:02:06.130> it<00:02:06.280> through

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490

these<00:02:06.700> exercises<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:08.259> heard<00:02:08.470> it<00:02:08.590> from<00:02:08.709> the

these exercises you heard it from the

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.940 
these exercises you heard it from the
motorman<00:02:09.190> get<00:02:09.910> out<00:02:10.060> there<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.509> practice

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
motorman get out there and practice

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.330 
motorman get out there and practice
that's<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.190> key<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.400> riding<00:02:12.850> like<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.030> pro
