00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
it's like yeah well maybe there's an

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.740 
it's like yeah well maybe there's an
easier<00:00:38.370> way<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.550> do<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.940> it'd<00:00:39.120> be<00:00:39.149> nice<00:00:39.420> if<00:00:39.450> you

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
easier way to do it it'd be nice if you

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.060 
easier way to do it it'd be nice if you
could<00:00:39.840> get<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.140> all<00:00:40.260> at<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.500> bottom<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.920> work

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
could get it all at the bottom and work

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.049 
could get it all at the bottom and work
your<00:00:41.219> way<00:00:41.280> back<00:00:41.610> up<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.739> this<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:43.980> Jamie<00:00:44.789> well

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
your way back up so this is a Jamie well

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.170 
your way back up so this is a Jamie well
the<00:00:45.390> slope<00:00:45.899> here<00:00:46.219> I've<00:00:47.219> got<00:00:47.370> two<00:00:47.550> lines<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:48.030> it

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the slope here I've got two lines of it

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.500 
the slope here I've got two lines of it
here<00:00:48.360> hopefully<00:00:48.840> that's<00:00:49.050> enough<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:50.510> give

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
here hopefully that's enough and give

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
they probably don't care you can just

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.810 
they probably don't care you can just
save<00:02:11.700> them<00:02:11.849> so<00:02:12.569> there's<00:02:12.900> my

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
save them so there's my

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
there's my handle and mmm so and this is

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.060 
there's my handle and mmm so and this is
slope<00:02:21.900> here<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.350> it's<00:02:22.470> gonna<00:02:22.560> take<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:22.830> while<00:02:23.010> so

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
slope here so it's gonna take a while so

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.700 
slope here so it's gonna take a while so
you<00:02:23.250> just<00:02:23.490> start<00:02:23.760> your<00:02:24.290> thing<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.500> hold

you just start your thing and you hold
it<00:02:25.830> under<00:02:26.040> there<00:02:26.220> believe<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.670> or<00:02:26.730> not<00:02:26.820> it

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
it under there believe it or not it

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.890 
it under there believe it or not it
didn't<00:02:27.210> burn<00:02:29.210> all<00:02:30.210> of<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.360> sudden<00:02:30.630> this<00:02:30.690> stuff

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
didn't burn all of a sudden this stuff

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.350 
didn't burn all of a sudden this stuff
starts<00:02:31.170> getting<00:02:31.790> you<00:02:32.790> know<00:02:32.880> literally

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
starts getting you know literally

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.730

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
now we give it a little stir because the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.170

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
that that was just against that bottom

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.660 
that that was just against that bottom
okay<00:02:45.030> not<00:02:45.840> bad<00:02:46.050> huh
