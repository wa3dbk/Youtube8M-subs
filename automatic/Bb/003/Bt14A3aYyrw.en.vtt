00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.820
 there the capri 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.739
 nini not chronologically im 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.230
 difficulty level are arranged 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.829
 but quite different patterns too 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.910
 demonstrate 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:51.610
 I would really start it first 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.519
 take the so-called lighter ones 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.210
 as there would be the number 13 as there 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.860
 also the number 14 maybe 15 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.140
 also the number 20 is always recommended 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.440
 good as an entry afterwards 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.520
 maybe the number 9 and then 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.800
 I assert the field is so far 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.320
 opened for all other caprices as 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.780
 It is then a very individual process 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.780
 being a student 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.360
 when you state the performance 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.030
 I almost knew paganinis 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.430
 complete in facsimile phone with me 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.860
 home and then you can see very clearly 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.720
 with which he has dealt publicly and 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.240
 in which places and when and how exactly 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.570
 but it is not even a capriccio 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.010
 so the caprices never played 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.260
 public that is also a 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.010
 interesting indiz he has it for the 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.010
 others have disappeared 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.700
 it's interesting to see 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:06.050
 first caprice in e major that we have here 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.830
 actually with a multiple design 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:13.930
 On the one hand, there is a barrio 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:17.570
 lashes if you go to paganini 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.290
 guitarist wants to think mario haas 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:25.120
 translated on soon sato over four pages 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.580
 So it's a very realistic etude 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.150
 then it is interesting to calculate 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.560
 at paganini almost cliched with a 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.180
 fast pace 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.510
 and that's not at all 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.320
 Given we have an andante it is 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.420
 keeps and nothing more than that and that 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.940
 is also thought of relatively reasonable by 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.670
 you hardly expect what then 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.670
 everything comes, for example, chronic 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.880
 test runs down that one should now 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.340
 do not have to play in other tempi 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.350
 and there I always put in my own game 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.799
 as well as the teaching worth it 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.450
 that common tempomat has to be found 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.019
 be and that is just then 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.570
 amazingly, a real one 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.400
 andante and care for such a piece eg 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.519
 to practice 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.670
 then they are almost as a metronome function 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:22.040
 my legs and then i can see how 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.690
 then internet was still working 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.790
 something to be louder 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.180
 difficulties first time does not come 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:33.970
 the piece begins in tactical that is 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:41.750
 it starts with the 2 so we have the 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:44.840
 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 which also musically 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:48.380
 To express completely different is in fact 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.440
 the hard time the 1 on the 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.980
 harmonious so to speak spice in side 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.750
 and the two on the relaxed that 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.549
 Much more than when you are from 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.220
 in the beginning with an exaggerated 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.530
 fast tempo and accent starts around 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.250
 a highly athletic performance, so to speak 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.160
 submitted 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.720
 it is not there at all 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.720
 and not at all wanted 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.260
 just the order table 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.910
 this is based on the mentioned caprice 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.180
 especially important to me why 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.610
 accent in the first smear actually 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.510
 it would be very harmful to him 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:40.280
 immediately avoid 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:42.020
 even at the bottom, that's basically why 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.300
 always make clear this bass line 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.690
 and now we come up with a traditional one 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.370
 gift of course is always again 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.210
 the problem of stroke style given that 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.250
 How did I learn that? How can it? 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.490
 convey 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.560
 My topic here is not the smear 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.800
 to overstate the impulse 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.990
 already due to the wrong accents 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:16.880
 but at all that spread to him 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:23.390
 to start all that is with this 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:25.550
 Technique I 'll do it again so I have 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.460
 namely I practiced a double effect 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.800
 can on the one hand the on itself 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.290
 give the necessary momentum to the will 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.190
 up to eight note if you have the whole 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:40.720
 phase counts is jumped without accent 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:43.729
 but also the coordination of the 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.789
 lower two notes that meet there 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:48.970
 in the bass rent is practiced clearly with 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:51.610
 So it's a coordination exercise 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:56.740
 between left and right hand 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.740
 with answers if I only pay attention 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.569
 me as a musician 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.970
 wrestle untreated untreated 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:21.349
 information 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:24.409
 That's why we're doing six issues 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:26.569
 much because what I'm doing in this 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:28.720
 was pulling out what my 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:32.569
 personal as well artistic 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:34.789
 it can become a surrogate 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:37.599
 yes, the publisher does not decide 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:41.440
 gives me a quasi first 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:41.440
 glasses-free view of the things
