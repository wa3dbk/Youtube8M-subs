00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
play it with a friend spec ops the story

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.189 
play it with a friend spec ops the story
is<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:24.000> begin<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.449> level<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:24.930> finish

the level has nothing to do with the
single-player<00:00:27.269> campaign<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.199> lets<00:00:28.349> us

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
single-player campaign so it lets us

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.589

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
feel like spec ops just takes the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.809 
feel like spec ops just takes the
handcuffs<00:02:53.380> off<00:02:53.560> they<00:02:54.040> don't<00:02:54.220> have<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.519> abide

by single player rules and stick which

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.370 
by single player rules and stick which
is<00:02:57.280> great<00:02:57.550> but<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.480> just<00:02:58.630> lets<00:02:58.870> them<00:02:59.050> flex

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
is great but it just lets them flex

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.020 
is great but it just lets them flex
their<00:02:59.650> designer<00:03:00.010> muscles<00:03:00.489> it's<00:03:00.760> not<00:03:00.970> just

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
out there and spec ops and that I think

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.720 
out there and spec ops and that I think
are<00:03:08.350> just<00:03:08.410> completely<00:03:08.739> unique<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.580> call

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730

of duty as far as DLC goes it does seem

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.229 
of duty as far as DLC goes it does seem
