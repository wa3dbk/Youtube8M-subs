00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.080
 hi to all youtube friends welcome 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.210
 in this new of ours has arrived 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.120
 Christmas gift of jailbreak for ios 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.559
 set on our apple devices without 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.500
 no doubt a beautiful gift 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.690
 unexpected among other things to say 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.090
 and sorry if the shooting will be done 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.619
 with lepad but unfortunately the means do not me 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.080
 allow you to do otherwise 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.119
 moment I will even use the mac of 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.380
 my brother so I couldn't go outside 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.439
 another already to prepare the show put 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.779
 a lot of time therefore obviously the 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.200
 guide will be understandable 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.700
 we're going to change an iphone 5 with ios 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.079
 7.0.2 but this guide is compatible and is 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.379
 identical for all devices 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.270
 compatible then up to ayers 7.0 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.860
 point 4 then I connected to the iphone 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.079
 downloaded the program from instead a 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.469
 com or this site but we can 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.399
 download for me so it is for windows 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.210
 very important before doing the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.949
 jailbreak 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.890
 you need to make a backup of your data 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.530
 our device 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.840
 after making a backup via itunes 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.939
 and through claude obviously backup is 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.330
 essential to avoid losing 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.770
 data is better to recover them in case of 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.260
 loss of all data 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.640
 I'll show you the site again 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.360
 however you find it in the description 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.530
 element and here are all written 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.310
 compatibility therefore with all the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.030
 iphone ipod touch ipad and ipad mini 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.650
 perfect very important too 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.200
 disable all passwords 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.759
 if you have them on the device 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.110
 then we can proceed later 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.060
 having made a backup we download 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.530
 the application we open the file e 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.860
 click on the perfect jailbreak button 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.150
 various operations will be carried out in 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.869
 previous should not require more 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.880
 of five minutes 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.710
 meanwhile I will show you what happens on 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.950
 computer and what happens 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:57.380
 on the iphone app jailbreak data 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.380
 the iphone at the moment remains as it was 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.170
 I recommend always making the backup 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.490
 backups always serve to recover the 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.379
 data I just did put us 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.580
 so much time because I didn't do it from 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:17.080
 for months but obviously I could not do 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.569
 not even in this case except go to 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.840
 take a moment did not show signs of 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.330
 change in the way the screen is 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:33.400
 applications were always blocked 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:35.610
 instead one takes about 20 months and we go 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.310
 to unlock the iphone 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:46.470
 I'm looking for the iPhone while I do the 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.470
 video is because to avoid 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.300
 ok arrived my brother noticed that 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.300
 he was using his computer 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:15.520
 meanwhile we are at 22 of with figures 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:16.900
 insist procedure should not 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.580
 ok we will be forced to 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.410
 reset the device but not 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.910
 worried because the possibility that 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:30.820
 I go by hand to a jailbreak of this type 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:32.590
 it is absolutely very low power 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.290
 I'm not touching the iPhone 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.570
 the iphone as it was left is better 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.260
 avoid pressing keys or in any case 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.260
 use it 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.070
 in fact also the same while there is 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.390
 reboot the device 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.120
 the same program recommends doing a 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.770
 backup as you can read is written 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.020
 we don't think there should be 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.830
 problems but there may be something 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:00.690
 however it is always better to protect yourself 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.690
 dabo or device rebooting 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.260
 ok perfect the iphone start to boot 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.579
 practically now exactly like the 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.290
 old the break we should open 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.759
 an application on our iphone e 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.759
 then cydia will be installed 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.680
 to consider please unblock the 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.690
 your device and opened the year on 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.650
 let's say it has the new icon of law 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.770
 even this is still mis 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.220
 waiting for it to just come on 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.630
 kata symbol done as you can see 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.840
 on the cell device 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:05:04.680
 I am going to give you this new division icon 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:05:07.910
 in April the device restarts yes 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.130
 see the upload icon 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.620
 even for nothing the procedure is 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.509
 went to 90 percent successfully in 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.490
 without missing the final blow if these 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.410
 we can say but we're almost there 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.169
 as you can see we are about five 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:25.039
 minutes the device is restarting 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.090
 that the apple came out again 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.979
 practically now at startup I should 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.639
 to find myself cydia later makes rome 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:36.210
 garrison is normally going to come 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.770
 device will perform a respring is then 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.270
 can easily use you 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.919
 device to continue please 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.479
 unlocks the device 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.479
 the device is still turning on 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.690
 perfect of course this guide is the 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:51.750
 face of his iphone but is equal on 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:57.330
 any other perfect device 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:59.120
 unblocked my device indeed the 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.659
 provision continues to move forward 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.659
 how you want to see 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.630
 better also in this case do not touch 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:12.280
 we expect nothing to be terminated 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:14.390
 all the perfect process is over 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.020
 possibly on the computer it turns out is 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.680
 over 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.940
 the iPhone reboots 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.060
 ok let's wait for it to come on 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:27.110
 completely to see precisely cydia 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.640
 on our device with ios set a lot 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.810
 positive because I will do so again 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.970
 many videos continue to 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.260
 follow me guys to understand how 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.370
 works the jailbreak you find already 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.060
 lots of videos for the versions 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.890
 previous 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.020
 obviously they also apply to this 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.050
 jailbreak I miss the aias 7 surely 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.220
 we can have more fun at 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.570
 customize this without any 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:49.100
 doubt perfect look on the device 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:51.200
 now there is a self configuration of that 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.700
 we can call it meanwhile on the peter 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.250
 finished wanting powers press her already 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.930
 exit but I honestly prefer 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.230
 leave the program open until 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.230
 end 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.430
 could be the final provision 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:22.570
 for a moment, position ipad better 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:25.570
 as well as device is restarting 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.570
 perfect 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.420
 ok his summer has restarted let's go 

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:35.580
 to check 

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:38.290
 we have pitfalls on our device 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:41.380
 then the jailbreak was performed with 

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:43.330
 success we have perfect cydia 

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.520
 preparing the filesystem later 

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:48.850
 cydia our positive will effect 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:52.320
 a respring and we can use the 

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:54.670
 jailbreak on our iphone with ios 7 

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.780
 great guys we'll come back to do 

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:56.530
 video I recommend you continue to 

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.120
 follow me 

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:01.590
 share this video that you sign up 

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.590
 to the channel to the next guys
