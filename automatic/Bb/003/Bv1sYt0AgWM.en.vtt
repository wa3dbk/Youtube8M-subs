00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.120
 I have just returned from the suburbs of 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.559
 cities of Egorievsk where 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:15.490
 near igor suit literally 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:18.970
 Kilometers 5 7 costs factory carnage 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:22.580
 which us us 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:28.970
 i roberta galimov this is a multiplier road 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:36.760
 on and Bashkir on stake and naturally for 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:39.739
 score show overboard my 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:44.710
 get you out of a trip next 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:48.260
 for our delegation from the factory did 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.850
 figuratively speaking how exactly the plant 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.780
 obviously helped me wash for a long time 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:56.120
 at the factory the activity was actually 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.149
 the plant was almost stopped 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.149
 Kutukov production started only 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.670
 those that were needed to show how 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.470
 the factory works workers there I saw not 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.010
 more than 20 people who you practically 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.520
 walked behind us as a guard to 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:17.360
 wandered around the plant did not ask questions 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:20.120
 to other employees means on when we 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.100
 the structure would have come almost to 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:27.200
 demille here is the smell of the territory west on 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.660
 territory or weak is decomposition 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.760
 tree 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:38.220
 small odors outsiders cut 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.690
 garlic but they were a little tolerable 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.400
 at least in the factory 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:47.040
 it surely led us for some reason us 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.050
 showed all the production even about 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.780
 four or five o'clock showed us this 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:57.930
 factory then means no truck 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.780
 it is during this time with a tree in the territory 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.560
 so drove in then we went for later I 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.880
 met with our live them which 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.580
 road residents who left at 1 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:15.630
 this plant two days before our delegate 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:19.940
 they say that change is what we are 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:25.610
 had before our arrival 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:31.110
 workers all over the other there are records 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.269
 their fall they already then say no longer 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.519
 could be near the territory 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:38.610
 factory 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:42.080
 that is, this school of eyes was unpleasant 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:45.780
 I do not speak like residents 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:50.000
 write lie new village still there 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:53.740
 several villages and be 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.910
 prove the fact that he really plant 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:02.320
 is committed to dropping first 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:06.370
 does exhaust some substances at night 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:11.990
 in the morning because people usually complain 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:15.380
 in the morning complain about all my launches on 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:19.010
 dizziness on precipitation of some kind 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.980
 substances glazed off on machines so on 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:26.810
 that they went around the factory 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.790
 such went from the rear factories found 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.670
 huge like a heap of waste 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.200
 wood material and drink that well 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.670
 clear understandable origin 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.129
 huge pile 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.079
 then my question is that what Mr. 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:40.739
 that said that we took out at the time 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.829
 this bunch 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.370
 to build on i in territory like 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:49.609
 it would be an object but by volume it is just 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.000
 huge volume and it is impossible to withdraw them 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:56.760
 inner impossible to get somewhere 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.620
 historical work right then we are with 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.689
 the guys drove to these heaps found 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.780
 a small stream is like a small stream 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:07.950
 meter meter wide and brook black water 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:11.700
 current current from the factory 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:15.299
 it can be seen visually that above there is water 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:19.160
 Well, she burned her hands a little bit 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:21.870
 with this wooden powder 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.599
 sawdust that they are boring 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.160
 substances we have collected on trial we will 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:30.750
 do analysis then what it is 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.449
 vegetation around the plant 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.039
 crosses she ruined a prominent day i'm not 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.830
 I know I'm not an expert on the deck for example 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.590
 Clover do not say it as an indicator 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.750
 at all 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.990
 clover pollution there black liver 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:48.140
 dies grows dies under what is 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.990
 facts we discovered 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:54.270
 I then went myself asked but 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.490
 talk to people did not confirm 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:01.950
 the data directly to the recorder did not confirm 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:04.590
 data that the inhabitants of the people themselves 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.420
 they advise us not through my teeth 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:13.020
 ways to prevent plants from being built 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:14.810
 children lived near allergies children pulmonary 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.890
 diseases 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.310
 medical disease statistics 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:22.710
 guys on the guys could not get 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.090
 population intimidated population intimidated well 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:30.960
 and there most of the village of course 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:32.340
 work find name is depressing we 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.880
 believe that we live near this plant 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.880
 you can
