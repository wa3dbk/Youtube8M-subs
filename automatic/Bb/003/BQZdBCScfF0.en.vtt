00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 she put them sportsbooks ya 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.220
 point like new minutes board 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.830
 today I leave minutes board 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.480
 not really since there is 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.059
 a lot of people in any case who 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.620
 asked us the question each time 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.150
 how did you choose late at this time 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.460
 had to select this famous breed 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.630
 how to choose your race that 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.400
 it's because it's a ba is what 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.650
 it's because you like the design 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.189
 is that it is also a player hand 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.260
 which made us finally want what 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.779
 made us choose simply 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.430
 this this race or not beautiful final 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.690
 in the end to answer this question 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.010
 it's still a lot of factors 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.170
 so I know that some of us 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.370
 for example who sony is what i can 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.989
 take this phase that it's easy to 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.820
 play what I can take this race 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.539
 because she looks pretty cool I 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.620
 want to say that all of your 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.180
 suits all your questions and all 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.590
 your answers you're going the given 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.570
 by a yes I would like to talk to 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.949
 other protos and you ask yourself 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.059
 maybe the question of the type 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.379
 yeah but will I choose 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.440
 this sentence because we are easy to 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.640
 play it seems a bit crappy 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.870
 and this one is a woman 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.160
 personally I think it's a 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.500
 answer more than correct because at 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.820
 final if you want a race 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.409
 because at the beginning in any case the most 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.090
 simple to play is also a choice 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.590
 completely viable and nothing does you 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.229
 prevents anyway after when you 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.299
 have progressed to change race nothing 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.040
 had nothing prevents at all considering that 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.290
 at the base so anyway on 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.850
 starcraft you will learn the basics 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.110
 and the basics in any race 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.970
 so that they are simpler to date 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.860
 it will not be much the same 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.299
 level of the micro macro multitask taken 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.880
 of decision and that's up to you will see 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.079
 substantially the same things so 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.630
 personally I want to tell you 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.590
 if you ask the question if it takes 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.479
 must choose this breed because she 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.920
 is it easy to play low do not hesitate 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.020
 do not hesitate then at the level of the rails 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.909
 between the easy trick to play most 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.979
 time I'm concerned you four protos 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.240
 at first to take to take your 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.399
 marks are clearly I find that 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.470
 these traces is not very complicated in 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.350
 any case to be identified at the beginning obviously 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.790
 the more you go ahead and the more the game goes 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.520
 you seem complicated with its traces 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.030
 obviously it's still work 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.020
 in all in all cases now 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.579
 why choose this or that race 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.290
 so I feel like you can 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.570
 see here was not the land 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.239
 agree protos the random so when we 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.500
 start what race really choose I 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.560
 want to tell you it's according to your tastes 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.840
 and your tastes to you nothing of 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.200
 nothing personal at the level for example 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.060
 every time asked asked yes is this 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.440
 you do not terrasson thought that to 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.050
 you to answer it clearly 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.910
 if you prefer the radars and eran by 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.760
 example is it ok or 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.099
 how are you training a little bit in 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.989
 the microphone is quite complete as race 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.400
 but in the end quite complicated at first 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.930
 in any case the devices is what will 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.370
 think about injection and that's at the level 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.110
 of the avoid macro I would advise you 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.440
 again at the level of taking in 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.700
 pure hands to protos now there is 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.870
 no miracle breed you will start 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.920
 by proto it may be that the 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.140
 fields where the design more so at 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.750
 final do not take your head off the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.430
 breed of departure we clearly do not care 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.400
 it's time to get to know the basics 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.970
 so why not start on 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.950
 random domme wine anyway 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.970
 you will be able to discover more 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.319
 little bit all breeds discover 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.569
 all not new units 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.650
 discover a little the gameplay you 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.769
 have to do so so much at the level 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.359
 both for you to set up or to 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.489
 counter so clearly it can be 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.019
 also a good solution 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.459
 now obviously I think that 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.870
 personally jumped because how 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.549
 I chose pitch at the beginning all 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.760
 just what I knew about her 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.400
 which at the very beginning so for those who 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.859
 that leaves a little bit and beats 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.819
 it was a little bit the esport reference 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.239
 on starcraft 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.579
 a few years ago and 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.799
 especially boxer too he's a boxer to 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.780
 edge who know a little bit 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.019
 it's a little bit the reference 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.590
 once in world history on 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.630
 job spotted 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.269
 so these two people made me 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.980
 that the choice sleeve will pay so that's it 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.840
 it's not necessarily for the design for 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.940
 the gameplay or again the 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.829
 ease of any other breed 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.220
 phase I want to say I would have chosen 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.900
 so this one so see in the end I 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.560
 want to tell you that the answer is 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.329
 locate you a little more 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.889
 obviously all races soon very 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.539
 soon as you told me 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.370
 on the previous video about 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.289
 new videos that will arrive 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.150
 the small minutes board is rather a 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.630
 little notice minutes it one allow 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.820
 in life five minutes 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.010
 the choice of breeds do not you take the 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.290
 head all races are good the 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.440
 rats are about whale hundred of 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.920
 voices on it in the end are rather 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.570
 balÃ¨ze 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.920
 we find ourselves anyway for the 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.900
 next on this channel I make you 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.070
 kisses and especially no headaches 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.070
 of which prague and very quickly
