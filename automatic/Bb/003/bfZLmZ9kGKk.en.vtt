00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.880
 hello everyone today we are thinking about 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.880
 that he is in the day of lima, winter is coming kia 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.059
 first frost 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.330
 but which is also called that day 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.000
 tinsmith because once on the roads 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.340
 there is a very icy car 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.070
 often fight each other gets in 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.679
 an accident 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.179
 This happens because of motorists 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.869
 did not have time to change the rubber and how 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.629
 known our latitudes winter is always 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:35.520
 comes unexpectedly 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.730
 and the south of order for any to happen 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.350
 unpleasant excesses needed on time 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.060
 so to say change the car 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.249
 i like that 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:48.379
 delay blonde blonde driving i 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.739
 very little really figuring out 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.719
 any technical nuances and therefore 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.890
 I want to ask the players in detail 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.370
 Ashanah in the difference between winter and summer 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.050
 winter morning please tell me what is she 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.780
 generally different 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.350
 but I think two information will be 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.399
 interesting not only for girls but also 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:06.689
 men beginners who just bought 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.520
 car and do not know all the subtleties of winter 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.139
 rubber meets the course itself summer so that 

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:14.810
 in simple terms, softer 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.840
 prosecutor's office if summer tires June 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.849
 take off and leave by car then in strong 

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:22.590
 frost it just dubeet it becomes 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.310
 very hard speck your very hard 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.330
 and the car rides like a hitman 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.700
 percentage of soft rubber it leaves it here 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.890
 same ride comfort and the car will drive to 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.230
 very afraid because 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.840
 in the end, winter is added 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.610
 special supplements that 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.830
 with even severe frost leave this 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.200
 rubber gently 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.550
 In addition, winter tires have more 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.000
 high tread 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.650
 im but there are wider grooves for 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.320
 what are the grooves of her tire for 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.220
 the fact that 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.190
 when you drive 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.630
 encounter water in summer if it's summer 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.090
 only when we currency if this winter 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.350
 only snow 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.270
 that kombar cross female for that 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.210
 to them 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.470
 water you walked to the top center not 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.280
 It did not work as a film on 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.610
 which Katya by which it seems 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.619
 wheel 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.489
 because if the wheels were perfect 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.109
 smooth ton 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:16.819
 would work between the road and the wheel 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.049
 such a thin film was in Rome 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.780
 ashana would have slid just like they would go 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.510
 this cannot be allowed therefore 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.670
 there is always that way and the winter tire does not have 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.680
 broader tee borovsky 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.269
 what to choose here 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.219
 and usually by what criteria do you value 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:32.609
 zin al senusi 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.599
 winter tires exist absolutely 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.439
 in different formats and therefore should 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.349
 choose tires for themselves 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.579
 there are winter tires without spanking and 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:42.730
 everyone remembers 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.929
 as you know 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:47.719
 rubber with spikes it is the best of itself 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.949
 shows on road sections 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:51.599
 church ice 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.260
 when icy when you need to brake 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.159
 and the wheels with spikes they brake faster and 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.559
 the car gets faster 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:01.779
 but if you have to drive 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:03.929
 clearing the road easier for him 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:06.339
 accountable police its only in the city 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:08.179
 drive where 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:10.429
 utilities clean the snow clean 

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:11.039
 ice 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:12.799
 then you won't have to face 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.049
 icy sections of the road and 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.579
 so 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.309
 especially chase your reserve i right 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.599
 I think you should not but for example if I 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.479
 going to go on my own 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.859
 cars in some European countries like there 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.209
 refer to studded tires 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.139
 good thing and then asked 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.319
 here it's better to avoid studded 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.219
 rubber because utilities 

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:37.499
 abroad very well watched 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:40.730
 condition of the roads and there in the face of the plot 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:42.609
 ice covered at least trails 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.159
 in general, and from these sites there 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.379
 so class a on the border can just 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.499
 Do not let in the country if you are on wheels 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:51.559
 but spikes say please 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:53.099
 does it depend on them 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.219
 m ap speed at which you him 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:57.919
 regular 10 thousand current 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.069
 what winter tires you november yes 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.120
 certainly manufacturers and 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.610
 Shein give marking special button 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.100
 subindex speed magnifier so 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.930
 called 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.160
 it works on indexing 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.520
 latin alphabet and there one must choose in 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.230
 depending on how fast you are 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.060
 move that rubber but because 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.040
 if you buy a cheaper one of 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.320
 books with a lower speed index on 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.260
 will go fast and you will have to go 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.740
 long enough 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.500
 plot road tula it will be m then 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.690
 survive Jacob ride under which rubber 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.920
 This did not count Sergius, she faster 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.240
 does it mean or maybe something else is Chechnya 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.570
 happen a left now gathering times 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.809
 rm change tires winter and 

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:42.419
 planned to go big enough 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.360
 distance to work but around town 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.030
 It is best to choose the more so because 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.639
 tread transportation in winter is always better 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.540
 if with a flatter project 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.870
 because the car suddenly happens 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.690
 happen so you have to move out 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.280
 its cleared road section on 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.069
 snow 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:02.259
 then a narrower tread is better 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:04.169
 will help the car to drive through this section 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.389
 and don't get stuck another one for those who don't know 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.599
 although it is still autumn 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.830
 comes middle necessary better note 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.110
 plus five this process 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.159
 presumably
