00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.139
 hello that such good friends welcome in 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.480
 this time I want to show you how 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.699
 some apps in the app store do not 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.100
 they allow us to use all their functions 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.619
 because we have our device with 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.310
 jailbreak for example whatsapp yes 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:34.190
 we go into the adjustments section and we 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.949
 let's go about and contact us 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.180
 You will see that this poster of the 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:40.730
 the application can not be used at this time 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.100
 on a device with jailbreak though 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.469
 we would have bought this 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.559
 application legally in the appstore 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.299
 same happens with skype and with some 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.570
 other applications that do not allow us 

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:55.610
 use your full functions to cause 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.739
 that they detect the device with 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.659
 jailbreak what we can do here is 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.250
 download this new tweet that is called 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:07.820
 test with alias what this tweet does is 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.850
 tell the applications or do that 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.030
 do not detect our device as a 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.710
 device with jailbreak even if it is 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.380
 this device the only thing we have 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.720
 what to do is give it in install and 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.030
 confirm once our 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.580
 device has done a res print what 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.940
 only thing that we are going to do is enter 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.210
 back to the application and check 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.179
 if now we can access the 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.600
 complete settings of the application 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:39.229
 about 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.689
 contact us and good as you can see 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:45.350
 now it detects our device as 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.570
 if it was like it was 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.210
 a single break device because it's 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.619
 legal jailbreak so there will be no 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.100
 no problem with this kind of 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.990
 applications that do not allow us to use 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.970
 its full functions 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.820
 I can have a device with jailbreak 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.670
