00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
uploaded that video right before I went

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.990 
uploaded that video right before I went
to<00:01:04.650> bed<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.100> didn't<00:01:05.430> even<00:01:05.489> think<00:01:05.700> about<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
to bed and I didn't even think about the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.870 
to bed and I didn't even think about the
thumbnail<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.950> guys<00:01:08.100> have<00:01:08.310> every<00:01:08.700> right

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
thumbnail so you guys have every right

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.390 
thumbnail so you guys have every right
to<00:01:09.090> make<00:01:09.240> fun<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.540> me<00:01:09.720> because<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.409> was<00:01:10.590> bad<00:01:11.040> I

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
to make fun of me because that was bad I

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.460 
to make fun of me because that was bad I
guess<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.210> that's<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.020> reason<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.409> don't

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
guess so that's the reason I don't

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.899 
guess so that's the reason I don't
rickroll<00:01:14.010> people<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.369> because<00:01:14.520> I'll<00:01:14.760> just

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
rickroll people is because I'll just

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.820 
rickroll people is because I'll just
screw<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.299> up<00:01:15.390> but<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.900> did<00:01:16.200> fix<00:01:16.350> his<00:01:16.530> thumbnail

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
screw it up but I did fix his thumbnail

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.320 
screw it up but I did fix his thumbnail
and<00:01:16.979> hopefully<00:01:17.340> I'll<00:01:17.580> be<00:01:17.610> able<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.000> get<00:01:18.119> some

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
and hopefully I'll be able to get some

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.719 
and hopefully I'll be able to get some
people<00:01:18.659> with<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.890> that's<00:01:20.340> only<00:01:20.460> if<00:01:20.640> they

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
people with it and that's only if they

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.070 
people with it and that's only if they
don't<00:01:20.909> watch<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.240> video<00:01:21.450> first<00:01:21.720> because

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
don't watch this video first because

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.359 
don't watch this video first because
they'll<00:01:22.259> then<00:01:22.710> don't<00:01:22.920> know<00:01:23.009> what<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.340> expect

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
they'll then don't know what to expect

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.450 
they'll then don't know what to expect
but<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.290> actually<00:01:25.290> saw<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> youtube<00:01:25.799> video<00:01:26.159> of

player<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:07.510> hopefully<00:03:08.500> will<00:03:08.799> kill<00:03:09.129> the

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
player and hopefully will kill the

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.470 
player and hopefully will kill the
Terran<00:03:09.669> player<00:03:09.760> as<00:03:09.939> well<00:03:10.060> although<00:03:10.239> it's<00:03:10.419> a

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
Terran player as well although it's a

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.849 
Terran player as well although it's a
lot<00:03:10.629> harder<00:03:10.810> because<00:03:11.049> Marines<00:03:11.470> have<00:03:11.680> that

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
lot harder because Marines have that

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:14.309 
lot harder because Marines have that
range<00:03:12.510> he<00:03:13.510> should<00:03:13.659> probably<00:03:13.930> send<00:03:14.079> a<00:03:14.169> couple

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
range he should probably send a couple

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.780 
range he should probably send a couple
marines<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:14.739> each<00:03:14.919> of<00:03:15.069> their<00:03:15.159> bases<00:03:15.489> just<00:03:15.639> to

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
marines to each of their bases just to

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.199 
marines to each of their bases just to
stop<00:03:16.030> any<00:03:16.269> further<00:03:16.720> leapfrogging<00:03:18.060> looks<00:03:19.060> like

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
stop any further leapfrogging looks like

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.000 
stop any further leapfrogging looks like
he's<00:03:19.359> getting<00:03:19.629> a<00:03:19.690> cybernetics<00:03:20.260> core<00:03:20.500> okay

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
he's getting a cybernetics core okay

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.589 
he's getting a cybernetics core okay
Irish<00:03:21.310> dude<00:03:21.489> spot<00:03:21.790> this<00:03:21.970> he<00:03:22.180> kills<00:03:22.419> that

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
Irish dude spot this he kills that

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.689 
Irish dude spot this he kills that
cannon<00:03:23.079> and<00:03:23.229> it<00:03:23.709> looks<00:03:23.859> like<00:03:23.919> he'll<00:03:24.129> be<00:03:24.280> fine

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:24.699 
cannon and it looks like he'll be fine

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.219 
cannon and it looks like he'll be fine

probe<00:03:26.470> but<00:03:26.680> if<00:03:26.769> you<00:03:26.919> look<00:03:27.040> at<00:03:27.190> our<00:03:27.280> tech<00:03:27.549> all<00:03:27.790> we

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
probe but if you look at our tech all we

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.240 
probe but if you look at our tech all we
really<00:03:28.000> have<00:03:28.239> is<00:03:28.419> cannons<00:03:29.319> and<00:03:29.530> forges<00:03:30.069> and

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
really have is cannons and forges and

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.629 
really have is cannons and forges and
briar<00:03:31.239> actually<00:03:31.870> went<00:03:32.199> for<00:03:32.470> a<00:03:32.500> forge<00:03:32.919> at<00:03:33.190> the

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:33.639 
briar actually went for a forge at the

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.309 
briar actually went for a forge at the
proxy<00:03:34.090> which<00:03:34.239> I<00:03:34.359> don't<00:03:34.419> agree<00:03:34.690> with<00:03:34.780> I<00:03:35.079> think

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
proxy which I don't agree with I think

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.869 
proxy which I don't agree with I think
it's<00:03:35.470> a<00:03:35.560> lot<00:03:35.709> safer<00:03:35.889> to<00:03:36.099> have<00:03:36.190> your<00:03:36.370> Forge<00:03:36.609> here

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 
it's a lot safer to have your Forge here

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:38.430 
it's a lot safer to have your Forge here
it<00:03:37.239> doesn't<00:03:37.510> slow<00:03:37.629> down<00:03:37.659> the<00:03:37.959> cannon<00:03:38.229> at<00:03:38.319> all

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
it doesn't slow down the cannon at all

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.990 
it doesn't slow down the cannon at all
but<00:03:38.709> I<00:03:38.889> guess<00:03:39.340> if<00:03:39.459> you're<00:03:39.549> going<00:03:39.639> to<00:03:39.729> use<00:03:39.849> it

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
but I guess if you're going to use it

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.580 
but I guess if you're going to use it
for<00:03:40.030> blocking<00:03:40.540> purposes<00:03:40.959> it'd<00:03:41.109> be<00:03:41.229> good<00:03:41.349> but

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
for blocking purposes it'd be good but

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.800 
for blocking purposes it'd be good but
here<00:03:41.889> he<00:03:42.010> didn't<00:03:42.340> so<00:03:42.549> small<00:03:43.299> mistake<00:03:43.569> right

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
here he didn't so small mistake right

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.899 
here he didn't so small mistake right
there<00:03:43.870> but<00:03:44.409> looks<00:03:45.069> like<00:03:45.159> he<00:03:45.400> is<00:03:45.430> going<00:03:45.729> to<00:03:45.849> be

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
there but looks like he is going to be

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:47.430 
there but looks like he is going to be
able<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.120> take<00:03:46.239> out<00:03:46.419> this<00:03:46.540> cannon<00:03:46.930> two<00:03:47.049> cannons

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
able to take out this cannon two cannons

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.229 
able to take out this cannon two cannons
morphing<00:03:47.769> against<00:03:48.099> his<00:03:48.280> one<00:03:48.519> cannon<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.090> this

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
morphing against his one cannon and this

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.030 
morphing against his one cannon and this
second<00:03:49.599> cannon<00:03:49.780> from<00:03:49.989> Genova<00:03:50.349> will<00:03:50.709> not<00:03:50.859> be

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
second cannon from Genova will not be

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.460 
second cannon from Genova will not be
here<00:03:51.250> in<00:03:51.400> time<00:03:51.609> there<00:03:52.510> too<00:03:52.750> Down<00:03:53.079> Goes<00:03:53.109> that

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
here in time there too Down Goes that

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.800 
here in time there too Down Goes that
cannon<00:03:53.919> gonna<00:03:54.519> focus<00:03:54.760> this<00:03:55.060> next<00:03:55.389> one<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:55.720> he

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
cannon gonna focus this next one and he

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.449 
cannon gonna focus this next one and he
actually<00:03:56.049> genova<00:03:56.680> should<00:03:56.829> be<00:03:56.949> attacking<00:03:57.310> this

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
actually genova should be attacking this

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.149 
actually genova should be attacking this
can<00:03:57.699> and<00:03:57.849> not<00:03:57.970> this<00:03:58.150> one<00:03:58.419> so<00:03:58.689> no<00:03:59.379> contest<00:03:59.859> here

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159

am leapfrogging up on my player two cans
completing<00:04:05.530> I<00:04:05.769> think<00:04:06.549> he<00:04:06.699> actually<00:04:06.849> sent<00:04:07.150> a

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
completing I think he actually sent a

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.670 
completing I think he actually sent a
couple<00:04:07.359> marines<00:04:07.750> at<00:04:07.900> me<00:04:08.049> and<00:04:08.229> shoot<00:04:08.439> away<00:04:08.560> a

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.800 
his probes are going to go down I don't
think<00:04:34.520> he<00:04:34.670> even<00:04:34.700> noticed<00:04:35.210> this<00:04:35.330> he's<00:04:35.510> too<00:04:35.660> busy

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
think he even noticed this he's too busy

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.540 
think he even noticed this he's too busy
building<00:04:36.350> cannons<00:04:36.830> yeah<00:04:36.980> look<00:04:37.130> at<00:04:37.220> that<00:04:37.250> he's

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
building cannons yeah look at that he's

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.490 
building cannons yeah look at that he's
building<00:04:37.850> cannons<00:04:38.240> there<00:04:38.750> is<00:04:38.870> a<00:04:38.900> bunker<00:04:39.320> here

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
building cannons there is a bunker here

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.680 
building cannons there is a bunker here
but<00:04:39.740> cannons<00:04:40.190> can<00:04:40.430> out<00:04:40.700> range<00:04:40.940> Marines<00:04:41.390> in<00:04:41.600> a

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
but cannons can out range Marines in a

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.720 
but cannons can out range Marines in a
bunker<00:04:42.050> by<00:04:42.320> one<00:04:42.710> so<00:04:43.010> if<00:04:43.130> he<00:04:43.250> places<00:04:43.460> that

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
bunker by one so if he places that

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.790 
bunker by one so if he places that
perfectly<00:04:44.150> he<00:04:44.390> can<00:04:44.570> outshoot<00:04:44.900> that<00:04:45.110> bunker

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
perfectly he can outshoot that bunker

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.370 
perfectly he can outshoot that bunker
and<00:04:45.980> take<00:04:46.430> it<00:04:46.580> out<00:04:46.670> but<00:04:47.390> unfortunately<00:04:47.630> his

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
and take it out but unfortunately his

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.040 
and take it out but unfortunately his
base<00:04:48.710> is<00:04:49.010> dead<00:04:49.340> here<00:04:50.180> I<00:04:50.270> have<00:04:50.360> pinched<00:04:50.780> my<00:04:50.900> way

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
base is dead here I have pinched my way

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.050 
base is dead here I have pinched my way
up<00:04:51.230> to<00:04:51.260> attacking<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:51.950> Nexus<00:04:52.310> and<00:04:52.340> iris<00:04:52.880> has

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
up to attacking the Nexus and iris has

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.730 
up to attacking the Nexus and iris has
as<00:04:53.300> well<00:04:53.600> I<00:04:53.660> believe<00:04:53.990> he<00:04:54.170> can<00:04:54.320> reach<00:04:54.530> this

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
as well I believe he can reach this

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.690 
as well I believe he can reach this
mansion<00:04:55.610> or<00:04:55.760> this<00:04:55.880> orbital<00:04:56.270> command<00:04:56.480> so<00:04:57.700> we

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
mansion or this orbital command so we

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.100 
mansion or this orbital command so we
killed<00:04:58.970> all<00:04:59.150> three<00:04:59.180> of<00:04:59.420> their<00:04:59.600> bases<00:04:59.960> where

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
killed all three of their bases where

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.660 
killed all three of their bases where
we're<00:05:00.260> going<00:05:00.470> to<00:05:00.590> with<00:05:00.800> this<00:05:00.950> cannon<00:05:01.370> attack

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
we're going to with this cannon attack

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.370 
we're going to with this cannon attack
and<00:05:01.940> it's<00:05:02.300> going<00:05:02.390> to<00:05:02.480> be<00:05:02.570> very<00:05:02.720> interesting<00:05:03.290> to

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
and it's going to be very interesting to

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.350 
and it's going to be very interesting to
see<00:05:03.500> what<00:05:03.620> happens<00:05:03.680> from<00:05:04.100> here<00:05:04.160> that<00:05:04.850> Nexus<00:05:05.180> is

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
see what happens from here that Nexus is

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.180 
see what happens from here that Nexus is
down<00:05:05.630> now<00:05:06.260> he's<00:05:06.320> going<00:05:06.560> to<00:05:06.650> move<00:05:06.800> on<00:05:06.920> to<00:05:06.950> my

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
down now he's going to move on to my

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.650 
down now he's going to move on to my
base<00:05:07.370> but<00:05:07.520> i<00:05:07.580> have<00:05:07.700> three<00:05:07.880> cannons<00:05:08.270> and<00:05:08.390> a<00:05:08.510> lot

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
base but i have three cannons and a lot

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.090 
base but i have three cannons and a lot
of<00:05:08.690> probes<00:05:09.020> and<00:05:09.140> this<00:05:09.290> will<00:05:09.440> be<00:05:09.560> just<00:05:09.590> what<00:05:10.070> i

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
of probes and this will be just what i

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.130 
of probes and this will be just what i
need<00:05:10.310> to<00:05:10.340> take<00:05:10.580> out<00:05:10.730> these<00:05:10.850> zealots<00:05:11.120> first<00:05:11.930> l

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:12.140 
need to take out these zealots first l

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.660 
need to take out these zealots first l
going<00:05:12.500> down<00:05:12.620> looks<00:05:12.830> like<00:05:12.890> he's<00:05:13.070> focusing<00:05:13.550> the

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:13.670 
going down looks like he's focusing the

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.700 
going down looks like he's focusing the
pylon<00:05:14.060> big<00:05:14.330> mistake<00:05:14.750> he<00:05:15.140> can<00:05:15.260> even<00:05:15.380> see<00:05:15.590> this

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
pylon big mistake he can even see this

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.990 
pylon big mistake he can even see this
pile<00:05:15.890> on<00:05:16.040> up<00:05:16.190> here<00:05:16.370> so<00:05:16.550> he's<00:05:16.670> going<00:05:16.760> to<00:05:16.820> try<00:05:16.970> to

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
pile on up here so he's going to try to

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.850 
pile on up here so he's going to try to
kill<00:05:17.240> both<00:05:17.420> the<00:05:17.600> pylons<00:05:17.990> before<00:05:18.380> just<00:05:18.620> killing

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
kill both the pylons before just killing

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.310 
kill both the pylons before just killing

Nexus<00:05:31.580> has<00:05:31.700> gone<00:05:31.910> down<00:05:32.120> here<00:05:32.570> and<00:05:32.720> I'm

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
Nexus has gone down here and I'm

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.600 
Nexus has gone down here and I'm
actually<00:05:33.320> going<00:05:33.590> to<00:05:33.680> take<00:05:33.860> an<00:05:34.040> expansion

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
actually going to take an expansion

actually going to take an expansion
right<00:05:34.850> here<00:05:35.270> where<00:05:35.840> he<00:05:36.020> was<00:05:36.230> just<00:05:36.590> for<00:05:36.830> fun

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
right here where he was just for fun

on<00:05:39.200> three<00:05:39.380> games<00:05:39.710> those<00:05:40.400> zealots<00:05:40.640> have<00:05:40.880> been

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
on three games those zealots have been

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.120 
on three games those zealots have been
defeated<00:05:41.360> and<00:05:41.660> it<00:05:41.810> looks<00:05:41.990> like<00:05:42.200> he<00:05:43.100> is

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
defeated and it looks like he is

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.440 
defeated and it looks like he is
spending<00:05:43.430> the<00:05:43.580> rest<00:05:43.760> of<00:05:43.910> his<00:05:44.000> money<00:05:44.180> on

building<00:05:44.720> some<00:05:44.990> zealots<00:05:45.200> because<00:05:45.590> he<00:05:45.710> has

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
building some zealots because he has

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.280 
building some zealots because he has
been<00:05:46.040> destroyed<00:05:46.400> completely<00:05:46.760> here<00:05:47.390> so<00:05:48.080> has

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.290 
been destroyed completely here so has

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.930 
been destroyed completely here so has
breyer<00:05:48.620> resent<00:05:49.280> him<00:05:49.430> we're<00:05:49.670> going<00:05:49.700> to<00:05:49.880> be

a<00:05:51.740> nexus<00:05:52.070> up<00:05:52.250> and<00:05:52.490> look<00:05:53.000> at<00:05:53.120> that<00:05:53.210> perfect

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
a nexus up and look at that perfect

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.290 
a nexus up and look at that perfect
range<00:05:53.990> just<00:05:54.800> in<00:05:55.010> range<00:05:55.280> of<00:05:55.490> those<00:05:55.760> marines<00:05:56.120> in

range just in range of those marines in

range just in range of those marines in
that<00:05:56.480> bunker<00:05:56.810> but<00:05:56.990> they<00:05:57.170> can't<00:05:57.560> quite<00:05:57.920> shoot

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
that bunker but they can't quite shoot

that bunker but they can't quite shoot
back<00:05:58.460> at<00:05:58.490> the<00:05:58.700> cannon<00:05:59.060> so<00:05:59.210> that<00:05:59.390> is<00:05:59.510> perfect

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
back at the cannon so that is perfect

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.780 
back at the cannon so that is perfect

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
you wouldn't be able to shoot it any

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.140 
you wouldn't be able to shoot it any
further<00:06:03.170> ahead<00:06:03.410> he<00:06:04.340> would<00:06:04.490> be<00:06:04.610> attacked<00:06:05.000> by

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
further ahead he would be attacked by

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.640 
further ahead he would be attacked by
those<00:06:05.270> marines<00:06:05.600> but<00:06:05.840> the<00:06:05.990> blue<00:06:06.170> player<00:06:06.380> has

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
those marines but the blue player has

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.010 
those marines but the blue player has
tech<00:06:06.980> two<00:06:07.160> tags<00:06:07.400> which<00:06:08.150> is<00:06:08.300> what<00:06:08.480> he<00:06:08.660> needed<00:06:08.900> to

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
tech two tags which is what he needed to

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.050 
tech two tags which is what he needed to
do<00:06:09.200> to<00:06:09.320> try<00:06:09.500> to<00:06:09.530> stop<00:06:10.070> any<00:06:10.370> more<00:06:10.580> damage<00:06:10.730> from

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.550 
do to try to stop any more damage from
this<00:06:11.240> tank<00:06:11.450> attack<00:06:11.720> but<00:06:11.960> it<00:06:12.050> looks<00:06:12.230> like<00:06:12.380> you

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
this tank attack but it looks like you

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.680 
this tank attack but it looks like you
might<00:06:12.800> lose<00:06:13.010> his<00:06:13.160> orbital<00:06:13.520> command<00:06:13.790> he<00:06:14.450> needs

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
might lose his orbital command he needs

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.750 
might lose his orbital command he needs
that<00:06:14.870> sees<00:06:15.170> research<00:06:15.650> there<00:06:16.010> he<00:06:16.130> goes<00:06:16.310> lifting

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
that sees research there he goes lifting

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.780 
that sees research there he goes lifting
it<00:06:16.850> off<00:06:16.940> will<00:06:17.360> that<00:06:17.540> be<00:06:17.570> destroyed<00:06:18.460> no<00:06:19.460> looks

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:19.790 
it off will that be destroyed no looks

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.820 
it off will that be destroyed no looks
like<00:06:19.940> he's<00:06:20.090> sending<00:06:20.360> up<00:06:20.450> his<00:06:20.750> scvs<00:06:21.200> to<00:06:21.500> do<00:06:21.620> some

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
like he's sending up his scvs to do some

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.959 
like he's sending up his scvs to do some
repairs<00:06:22.190> on<00:06:22.340> that<00:06:22.550> so

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:22.969 
repairs on that so

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:30.709 
down his nexus in between the two sets

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:33.189 
down his nexus in between the two sets
of<00:06:30.860> rocks<00:06:31.279> that<00:06:31.429> is<00:06:31.759> quite<00:06:32.059> hilarious<00:06:32.239> he

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 
of rocks that is quite hilarious he

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:34.749 
of rocks that is quite hilarious he
didn't<00:06:33.769> want<00:06:33.889> to<00:06:33.919> waste<00:06:34.069> time<00:06:34.279> killing<00:06:34.699> the

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:34.759 
didn't want to waste time killing the

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:37.329 
didn't want to waste time killing the
rocks<00:06:34.969> because<00:06:35.709> probes<00:06:36.709> just<00:06:36.979> do<00:06:37.069> not<00:06:37.189> do

00:06:37.329 --> 00:06:37.339 
rocks because probes just do not do

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:39.159 
rocks because probes just do not do
enough<00:06:37.610> damage<00:06:37.669> to<00:06:38.089> it<00:06:38.209> so<00:06:38.360> he's<00:06:38.569> content<00:06:39.079> with

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
enough damage to it so he's content with

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:41.439 
enough damage to it so he's content with
putting<00:06:39.409> it<00:06:39.529> right<00:06:39.679> there<00:06:40.089> kind<00:06:41.089> of<00:06:41.119> funny<00:06:41.269> you

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:41.449 
putting it right there kind of funny you

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:46.659 
putting it right there kind of funny you
never<00:06:41.569> really<00:06:41.809> see<00:06:41.959> that<00:06:45.159> whole<00:06:46.159> bunch<00:06:46.489> of

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:46.669 
never really see that whole bunch of

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:48.789 
never really see that whole bunch of
cannons<00:06:47.029> from<00:06:47.179> iris<00:06:47.659> not<00:06:48.169> really<00:06:48.499> going<00:06:48.619> to<00:06:48.709> be

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:48.799 
cannons from iris not really going to be

00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:50.109 
cannons from iris not really going to be
doing<00:06:48.979> too<00:06:49.279> much<00:06:49.399> you<00:06:49.579> don't<00:06:49.610> really<00:06:49.819> need<00:06:49.999> to

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:50.119 
doing too much you don't really need to

00:06:50.119 --> 00:06:51.819 
doing too much you don't really need to
leap<00:06:50.360> frogs<00:06:50.659> I<00:06:51.019> mean<00:06:51.409> you<00:06:51.469> just<00:06:51.529> need<00:06:51.739> to

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:51.829 
leap frogs I mean you just need to

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:53.350 
leap frogs I mean you just need to
leapfrog<00:06:52.069> you<00:06:52.399> don't<00:06:52.549> need<00:06:52.669> to<00:06:52.759> stack<00:06:52.999> them<00:06:53.179> so

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
leapfrog you don't need to stack them so

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.569 
leapfrog you don't need to stack them so
much<00:06:53.539> like<00:06:53.779> that<00:06:54.049> even<00:06:54.649> I<00:06:54.949> got<00:06:55.129> a<00:06:55.159> little<00:06:55.399> bit

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:55.579 
much like that even I got a little bit

00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:56.829 
much like that even I got a little bit
too<00:06:55.729> many<00:06:55.999> notice<00:06:56.299> how<00:06:56.389> I<00:06:56.419> kind<00:06:56.659> of<00:06:56.689> have<00:06:56.809> a

00:06:56.829 --> 00:06:56.839 
too many notice how I kind of have a

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:59.259 
too many notice how I kind of have a
leap<00:06:57.049> leap<00:06:57.439> leap<00:06:57.499> I<00:06:58.159> probably<00:06:58.699> only<00:06:58.909> need<00:06:59.059> like

00:06:59.259 --> 00:06:59.269 
leap leap leap I probably only need like

00:06:59.269 --> 00:07:00.819 
leap leap leap I probably only need like
one<00:06:59.539> for<00:06:59.749> each<00:06:59.899> of<00:07:00.049> those<00:07:00.169> just<00:07:00.439> because<00:07:00.679> they

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:00.829 
one for each of those just because they

00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:02.399 
one for each of those just because they
didn't<00:07:01.009> really<00:07:01.219> have<00:07:01.399> any<00:07:01.579> forces<00:07:01.969> and

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:02.409 
didn't really have any forces and

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:05.199 
didn't really have any forces and
especially<00:07:03.409> with<00:07:03.679> only<00:07:03.860> one<00:07:04.129> Terran<00:07:04.579> you<00:07:04.999> need

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:05.209 
especially with only one Terran you need

00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:06.959 
especially with only one Terran you need
a<00:07:05.239> lot<00:07:05.419> of<00:07:05.539> Marines<00:07:05.659> to<00:07:05.929> kill<00:07:06.110> a<00:07:06.139> cannon<00:07:06.589> so

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:06.969 
a lot of Marines to kill a cannon so

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:08.949 
a lot of Marines to kill a cannon so
yeah<00:07:07.969> I<00:07:07.999> probably<00:07:08.269> didn't<00:07:08.539> need<00:07:08.629> to<00:07:08.749> waste

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:08.959 
yeah I probably didn't need to waste

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:10.989 
yeah I probably didn't need to waste
that<00:07:09.199> much<00:07:09.469> money<00:07:09.619> on<00:07:09.889> those<00:07:10.069> cannons<00:07:10.579> even

00:07:10.989 --> 00:07:10.999 
that much money on those cannons even

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:12.729 
that much money on those cannons even
these<00:07:11.119> cannons<00:07:11.599> that's<00:07:11.749> quite<00:07:11.989> a<00:07:12.019> bit<00:07:12.199> too<00:07:12.439> so

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:12.739 
these cannons that's quite a bit too so

00:07:12.739 --> 00:07:15.039 
these cannons that's quite a bit too so
we're<00:07:13.519> very<00:07:13.549> heavy<00:07:14.149> on<00:07:14.329> the<00:07:14.449> cannons<00:07:14.809> and

00:07:15.039 --> 00:07:15.049 
we're very heavy on the cannons and

00:07:15.049 --> 00:07:16.839 
we're very heavy on the cannons and
because<00:07:15.469> we<00:07:15.619> have<00:07:15.799> these<00:07:15.949> defenses<00:07:16.579> well

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:16.849 
because we have these defenses well

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:18.549 
because we have these defenses well
might<00:07:17.149> as<00:07:17.179> well<00:07:17.449> put<00:07:17.659> down<00:07:17.779> Nexus<00:07:18.199> at<00:07:18.379> their

00:07:18.549 --> 00:07:18.559 
might as well put down Nexus at their

00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:20.350 
might as well put down Nexus at their
base<00:07:18.709> which<00:07:18.979> is<00:07:19.129> what<00:07:19.309> i'm<00:07:19.429> doing<00:07:19.789> a<00:07:19.939> nexus

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:20.360 
base which is what i'm doing a nexus

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.539 
base which is what i'm doing a nexus
without<00:07:20.719> a<00:07:20.749> rally<00:07:21.199> point<00:07:21.499> from<00:07:21.829> the<00:07:21.979> probe<00:07:22.249> so

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:22.549 
without a rally point from the probe so

00:07:22.549 --> 00:07:24.939 
without a rally point from the probe so
that<00:07:22.759> is<00:07:22.909> process<00:07:23.389> right<00:07:23.569> there<00:07:23.769> now<00:07:24.769> I'm

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:24.949 
that is process right there now I'm

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:26.649 
that is process right there now I'm
putting<00:07:25.099> up<00:07:25.369> my<00:07:25.489> Gateway<00:07:25.909> just<00:07:26.239> now<00:07:26.389> getting

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:26.659 
putting up my Gateway just now getting

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:28.359 
putting up my Gateway just now getting
my<00:07:26.779> to<00:07:26.839> gas<00:07:27.229> I<00:07:27.499> have<00:07:27.679> some<00:07:27.889> enormous

00:07:28.359 --> 00:07:28.369 
my to gas I have some enormous

00:07:28.369 --> 00:07:30.429 
my to gas I have some enormous
saturation<00:07:29.119> right<00:07:29.269> there<00:07:29.509> looks<00:07:30.139> like<00:07:30.259> that

00:07:30.429 --> 00:07:30.439 
saturation right there looks like that

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:33.009 
saturation right there looks like that
probe<00:07:30.800> is<00:07:31.129> oh<00:07:31.429> that<00:07:31.610> probe<00:07:31.819> is<00:07:31.999> uh<00:07:32.059> I<00:07:32.539> like<00:07:32.899> with

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:33.019 
probe is oh that probe is uh I like with

00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:34.269
