touch<00:00:23.910> 5th<00:00:24.300> generation<00:00:24.510> with<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.140> larger

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
touch 5th generation with the larger

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.679 
touch 5th generation with the larger
4-inch<00:00:25.830> display<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.430> not<00:00:26.910> optimized<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.599> you

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
4-inch display is not optimized so you

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.599 
4-inch display is not optimized so you
won't<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:27.960> able<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.170> take<00:00:28.349> advantage<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.030 
won't be able to take advantage of the
full<00:00:29.789> screen<00:00:30.090> videos<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.859> definitely

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
full screen videos so this is definitely

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.590 
full screen videos so this is definitely
a<00:00:32.219> great<00:00:32.369> alternative<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.300> say<00:00:33.480> I'm

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600
