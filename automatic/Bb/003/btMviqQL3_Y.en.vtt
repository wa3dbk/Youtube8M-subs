 Hello everyone, we will fry cucumbers today 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.870
 just thinking about yes the phrase fry cucumbers 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.859
 pirates trust open as 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:15.839
 fry cucumbers 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:17.730
 then eat cucumbers cucumbers when reprise 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.279
 positive i want to get along with 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.529
 I openly said yes kholoditsy as it were 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.000
 together we will try what it is 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.490
 really and how it tastes but you 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.130
 You know how I have some 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.100
 suspicion as if zucchini and cucumbers 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.960
 they are not far from each other although cucumbers 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.390
 much lower zucchini day 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.690
 but it seems to me that she will be somewhere 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.280
 I'm close to each other dishes look well 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.320
 but even as the jerk did not 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.980
 interesting then we will make dishes in 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.190
 Japanese style with variations of teriyaki sauce 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.850
 we will have these japanese fried 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.910
 cucumbers 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.710
 so first thing the streets of the cucumber zhopki up 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.120
 front rear rear generally trim 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.540
 all that you think is superfluous 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.670
 extreme points then chop cucumber not 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.200
 very thick bars principle here 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.200
 then control and over it into eight parts 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.710
 that is, the edge will need to be cut 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.439
 straws 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:27.689
 only fat and so on you should 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.640
 prepared other agents in advance 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.250
 before the taxi we will do very quickly 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.780
 literally the whole cooking procedure on 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.829
 It will take literally a minute 4 from here. 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.900
 should not be respected 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.060
 and then not unleashed to porridge 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.590
 last daen then handy on must 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.500
 be soy sauce sesame red ground 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.640
 pepper 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.979
 horseradish mustard up 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.950
 mustard ideally fashion for the year of wasabi but 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.770
 she is fleeting fits smoked 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.799
 garlic which is now finely chopped and 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:02.990
 of course cooking oil which options 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.990
 far you sanded continue 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.009
 and we do zhopki what exactly on Huts 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.080
 pan pouring oil until minced - 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.730
 short 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.900
 pour oil or pour oil then 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.670
 we wait while it is warmed up 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.670
 let such a multi 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:36.450
 all the sofa is very fast everything is at hand 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.450
 yes nobody in the area of ​​a teaspoon of flour you 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:45.600
 facades 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.600
 about 3 teaspoons 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.230
 these things or vodka wine 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.620
 assembly 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.620
 by hands 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.920
 and the whole thing from tsuma take 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.840
 a total of this bind 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.730
 tornado is four minutes by the way me 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:23.030
 it seems worth the sauce is worth adding as 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:27.109
 go famous but here should be 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.060
 strong enough principle here is someone 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.159
 fret 11th pan on the idea wog 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.900
 I don't know what's called here and we are all very 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:35.030
 gets very hot and roasts fast 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:43.579
 I came not one time dish 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:46.609
 dumb she can better bush 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.000
 and can be fried patient is not our 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.730
 dish 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.829
 all may be well, let us wait until 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.019
 cool and then try we thought 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:04:03.219
 decided to try this dish for two 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:03.219
 and measured nerves fried cabbage rolls 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.040
 crunch 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.730
 on top of 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.900
 soft shell 5 on zucchini looks like 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:24.160
 marinated zucchini 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:26.470
 to chat on the early taste of course 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.200
 pretty kind of here if not 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.960
 although it 's nice, I don't know 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:39.370
 so more herbaceous with spices here 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:42.250
 so personally my opinion here is such a dish on 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.729
 there is no taste in my kitchen 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.889
 peculiar but when compared 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.150
 something of a series of stewed stewed 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.040
 zucchini there or 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.090
 this zucchini dish only barrels 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:05:00.100
 look much nicer here freshness 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:02.380
 there are no cucumbers 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.470
 translate cucumbers so better let's say here 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.850
 with the same wakame seaweed 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.270
 some kind of salad that was refreshing 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.850
 10 for summer for summer dish absolutely 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:19.710
 not pulling and pulling 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:22.500
 but let's say no rolls 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:27.190
 here I would add all the same 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.760
 I finished it got tolyatti mask 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.370
 possesses 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.370
 the taste is so slightly freshly obtained 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.910
 on in general all the same we have this dish 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.860
 set aside for your discussion 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.470
 try to get ready to succeed very 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.330
 tight yes everything is very simple such 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.300
 little advice add more acid 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:53.169
 so cucumbers have more cyst 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.720
 It was so nice I was add 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.539
 a little acid samara dish was more 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.910
 so sharp because now it’s up to 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.970
 freshly reviewed 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.680
 looks but generally to taste garlic temple 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.790
 in principle, it will be possible to call 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.890
 now he has them a little bit 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:12.000
 felt he lost culture 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:15.420
 I opened well what else I wanted to say 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.640
 before now managed a nice hello i 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.670
 I'll take it, but it seems that it does not burn much 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:31.320
 but if we look at the tables like 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:33.660
 refreshingly my heart association 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.430
 to the palace a refreshing dish this summer 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.990
 a dish that can be well if not on 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.820
 childhood even there get me drunk 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:41.250
 get drunk well at least a good snack 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.390
 moisture here should be all the same summer 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.600
 refreshing salads 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:48.840
 and here it turns out some kind of conservation 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.360
 incomprehensible that well, I even 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.480
 now he recalls even now thought 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:58.820
 know exactly what kind of beans 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:07:02.730
 by the way incidentally bean beans very 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:06.270
 her think yes yes yes there are very zucchini. 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:08.520
 well, why transfer cucumbers to once again for 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:12.270
 imitation of another dish i'm beans more expensive 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:14.820
 I do not see the point beans even yes I agree 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:17.700
 all right let's cook try 

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:20.190
 not everything is so bad then tell yourself 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.610
 is it worth it or not answered yes gone bye 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:27.140
 I have washed a lot almost half already 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:27.140
 an attack is a good good 

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:33.620
 cook and you and your comments by 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.430

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:39.720
 unusual underwater casket 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:43.280
