00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
 all right 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.270
 welcome to the audible version of the 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:17.710
 endodontic notes this sound resource 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.740
 is a complement to the page of 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.140
 Internet that you have consulted was developed 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.970
 by doctor ricardo rivas muÃ±oz of the 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.580
 faculty of higher education iztacala 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.839
 of the National Autonomous University of 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:34.660
 Mexico and second unit morphology of the 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:36.550
 thumb cavity the topic that I'm going to read is 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.530
 that of the morphology of the second prize 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.809
 The upper lingual view 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.520
 radiographic will reveal the reduced 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.920
 distal middle width of the cavity 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.100
 thumb the curvature seen apical in the 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.710
 34 percent of the time and one 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.140
 axial tilt of 19 degrees 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.840
 tooth morphological details that do not 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.120
 will be visible in the radiograph 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.859
 height of the horns 'blame' is the 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.649
 great width of the pulp chamber and 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:05.110
 root canal greater ovoid 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.700
 in palatal vestibule sense what 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.520
 reveals that the pulp is shaped like 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.740
 lane lynn or axial angulation of 9 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.780
 degrees of the tooth at the apical level 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.090
 ducts are progressively made more 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.050
 circular the average length of the 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.780
 tooth is weak 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.500
 millimeters a single conduit with a 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.650
 apical hole in 75% two ducts 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.950
 with two apical holes is in 24% 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.190
 three ducts at 1% as far as the 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:37.180
 Root curvature is straight in 9.5 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.820
 percent curve distal at 27% curve 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.700
 initial at 1.6 percent curve 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.640
 labial in the 12.7 percent curve 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.430
 lingual in 4% curve in bayonet in the 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.770
 20.6 percent thumb camera 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.870
 presents form similar to that of the first 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.450
 senior prize although seniors 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.700
 dimensions has two extensions that 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.370
 they harbor the pulpal horns that have 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.890
 dimensions almost equal the conduit 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.870
 radicular in some teeth can 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.940
 there is a dentine bug that divides 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.100
 the conduit in two that can be 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.200
 completely separated or can 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.750
 convert forming a single apex 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.380
 form after the central incisor 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.600
 lower 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.990
 this is the tooth that presents the highest 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.100
 percentage of curvature toward vestibular 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.959
 clinical consequences of anatomy 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.890
 pulp for an endodontic treatment 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.350
 favor 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.780
 in the second prize the superior is more 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.110
 width in the lingual hallway direction that 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.760
 in the distal middle it has 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.720
 approximately the same 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.930
 characteristics of the first prize lar 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.350
 superior can have a two or three 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.870
 roots or conduits may exist two or 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.360
 three ducts in a single root when 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.400
 a single root canal is planned is 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.890
 very easy to miss the second 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.380
 root canal if it does not appear in the 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.630
 radiography can be found through 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.760
 of a successful camera scan 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.500
 blame or watching the angle of the 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.840
 first file placed in the conduit 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.330
 radicular proximity to the maxillary sinus 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.180
 makes the bayonet curve more 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.980
 frequent this is all for now for 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.000
 see the illustrations on the subject and the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:16.810
 bibliography should consult the site 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.630
 www point is every point a mx point mx 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.820
 diagonal was rivas but if what you want 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.160
 is to continue forward move to the next 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.470
 electronic page and will continue listening 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.130
