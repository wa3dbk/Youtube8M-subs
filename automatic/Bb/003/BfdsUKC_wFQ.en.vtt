00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
they go back many many many years they

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.899 
they go back many many many years they
show<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.619> combination<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.280> indigenous

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909

different<00:03:48.120> about<00:03:48.150> most<00:03:48.690> mass<00:03:49.079> exhibitions<00:03:49.859> is

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
different about most mass exhibitions is

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.310 
different about most mass exhibitions is
that<00:03:50.730> usually<00:03:51.239> their<00:03:51.480> prominence<00:03:52.079> that

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
that usually their prominence that

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.960 
that usually their prominence that
extend<00:03:52.829> point<00:03:53.160> so<00:03:53.340> you're<00:03:53.519> just<00:03:53.640> kind<00:03:53.910> of

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
extend point so you're just kind of

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.880 
extend point so you're just kind of
referencing<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.780> design<00:03:55.200> elements<00:03:55.829> that

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
referencing the design elements that

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.460 
referencing the design elements that
constitute<00:03:56.190> this<00:03:56.790> object<00:03:57.030> but<00:03:57.959> this

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
constitute this object but this

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.390 
constitute this object but this
exhibition<00:04:00.170> contextualizes<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.890> object

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
exhibition contextualizes the object

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.270 
exhibition contextualizes the object
itself<00:04:02.730> so<00:04:03.209> how<00:04:03.780> it's<00:04:04.079> being<00:04:04.320> used<00:04:04.680> where<00:04:05.070> it's

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
itself so how it's being used where it's

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.960 
itself so how it's being used where it's
being<00:04:05.549> used

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
being used

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.440 
being used
it's<00:04:06.329> very<00:04:06.989> sense<00:04:07.380> oriole<00:04:08.010> experience<00:04:08.700> the
