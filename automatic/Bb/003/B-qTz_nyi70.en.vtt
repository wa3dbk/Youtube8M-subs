00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.020 

now<00:00:01.079> look<00:00:01.230> at<00:00:01.350> this<00:00:01.530> what<00:00:02.310> is<00:00:02.460> the<00:00:02.580> effect<00:00:02.850> on

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
now look at this what is the effect on

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.120 
now look at this what is the effect on
line<00:00:03.600> utilization<00:00:04.319> if<00:00:04.500> you<00:00:04.710> increase<00:00:05.009> the

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
line utilization if you increase the

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.130 
line utilization if you increase the
number<00:00:05.430> of<00:00:05.460> frames<00:00:05.850> for<00:00:06.120> a<00:00:06.299> constant<00:00:06.960> message

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
number of frames for a constant message

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.820 
number of frames for a constant message
size<00:00:07.849> so<00:00:08.849> one<00:00:09.719> thing<00:00:09.900> that<00:00:09.929> you<00:00:10.349> you<00:00:10.620> should<00:00:10.800> be

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
size so one thing that you you should be

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.370 
size so one thing that you you should be
clear<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.309> on<00:00:11.550> line<00:00:12.420> utilization<00:00:13.110> there's

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
clear is on line utilization there's

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.039 
clear is on line utilization there's
talking<00:00:13.860> about<00:00:14.099> one<00:00:14.309> line<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:15.179> one<00:00:15.540> line<00:00:15.719> could

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
talking about one line so one line could

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.480 
talking about one line so one line could
be<00:00:17.240> the<00:00:18.240> best<00:00:18.539> thing<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.869> assume<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.439> that

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
be the best thing to assume is that

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.070 
be the best thing to assume is that
there<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.609> only<00:00:20.730> one<00:00:21.060> line<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
there is only one line so this is the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.109 
there is only one line so this is the
assumption<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.500> am<00:00:22.529> making<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.070> am<00:00:23.400> NOT<00:00:23.640> thinking

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
assumption I am making I am NOT thinking

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.540 
assumption I am making I am NOT thinking
that<00:00:24.300> there<00:00:24.900> are<00:00:25.019> various<00:00:25.470> hops<00:00:25.859> or<00:00:26.220> various

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
that there are various hops or various

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.730 
that there are various hops or various
features<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.300> way<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.930> reason<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.349> they

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
features on the way the reason is they

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.290 
features on the way the reason is they
didn't<00:00:29.010> mention<00:00:29.250> anything<00:00:29.460> therefore<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
didn't mention anything therefore the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.939 
didn't mention anything therefore the
best<00:00:30.480> resumption<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.320> could<00:00:31.500> make<00:00:31.740> is

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
best resumption that you could make is

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.040 
best resumption that you could make is
line<00:00:32.640> utilization<00:00:33.239> means<00:00:33.450> they<00:00:33.630> are<00:00:33.690> talking

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
line utilization means they are talking

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.470 
line utilization means they are talking
about<00:00:34.140> one<00:00:34.500> line<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.950> second<00:00:35.489> thing<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.790> line

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
about one line and second thing is line

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.510 
about one line and second thing is line
utilization<00:00:37.110> or<00:00:37.370> centralization<00:00:38.370> or

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
utilization or centralization or

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.139 
utilization or centralization or
efficiency<00:00:39.360> all<00:00:39.570> are<00:00:39.809> same<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.730> keep<00:00:42.000> it

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
efficiency all are same so you keep it

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.619 
efficiency all are same so you keep it
in<00:00:42.270> mind

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
in mind

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.420 
in mind
line<00:00:43.440> utilization<00:00:44.160> or<00:00:45.710> sender<00:00:46.710> utilization

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
line utilization or sender utilization

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:57.130 
line utilization or sender utilization
or<00:00:50.449> link<00:00:51.449> utilization<00:00:53.660> link<00:00:54.660> utilization<00:00:54.870> or

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
or link utilization link utilization or

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.729 
or link utilization link utilization or
efficiency<00:00:58.140> all<00:00:58.410> are<00:00:58.890> same<00:01:00.140> right<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.620> now

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
efficiency all are same right so now

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.549 
efficiency all are same right so now
what<00:01:01.920> they're<00:01:02.160> trying<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.430> do<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:03.409> what<00:01:04.409> they

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
what they're trying to do is what they

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.410 
what they're trying to do is what they
want<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.010> talk<00:01:05.309> about<00:01:05.369> line<00:01:05.820> equation

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
want to talk about line equation

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.850 
want to talk about line equation
therefore<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.780> am<00:01:07.080> assuming<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.560> there<00:01:07.770> is

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
therefore I am assuming that there is

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.399 
therefore I am assuming that there is
only<00:01:07.950> one<00:01:08.220> line<00:01:08.430> instead<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.479> taking<00:01:10.229> many

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
only one line instead of taking many

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.780 
only one line instead of taking many
hops<00:01:10.710> because<00:01:11.070> they<00:01:11.159> did<00:01:11.310> mention<00:01:11.490> anything

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
hops because they did mention anything

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.179 
hops because they did mention anything
there<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.360> second<00:01:13.170> thing<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.409> if<00:01:13.619> we<00:01:13.830> increase

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
there and second thing is if we increase

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.429 
there and second thing is if we increase
the<00:01:14.369> number<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.850> frames<00:01:15.270> for<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.750> constant

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
the number of frames for a constant

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.710 
the number of frames for a constant
message<00:01:16.680> size<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.939> they<00:01:18.090> are<00:01:18.150> talking<00:01:18.330> about<00:01:18.689> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
message size so they are talking about a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.630 
message size so they are talking about a
constant<00:01:19.350> message<00:01:19.530> size<00:01:19.920> which<00:01:20.189> means<00:01:20.430> they

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
constant message size which means they

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.090 
constant message size which means they
do<00:01:20.790> not<00:01:20.909> want<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.210> send<00:01:21.420> many<00:01:21.659> messages<00:01:22.100> they

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
do not want to send many messages they

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.410 
do not want to send many messages they
want<00:01:23.369> they<00:01:23.640> are<00:01:23.700> talking<00:01:23.880> about<00:01:24.119> only<00:01:24.240> one

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
want they are talking about only one

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.390 
want they are talking about only one
message<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.290> when<00:01:25.710> they<00:01:25.830> are<00:01:25.860> talking<00:01:26.189> about

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
message so when they are talking about

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.190 
message so when they are talking about
constant<00:01:27.090> message<00:01:27.420> says<00:01:27.600> here<00:01:27.810> also<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.110> am

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
constant message says here also I am

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.260 
constant message says here also I am
assuming<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.619> they<00:01:29.340> are<00:01:29.369> sending<00:01:29.670> only<00:01:29.970> one

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
assuming that they are sending only one

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.850 
assuming that they are sending only one
message<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.869> they<00:01:31.110> are<00:01:31.170> talking<00:01:31.380> about<00:01:31.590> this

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
message and they are talking about this

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.710 
message and they are talking about this
message<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.670> what<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.850> visited<00:01:33.299> because<00:01:33.479> I

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
message that is what I visited because I

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.030 
message that is what I visited because I
do<00:01:33.780> not<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:33.960> any<00:01:34.170> clue<00:01:34.439> about<00:01:34.560> how<00:01:34.860> many

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
do not have any clue about how many

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.219 
do not have any clue about how many
messages<00:01:35.369> they<00:01:35.640> are<00:01:35.670> sending<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.210> what<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.990> T

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
messages they are sending and what is T

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.039 
messages they are sending and what is T
T<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.560> what<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.920> T<00:01:38.159> P<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.939> cannot<00:01:39.780> assume

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
T and what is T P so I cannot assume

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.960 
T and what is T P so I cannot assume
anything<00:01:40.439> else<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.729> what<00:01:41.939> I

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
anything else this is this is what I

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.429 
anything else this is this is what I
could<00:01:42.299> come<00:01:42.509> up<00:01:42.540> with<00:01:42.689> from<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.170> question

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
could come up with from this question

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.050 
could come up with from this question
because<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.159> do<00:01:44.220> not<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.430> any<00:01:44.579> other<00:01:44.759> pre

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
because I do not have any other pre

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.679 
because I do not have any other pre
about<00:01:45.360> it

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
about it

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.740 
about it
so<00:01:46.200> now<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:47.430> frame<00:01:47.790> they<00:01:48.299> are<00:01:48.360> talking<00:01:48.600> about

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
so now the frame they are talking about

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.770 
so now the frame they are talking about
if<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.439> entire<00:01:49.890> frame<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.460> sent<00:01:50.850> all<00:01:51.149> at<00:01:51.509> once

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
if this entire frame is sent all at once

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.830 
if this entire frame is sent all at once
or<00:01:52.049> if<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.619> sent<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.460> broken<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:54.060> two<00:01:54.240> parts

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.289 
or if the sent it is broken in two parts
and<00:01:54.960> then<00:01:55.290> sent<00:01:55.619> either<00:01:56.219> if<00:01:56.610> they<00:01:56.729> send<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.119> all

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
and then sent either if they send it all

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.780 
and then sent either if they send it all
at<00:01:57.450> once<00:01:57.689> or<00:01:58.020> if<00:01:58.170> they<00:01:58.320> break<00:01:58.560> into<00:01:59.009> pieces<00:01:59.579> and

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
at once or if they break into pieces and

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.789 
at once or if they break into pieces and
send<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.240> obviously<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.229> efficiency<00:02:01.740> is

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
send it obviously the efficiency is

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.139 
send it obviously the efficiency is
going<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.219> same<00:02:02.430> because<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.909> total

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
going to be same because the total

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.969 
going to be same because the total
amount<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.570> data<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.170> transmitted<00:02:04.829> at

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
amount of data that is transmitted at

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.770 
amount of data that is transmitted at
the<00:02:05.100> total<00:02:05.399> transmission<00:02:05.790> time<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.090> same<00:02:06.450> so

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
the total transmission time is same so

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.199 
the total transmission time is same so
we<00:02:07.049> don't<00:02:07.530> we<00:02:07.740> cannot<00:02:07.950> do<00:02:08.069> anything<00:02:08.399> much<00:02:08.580> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
we don't we cannot do anything much the

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.690 
we don't we cannot do anything much the
efficiency<00:02:09.929> doesn't<00:02:10.349> vary<00:02:10.649> or<00:02:10.950> if<00:02:11.250> there<00:02:11.670> is

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
efficiency doesn't vary or if there is

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.580 
efficiency doesn't vary or if there is
no<00:02:11.790> relation<00:02:12.300> with

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
efficiency and the frame size but then

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.780 
efficiency and the frame size but then
there<00:02:15.530> are<00:02:15.620> various<00:02:16.069> things<00:02:16.310> that<00:02:16.459> you<00:02:16.640> should

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
there are various things that you should

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.430 
there are various things that you should
take<00:02:17.030> into<00:02:17.209> consideration<00:02:17.780> here<00:02:17.989> so<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.319> am

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
take into consideration here so I am

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.680 
take into consideration here so I am
talking<00:02:18.769> about<00:02:18.800> or<00:02:19.430> there<00:02:19.879> is<00:02:20.000> relation<00:02:20.450> but

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
talking about or there is relation but

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.690 
talking about or there is relation but
then<00:02:20.900> D<00:02:21.590> is<00:02:21.739> not<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.099> option<00:02:24.010> no<00:02:25.010> change<00:02:25.489> in

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
then D is not the option no change in

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.790

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
there is no change right so lower line

there is no change right so lower line

whatever<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.660> is<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:57.049> always<00:02:57.530> see<00:02:57.769> that<00:02:57.799> in

whatever it is you always see that in

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:00.379 
the denominator there is L by B isn't it

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.979 
the denominator there is L by B isn't it
serious<00:03:01.099> so<00:03:01.670> what<00:03:01.879> is<00:03:02.000> efficiency<00:03:02.629> I<00:03:02.660> told<00:03:02.870> you

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
serious so what is efficiency I told you

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.819 
serious so what is efficiency I told you
1<00:03:03.560> upon<00:03:03.920> 1<00:03:03.950> plus<00:03:04.250> 2<00:03:04.940> into<00:03:05.120> T<00:03:05.810> P<00:03:06.019> by<00:03:06.170> T<00:03:06.410> T<00:03:06.560> what<00:03:06.799> is

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
1 upon 1 plus 2 into T P by T T what is

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.180 
1 upon 1 plus 2 into T P by T T what is
T<00:03:07.160> P<00:03:07.370> T<00:03:07.760> by<00:03:07.970> V<00:03:08.180> into<00:03:08.450> what<00:03:08.750> is<00:03:08.930> T<00:03:09.170> T<00:03:09.349> L<00:03:09.890> by<00:03:10.160> B

T P T by V into what is T T L by B

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.650 
T P T by V into what is T T L by B
therefore<00:03:10.610> you<00:03:10.790> are<00:03:10.819> going<00:03:11.030> to<00:03:11.090> write<00:03:11.180> it<00:03:11.299> as<00:03:11.420> B

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
therefore you are going to write it as B

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.509 
therefore you are going to write it as B
by<00:03:11.840> L<00:03:11.989> obviously<00:03:12.709> as<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:13.010> length<00:03:13.220> increases

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
by L obviously as the length increases

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.339 
by L obviously as the length increases
the<00:03:14.180> length<00:03:14.329> of<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.660> frame<00:03:14.840> increases

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
the length of the frame increases

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.020 
the length of the frame increases
efficiency<00:03:15.680> is<00:03:16.340> supposed<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.790> increase

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
efficiency is supposed to increase

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.300 
efficiency is supposed to increase
therefore<00:03:17.450> we<00:03:17.780> cannot<00:03:18.079> say<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.319> there<00:03:18.620> is<00:03:18.769> no

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
therefore we cannot say that there is no

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.590 
therefore we cannot say that there is no
relation<00:03:19.639> between<00:03:19.670> line<00:03:20.000> efficiency<00:03:20.239> and

relation between line efficiency and

relation between line efficiency and
frame<00:03:20.810> size<00:03:21.079> it<00:03:21.319> is<00:03:21.620> not<00:03:21.980> right<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:22.790> in<00:03:23.150> this<00:03:23.359> in

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
frame size it is not right so in this in

this particular situation in this

this particular situation in this
particular<00:03:25.459> circumstances<00:03:26.420> we<00:03:26.660> can<00:03:26.810> say<00:03:26.989> that

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
particular circumstances we can say that

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.440 
particular circumstances we can say that
either<00:03:27.920> you<00:03:28.190> send<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.549> entire<00:03:28.700> message<00:03:29.120> at

either you send the entire message at

either you send the entire message at

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.170 
once or you break it into parts and send
it<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.450> line<00:03:32.660> efficiency<00:03:32.930> is<00:03:33.380> going<00:03:33.739> to<00:03:33.889> be

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
it the line efficiency is going to be

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.420 
it the line efficiency is going to be
the<00:03:35.180> same<00:03:35.930> it<00:03:36.200> is<00:03:36.260> not<00:03:36.380> there<00:03:36.620> is<00:03:36.739> no<00:03:36.889> there<00:03:37.310> is

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
the same it is not there is no there is

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.000 
the same it is not there is no there is
no<00:03:37.609> much<00:03:37.819> change<00:03:38.120> but<00:03:38.810> then<00:03:39.019> in<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.440> topic<00:03:39.829> of

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
no much change but then in the topic of

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.400 
no much change but then in the topic of
message<00:03:40.459> fishing<00:03:40.880> I<00:03:41.000> told<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:41.329> that<00:03:41.540> if<00:03:41.750> there

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
message fishing I told you that if there

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.309 
message fishing I told you that if there
are<00:03:42.560> various<00:03:43.099> switches<00:03:43.459> and<00:03:43.970> then<00:03:44.569> if<00:03:44.840> you<00:03:45.109> do

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
are various switches and then if you do

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.920 
are various switches and then if you do
send<00:03:46.280> a<00:03:46.459> message<00:03:46.790> into<00:03:46.970> many<00:03:47.239> packets<00:03:47.750> then

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
send a message into many packets then

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.930 
send a message into many packets then
that<00:03:48.049> is<00:03:48.139> going<00:03:48.349> to<00:03:48.410> be<00:03:48.470> beneficial<00:03:48.829> but<00:03:49.730> then

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
that is going to be beneficial but then

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.699 
that is going to be beneficial but then
here<00:03:50.209> given<00:03:50.540> one<00:03:50.750> link<00:03:51.019> it<00:03:51.139> is<00:03:51.230> not<00:03:51.440> going<00:03:51.650> to

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
here given one link it is not going to

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.370 
here given one link it is not going to
be<00:03:51.769> beneficial<00:03:51.919> right<00:03:52.639> so<00:03:53.180> what<00:03:53.900> I<00:03:53.930> mean<00:03:54.230> to

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
be beneficial right so what I mean to

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.640 
be beneficial right so what I mean to
say<00:03:54.410> is<00:03:54.739> if<00:03:55.040> it<00:03:55.250> is<00:03:55.280> a<00:03:55.430> kind<00:03:55.819> of<00:03:56.650> circuits

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
say is if it is a kind of circuits

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.500 
say is if it is a kind of circuits
fishing<00:03:58.040> circuit<00:03:58.489> switching<00:03:58.819> means<00:03:59.030> one<00:03:59.329> line

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
fishing circuit switching means one line

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.509 
fishing circuit switching means one line
is<00:03:59.720> there<00:03:59.959> then<00:04:00.500> always<00:04:00.709> you<00:04:01.040> go<00:04:01.220> with<00:04:01.400> the

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
is there then always you go with the

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.909 
is there then always you go with the
entire<00:04:01.849> net<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.239> push<00:04:02.540> it<00:04:02.720> all<00:04:02.959> at<00:04:03.169> once<00:04:03.410> if<00:04:03.709> it

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
entire net and push it all at once if it

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.770 
entire net and push it all at once if it
is<00:04:04.010> a<00:04:04.069> kind<00:04:04.340> of<00:04:04.579> four<00:04:04.849> message<00:04:05.209> fishing<00:04:05.599> which

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
is a kind of four message fishing which

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.390 
is a kind of four message fishing which
means<00:04:05.989> if<00:04:06.109> there<00:04:06.230> are<00:04:06.319> many<00:04:06.530> hops<00:04:06.859> on<00:04:07.130> the<00:04:07.280> way

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
means if there are many hops on the way

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.940 
means if there are many hops on the way
and<00:04:07.639> you<00:04:08.419> know<00:04:08.450> it<00:04:08.630> is<00:04:08.720> better<00:04:08.930> that<00:04:09.079> you<00:04:09.530> go

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
and you know it is better that you go

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.860 
and you know it is better that you go
with<00:04:10.130> many<00:04:10.340> packets<00:04:10.790> so<00:04:11.120> according<00:04:11.690> to<00:04:11.750> the

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
with many packets so according to the

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.030 
with many packets so according to the
question<00:04:12.079> I<00:04:12.260> am<00:04:12.349> assuming<00:04:12.560> that<00:04:12.769> there<00:04:13.010> is

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
question I am assuming that there is

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.890 
question I am assuming that there is
only<00:04:13.280> one<00:04:13.549> link<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:14.030> there<00:04:14.569> is<00:04:14.660> only<00:04:14.780> one

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
only one link and there is only one

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.690 
only one link and there is only one
message<00:04:15.410> for<00:04:15.680> that<00:04:15.859> there<00:04:16.039> is<00:04:16.130> no<00:04:16.280> change<00:04:16.549> in

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
message for that there is no change in

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.240 
message for that there is no change in
the<00:04:16.880> link<00:04:17.630> utilization<00:04:17.840> if<00:04:18.380> any<00:04:19.039> more

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
the link utilization if any more

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.039 
the link utilization if any more
information<00:04:19.609> is<00:04:20.000> given<00:04:20.180> then<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:20.599> answer

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
information is given then the answer

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.640 
information is given then the answer
would<00:04:21.169> change<00:04:21.530> definitely<00:04:22.340> right
