00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hi welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.660
 task mister vigorous reviews today 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.340
 I want the new one together with you 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.250
 grow iso desiree 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.840
 The series is a ladies watch with a 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.840
 quartz plant remains on 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.360
 We would only be packing these 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.910
 first consists of an outer 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:28.290
 packaging made of a kind of carton or 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:31.320
 Thick paper is on this packaging 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:34.050
 the timeline of the watches depict the 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.210
 history of the different models the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.449
 Not being recognized becomes so important 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.449
 were 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.890
 because he is the one of interesting the outer 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.330
 packaging 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:52.199
 That, in turn, is more interesting 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:55.409
 Relatively difficult around the 900 grams 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.570
 made of a plastic composite that 

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:02.549
 black is plastic and that every 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.440
 carton this the so sign 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:08.240
 Signatures consist of one 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.640
 metal from metallic 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:23.970
 Application are glued on it and with 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:26.790
 a foil sealed that is here too 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:30.140
 we have quite interesting here 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.480
 namely the history of the manufactory in 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.480
 a novel where you have a watch factory 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.630
 you can read who is in favor 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:44.690
 interested and we have the 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:58.159
 current catalog the current catalog 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:58.159
 Let's see this is the novel 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.280
 and that is the catalog 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:22.460
 ok, I 'll do that before we get together 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.600
 devote the clock 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.600
 I'll see what we have here 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:38.840
 there are the relative conditions 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.840
 international guarantee conditions ez 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.840
 event calendar for grandprix 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.840
 motogp 2012 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.790
 and of course the instructions for use 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:07.569
 so and now at the clock 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:12.020
 It has the following water diameter 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.190
 27 mm without crown mind you and the 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:20.660
 height or 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:22.850
 the thickness 58 5 mm it is quite good for 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.790
 a woman just that is a mean one 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.470
 size neither too big nor too small for 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.980
 There are also much smaller ladies 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.630
 I'll pick the clock from the size 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.630
 Perfect for a lady 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.660
 The housing is the housing 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.660
 stainless steel 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:55.430
 This case has been finished with gold 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.420
 that was through the so-called pvd 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:03.079
 method or the pvd coating 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:05.019
 gilded what is bvd dvd set for physics 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:09.459
 laboratory disposition 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:12.560
 that means to refine the de or 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:16.220
 the substances with which one is ennobled you 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.700
 with deprivation of oxygen from air there 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.870
 under vacuum favors that makes you 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.250
 by doing that for example with a 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.930
 arc heats the so-called 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.000
 nachverfahren or with electron beam 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.960
 that evaporates and that comes to that 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.550
 substrate so the clock and condensed 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.460
 The procedure is relative 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.169
 inexpensive because in this way you can 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:49.000
 with very little source material 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.000
 ennoble a lot of surface 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.229
 At the front we have the dial completely 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.979
 usually with the hour hand 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:59.360
 minute hand and a second hand 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:01.010
 you can also clearly see the second 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.320
 his jumps know indiz for one 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.870
 nonsense clockwork 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:11.770
 the Arabic numerals in one 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.770
 italics font with a date window 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:22.730
 on the right , the crown is quite ordinary 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.750
 have a leather strap in one here 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:30.830
 crocodile leather look that this very good 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:37.550
 processes the seams are super good one 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:38.750
 noted it is of high quality the 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.190
 Close is also gold plated 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:43.970
 I assume with the same procedure 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.880
 and that is an ordinary one 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:55.610
 pin buckle which, of course, to one 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:57.170
 Classic just looks good 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.550
 unfortunately you can not do that on the backside 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.970
 see clockwork through a small window 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.440
 or something like that 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:06.080
 but it is not very tragic 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.990
 it's not a quartz movement either 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.830
 fascinated if automatikwerk the big one 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.870
 ears 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:20.170
 Nevertheless, the clockwork is very 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:25.780
 Well, it is a budget work 956 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:25.780
 412 a very reliable quartz movement 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:41.739
 okay that 's it from me that was it from 

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:42.509
 And that was it for the jury 

00:06:41.739 --> 00:06:44.919
 ladies world 

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:47.019
 I hope you enjoyed it very much 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.669
 to watch this video and I would 

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:49.029
 I am happy if you do not subscribe 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:51.929
 would 

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:51.929
 See you
