of<00:01:04.160> course<00:01:04.369> we<00:01:04.460> all<00:01:04.580> know<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:04.729> basic<00:01:05.380> that<00:01:06.380> was

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
of course we all know the basic that was

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.910 
of course we all know the basic that was
like<00:01:06.710> that<00:01:08.320> so<00:01:09.320> as<00:01:09.440> you<00:01:09.530> can<00:01:09.619> see<00:01:09.740> already

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
like that so as you can see already

like that so as you can see already
going<00:01:10.399> off<00:01:10.550> camera<00:01:11.060> here<00:01:11.830> sucker<00:01:12.830> is<00:01:13.070> huge

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
going off camera here sucker is huge

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.940 
going off camera here sucker is huge
just<00:01:14.570> to<00:01:14.660> bring<00:01:14.810> in<00:01:14.960> just<00:01:15.200> for<00:01:15.380> completeness

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
just to bring in just for completeness

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.910 
just to bring in just for completeness
sake<00:01:17.740> there's<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.890> little<00:01:19.010> PVC<00:01:20.320> and<00:01:21.320> the

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
sake there's the little PVC and the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.510 
sake there's the little PVC and the
energized<00:01:22.369> ones<00:01:22.700> in<00:01:22.909> the<00:01:23.000> back<00:01:24.100> but<00:01:25.100> yeah<00:01:25.310> he

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
energized ones in the back but yeah he

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.160 
energized ones in the back but yeah he
is<00:01:25.640> easily<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.420> biggest<00:01:26.510> one<00:01:26.840> of<00:01:26.869> the<00:01:27.020> bunch

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
is easily the biggest one of the bunch

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.109 
is easily the biggest one of the bunch
of<00:01:27.560> this<00:01:27.799> crew<00:01:28.070> at<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:28.340> moment<00:01:28.700> and

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
of this crew at the moment and

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.250 
of this crew at the moment and
rightfully<00:01:32.119> so<00:01:32.299> because<00:01:32.420> this<00:01:32.659> is<00:01:32.780> more<00:01:32.990> meant

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
rightfully so because this is more meant

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.710 
rightfully so because this is more meant
to<00:01:33.350> be<00:01:33.409> a<00:01:33.530> playset<00:01:34.430> Optimus<00:01:35.030> Prime<00:01:35.799> the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
to be a playset Optimus Prime the

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.539 
to be a playset Optimus Prime the
trailer<00:01:38.720> is<00:01:40.689> kind<00:01:41.689> of<00:01:41.860> boring<00:01:42.860> looking<00:01:43.310> but

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
trailer is kind of boring looking but

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.730 
trailer is kind of boring looking but
I'll<00:01:43.700> get<00:01:43.909> into<00:01:44.060> why<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:44.930> we'll<00:01:46.270> pretty<00:01:47.270> much

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
I'll get into why and we'll pretty much

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.859 
I'll get into why and we'll pretty much
make<00:01:48.740> do<00:01:49.369> with<00:01:49.580> what<00:01:49.790> we<00:01:49.939> have<00:01:50.619> back<00:01:52.869> very

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
make do with what we have back very

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.170 
make do with what we have back very
simple<00:01:54.259> transformation<00:01:54.860> has<00:01:55.009> expected<00:01:55.579> so

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
simple transformation has expected so

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.399 
simple transformation has expected so
the<00:01:57.250> trailer<00:01:58.250> in<00:01:58.400> this<00:01:58.520> mode<00:01:58.960> very<00:01:59.960> simple

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
the trailer in this mode very simple

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.039 
the trailer in this mode very simple
very<00:02:01.220> bland<00:02:01.610> but<00:02:02.150> there's<00:02:02.329> a<00:02:02.390> reason<00:02:02.750> for<00:02:02.780> that

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
very bland but there's a reason for that

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.620 
very bland but there's a reason for that
just<00:02:03.890> like<00:02:04.070> the<00:02:04.220> last<00:02:04.400> playset<00:02:05.619> stickers<00:02:06.619> so

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
just like the last playset stickers so

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.630 
just like the last playset stickers so
let's<00:02:08.630> apply<00:02:08.750> those<00:02:09.140> stickers<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.769> uh<00:02:09.890> give

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
let's apply those stickers and uh give

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.069 
let's apply those stickers and uh give
this<00:02:10.670> some<00:02:11.120> color<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.630> I<00:02:11.660> think<00:02:11.690> there's<00:02:11.959> even

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.079 
this some color and I think there's even

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.220 
this some color and I think there's even
some<00:02:12.350> for<00:02:12.500> Optimus<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:14.510> now<00:02:14.660> I'll<00:02:14.840> stickered

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
some for Optimus so now I'll stickered

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.600 
some for Optimus so now I'll stickered
up<00:02:15.350> Optimus<00:02:15.769> Prime<00:02:15.980> looks<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.250> little<00:02:16.370> more

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
up Optimus Prime looks a little more

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.490
