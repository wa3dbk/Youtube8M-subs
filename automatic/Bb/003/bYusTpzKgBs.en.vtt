00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.369 
toriel series on the basics of C++ most
of<00:00:42.059> us<00:00:42.210> BL<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.940> light<00:00:44.940> intro<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:46.070> OpenGL<00:00:47.070> and

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
of us BL and a light intro to OpenGL and

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:56.000 
of us BL and a light intro to OpenGL and
the<00:00:49.379> end<00:00:49.649> product<00:00:50.280> will<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:52.399> Ponca<00:00:53.399> loan<00:00:55.010> not

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the end product will be a Ponca loan not

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.220 
the end product will be a Ponca loan not
a<00:00:56.070> whole<00:00:56.340> lot<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:56.940> it's<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:58.129> 3d<00:00:59.129> game<00:00:59.370> using<00:01:00.300> STL

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
a whole lot but it's a 3d game using STL

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.580 
a whole lot but it's a 3d game using STL
and<00:01:01.670> OpenGL<00:01:03.860> so<00:01:04.909> hopefully<00:01:06.110> those<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.380> you

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and OpenGL so hopefully those of you

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.960 
and OpenGL so hopefully those of you
looking<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.549> get<00:01:08.729> into<00:01:10.189> game<00:01:11.189> development<00:01:11.700> or

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
looking to get into game development or

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.830 
looking to get into game development or
just<00:01:12.420> improve<00:01:12.979> your<00:01:13.979> programming<00:01:14.610> skills<00:01:14.970> I'm

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
just improve your programming skills I'm

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.760 
just improve your programming skills I'm
hoping<00:01:16.350> you'll<00:01:16.650> learn<00:01:17.310> from<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:18.320> I<00:01:21.770> put

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
five months so yeah the source for this

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.190 
five months so yeah the source for this
project<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.579> available<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.720> description

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
project is available in the description

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.240 
project is available in the description
of<00:01:40.740> this<00:01:40.829> video

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
to learn all the steps all the way up to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.539 
to learn all the steps all the way up to
this<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.560> you'll<00:01:49.740> be<00:01:49.890> able<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.130> make<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.399> on

this and you'll be able to make it on

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.170 
this and you'll be able to make it on
your<00:01:50.579> own<00:01:51.530> so<00:01:52.530> yeah<00:01:52.740> just<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:54.890> look<00:01:55.890> into<00:01:56.729> what's

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
your own so yeah just a look into what's

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:18.580 
your own so yeah just a look into what's
to<00:01:57.450> come

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.590 

okay
