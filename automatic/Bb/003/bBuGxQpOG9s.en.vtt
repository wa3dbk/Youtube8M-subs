00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.910 
then down the center and you want to
make<00:01:59.790> sure<00:01:59.840> this<00:02:00.840> isn't<00:02:01.110> pushed<00:02:01.560> all<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.800> way

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
make sure this isn't pushed all the way

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.980 
make sure this isn't pushed all the way
down<00:02:02.160> in<00:02:02.400> an<00:02:02.580> order<00:02:02.970> so<00:02:03.330> we<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.509> loop<00:02:03.810> it

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
down in an order so we can loop it

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.400 
down in an order so we can loop it
easier<00:02:04.530> later<00:02:05.240> taking<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.540> single<00:02:06.780> rubber<00:02:07.140> band

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
easier later taking a single rubber band

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.249 
easier later taking a single rubber band
and<00:02:07.680> cap<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.850> off<00:02:09.090> by<00:02:09.509> looping<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.020> four

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
and cap that off by looping it four

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:18.770 
and cap that off by looping it four
times<00:02:11.690> like<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:14.450> now<00:02:16.730> taking<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.910> holding

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
times like that now taking a holding

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.460 
times like that now taking a holding
rubber<00:02:18.959> band

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470
