I<00:02:26.140> had<00:02:26.770> no<00:02:28.950> issue<00:02:29.950> with<00:02:30.100> it<00:02:30.220> being<00:02:30.490> closed<00:02:30.820> I

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
I had no issue with it being closed I

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.310 
I had no issue with it being closed I
didn't<00:02:31.330> think<00:02:31.420> there<00:02:31.660> was<00:02:31.750> any<00:02:31.960> other<00:02:32.080> option

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
didn't think there was any other option

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.370 
didn't think there was any other option
for<00:02:32.980> me<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:34.390> then<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.960> information

through FIA told me there was another

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.940 
through FIA told me there was another
option<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:39.990> was<00:02:40.990> happily<00:02:41.380> convinced

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
option and and I was happily convinced

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.560 
option and and I was happily convinced
otherwise<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:42.700> there<00:02:42.880> was<00:02:43.030> another<00:02:43.300> way<00:02:43.510> to

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
otherwise that there was another way to

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.260 
otherwise that there was another way to
do<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.890> so<00:02:44.950> I'm<00:02:45.460> so<00:02:45.700> glad<00:02:45.880> that<00:02:46.030> I

do it and and so I'm so glad that I
chose<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.720> round<00:02:46.990> that<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.320> chose<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.860> open

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
chose that round that I chose to open

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.390 
chose that round that I chose to open
route<00:02:48.630> because<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:50.410> just<00:02:50.830> there's<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:51.340> much

that<00:02:54.850> can<00:02:55.060> grow<00:02:55.270> from<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:56.220> into<00:02:57.220> making<00:02:57.400> open

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
that can grow from that into making open

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.120 
that can grow from that into making open
this<00:02:57.850> work<00:02:58.090> just<00:02:58.960> to<00:02:59.200> be<00:02:59.320> honest<00:02:59.740> yeah

people<00:03:03.340> involved<00:03:03.700> and<00:03:04.150> to<00:03:04.990> figure<00:03:05.380> out

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
people involved and to figure out

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.770 
people involved and to figure out
together<00:03:05.920> what<00:03:06.370> works<00:03:06.580> and<00:03:06.850> what<00:03:07.060> doesn't<00:03:07.300> and

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
together what works and what doesn't and

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.360 
together what works and what doesn't and
it's<00:03:08.260> gonna<00:03:08.380> be<00:03:08.560> different<00:03:08.740> for<00:03:08.950> everyone

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
it's gonna be different for everyone

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.010 
it's gonna be different for everyone
but<00:03:09.760> we<00:03:09.910> figured<00:03:10.240> out<00:03:10.390> what<00:03:10.540> works<00:03:10.720> for<00:03:10.960> us

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
but we figured out what works for us

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.830 
but we figured out what works for us
when<00:03:11.470> one<00:03:11.800> of<00:03:11.920> us<00:03:12.010> is<00:03:12.070> going<00:03:12.430> through<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:13.180> rough

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
when one of us is going through a rough

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.560 
when one of us is going through a rough
patch<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:14.410> needs<00:03:15.240> something<00:03:16.240> from<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.540> other

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
patch and needs something from the other

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:26.760 
patch and needs something from the other
than<00:03:17.080> just<00:03:17.440> being<00:03:17.710> honest<00:03:24.600> really<00:03:25.600> it<00:03:26.590> was<00:03:26.740> a

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
than just being honest really it was a

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.150 
than just being honest really it was a
really<00:03:27.010> easy<00:03:27.160> decision<00:03:27.790> actually<00:03:29.160> typically

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
really easy decision actually typically

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.360 
really easy decision actually typically

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
closely resembled my own and so that I

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.690 
closely resembled my own and so that I
when<00:04:45.970> I<00:04:46.000> chose<00:04:46.270> them<00:04:46.600> I<00:04:46.870> would<00:04:47.290> see<00:04:48.280> him<00:04:48.490> grow

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.070 
when I chose them I would see him grow
up<00:04:48.790> with<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:49.030> same<00:04:49.210> values<00:04:49.570> that<00:04:49.600> I<00:04:49.780> grew<00:04:50.020> up

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
up with the same values that I grew up

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.770 
up with the same values that I grew up
with<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:51.700> biggest<00:04:52.000> message<00:04:52.510> I<00:04:52.690> could<00:04:52.870> give<00:04:53.050> to
