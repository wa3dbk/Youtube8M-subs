this<00:00:32.910> isn't<00:00:33.239> gay<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.110> game<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.440> an

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
this isn't gay this game is an

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.490 
this isn't gay this game is an
old-school<00:00:34.920> shooter<00:00:35.309> i<00:00:35.899> guess<00:00:36.899> similar<00:00:37.110> to

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
old-school shooter i guess similar to

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.270 
old-school shooter i guess similar to
like<00:00:37.649> contra<00:00:38.219> or<00:00:38.550> Mega<00:00:38.910> Man<00:00:39.410> Metal<00:00:40.410> Slug<00:00:40.530> but

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
like contra or Mega Man Metal Slug but

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.700 
like contra or Mega Man Metal Slug but
you<00:00:41.460> know<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.730> very<00:00:42.000> very<00:00:42.360> simplistic<00:00:42.870> with

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
you know it's very very simplistic with

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.220 
you know it's very very simplistic with
a<00:00:43.739> very<00:00:44.190> unique<00:00:46.129> with<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.489> very<00:00:47.850> unique<00:00:48.230> graphic

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
a very unique with a very unique graphic

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.880 
a very unique with a very unique graphic
style<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.930> think<00:00:51.930> there<00:00:52.379> might<00:00:52.559> be<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.710> lot<00:00:52.860> of

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
style I think there might be a lot of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.639 
style I think there might be a lot of
flickering<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.879> screen<00:00:54.210> due<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.410> fact

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
flickering on the screen due to the fact

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.930 
flickering on the screen due to the fact
that<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:56.219> game<00:00:56.489> has<00:00:57.260> this<00:00:58.579> hand-drawn<00:00:59.579> look

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
that this game has this hand-drawn look

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.650 
that this game has this hand-drawn look
that<00:01:00.649> keeps<00:01:01.649> moving<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.579> paper<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.329> feel

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
that keeps moving this paper like feel

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.219 
that keeps moving this paper like feel
that<00:01:04.530> keeps<00:01:04.860> moving<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.489> bear<00:01:06.420> with<00:01:06.450> me<00:01:06.630> if<00:01:07.020> you

really challenging platforming sections

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.740 
really challenging platforming sections
later<00:04:32.500> on<00:04:32.710> in<00:04:32.919> the<00:04:33.009> game<00:04:33.039> and<00:04:33.789> as<00:04:34.210> I<00:04:34.330> mentioned

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
later on in the game and as I mentioned

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.620 
later on in the game and as I mentioned
