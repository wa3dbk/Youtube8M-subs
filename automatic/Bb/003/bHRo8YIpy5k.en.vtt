00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello and welcome my name 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.400
 We are in the pan and today we have two 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.859
 to discuss extremely important topics 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.080
 For one, I actively search for top five 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.090
 compilation support after 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.519
 People both choose me the top 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.690
 help five compilation and the other 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.340
 Of course, I have a smaller one 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.960
 warmed up so a bit and 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.449
 what are we doing now? 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.369
 can do together or when it is 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.410
 then as far as it is with him 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.730
 at all just looks like it but first 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.410
 Let's get back to the beginning we have 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.000
 of course a guest gameplay sent in 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.650
 have a video of the flair ever 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.870
 seen him play call of duty 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.640
 Ghosts and he has the honey weather 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.440
 with griffin magazine extension and 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.239
 Specialist package with many 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.450
 different parks he has written 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.890
 that he flew on the map 30.04 the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.890
 Gameplay has sent out and he would have 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.329
 ever played ffh and there it would be in 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.710
 the comments are pretty high 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.660
 hergegangen that one accused 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.010
 because he was very defensive 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.050
 he has played that more or less 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.670
 Fighting people is coming 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.500
 a little bit down on the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.629
 one and the other kind mirror there 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.129
 So that's why I would be honest 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.930
 Do not say anything when thinking if one 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.880
 or others the comments times with the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.860
 playing style is not quite as satisfied 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.439
 dear flair, that's why I have one 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.330
 gameplay here then again he took 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.250
 played on the ps3 and it's just 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.479
 just six minutes, that's why I have to 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.860
 Keep me a bit now though 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.619
 should not speak fast for me 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.330
 problem be so top five i support 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.549
 was thinking the or 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.740
 in the comments is yes again and again 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.070
 something like this clip because it has nothing to 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.360
 search 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.220
 this clip has to look through the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.900
 reception has no idea of ​​call of 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.119
 duty though, of course he call already 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.590
 has gambled from duty 1 to 4 and so on 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.240
 but that's what it's all about 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.400
 do not let I never with a 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.630
 laughing eyes over it anyway 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.479
 I thought so if you were there too 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.399
 bock then I would from the 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.990
 community so speak of people like 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.729
 So you guys, I've got that now 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.890
 Look here and feel called 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.220
 to look into the lists 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.509
 a total of three people search that is 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.460
 we do not have an exact plan yet 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.259
 how that will work out or so on 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.750
 is only now for the first time whether or not 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.909
 the interest is because of the 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.590
 task is already I say not 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.390
 especially extensive but already 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.630
 I'll say long-term 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.940
 Cooperation selected it 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.500
 I would also be active directly three people 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.630
 Search and not just a first 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.730
 that means when a total of three 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.710
 Find people would because the buck on it 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.930
 then you would have access to the 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.250
 complete list of the files get the 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.370
 be sent to us 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.650
 and they should in principle once the 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.660
 Week about looking something like this 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.100
 new things with it white and theirs 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.050
 personal top 3 compilation 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.610
 put together so I'm saying that 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.050
 I at once a week from one 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.730
 the compilation will take in the next 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.290
 week the next and in the 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.980
 next week, in turn, carries out the 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.570
 next year 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.820
 but now we have one 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.710
 find a way to vote like you 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.730
 could that be who of these three 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.170
 people are taken at all 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.220
 or which three people 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.100
 it really has to be taken 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.360
 right means that we will do that 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.860
 Of course we will still be 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.540
 that's exactly what it will be 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.520
 Nice to give the vote or a small 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.480
 vote but again do exactly that 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.130
 probably via the commander 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.200
 warrior forum or via facebook directly 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.640
 that just does not say if 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.380
 you have it on it means that he is 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.850
 you are of the opinion that you can help 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.010
 use in the top five compilation 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.890
 both at winfrey and or 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.170
 even in particular with the cod 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.180
 killstreak compilation or battlefield 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.310
 write me that they comments 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.990
 we have there I say one now 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.370
 more direct wire than if I am here now 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.820
 Immediately choose something 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.130
 would 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.600
 and depending on how it looks like 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.770
 So who will say somehow yes 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.910
 all right we can do that or 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.130
 can not do so any time 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.870
 because in principle ever so in the 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.730
 closer selection but come again 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.900
 anticipation that is now has nothing 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.000
 the people we really do then 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.160
 you can of course already in 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.570
 Write this in comment if 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.760
 for example, someone special 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.250
 would recommend the however 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.760
 then also time must have very clear 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.160
 Thing 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.380
 That's how she fell in the first place, she knows 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.810
 that will be in the next few days again 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.130
 I'll take a ride and see you 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.720
 next week we will certainly be there 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:58.820
 have thought as we did there 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.310
 He can choose exactly who he is 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.340
 then you can choose or the synonymous 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.360
 can suggest so the second yesterday 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.680
 evening a little bit longer with commander 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.940
 warrior talked there were a few more 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.310
 other people with it and there it went 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.020
 mainly to streaming and you guys 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.270
 One thing to say behind closed doors 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.270
 come back soon 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:25.070
 but on the one hand and on the other 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.380
 should he be so alienware gaming pc 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.970
 laptops part because somehow get and 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.080
 if the thing is there then well then 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.570
 Let's do some things together 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.690
 only do it almost on the edge so that's it 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.710
 is just the things and look forward to it 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.280
 Of course, I am already very special 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.380
 it 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.340
 For one thing, because I know that the gentleman 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.720
 warrior is more like this I say a lot 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.340
 consoles of heavy types and on the 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.810
 other side that you also with him 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.610
 what can raise together so gamble 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.500
 can or can absorb something 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.890
 and the whole in the typical commander 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.630
 warrior style dingens churches used there 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.800
 Did not you see it through 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.480
 Personally, I am very, very much 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.740
 I'm looking forward to it and more 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.669
 of course not in advance 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.600
 Betrayed because otherwise get 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.520
 probably a neck like that again 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.010
 I almost want to be honest 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.650
 certainly not said by anyone 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.540
 Commander warriors so much about it so in the 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.180
 the big whole noodle the abstract 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.230
 the top five supporters can 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.419
 like to be here in the comments 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.280
 but that has now here is now 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.410
 first feel only son when you are there 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.940
 bock on it has or the opinion you are 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.919
 because someone knows you know someone 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.360
 is absolutely predestined for that too 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.190
 A twice a week time has changed 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.660
 to deal with the compilations 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.430
 put quietly in the comments 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.510
 pack the simply first everything and 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.470
 we'll take a look at the next one 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:41.510
 meet again 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.470
 just like commander warrior and you 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.510
 be much know 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.340

 I really on your comments 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.910
 excited until then makes it well below
