driver and this is the AAL to the leaven
what<00:00:37.380> I'm<00:00:37.469> doing<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.129> 800<00:00:38.579> grit

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
what I'm doing is I have 800 grit

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.479 
what I'm doing is I have 800 grit
sandpaper<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.660> I've<00:00:40.379> got<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:43.160> bowl<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.190> water

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
sandpaper and I've got a bowl of water

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.580 
sandpaper and I've got a bowl of water
right<00:00:44.760> here<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.700> dip<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.329> water

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.130 

the<00:00:51.920> sandpaper<00:00:52.520> in<00:00:52.700> the<00:00:52.880> water<00:00:53.150> and<00:00:53.510> then<00:00:53.780> I

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
the sandpaper in the water and then I

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:01.479 
the sandpaper in the water and then I
basically<00:00:55.540> suck<00:00:56.540> wet<00:00:56.900> sand<00:01:00.190> and<00:01:01.190> I<00:01:01.280> keep

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
basically suck wet sand and I keep

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:09.010 
basically suck wet sand and I keep
dipping<00:01:02.059> the<00:01:03.370> set<00:01:04.370> paper<00:01:04.750> is<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.960> water<00:01:08.020> try

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
dipping the set paper is the water try

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:25.260 
dipping the set paper is the water try
and<00:01:09.170> get<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:10.060> note<00:01:11.060> section<00:01:11.360> of<00:01:11.660> me<00:01:11.840> wet

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.130 

so<00:01:26.270> I'm<00:01:26.390> doing<00:01:26.660> is<00:01:26.900> taking<00:01:27.830> water

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.120 

keeping<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.560> nose<00:01:32.990> what<00:01:33.990> percentage<00:01:34.650> Google

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
keeping the nose what percentage Google

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.630 
keeping the nose what percentage Google
Drive<00:01:35.430> selling<00:01:35.909> disclosure<00:01:36.890> one<00:01:37.890> sending<00:01:38.310> can

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
Drive selling disclosure one sending can

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.350 
Drive selling disclosure one sending can
actually<00:01:39.030> be<00:01:39.150> easier<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:41.670> keep<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.150> circle

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
actually be easier and keep the circle

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:52.770 
actually be easier and keep the circle
smooth<00:01:42.750> as<00:01:43.590> you're<00:01:43.860> actually

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.310 

today<00:01:53.770> I'm<00:01:53.830> going<00:01:54.010> in<00:01:54.190> a<00:01:54.280> circular<00:01:54.520> pattern

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
today I'm going in a circular pattern

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.420 
today I'm going in a circular pattern
always<00:01:56.320> coming<00:01:56.680> for

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
always coming for

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.690 
always coming for
circular<00:01:59.590> follow<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.830> contour<00:02:01.340> you<00:02:01.460> really

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
circular follow the contour you really

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.100 
circular follow the contour you really
don't<00:02:01.880> want<00:02:02.030> to<00:02:02.090> go<00:02:02.180> back<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.600> forth<00:02:02.780> because

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
don't want to go back and forth because

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.200 
don't want to go back and forth because
you<00:02:03.320> need<00:02:03.470> sometimes<00:02:04.900> do<00:02:06.190> into<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.340> epoxy

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
you need sometimes do into the epoxy

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.090 
you need sometimes do into the epoxy
into<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.630> coat<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.140> get<00:02:09.590> down<00:02:09.770> into<00:02:09.950> the

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
into the coat and get down into the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.400 
into the coat and get down into the
phone<00:02:10.280> you<00:02:10.460> don't<00:02:10.610> want<00:02:10.729> to<00:02:10.789> do<00:02:10.880> that<00:02:11.200> you<00:02:12.200> want

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
phone you don't want to do that you want

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:26.040 
phone you don't want to do that you want
to<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.900> want<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.140> go<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.380> circular<00:02:15.890> pattern

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.440 

and<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:28.750> can<00:02:28.900> look<00:02:29.020> at<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:30.090> at<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.180> same

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
and you can look at the at the same

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.020 
and you can look at the at the same
paper<00:02:31.660> you<00:02:31.810> can<00:02:31.930> see<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:33.040> residue<00:02:33.490> coming<00:02:33.880> off

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
paper you can see the residue coming off

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.870 
paper you can see the residue coming off
you<00:02:34.240> can<00:02:34.360> see<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:34.780> excess<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.760> making<00:02:36.760> a

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
you can see the excess and making a

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.070 
you can see the excess and making a
smooth<00:02:37.180> surface<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:39.240> again<00:02:40.240> this<00:02:40.360> is<00:02:40.540> 800

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
smooth surface and again this is 800

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.290 
smooth surface and again this is 800
grit<00:02:41.260> sandpaper<00:02:43.530> 800<00:02:44.530> grit<00:02:45.000> donate<00:02:46.000> hundred

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
grit sandpaper 800 grit donate hundred

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.560 
grit sandpaper 800 grit donate hundred
grit<00:02:46.420> or<00:02:46.480> higher<00:02:46.750> when<00:02:47.080> you<00:02:47.230> wet<00:02:47.410> sand<00:02:48.570> where

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
grit or higher when you wet sand where

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.770 
grit or higher when you wet sand where
you<00:02:49.690> can<00:02:49.810> go<00:02:49.960> to<00:02:50.020> maybe<00:02:50.320> a<00:02:50.410> 600<00:02:51.010> but<00:02:51.910> wet

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
you can go to maybe a 600 but wet

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.980 
you can go to maybe a 600 but wet
sanding<00:02:53.290> keeps<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.650> real<00:02:54.480> nice<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.540> smooth

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
sanding keeps it real nice and smooth

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.700 
sanding keeps it real nice and smooth
cuts<00:02:56.500> down<00:02:56.680> perching<00:02:58.140> but<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.230> actually<00:02:59.410> makes

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
cuts down perching but it actually makes

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:23.540 
cuts down perching but it actually makes
the<00:02:59.830> sanding<00:03:00.220> more<00:03:00.430> efficient

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.620 

see<00:03:24.550> you<00:03:25.090> can<00:03:25.240> also<00:03:26.760> take<00:03:27.760> a<00:03:27.790> rag<00:03:28.090> or<00:03:28.300> a<00:03:28.360> shoot

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
see you can also take a rag or a shoot

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.730 
see you can also take a rag or a shoot
and<00:03:30.150> help<00:03:31.150> way<00:03:31.660> down<00:03:31.840> the<00:03:32.020> plane<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:32.440> put<00:03:32.620> the

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
and help way down the plane to put the

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.850 
and help way down the plane to put the
rag<00:03:32.920> on<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.310> fuselage<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.120> keeps<00:03:34.360> it<00:03:34.480> on

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
rag on the fuselage and that keeps it on

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.560 
rag on the fuselage and that keeps it on
the<00:03:35.860> plane<00:03:36.430> without<00:03:36.640> stretching<00:03:37.120> afford

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
the plane without stretching afford

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.590 
the plane without stretching afford
anything<00:03:37.810> from<00:03:38.490> this<00:03:39.490> is<00:03:39.730> now<00:03:39.880> has<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.210> hardened

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
anything from this is now has a hardened

anything from this is now has a hardened
shell<00:03:40.630> but<00:03:41.440> this<00:03:41.560> doesn't<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.190> rear<00:03:42.370> section

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
shell but this doesn't the rear section

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.920
