00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 I claudinei the businessman of the paint industry 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.230
 who lives in the city of pilar do sul 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.450
 on one occasion god answered his 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.370
 request in prayer with God I asked for 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.109
 show me the true church 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.180
 Then I made a trip from the parana where I 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:22.500
 I listened to the radio there and my head is in the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.170
 radio website www.otempo.com.br and in the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.380
 Sunday I opened the site of the new break and 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.420
 I listened once there in the studio to 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.790
 bible she appears the pope her shepherd 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.050
 responsible with those three books to 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.780
 great hope is not 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.399
 that touched me a lot of heart in the person 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.680
 Sunday the other day on Monday 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.750
 when I went to my store there because 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.450

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.430
 morning in three books minus three books 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.860
 what was on the site there right? 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.989
 the one that touched my heart was the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.000
 request that I made in prayer to God there 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.399
 it was certain that god has shown the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.379
 true church for me and may I come 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.359
 receiving the band Green Day has already 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.730
 certainty that there was going to be a 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.979
 very big change in my store that 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.770
 I finally finished god, he proved to me. 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.560
 It was very good this week that you saved 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.350
 saturday on friday for you to have a 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.439
 idea to my shop the day that sold the most 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.030
 in her history was 4,500 reais in that 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.500
 Friday that I had promised that 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.720
 was to keep the Sabbath 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.880
 she sold six thousand five hundred reais 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.840
 the week was the best week a month was 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.690
 the best month 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.680
 I already had a change a feeling is 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.810
 inexplicable happiness completed me 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.420
 the emptiness I had inside of me 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.380
 filled in knows then from there it was 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.900
 wonderful 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.900
 baptism was a sequence of Mr. 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.330
 I was already very happy in my testimony 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.780
 I told you I was in my store. 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.180
 I taught her and one day I spoke with 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.490
 one of my employees there I do not know the 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.910
 what God wants for my life but I know 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.619
 that he wants something something 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.670
 and that's what happened, everything that I went 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.350
 travel was also closed today, I 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.119
 I know what he wants in my life. 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.119
 It is with work in the works in him not 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.220
 looking to bring more people but not 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.220
 pleasurable
