the lady into that action is that we're
going<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.609> think<00:03:29.700> of<00:03:29.819> a<00:03:29.910> diagonal<00:03:30.450> line<00:03:30.629> from

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
going to think of a diagonal line from

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.990 
going to think of a diagonal line from
our<00:03:31.440> knees<00:03:31.829> thighs<00:03:32.519> hips<00:03:34.099> ribcage<00:03:35.099> sending

the head weight diagonally forward to
our<00:03:39.180> left<00:03:39.450> so<00:03:40.230> that<00:03:40.500> will<00:03:40.709> change<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:41.430> lady's

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
our left so that will change the lady's

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.270 
our left so that will change the lady's
angle<00:03:42.239> as<00:03:42.419> I<00:03:42.840> rotate<00:03:43.319> my<00:03:43.349> upper<00:03:43.769> torso<00:03:43.949> my

nice incline as we use our body and head

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.979 
nice incline as we use our body and head
weights<00:04:01.319> to<00:04:01.530> come<00:04:01.709> out<00:04:01.859> into<00:04:02.129> promenade<00:04:02.989> now

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
weights to come out into promenade now

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.900 
weights to come out into promenade now
from<00:04:04.590> this<00:04:04.739> position<00:04:04.980> we<00:04:05.400> arrived<00:04:05.699> in

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
from this position we arrived in

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.319 
from this position we arrived in
promenade<00:04:06.389> and<00:04:06.599> we<00:04:07.440> step<00:04:07.739> through<00:04:07.769> now<00:04:08.730> as<00:04:08.940> I

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
promenade and we step through now as I

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.900 
promenade and we step through now as I
bring<00:04:09.569> my<00:04:09.810> feet<00:04:10.079> together<00:04:10.319> I'm<00:04:10.829> going<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.459> rise

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
bring my feet together I'm going to rise

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.360 
bring my feet together I'm going to rise
up<00:04:12.209> on<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.629> toes

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
up on the toes

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.219 
up on the toes
allowing<00:04:14.370> Heather<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.239> chance<00:04:15.599> to<00:04:15.840> swing<00:04:16.079> her

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
allowing Heather a chance to swing her

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.430 
allowing Heather a chance to swing her
right<00:04:16.410> leg<00:04:16.560> ahead<00:04:16.919> of<00:04:17.039> me<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:18.079> we<00:04:19.079> lower<00:04:19.320> down

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
right leg ahead of me and we lower down

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.580 
right leg ahead of me and we lower down
so<00:04:20.039> it's<00:04:20.190> very<00:04:20.340> important<00:04:20.880> that<00:04:20.910> we<00:04:21.590> receive

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
so it's very important that we receive

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.610 
so it's very important that we receive
that<00:04:22.860> sway<00:04:23.280> and<00:04:23.610> that<00:04:24.030> will<00:04:24.260> stop<00:04:25.260> us<00:04:25.289> from

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
that sway and that will stop us from

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.600 
that sway and that will stop us from
rotating

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610

this<00:04:34.229> video<00:04:34.560> on<00:04:34.949> the<00:04:35.460> impetus<00:04:35.909> we<00:04:36.120> keep<00:04:36.300> a

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
this video on the impetus we keep a

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.659 
this video on the impetus we keep a
right<00:04:36.659> side<00:04:36.930> positive<00:04:37.250> allow<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.310> feet<00:04:38.639> to

right side positive allow the feet to

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.140 
right side positive allow the feet to
turn<00:04:39.439> before<00:04:40.439> the<00:04:40.979> head<00:04:41.219> delay<00:04:41.759> the<00:04:41.969> head

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
turn before the head delay the head

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.779 
turn before the head delay the head
action<00:04:42.569> maintain<00:04:43.080> the<00:04:43.289> sway<00:04:43.560> so<00:04:44.430> as<00:04:44.639> we're

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
action maintain the sway so as we're

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
side we find the center on count two we

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.200 
side we find the center on count two we

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
and now from here as we land in

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.240 
and now from here as we land in
promenade<00:04:56.969> position<00:04:57.259> taking<00:04:58.259> care<00:04:58.560> ladies<00:04:58.889> to

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.980 
keep the shoulders towards our partner
try<00:05:01.860> not<00:05:02.099> to<00:05:02.310> wrote<00:05:02.520> it<00:05:02.789> on<00:05:02.939> this<00:05:03.120> inside<00:05:03.629> step

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
try not to wrote it on this inside step

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.529 
try not to wrote it on this inside step
it's<00:05:04.169> a<00:05:04.529> small<00:05:05.159> step<00:05:05.460> for<00:05:05.639> the<00:05:05.729> man<00:05:05.909> and<00:05:06.210> we

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
it's a small step for the man and we

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.260 
it's a small step for the man and we
have<00:05:06.719> to<00:05:06.900> monitor<00:05:07.500> the<00:05:08.189> man<00:05:08.400> Center

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
have to monitor the man Center

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.230 
have to monitor the man Center
so<00:05:09.770> basically<00:05:10.770> when<00:05:11.039> we<00:05:11.159> come<00:05:11.370> through<00:05:11.400> it's<00:05:12.090> a

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
so basically when we come through it's a

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.929 
so basically when we come through it's a
very<00:05:12.599> very<00:05:12.960> tight<00:05:13.529> action<00:05:14.159> for<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.430> man<00:05:14.610> if<00:05:14.759> we

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:14.939 
very very tight action for the man if we

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:18.080 
very very tight action for the man if we
step<00:05:15.210> too<00:05:15.449> big<00:05:16.340> automatically<00:05:17.340> that<00:05:17.909> will

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
step too big automatically that will

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.649 
step too big automatically that will
call<00:05:18.360> in<00:05:18.539> cause<00:05:19.020> an<00:05:19.229> imbalance<00:05:19.580> for<00:05:20.580> his<00:05:20.849> body
