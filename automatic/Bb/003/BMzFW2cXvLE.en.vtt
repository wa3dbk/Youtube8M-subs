00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.990
 No 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.680
 yes if there is one thing that we do not lack 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.279
 have arrived in recent months then 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.160
 it does 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.320
 220 horsepower in the still one working 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.270
 if this yes it is just very very much 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.900
 certainly if you think again 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.180
 also once more 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.930
 skoda on unfortunately I almost have to 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.150
 say 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.510
 sit down is on had him continue 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.510
 to go 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.989
 how 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.640
 yes I want to talk about that ability 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.680
 have hear because 22 hp is just more 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.700
 then sat for always one like this one 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.200
 once again three hundred and fifty 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.390
 minutes and I actually have none 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.280
 moment that the long corridor to more 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.350
 ability he is just really super fast 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.240
 and we noticed that during a trip 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.680
 to the Harz beautiful region on the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.120
 border of the former east and west 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.790
 Germany 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.410
 beautiful nice weather curves and up 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.530
 the autobahn go 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.610
 he really went as this car starts 254 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.520
 on the clock 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.420
 242 real miles that I am the top one 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.700
 is a commissioner 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.900
 with ease it is very nice to be with 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.050
 a skoda 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.210
 Germans to drive out we have it 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.460
 also a hearts beautiful mountains 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.050
 occasional shorter loops and and am 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.700
 you accelerate out following and then has 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.810
 you are struggling for train then goes 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.729
 he skates a little then he goes a little 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.550
 flapping and think they had to 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.009
 's code but a spare mounted 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.140
 and what do you think they are doing now 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.119
 the octavia rs 230 a special one 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.100
 implementation here think of the standard 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.330
 a mechanical barrier and that salt then again 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.330
 want to have this car 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.750
 I already agree on the manufacturer's specifications 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.400
 had cat top speed car sprint is that 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.410
 not wrong or a zero in 100 we have in 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.850
 6.6 could have measured that is just about 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.500
 half a second faster than the factory 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.260
 promised 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.580
 yes, these little farts and and kicking 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.380
 it's just incredible how fast you get 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.739
 then you are 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.090
 and number advantage of this rs combi is 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.310
 he no oil consumed 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.540
 in contrast to the other endurance test 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.299
 fabia rs combi 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.220
 because yes that yes no petit futÃ© see that 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.870
 like a decent kick of oil 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.280
 but with this so don't have it 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.350
 having to take oil can in hand 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.570
 he just kept doing fine with the 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.400
 with oil that it had been given and that 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.890
 is also nice about it 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.160
 consumption spoken 19,000 kilometers 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.840
 driven and over those 19,000 kilometers 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.610
 yes in the beginning is renting a car 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.050
 you do kick well no goes in it too 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.760
 Germany also give a lot of grass with 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.180
 the netherlands just drive normally me 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.099
 do it 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.810
 he car week was a good preparation 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.489
 just follow the traffic 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.500
 I also find one or 12.0 whole 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.690
 realistic consumption that you get 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.019
 quite so easy with this car 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.019
 just neat 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.750
 what was not so neat was this one 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.580
 car has adaptive cruise control 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.950
 with councils for the sensor in the nose 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.900
 and services just had it out 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.030
 I stepped hit family the car indicated 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.810
 that your malfunction had he indicated malfunction 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.030
 start-stop system 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.440
 apparently that is via the electronics 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.380
 again linked to that 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.450
 to which sensor anyway the sensor 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.190
 So it turned out swiped his colleague 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.420
 marco said look at your nose 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.190
 into a hole 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.630
 and what do you think a few weeks later the 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.319
 police on the line at the 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.360
 leasing company 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.920
 but we registered this car 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.360
 have a weird center so come to 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.890
 found it 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.349
 when further we are done with it 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.180
 popped open to the snowy 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.040
 after being austria we are looking 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.239
 gone to octavia combi rs 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.620
 first generation 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.030
 you know all by yourself with an amount 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.220
 20v turbo 180hp nice engine 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.840
 And yes if you have those two robust ones 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.650
 so that shoulders are side by side 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.780
 he is still very bad 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.330
 I mean are recognizable as Cora 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.610
 octavia is common in appearance 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.160
 angular straight forward that is in that 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.870
 13 years has not changed 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.070
 nice to see how that that you do 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.169
 now we have the on the table i come too 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.630
 our fast heart version is also common 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.479
 a very nice addition to your of your 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.100
 guinea pig line singer and because we 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.240
 confirm also have comparative 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.080
 tests that we have done 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:57.440
 with a peugeot 308 sw gt with 205 hp one 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.180
 budgetary engine what turned out this rs is 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.970
 a bit sportier a bit more hard-core 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.530
 more than 308 pre-set to 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.000
 sw gt 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.130
 but remember that in the meantime there are 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.910
 also cars like a c atleon sd cupra 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.330
 added 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.350
 82 hp on the front wheels or the golf r 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.340
 variant 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:20.660
 300 hp four-wheel drive yes that is now 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:23.830
 can do completely if you then have that octavia 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.310
 want to position combi rs like that then I say 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.060
 this one more 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.580
 a golden mean not extreme in terms of 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.610
 consumption is all there to handle 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.890
 1 in 12 more economical is also possible 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.230
 and that makes this octavia combi rs 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.840
 just a very interesting one 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.280
 addition to the octavia range 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.100
 which also simply very good everyday 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.900
 so driving is yes even business 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.570
 just more with this car 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.040
 great and if you want some more 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.780
 you might have to make miles 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.120
 but agree on such an Athens here with 180 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.400
 pk start thinking because such are or 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.700
 diesel block yes that was also with this 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.700
 car
