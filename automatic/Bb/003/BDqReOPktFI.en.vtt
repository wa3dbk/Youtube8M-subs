are not listed but not big games like
Call<00:03:59.200> of<00:03:59.230> Duty<00:03:59.650> doesn't<00:04:00.070> support<00:04:00.400> or<00:04:00.670> unreal

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
Call of Duty doesn't support or unreal

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.099 
Call of Duty doesn't support or unreal
tournament<00:04:01.900> 3<00:04:03.060> doesn't<00:04:04.060> support<00:04:04.390> it<00:04:04.540> because

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
tournament 3 doesn't support it because

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.400 
tournament 3 doesn't support it because
those<00:04:05.590> are<00:04:05.829> two<00:04:06.040> big<00:04:06.070> games<00:04:06.489> but<00:04:06.870> for<00:04:07.870> example

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
those are two big games but for example

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.430 
those are two big games but for example
you<00:04:08.680> have<00:04:08.859> here<00:04:09.280> super<00:04:09.700> crazy<00:04:10.000> guitar<00:04:10.260> we<00:04:11.260> have

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
you have here super crazy guitar we have

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.210 
you have here super crazy guitar we have
to<00:04:11.560> mix<00:04:11.709> 3<00:04:12.250> which<00:04:12.700> is<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:13.260> very<00:04:14.260> small<00:04:14.650> game<00:04:14.920> with

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
to mix 3 which is a very small game with

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.599 
to mix 3 which is a very small game with
flash<00:04:15.579> finger<00:04:15.970> and<00:04:16.320> it's<00:04:17.320> an<00:04:17.680> execution<00:04:18.430> style

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
flash finger and it's an execution style

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.570 
flash finger and it's an execution style
so<00:04:18.820> normally<00:04:19.150> you<00:04:19.180> can't<00:04:19.510> actually<00:04:19.900> do<00:04:20.440> that

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
so normally you can't actually do that

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.810 
so normally you can't actually do that
but<00:04:21.580> if<00:04:21.789> you<00:04:22.090> double<00:04:22.479> click<00:04:22.510> on<00:04:22.960> it

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
but if you double click on it

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.740 
but if you double click on it
it<00:04:24.720> will<00:04:25.470> actually<00:04:25.620> call<00:04:26.040> a<00:04:26.220> start<00:04:27.120> crossover

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
it will actually call a start crossover

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.220 
it will actually call a start crossover
games<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.290> you<00:04:29.070> could<00:04:29.370> can<00:04:29.730> actually<00:04:30.150> play<00:04:30.420> so

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
games and you could can actually play so

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.330 
games and you could can actually play so
it's<00:04:32.130> pretty<00:04:32.370> nice<00:04:33.020> you<00:04:34.020> see<00:04:34.230> not<00:04:34.470> it's

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
it's pretty nice you see not it's

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.280 
it's pretty nice you see not it's
loading<00:04:36.020> so<00:04:37.970> you<00:04:38.970> guys<00:04:39.270> just<00:04:39.660> have<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:40.110> wait

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
loading so you guys just have to wait

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.610 
loading so you guys just have to wait
for<00:04:40.320> a<00:04:40.620> while<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:42.590> just<00:04:43.590> start<00:04:44.520> up

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
for a while and just start up

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.140 
for a while and just start up
automatically<00:04:46.620> but<00:04:47.070> some<00:04:47.430> you<00:04:47.610> have<00:04:47.820> to<00:04:47.970> make

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
automatically but some you have to make

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.630 
automatically but some you have to make
bottle<00:04:48.630> for<00:04:48.870> them<00:04:49.020> so<00:04:49.590> that's<00:04:49.800> cross<00:04:50.160> over

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
bottle for them so that's cross over

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.750 
bottle for them so that's cross over
