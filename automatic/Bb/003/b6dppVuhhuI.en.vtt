this<00:00:01.949> tutorial<00:00:02.159> looks<00:00:02.639> at<00:00:02.820> paint<00:00:03.149> and<00:00:03.570> how

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
this tutorial looks at paint and how

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.099 
this tutorial looks at paint and how
paint<00:00:04.650> dries<00:00:05.100> and<00:00:05.879> there's<00:00:06.029> two<00:00:06.210> main<00:00:06.509> types

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
paint dries and there's two main types

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.640 
paint dries and there's two main types
of<00:00:07.350> paint<00:00:07.649> one<00:00:07.980> on<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.940> left<00:00:09.179> here<00:00:09.480> is

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
of paint one on the left here is

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.970 
of paint one on the left here is
emulsion<00:00:10.650> paint<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.300> on<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.450> right<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:13.259> oil

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
emulsion paint and on the right is oil

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.890 
emulsion paint and on the right is oil
paint<00:00:14.340> and<00:00:14.700> although<00:00:15.330> they<00:00:15.480> have<00:00:15.570> lots<00:00:15.809> of

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
paint and although they have lots of

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.660 
paint and although they have lots of
things<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.230> common<00:00:16.260> they<00:00:17.070> have<00:00:17.100> some

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
things in common they have some

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.570 
things in common they have some
essential<00:00:18.090> differences<00:00:18.570> as<00:00:18.750> well<00:00:19.580> we're

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
essential differences as well we're

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.189 
essential differences as well we're
going<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.760> look<00:00:20.910> at<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.210> similarities

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
going to look at the similarities

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.480 
going to look at the similarities
between<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.740> two<00:00:22.769> different<00:00:23.160> kinds<00:00:23.400> of

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
between the two different kinds of

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.390 
between the two different kinds of
paints<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.289> also<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.500> differences<00:00:26.220> between

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
paints and also the differences between

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.189 
paints and also the differences between
the<00:00:26.760> two<00:00:26.939> different<00:00:27.119> kinds<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.660> paints<00:00:28.050> and

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
the two different kinds of paints and

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.740 
the two different kinds of paints and
how<00:00:29.039> each<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.340> them<00:00:29.640> dries<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.420> sets<00:00:32.630> so<00:00:33.630> what

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
how each of them dries and sets so what

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.799 
how each of them dries and sets so what
does<00:00:33.870> milk<00:00:34.230> got<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.920> do<00:00:35.070> with<00:00:35.280> paint<00:00:35.820> well

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809

or<00:02:27.400> gloss<00:02:28.329> paints<00:02:28.870> such<00:02:29.049> as<00:02:29.230> this<00:02:29.439> we<00:02:30.430> use<00:02:30.639> this

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
or gloss paints such as this we use this

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.240 
or gloss paints such as this we use this
kind<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.329> paint<00:02:31.599> for<00:02:32.319> painting<00:02:32.859> things<00:02:33.099> like

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
kind of paint for painting things like

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.270 
kind of paint for painting things like
skirting<00:02:33.790> boards<00:02:34.269> doors<00:02:35.049> and<00:02:35.969> garage<00:02:36.969> doors

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
skirting boards doors and garage doors

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.500 
skirting boards doors and garage doors
again<00:02:39.280> there<00:02:39.549> are<00:02:39.669> three<00:02:39.700> main<00:02:40.299> components

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
again there are three main components

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.069 
again there are three main components
the<00:02:41.260> first<00:02:41.739> is<00:02:42.159> a<00:02:42.219> solvent<00:02:42.730> but<00:02:43.329> for<00:02:43.599> gloss

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
the first is a solvent but for gloss

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.619 
the first is a solvent but for gloss
paint<00:02:44.439> the<00:02:44.650> solvent<00:02:45.159> is<00:02:45.310> not<00:02:45.879> water<00:02:46.239> and

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
paint the solvent is not water and

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.259 
paint the solvent is not water and
that's<00:02:47.139> why<00:02:47.409> you<00:02:47.469> can't<00:02:47.980> wash<00:02:48.280> your<00:02:48.310> brushes

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
that's why you can't wash your brushes

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.890 
that's why you can't wash your brushes
from<00:02:49.930> gloss<00:02:50.290> paint<00:02:50.620> in<00:02:51.000> water<00:02:52.000> under<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.659> tab

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
from gloss paint in water under the tab

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.649 
from gloss paint in water under the tab
you<00:02:53.109> have<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.919> use<00:02:54.189> for<00:02:54.459> example<00:02:54.519> white<00:02:55.120> spirit

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:55.659 
you have to use for example white spirit

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.520 
you have to use for example white spirit
so<00:02:56.319> the<00:02:56.439> solvent<00:02:57.040> is<00:02:57.310> an<00:02:57.819> aliphatic<00:02:58.530> petroleum

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
so the solvent is an aliphatic petroleum

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.819 
so the solvent is an aliphatic petroleum
solvent<00:03:00.010> or<00:03:00.129> an<00:03:00.370> ester<00:03:00.879> and<00:03:01.530> just<00:03:02.530> like<00:03:02.709> the

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
solvent or an ester and just like the

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.339 
solvent or an ester and just like the
other<00:03:02.980> kind<00:03:03.189> of<00:03:03.310> paint<00:03:03.579> it<00:03:04.120> evaporates<00:03:04.989> as<00:03:05.260> the

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
other kind of paint it evaporates as the

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.069 
other kind of paint it evaporates as the
paint<00:03:05.590> dries<00:03:06.359> but<00:03:07.359> there<00:03:07.480> are<00:03:07.599> two<00:03:07.810> other

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
paint dries but there are two other

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.189 
paint dries but there are two other
components<00:03:08.639> there's<00:03:09.639> a<00:03:09.760> pigment<00:03:10.359> and<00:03:10.569> these

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:11.199 
components there's a pigment and these

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:13.110 
components there's a pigment and these
are<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.680> tiny<00:03:11.949> particles<00:03:12.459> of<00:03:12.819> color

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
are the tiny particles of color

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.800 
are the tiny particles of color
dispersed<00:03:14.079> as<00:03:14.349> a<00:03:14.409> colloid<00:03:15.040> and<00:03:15.389> as<00:03:16.389> also<00:03:16.629> a

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
dispersed as a colloid and as also a

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.670 
dispersed as a colloid and as also a
binder

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
binder

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.659 
binder
now<00:03:18.129> the<00:03:18.189> binder<00:03:18.759> is<00:03:18.909> a<00:03:18.939> resin<00:03:19.509> and<00:03:19.689> this

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
now the binder is a resin and this

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:23.030 
now the binder is a resin and this
reacts<00:03:21.669> with<00:03:21.849> oxygen<00:03:22.180> from<00:03:22.629> the<00:03:22.870> air

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
reacts with oxygen from the air

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.939 
reacts with oxygen from the air
atmospheric<00:03:24.040> oxygen<00:03:24.419> forming<00:03:25.419> a

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
atmospheric oxygen forming a

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.170 
atmospheric oxygen forming a
three-dimensional<00:03:26.949> cross-linked<00:03:27.699> polymer

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
three-dimensional cross-linked polymer

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.719 
three-dimensional cross-linked polymer
and<00:03:28.359> this<00:03:28.810> is<00:03:28.959> what<00:03:29.139> makes<00:03:29.319> gloss<00:03:29.709> paint<00:03:30.069> so

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:30.729 
and this is what makes gloss paint so

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:31.999 
and this is what makes gloss paint so
hard

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:32.009 
hard

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.330 
hard
so<00:03:33.009> in<00:03:33.159> summary<00:03:33.430> two<00:03:34.269> kinds<00:03:34.629> of<00:03:34.689> paint

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
so in summary two kinds of paint

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.879 
so in summary two kinds of paint
oil-based<00:03:36.340> paint<00:03:36.669> or<00:03:36.909> gloss<00:03:37.209> and<00:03:37.889> emulsion

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
oil-based paint or gloss and emulsion

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:42.210 
oil-based paint or gloss and emulsion
paint<00:03:39.129> both<00:03:40.000> have<00:03:40.269> a<00:03:40.299> solvent<00:03:40.900> for<00:03:41.220> emulsion

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
paint both have a solvent for emulsion

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.580 
paint both have a solvent for emulsion
paint<00:03:42.430> that<00:03:42.699> solvent<00:03:43.150> is<00:03:43.269> water<00:03:43.299> which<00:03:44.199> thins

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
paint that solvent is water which thins

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.890 
paint that solvent is water which thins
out<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:44.829> paint<00:03:45.159> and<00:03:45.419> evaporates<00:03:46.419> when<00:03:46.720> the

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
out the paint and evaporates when the

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.580 
out the paint and evaporates when the
paint<00:03:47.139> dries<00:03:47.549> for<00:03:48.549> gloss<00:03:48.879> paint<00:03:49.239> that<00:03:50.019> solvent

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
paint dries for gloss paint that solvent

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.420 
paint dries for gloss paint that solvent
is<00:03:50.739> another<00:03:51.370> liquid<00:03:51.699> not<00:03:52.389> water<00:03:53.189> again<00:03:54.189> the

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
is another liquid not water again the

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.759 
is another liquid not water again the
solvent<00:03:54.879> evaporates<00:03:55.509> when<00:03:56.319> the<00:03:56.439> paint<00:03:56.680> dries

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
solvent evaporates when the paint dries

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.569 
solvent evaporates when the paint dries
but<00:03:57.609> another<00:03:58.120> process<00:03:58.599> happens<00:03:59.019> in<00:03:59.319> an<00:03:59.680> oil<00:03:59.979> in

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
but another process happens in an oil in

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.969 
but another process happens in an oil in
the<00:04:00.790> gloss<00:04:00.969> paint<00:04:01.329> reacts<00:04:02.139> with<00:04:02.379> atmospheric

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:02.979 
the gloss paint reacts with atmospheric

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:07.559 
the gloss paint reacts with atmospheric
oxygen<00:04:03.069> and<00:04:03.989> forms<00:04:04.989> a<00:04:05.259> hard<00:04:05.979> polymer<00:04:06.969> which

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
oxygen and forms a hard polymer which

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.869 
oxygen and forms a hard polymer which
makes<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.989> gloss<00:04:08.259> paint<00:04:08.590> very<00:04:09.219> hard<00:04:09.579> when<00:04:09.729> it

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
makes the gloss paint very hard when it

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.709 
makes the gloss paint very hard when it
sets<00:04:11.159> these<00:04:12.159> two<00:04:12.459> kinds<00:04:12.849> of<00:04:12.909> paints<00:04:13.329> have

explain why paints dry well that's kind

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.120 
explain why paints dry well that's kind
of<00:05:02.950> for<00:05:03.130> two<00:05:03.340> reasons<00:05:03.850> one<00:05:03.970> is<00:05:04.650> that<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:05.830> paint

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
of for two reasons one is that the paint

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:23.150 
of for two reasons one is that the paint
is<00:05:07.740> applied<00:05:12.150> as<00:05:14.580> a<00:05:15.580> thin<00:05:16.150> layer<00:05:16.450> and<00:05:22.110> secondly

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
is applied as a thin layer and secondly

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:31.279 
is applied as a thin layer and secondly
because<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:24.340> solvent<00:05:26.070> which<00:05:27.070> is<00:05:27.280> water

by<00:05:40.750> a<00:05:41.200> colloid<00:05:42.120> or<00:05:43.120> here<00:05:43.540> we<00:05:43.810> might<00:05:44.020> say<00:05:44.380> that

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
by a colloid or here we might say that

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:57.850 
by a colloid or here we might say that
particles<00:05:45.670> are<00:05:51.390> dispersed
