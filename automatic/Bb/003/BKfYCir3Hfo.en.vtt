00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.170
 brian o'driscoll had burst 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.300
 on the international scene with a 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.099
 trick against france in paris in 2000 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.139
 and it's in the French capital that 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.610
 the Irish number 13 performed his 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.130
 last appearance for his country 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.869
 it was inevitable that the attention would 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.119
 would focus on o'driscoll and its 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.380
 new world record with 140 and a 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.390
 international selection 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.430
 but after the result a little earlier to 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.080
 rome ireland knew that with a 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.939
 victory over the French she 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.540
 would win the tournament for the first 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.500
 times since 2009 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.420
 the coach of france philippe 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.059
 saint-andré has decided four changes 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.600
 in the composition of his louis team 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.969
 picamoles 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.890
 dimitri szarzewski remy talès brighten 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.710
 fickou were tenured to do 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.030
 silence the critics 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.050
 and it's the French who quickly 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.579
 open the mark 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.079
 christine dan reed is time sanctioned 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.210
 for not releasing the player 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.370
 platted maxime machenaud was passing the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.930
 penalty and France lead 3 0 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.579
 it may not have been his best 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.899
 kick but that was enough to 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.090
 allow French to take 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.409
 the adventures and machenaud doubling the bet 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.510
 after a quarter of an hour of play 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.250
 at about the same place the half of 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.110
 metro racing melee did not shake 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.909
 while the public of the stadium of France 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.210
 encourage his team after what 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.210
 is not 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.320
 but in the 20th minute ireland ended 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.590
 to enter the match and reassure oneself 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.880
 with an important test 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.680
 after a good period of possession 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.330
 in the French camp she does not laugh that's 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:38.220
 a johnny sexton that was going to fall apart 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:39.600
 in the aim to flatten the angle of 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.490
 costs and power of the half 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.409
 opening to deceive the French defense 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.690
 but the number 10 missed the transformation 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.520
 and France stay ahead on the board 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.520
 6 to 5 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.440
 ireland dominated the party at this 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.420
 moment and mark a second try 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.550

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.890
 his run in the in-goal and under the 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.880
 poles ireland led for the first 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.160
 times in the match 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.810
 a nice collective action and the 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.910
 finisher qualities of the stomach 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.190

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.060
 transformation ireland passes 12

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.180
 French did not give up and 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.830
 ironed in front of the half hour of play 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.720

 French of the match the referee wolf was doing 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.380
 appeal to the tmb who confirmed that the test 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.390

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.670
 the caste back managed to score 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.320

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.580
 give the advantage back to the score in Ireland 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.740

 relatively easy position go to 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.040
 side of the poles and France returned to 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.200
 cloakroom with a point of advance to the 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.860
 pause before the beginning of the second 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.600

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.260
 tournament 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.870
 the pressure was definitely on 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.670
 the shoulders of men in green after 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.440

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.930

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.850
 half-time in the 46th minute on a beautiful 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.660
 breakthrough from his camp before moving on to 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.730
 O'Driscoll 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.680
 he seemed to be going on a trial but was 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.990
 caught up by maxime médard makes the 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.240
 line but the respite was short 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.160
 duration for blues recycled ireland 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.480
 quickly the ball that reached sexton 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.890
 launched and that ended between the poles 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.720
 the opening half wrote down his 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.590
 second try of the match and the fourth 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.600
 In a week 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.690
 demonstrating his ability to find the 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.690
 intervals 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.480
 he passed the easy transformation and 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.990

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.990
 at 13 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.570

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.269
 move to nine points 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.480
 sexton setting the sights for a penalty 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.370
 the score was now 22 to 13 and 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.860
 the fairy tale seemed to come true 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.420
 with a kit for ireland to celebrate 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.680
 o'driscoll's international retreat 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.450
 but things never happen 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.610
 also just for the want and at the 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.530
 63rd minute France showed that she 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.240
 still had not abdicated after a 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.040
 shelling session near the line 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.960
 Irish he while the defense 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.490
 seemed to place saint is what 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.450
 seize the balloon and dive to the 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.430
 post 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.120
 the umpire woche raise the arm for 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.120
 give the test 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.110
 reviewing the images if the arbitrator 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.120
 had called the tempo a forward 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.250
 might have been detected but 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.570
 the test had been granted and machenaud 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.860
 pass the transformation 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.390
 France comes back to two points 20 22 la 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.400
 tension was at its height for the last 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.740
 of the match with so little difference between 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.240
 two teams 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.340
 ten minutes from the final whistle 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.250
 France got a melee penalty 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.340
 the Irish pack looking tired and 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.380
 accusing the blow but jean marc doussain 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.540
 who had come into play in place of 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.070
 machenaud missed the target 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.690
 joe smic's team could breathe 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.690
 she kept her two points advanced 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.110
 then two minutes from the end of the match 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:41.639
 France seemed to have ruined all 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.309
 Irish hopes of winning the 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.379
 tournament after setting the defense the 

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:48.209
 blue spread the balloon that ended 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:52.490
 on damien chouly in winger position 

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:52.490
 he's picking it up and going to score in corner 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:56.399
 hard blow for men in green but 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:58.619
 the referee used the tempo 

00:05:56.399 --> 00:06:00.629
 welsh gareth simons to check that 

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:02.699
 the pass from papeete h to bed was not 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:04.949
 forward after viewing all 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.969
 angles the decision fell last 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:07.969
 pass was forward 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.290
 of course this judgment went badly 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:19.150
 with locals and their supporters 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.150
 but the Irish were relieved 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.170
 after one last fright in the 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.510
 last seconds 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.640
 referee returned the ball to ireland 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.750
 on a maul initiated by France is 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:38.470
 hissed the end of the match 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:40.060
 the celebrations could start a 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.070
 great fake for ireland and 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.390
 illustrious international career of a 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.840
 of the greatest players in the history of 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.120
 this sport 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.740
 brian o'driscoll it's only the 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.960
 second six nations won by 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.690
 ireland and john smit and his players 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.830
 deserves to raise this trophy in this 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.570
 2014 tournament 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.390
 France will have experienced ups and downs 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.040
 down which explains his fourth place at 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:03.240
 tie with galls but a goal 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.240
 lower caste 

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.720
 and so it's Paul O'connell 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.610
 captain who has returned the honor of 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.870
 lift the trophy alongside others 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.870
 schools that deserves it 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.860
 for ireland it's a worthy scenario 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.259
 hollywood 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.880
 the title is won in paris for the 

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:29.740
 o'driscoll's last international match 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.410
 and the weekend of saint patrick 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:35.229
 Ireland wins the tournament after a 

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:38.430
 win 22 to 20 after a match on 

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:38.430
 can not be more indecisive
