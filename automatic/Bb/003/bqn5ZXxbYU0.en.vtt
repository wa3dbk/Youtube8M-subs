00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
them I just tap it first over the

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.379

blemish<00:04:16.810> or<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.380> under<00:04:17.709> eye

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.300 

then<00:04:23.479> I'll<00:04:23.629> tend<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:24.020> rub<00:04:24.259> it<00:04:24.409> in<00:04:24.439> like<00:04:25.099> I'll

then I'll tend to rub it in like I'll
tap<00:04:26.300> it<00:04:26.569> and<00:04:26.689> then<00:04:27.110> kind<00:04:27.379> of<00:04:27.560> rub<00:04:27.770> it<00:04:27.919> so<00:04:28.069> it

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
melts so if you just tap it you're going

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.659 
melts so if you just tap it you're going
to<00:04:30.169> see<00:04:30.530> all<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:30.919> fingerprints<00:04:31.310> underneath

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:07.149 
using my fingers for these because when
you<00:05:05.810> dip<00:05:05.960> your<00:05:05.990> finger<00:05:06.469> and<00:05:06.620> then<00:05:06.740> put<00:05:06.919> it<00:05:07.009> in

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:07.159 
you dip your finger and then put it in

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:08.709 
you dip your finger and then put it in
your<00:05:07.250> on<00:05:07.430> your<00:05:07.610> face<00:05:07.849> you<00:05:08.360> tend<00:05:08.599> to

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:08.719 
your on your face you tend to

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:10.420 
your on your face you tend to
concentrate<00:05:09.349> most<00:05:09.800> of<00:05:09.949> the<00:05:10.009> concealer<00:05:10.340> on

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
concentrate most of the concealer on

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.980 
concentrate most of the concealer on
your<00:05:10.639> finger<00:05:10.939> when<00:05:11.120> you<00:05:11.210> transfer<00:05:11.659> there's

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
your finger when you transfer there's

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.360 
your finger when you transfer there's
not<00:05:12.169> very<00:05:12.199> much<00:05:12.469> concealer<00:05:12.800> left<00:05:13.159> on<00:05:13.279> your

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
not very much concealer left on your

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.610 
not very much concealer left on your
face<00:05:13.580> so<00:05:14.240> I<00:05:14.270> like<00:05:14.509> using<00:05:14.659> a<00:05:14.900> brush<00:05:15.080> this<00:05:15.409> is<00:05:15.529> a

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
face so I like using a brush this is a

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.019 
face so I like using a brush this is a
little<00:05:15.800> bit<00:05:15.979> smaller<00:05:16.370> of<00:05:16.550> our<00:05:16.669> brush<00:05:16.849> and<00:05:17.000> I

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:17.029 
little bit smaller of our brush and I

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:18.490 
little bit smaller of our brush and I
recommend<00:05:17.419> using<00:05:17.569> for<00:05:17.839> concealer<00:05:18.259> it's<00:05:18.409> an

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
recommend using for concealer it's an

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.290 
recommend using for concealer it's an
elf<00:05:18.680> concealer<00:05:19.189> brush<00:05:19.400> but<00:05:19.639> it's<00:05:19.729> very<00:05:19.909> tiny

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
elf concealer brush but it's very tiny

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.089 
elf concealer brush but it's very tiny
it's<00:05:20.960> not<00:05:21.169> very<00:05:21.349> good<00:05:21.620> for<00:05:21.650> concealing

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
it's not very good for concealing

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:24.070 
it's not very good for concealing
redness<00:05:22.669> like<00:05:22.849> large<00:05:23.180> red<00:05:23.509> areas<00:05:23.810> but<00:05:23.930> it's

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
redness like large red areas but it's

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.510 
redness like large red areas but it's
really<00:05:24.259> good<00:05:24.409> if<00:05:24.499> you<00:05:24.560> wanted<00:05:24.800> to<00:05:24.860> stop<00:05:25.099> dotted

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
really good if you wanted to stop dotted

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.429 
really good if you wanted to stop dotted
