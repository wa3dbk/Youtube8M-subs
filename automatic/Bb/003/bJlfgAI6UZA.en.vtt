00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
things like that but to me if you do a

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.770 
things like that but to me if you do a
lot<00:03:41.860> of<00:03:41.890> hair<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:42.459> most<00:03:42.940> stylists<00:03:43.360> do<00:03:43.570> take

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
lot of hair and most stylists do take

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.690 
lot of hair and most stylists do take
their<00:03:43.959> clients<00:03:44.590> hair<00:03:44.769> out<00:03:44.980> then<00:03:45.280> i<00:03:45.400> think<00:03:45.459> this

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
their clients hair out then i think this

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.610 
their clients hair out then i think this
is<00:03:45.850> a<00:03:45.880> good<00:03:46.120> tool<00:03:46.329> now<00:03:46.750> be<00:03:46.930> careful<00:03:47.110> cuz<00:03:47.440> this

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
is a good tool now be careful cuz this

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.949 
is a good tool now be careful cuz this
thing<00:03:47.890> is<00:03:48.100> a<00:03:48.130> bit<00:03:48.459> short<00:03:48.760> so<00:03:49.120> it<00:03:49.570> lasts<00:03:49.810> a

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
thing is a bit short so it lasts a

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.539 
thing is a bit short so it lasts a
little<00:03:50.079> time<00:03:50.380> to<00:03:50.410> show<00:03:50.709> you<00:03:50.769> how<00:03:50.980> sharp<00:03:51.310> it<00:03:51.459> is

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
little time to show you how sharp it is

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.560 
little time to show you how sharp it is
it<00:03:51.820> cuts<00:03:52.060> like<00:03:52.150> this<00:03:53.850> so<00:03:54.850> cuts<00:03:55.209> through<00:03:55.359> paper

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
it cuts like this so cuts through paper

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.940 
it cuts like this so cuts through paper
that<00:03:55.840> quick<00:03:56.140> you<00:03:56.790> thinking

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
that quick you thinking

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.400 
that quick you thinking
so<00:03:59.950> it's<00:04:00.100> a<00:04:00.160> very<00:04:00.190> very<00:04:00.520> short<00:04:00.760> tool<00:04:01.350> so<00:04:02.350> it

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
so it's a very very short tool so it

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.200 
so it's a very very short tool so it
doesn't<00:04:02.710> take<00:04:02.830> that<00:04:02.980> long<00:04:03.040> are<00:04:03.610> you<00:04:03.730> be<00:04:03.910> doing

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
doesn't take that long are you be doing

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.940 
doesn't take that long are you be doing
is<00:04:04.360> going<00:04:04.540> through<00:04:04.900> typically<00:04:05.440> when<00:04:05.650> you<00:04:05.770> use

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
is going through typically when you use

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.650 
is going through typically when you use
like<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:06.280> scissors<00:04:06.610> or<00:04:06.700> whatever<00:04:07.030> you'll

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
like the scissors or whatever you'll

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.510

that and just get the string and you cut
up<00:04:24.120> dead<00:04:25.120> for<00:04:25.510> it<00:04:25.540> you<00:04:25.810> could<00:04:26.050> that's<00:04:26.320> all

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
up dead for it you could that's all

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.460 
up dead for it you could that's all
you're<00:04:26.710> doing<00:04:27.070> all<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.760> way<00:04:27.850> around<00:04:27.970> the<00:04:28.270> edge

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
you're doing all the way around the edge

he is picking up strings and you cutting

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.650 
he is picking up strings and you cutting
it<00:04:32.380> so<00:04:32.680> it's<00:04:32.890> very<00:04:33.040> simple<00:04:33.520> and<00:04:33.970> then<00:04:34.330> this<00:04:34.450> too

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
it so it's very simple and then this too

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.420 
it so it's very simple and then this too
right<00:04:34.690> here<00:04:34.960> can<00:04:35.110> be<00:04:35.140> used<00:04:35.410> I<00:04:35.590> use<00:04:35.770> it<00:04:35.980> for<00:04:36.010> um

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
have like a white to a skinny tooth comb

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.550 
have like a white to a skinny tooth comb
that's<00:04:43.420> not<00:04:43.690> skinny<00:04:43.930> enough<00:04:44.080> you<00:04:44.380> know<00:04:44.470> how

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
that's not skinny enough you know how

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.500 
that's not skinny enough you know how
sometimes<00:04:44.770> can<00:04:45.190> be<00:04:45.220> a<00:04:45.340> look<00:04:45.550> though<00:04:45.790> this<00:04:46.360> is

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
sometimes can be a look though this is

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.030 
sometimes can be a look though this is
really<00:04:46.720> good<00:04:46.960> for<00:04:47.110> taking<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.500> brains<00:04:47.740> out

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
really good for taking the brains out

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.100 
really good for taking the brains out
too<00:04:48.280> so<00:04:48.550> it's<00:04:49.030> just<00:04:49.210> like<00:04:49.330> three<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:49.930> one

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
too so it's just like three and one

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.840 
too so it's just like three and one
honestly<00:04:50.560> I<00:04:50.650> mean<00:04:50.890> is<00:04:50.980> a<00:04:51.040> very<00:04:51.250> simple<00:04:51.460> proud

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850

this is this track right here we're
gonna<00:04:57.880> be<00:04:58.090> taking<00:04:58.270> out<00:04:58.600> other<00:04:59.200> clients<00:04:59.800> tend

and we're just going to get the string
I'm<00:05:02.140> a<00:05:02.200> zoom<00:05:02.680> in<00:05:02.920> all<00:05:03.190> the<00:05:03.370> way<00:05:03.490> for<00:05:03.790> you<00:05:03.880> all<00:05:04.200> as

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
I'm a zoom in all the way for you all as

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.900 
I'm a zoom in all the way for you all as
much<00:05:05.530> as<00:05:05.710> I<00:05:05.830> can<00:05:08.130> it's<00:05:09.130> kind<00:05:09.370> of<00:05:09.430> hard<00:05:09.640> to<00:05:09.700> see

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
much as I can it's kind of hard to see

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
much as I can it's kind of hard to see
but<00:05:10.060> you<00:05:10.120> can<00:05:10.330> see<00:05:10.420> what<00:05:10.510> I'm<00:05:10.600> talking<00:05:10.630> about

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
but you can see what I'm talking about

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.660 
but you can see what I'm talking about
you<00:05:11.170> know<00:05:11.260> when<00:05:11.440> you<00:05:11.500> take<00:05:11.590> a<00:05:11.650> sewing<00:05:12.070> out<00:05:12.220> it's

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
you know when you take a sewing out it's

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.340 
you know when you take a sewing out it's
very<00:05:12.940> difficult<00:05:13.180> to<00:05:13.450> see<00:05:13.660> the<00:05:13.690> person's<00:05:14.200> here

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
very difficult to see the person's here

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.510 
very difficult to see the person's here
because<00:05:14.530> it<00:05:14.620> here<00:05:14.770> is<00:05:14.860> black<00:05:15.160> and<00:05:15.370> then<00:05:15.460> the

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
because it here is black and then the

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.640 
because it here is black and then the
string<00:05:15.790> is<00:05:15.820> black<00:05:16.090> so<00:05:16.630> this<00:05:16.960> allows<00:05:17.110> you<00:05:17.530> to

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
string is black so this allows you to

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.140 
string is black so this allows you to
pick<00:05:17.950> exactly<00:05:18.190> what's<00:05:18.730> the<00:05:18.850> string<00:05:19.120> and

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
pick exactly what's the string and

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.630 
pick exactly what's the string and
what's<00:05:19.420> the<00:05:19.540> air<00:05:19.810> and<00:05:19.990> just<00:05:20.710> basically<00:05:21.250> just

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
what's the air and just basically just

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.630 
what's the air and just basically just
picking<00:05:21.940> out<00:05:22.060> like<00:05:22.210> I<00:05:22.330> said<00:05:23.250> and<00:05:24.250> that's<00:05:24.400> it

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
picking out like I said and that's it

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.460 
picking out like I said and that's it
like<00:05:24.820> it's<00:05:25.030> so<00:05:25.240> quick<00:05:25.570> that's<00:05:26.170> all<00:05:26.320> you're

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
like it's so quick that's all you're

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.830 
like it's so quick that's all you're
doing<00:05:26.830> now<00:05:27.700> sometimes<00:05:28.180> you<00:05:28.300> may<00:05:28.420> get<00:05:28.630> a<00:05:28.660> little

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
doing now sometimes you may get a little

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.720 
doing now sometimes you may get a little
snag<00:05:29.230> and<00:05:29.620> it<00:05:29.710> may<00:05:29.830> be<00:05:30.010> a<00:05:30.040> little<00:05:30.220> difficult<00:05:30.430> to

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
snag and it may be a little difficult to

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.700 
snag and it may be a little difficult to
get<00:05:30.910> out<00:05:31.120> but<00:05:31.720> that's<00:05:31.960> right<00:05:32.170> now<00:05:32.350> all<00:05:32.560> the

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
get out but that's right now all the

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.140 
get out but that's right now all the
time<00:05:32.920> then<00:05:33.220> it<00:05:33.340> only<00:05:33.460> happened<00:05:33.850> to<00:05:33.910> me<00:05:33.940> a<00:05:34.090> few

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
time then it only happened to me a few

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.960 
time then it only happened to me a few
times<00:05:34.390> and<00:05:35.380> then<00:05:35.440> you<00:05:36.130> just<00:05:36.310> pick<00:05:36.580> you<00:05:36.760> and

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
times and then you just pick you and

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.990 
times and then you just pick you and
then<00:05:37.120> you<00:05:37.240> just<00:05:38.160> just<00:05:39.160> pull<00:05:39.400> it<00:05:39.520> out<00:05:39.670> and<00:05:39.700> are

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
then you just just pull it out and are

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.400 
then you just just pull it out and are
you<00:05:40.120> the<00:05:40.150> one<00:05:40.270> in<00:05:40.630> the<00:05:40.780> track<00:05:41.020> just<00:05:41.140> comes

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
you the one in the track just comes

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:49.600 
you the one in the track just comes
loose<00:05:41.650> you<00:05:42.280> know<00:05:42.310> typical<00:05:43.030> signs<00:05:43.210> check<00:05:43.630> out

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.830 

so<00:05:50.610> notice<00:05:50.850> when<00:05:51.000> I<00:05:51.030> was<00:05:51.240> using<00:05:51.479> this<00:05:51.630> on

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
so notice when I was using this on

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.980 
so notice when I was using this on
somebody's<00:05:52.259> head<00:05:52.289> it<00:05:53.100> wasn't<00:05:53.580> as<00:05:53.759> risky<00:05:54.360> as<00:05:54.389> it

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
somebody's head it wasn't as risky as it

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.080 
somebody's head it wasn't as risky as it
would<00:05:55.139> be<00:05:55.289> using<00:05:55.620> scissors<00:05:55.830> or<00:05:56.100> a<00:05:56.160> heart<00:05:56.520> blade

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
would be using scissors or a heart blade

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.029 
would be using scissors or a heart blade
to<00:05:57.389> take<00:05:57.570> the<00:05:57.690> hair<00:05:57.900> out<00:05:57.930> because<00:05:58.229> a<00:05:58.650> lot<00:05:59.009> of
