00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:16.199
 Hi guys, how are you? I 'm going to teach today. 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.060
 for you how do you draw ok then 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.830
 some people were asking me to 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.039
 teach me how to draw glasses in the sketch 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.990
 So draw a face and now I go. 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.779
 draw his glasses 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.869
 The first thing I do is to make the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.219
 marking where the eyes of the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.590
 doll for me has a sense of where I 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.550
 I'm going to draw a pair of glasses. 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.129
 so I've already made the markings and now a 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.940
 just above the mark of the eyes I go 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.940
 draw a straight line 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.060
 done that I'm going to make the mark zinha 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.060
 there near the nose 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.910
 then I start to ground a line 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.410
 round 'shape of the beach 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.410
 glasses on the drawing 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:25.750
 so now just go and do the curvature 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.750
 and close the line at 5 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.390
 It is important to remember that when you go 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.930
 read a glasses in the sketch you do not need 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.160
 make the part is behind the frame 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.640
 the one that will be placed behind the 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.830
 ear does not need because it is a drawing 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.720
 So how are you going to look at it from the front? 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.670
 if you want to do just a little bit there 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.869
 from the corner just as I am 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.530
 making 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:59.410
 You can but it's just that and then I 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:02.360
 I've been giving a better drawing format 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.130
 The question of the shape of the glasses 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.280
 according to your creativity 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:11.000
 What you need to know is just the location. 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.920
 sure to put it on and then the 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.800
 format is according to your taste 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.450
 you can make round square of 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.450
 The way you think it's gonna be cool 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.230
 ae 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:57.040
 if you want to give the impression of 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:01.540
 book or mirrored glasses is just do 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:05.740
 This drawing is a way that I 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:08.020
 give that impression of brightness even though 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.220
 then just coloring remembering that this 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:15.280
 part of this middle design is to leave or 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:20.190
 in white or with a lighter roll 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.190
 to give the impression of kissing on the glasses 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.560
 ae 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.970
 Are you ready glasses now what I'm going 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.960
 do is do three different models 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.850
 here just so you have an idea 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.850
 inspired to create the first 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:32.510
 thing always kill the size I do not want 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.880
 glasses always risk making a sketch 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.780
 first for later I came giving 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.780
 event format 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.400
 ae 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.910
 whenever I want to draw a glasses 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.210
 of degree 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:47.340
 I do these stingy ones and leave them in 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.340
 color the inside of the glasses 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.600
 ae 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.229

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.690
