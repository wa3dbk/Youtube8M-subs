00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.590
 little open in a corner by 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.530
 what the water goes up 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.290
 and we're going to leave about three 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.100
 hours or until it is already soft 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.670

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.870
 a little more water so you do not 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.210
 consume 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.560
 the one that needs, we already know when 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.190
 is when he easily gets a 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.820
 fork or knife 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.280
 to the meat and that's enough 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.110
 We're going to let it cool 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.240
 little to be able to peel 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.930
 in the tongue it cools to be able 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.350
 peel we're going to make our tomatoes and 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.400
 Serrano chiles here at medium heat 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.980
 high we put a comal and we put a 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.190
 aluminum sheet so that we 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:05.100
 easy to clean when we go to 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:07.940
 put the tomatoes here we have six 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.940
 tomatoes 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.390
 we have serrano peppers 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.090
 We have 8 Serrano chiles if you want it 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.130
 more spicy you can put more and you 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.340
 let's put a clove of garlic that 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.170
 we will also do well here 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.620
 let's go turning until the 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.110
 we do well all around already they are 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:39.000
 well roasted around and we're going to 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.000
 put a little bit of olive oil 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.550
 more or less a spoonful 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.160
 and we're going to put this in the glass of 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.980
 the blender and we will liquefy it 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.620
 let's put the tomatoes chiles a 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.770
 piece of onion and garlic that we passed 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.770
 as well 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.930
 let's put a teaspoon of vinegar 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.690
 of Apple 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.250
 ah 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.250
 a handful of coriander 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:15.200
 and now we are going to put the tomatoes and 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:18.550
 the chiles already roasted and this we are going to 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.550
 liquefy well 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:27.909
 but in this case we are going to omit the 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.079
 noise from the blender but a 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:33.219
 teaspoon of salt 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:35.620
 then we are going to adjust all we are going and 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:37.480
 Now let's put a pan while 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.670
 let's put on heat first that 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.719
 I want to show that language already 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:47.139
 we remove the skin the hard skin already what 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:49.599
 we clean and now we're going to slice the 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:54.010
 sliced ​​and be small pictures or in 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:56.560
 slices as they do in the tacos that 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.519
 it's like we like more with some 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.540
 slices 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.540
 so thin 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.360
 with a little thicker if you like 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.500
 and now what are we going to do in the 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:16.109
 pan is that we are going to give slices 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.019
 we're going to caramelize them a bit so that 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:22.340
 give it more flavor before putting the 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.770
 slice the tongue 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.320
 and here we have the pan is already 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.850
 hot and we're going to put some 2 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.850
 tablespoons of vegetable oil 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.629
 here we go let's go 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.830
 caramelize the whole tongue a little 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.970
 first on one side after I do not tell you 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.970
 let's put the sauce 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.330
 easy and even caramelized as 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.600
 You can see that is what we are looking for 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.060
 really this caramelized doradito 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.669
 behind each side this is going to give 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:02.639
 much more flavor and now if we take out 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.440
 fire so he can put the sauce and 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.390
 do not jump 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.590
 how well you both in your land 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.590
 let's put the sauces 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.500
 It must be said that he had exaggerated a bit 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.700
 with the oil there were two spoonfuls was 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:28.409
 a spoonful here we are going to put 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:32.029
 half a cup of water 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:34.420
 this so that with the reduction we are left 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:38.650
 enough sauce 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:40.249
 then let's put the fire and what 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.669
 let's leave 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:47.389
 that says a little bit that breaks well in the 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:49.129
 bowl and incorporate all the flavors and 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:52.069
 already after five minutes that what 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:54.459
 we leave maybe a little bit we can no longer 

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:54.459
 to serve 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:01.960

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.420
 refried 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:11.860
 a lot of that we also have
