soul just chug along on its own well the

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.290 
soul just chug along on its own well the
most<00:00:34.590> common<00:00:34.680> issue<00:00:35.160> for<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.970> idle

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
most common issue for this is the idle

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.150 
most common issue for this is the idle
screw<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:37.020> little<00:00:37.260> thing<00:00:37.380> right<00:00:37.500> there<00:00:37.770> it's

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
screw that little thing right there it's

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.069 
screw that little thing right there it's
probably<00:00:38.520> turned<00:00:38.760> way<00:00:39.000> down<00:00:39.030> your<00:00:39.540> idols<00:00:39.899> down

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
probably turned way down your idols down

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.470 
probably turned way down your idols down
so<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.560> just<00:00:40.739> caulking<00:00:41.190> out<00:00:41.340> as<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.760> mean<00:00:42.060> it's

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
so it's just caulking out as I mean it's

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.729 
so it's just caulking out as I mean it's
not<00:00:42.570> enough<00:00:42.660> fuel<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.170> there<00:00:43.350> getting<00:00:43.560> in

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
not enough fuel in there getting in

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.889 
not enough fuel in there getting in
there<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.070> it's<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.430> yeah<00:00:45.329> it's<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.750> come

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
there so it's just yeah it's just come

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.490 
there so it's just yeah it's just come
about<00:00:47.180> basically<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> most<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.170> easiest

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
about basically the most the easiest

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.860 
about basically the most the easiest
thing<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.710> do<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.269> almost

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
thing to do is just that you just almost

thing to do is just that you just almost
I'm<00:00:52.320> just<00:00:52.500> turned<00:00:52.710> them<00:00:52.829> out<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.039> take<00:00:53.160> a

in this case

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.979 
in this case
mine's<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.239> Philips<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.750> think<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.219> have<00:00:59.399> to

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989

mine's a Philips I think and you have to
undo<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.109> nut<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.530> then<00:01:01.890> wind<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> screw

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
out and then put the nut back on and

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.850 
out and then put the nut back on and
like<00:01:06.120> you<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.300> listen<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.380> your<00:01:07.470> bike<00:01:07.680> and

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
like you just listen to your bike and

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.140 
like you just listen to your bike and
when<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.130> find<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> idol<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.850> want<00:01:09.030> you

put the nut back on you leave it like

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.860 
put the nut back on you leave it like
that<00:01:10.640> but<00:01:12.350> most<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.590> just<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:13.980> a<00:01:14.010> little

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
that but most it's just like a little

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.180 
that but most it's just like a little
standard<00:01:15.870> screw<00:01:16.230> with<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.440> spring<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.040> back

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
and you spin it return it with a

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.850 
and you spin it return it with a
screwdriver<00:01:19.650> should<00:01:20.130> set<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> idle<00:01:21.560> if<00:01:22.560> that

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
screwdriver should set the idle if that

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.820 
screwdriver should set the idle if that
doesn't<00:01:23.250> work<00:01:24.020> then<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.350> could<00:01:25.470> be<00:01:25.560> something

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830

one<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.350> issues<00:02:13.590> could<00:02:13.740> be<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.340> could

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
one of the issues could be is that could

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.850 
one of the issues could be is that could
be<00:02:14.580> clogged<00:02:15.230> some<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.350> jets<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.650> are<00:02:16.770> in

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
be clogged some of the jets that are in

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.170 
be clogged some of the jets that are in
here<00:02:16.980> as<00:02:17.070> well<00:02:17.220> could<00:02:17.520> be<00:02:17.610> clogged<00:02:17.910> and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
here as well could be clogged and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.660 
here as well could be clogged and
there's<00:02:18.360> actually<00:02:18.660> a<00:02:19.040> lot<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.460> here<00:02:20.580> I

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
there's actually a lot of in here I

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.360 
there's actually a lot of in here I
should<00:02:20.760> probably<00:02:20.880> clean<00:02:21.090> this<00:02:21.210> out<00:02:21.510> but<00:02:22.370> your

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
should probably clean this out but your

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.830 
should probably clean this out but your
yeah<00:02:23.550> your<00:02:23.700> jets<00:02:23.940> could<00:02:24.120> be<00:02:24.240> clogged<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.780> I

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
yeah your jets could be clogged and I

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.660 
yeah your jets could be clogged and I
could<00:02:25.020> be<00:02:25.110> sucking<00:02:25.620> up<00:02:25.740> all<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:25.950> fuel<00:02:26.340> mixture

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
could be sucking up all the fuel mixture

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.770 
could be sucking up all the fuel mixture
it's<00:02:26.850> getting<00:02:27.030> into<00:02:27.180> your<00:02:27.300> bike<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.600> could

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
it's getting into your bike and could

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
and some sort of a difference got a

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.030 
and some sort of a difference got a
whole<00:04:24.170> bunch<00:04:24.320> of<00:04:24.410> these<00:04:24.500> little<00:04:24.770> holes<00:04:24.920> like

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
whole bunch of these little holes like

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.810 
whole bunch of these little holes like
that<00:04:25.160> right<00:04:25.460> there

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
now this is my carve your carbon is

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.370 
now this is my carve your carbon is
probably<00:04:28.910> gonna<00:04:29.090> be<00:04:29.180> different<00:04:29.660> but<00:04:29.840> this<00:04:30.320> is

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
probably gonna be different but this is

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.960 
probably gonna be different but this is
what<00:04:30.500> mine<00:04:30.710> looks<00:04:30.740> like<00:04:31.220> so<00:04:31.490> just<00:04:31.730> take<00:04:31.850> out

then you're gonna be kind of for

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.550 
then you're gonna be kind of for
this<00:05:14.480> and<00:05:14.690> you<00:05:14.750> might<00:05:14.870> have<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.110> get<00:05:15.170> a<00:05:15.230> new<00:05:15.320> jet

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
this and you might have to get a new jet

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.720 
this and you might have to get a new jet
but<00:05:17.110> yeah<00:05:18.110> chances<00:05:18.740> are<00:05:18.860> that<00:05:18.890> the<00:05:19.340> Jets<00:05:19.550> your

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
but yeah chances are that the Jets your

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.820 
but yeah chances are that the Jets your
idle<00:05:20.000> screw<00:05:20.300> um<00:05:21.169> if<00:05:21.860> not<00:05:22.190> then<00:05:22.550> it<00:05:22.669> is<00:05:22.720> I<00:05:23.830> highly

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
idle screw um if not then it is I highly

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.500 
idle screw um if not then it is I highly
doubt<00:05:25.040> that<00:05:25.100> it's<00:05:25.370> gonna<00:05:25.460> be<00:05:25.669> your<00:05:25.850> top<00:05:26.060> end<00:05:26.330> or

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
doubt that it's gonna be your top end or

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.409 
doubt that it's gonna be your top end or
anything<00:05:26.690> like<00:05:26.990> that<00:05:27.050> major<00:05:27.440> but<00:05:28.060> it's<00:05:29.060> always

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419 
anything like that major but it's always

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.080 
anything like that major but it's always
a<00:05:29.510> possibility<00:05:29.750> so<00:05:30.530> just<00:05:31.010> keep<00:05:31.610> that<00:05:31.640> in<00:05:31.880> mind

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
a possibility so just keep that in mind

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.150 
a possibility so just keep that in mind
but<00:05:32.330> yeah<00:05:32.750> just<00:05:32.960> try<00:05:33.140> the<00:05:33.200> idle<00:05:33.560> screw<00:05:33.830> try

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
but yeah just try the idle screw try

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.159 
but yeah just try the idle screw try
tightening<00:05:34.580> that<00:05:34.700> up<00:05:34.760> or<00:05:35.450> loosening<00:05:35.840> over<00:05:36.050> the

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
tightening that up or loosening over the

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.200 
tightening that up or loosening over the
 whatever<00:05:36.830> way<00:05:36.919> you<00:05:37.010> have<00:05:37.130> to<00:05:37.220> go<00:05:37.370> just

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
 whatever way you have to go just

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.490 
 whatever way you have to go just
try<00:05:38.300> playing<00:05:38.540> around<00:05:38.750> with<00:05:38.900> it<00:05:38.960> and<00:05:40.180> also<00:05:41.500> try

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
try playing around with it and also try

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.070 
try playing around with it and also try
to<00:05:42.860> around<00:05:42.980> with<00:05:43.220> your<00:05:43.340> jets<00:05:43.580> because

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
to around with your jets because

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.940 
to around with your jets because
they<00:05:45.080> could<00:05:45.230> be<00:05:45.320> clogged

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
they could be clogged
