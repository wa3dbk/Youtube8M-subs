00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
the original that was a core development

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.640 
the original that was a core development
principle<00:01:18.180> for<00:01:18.360> us<00:01:18.540> as<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.870> game<00:01:19.080> needed<00:01:19.530> to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
launched a generation of shooters so we

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.440

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
had to make sure that that feeling was

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.850 
had to make sure that that feeling was
identical<00:01:27.870> to<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.110> experience<00:01:28.710> that

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
identical to that experience that

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.200 
identical to that experience that
everybody<00:01:29.190> remembered<00:01:29.610> ten<00:01:29.850> years<00:01:30.060> ago

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.760 
everybody remembered ten years ago
because<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.020> really<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.320> gift<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
because this is really a gift to the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.890 
because this is really a gift to the
fans<00:01:31.980> this<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.490> way<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.750> relive<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
fans this is a way to relive the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.420 
fans this is a way to relive the
experience<00:01:34.080> of<00:01:34.440> playing<00:01:34.620> halo<00:01:34.920> one<00:01:35.159> for<00:01:35.370> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
experience of playing halo one for the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.860 
experience of playing halo one for the
first<00:01:35.640> time<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.150> really<00:01:36.390> wanted<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.659> make

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
first time so we really wanted to make

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.719 
first time so we really wanted to make
sure<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.080> was<00:01:37.170> identical<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.400> way<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.610> did

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
sure it was identical and the way we did

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.610 
sure it was identical and the way we did
that<00:01:38.909> was<00:01:38.970> actually<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.750> fun<00:01:39.960> technical<00:01:40.440> trick

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
that was actually a fun technical trick

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.050 
that was actually a fun technical trick
we're<00:01:40.800> actually<00:01:40.920> running<00:01:41.250> portions<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.909> two

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
we're actually running portions of two

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.120 
we're actually running portions of two
engines<00:01:42.390> at<00:01:42.510> the<00:01:42.600> same<00:01:42.810> time<00:01:43.050> so<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
engines at the same time so the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.800 
engines at the same time so the
underlying<00:01:44.520> code<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.940> code<00:01:45.090> controlling<00:01:45.720> how

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
underlying code the code controlling how

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.570 
underlying code the code controlling how
the<00:01:45.870> game<00:01:46.110> feels<00:01:46.380> how<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.620> AI<00:01:46.830> reacts<00:01:47.280> all<00:01:47.490> of

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
the game feels how the AI reacts all of

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.670 
the game feels how the AI reacts all of
that<00:01:47.700> stuff<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.510> a<00:01:48.570> lot<00:01:48.870> of<00:01:48.930> it's<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> original

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
that stuff is a lot of it's the original

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.320 
that stuff is a lot of it's the original
halo<00:01:49.860> 1<00:01:50.100> code<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.580> that<00:01:50.610> was<00:01:50.790> really<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.090> best

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
halo 1 code and that was really the best

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.700 
halo 1 code and that was really the best
way<00:01:51.450> for<00:01:51.750> us<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.870> ensure<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.560> game

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
way for us to ensure that the game

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.410 
way for us to ensure that the game
played<00:01:52.979> exactly<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.640> same<00:01:53.820> as<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.090> did<00:01:54.210> 10

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
played exactly the same as it did 10

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.390 
played exactly the same as it did 10
years<00:01:54.450> ago<00:01:54.690> but<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.680> top<00:01:55.830> of<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.070> we've

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
years ago but on top of that we've

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.430 
years ago but on top of that we've
layered<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.940> new<00:01:57.060> graphics<00:01:57.510> engine<00:01:57.659> that

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
layered a new graphics engine that

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.930 
layered a new graphics engine that
allows<00:01:58.530> us<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.340> know<00:01:59.460> make<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.790> game<00:01:59.909> look

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
allows us to you know make the game look

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.490 
allows us to you know make the game look
fantastic<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.810> look<00:02:00.960> like<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> current

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
fantastic and look like a current

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.990 
fantastic and look like a current
generation<00:02:01.950> title<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.369> it's<00:02:02.520> really<00:02:02.760> a<00:02:02.880> great

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
generation title so it's really a great

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.330 
generation title so it's really a great
mix<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.900> two<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.770> at<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.950> end<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.220> day

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
mix of the two so at the end of the day

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.680 
mix of the two so at the end of the day
