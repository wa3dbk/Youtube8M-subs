 I apologize to you and I want to explain 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.710

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.380
 now, and I'm sorry, and at night 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.470
 I'm here with a light here LED hope 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.960
 Can you understand how to speak? 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.120
 here's the excuse too, I 'm recording 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.079
 with one hand holding the lamp with the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.370
 other 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.770
 here on our right side here or 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:47.850
 best on our left side 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:54.449
 I'll try to hold him here from our side. 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:56.010
 Here we have left here the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.430

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.860
 in my case not even that hole there is 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.270
 would be the lighter 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.460
 but it's a problem I ended up cutting and I 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.880
 until today not touching the electrical part 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:35.159
 or a solution is still something that 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.790
 I intend to fix and replace staff 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.490
