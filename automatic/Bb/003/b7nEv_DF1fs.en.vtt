00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
focus that's okay you can then gradually

00:00:43.950 --> 00:01:08.660 
focus that's okay you can then gradually
remove<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.430> treat

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.200 

then<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.960> second<00:01:10.590> step<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.700> do<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> same

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
then the second step is to do the same

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.840 
then the second step is to do the same
thing<00:01:12.570> but<00:01:12.810> have<00:01:13.259> her<00:01:13.590> walk<00:01:14.040> alongside<00:01:14.369> you

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
thing but have her walk alongside you

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.630 
thing but have her walk alongside you
for<00:01:15.060> longer<00:01:15.240> periods<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:16.020> time<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.619> this

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.950 

so<00:01:21.240> you're<00:01:21.390> going<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.570> wait<00:01:21.780> before<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.560> click

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.450 

for<00:01:26.960> a<00:01:26.990> longer<00:01:27.260> period<00:01:27.650> versus<00:01:28.130> when<00:01:28.280> she

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
for a longer period versus when she

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:39.550 
for a longer period versus when she
first<00:01:28.700> gets<00:01:28.880> into<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.300> heel<00:01:29.690> position

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.560

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.319 

if<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.129> dog<00:02:36.310> doesn't<00:02:36.549> need<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.790> correction<00:02:37.239> you

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
you but make sure they're not like

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.009 
you but make sure they're not like
pulling<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.549> forward<00:02:54.849> and<00:02:55.299> you're<00:02:55.750> still

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
pulling you forward and you're still

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.050 
pulling you forward and you're still
yeah<00:02:56.560> their<00:02:57.159> shoulders<00:02:57.609> should<00:02:57.790> be<00:02:57.909> at<00:02:58.030> your

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
yeah their shoulders should be at your

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.569 
yeah their shoulders should be at your
the<00:02:58.510> side<00:02:58.719> of<00:02:58.750> your<00:02:58.989> leg<00:02:59.200> give<00:03:00.159> or<00:03:00.189> take<00:03:00.340> a

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
the side of your leg give or take a

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:13.320 
the side of your leg give or take a
little

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.300 

one<00:03:14.320> way<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.470> keep<00:03:14.680> your<00:03:14.800> die<00:03:14.950> from<00:03:15.160> that

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
one way to keep your die from that

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.420 
one way to keep your die from that
polling<00:03:15.730> is<00:03:15.960> to<00:03:16.960> actually<00:03:17.320> go<00:03:17.680> on<00:03:17.830> a<00:03:17.860> walk<00:03:18.160> and

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
polling is to actually go on a walk and

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.680 
polling is to actually go on a walk and
prevent<00:03:18.760> them<00:03:18.850> from<00:03:18.910> doing<00:03:19.060> too<00:03:19.510> much

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
prevent them from doing too much

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.840 
prevent them from doing too much
sniffing<00:03:20.350> and<00:03:20.770> going<00:03:21.070> wherever<00:03:21.310> they<00:03:21.520> want<00:03:21.760> to

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
sniffing and going wherever they want to

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.330 
sniffing and going wherever they want to
go<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.810> whatnot<00:03:23.650> and<00:03:23.890> this<00:03:24.010> is<00:03:24.130> a<00:03:24.160> great

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
go and and whatnot and this is a great

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.640 
go and and whatnot and this is a great
way<00:03:24.550> to<00:03:24.610> keep<00:03:24.820> their<00:03:25.030> focus<00:03:25.210> on<00:03:25.690> you<00:03:26.080> instead

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
way to keep their focus on you instead

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.630 
way to keep their focus on you instead
of<00:03:26.770> what<00:03:26.920> they<00:03:27.070> want<00:03:27.100> to<00:03:27.400> do<00:03:27.520> on<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.700> walk<00:03:29.640> the

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
of what they want to do on a walk the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.880 
of what they want to do on a walk the
fourth<00:03:30.940> step<00:03:31.030> is<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:31.870> finish<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.500> command

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
fourth step is to finish the command

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.090 
fourth step is to finish the command
heel<00:03:33.250> by<00:03:33.880> having<00:03:34.630> them<00:03:34.810> sit<00:03:35.200> when<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:35.650> stop

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
heel by having them sit when you stop

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.550 
heel by having them sit when you stop
like<00:03:36.940> this<00:03:37.210> so<00:03:37.630> you<00:03:37.720> still<00:03:37.960> say<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.260> command

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
like this so you still say the command

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.860 
like this so you still say the command
heel<00:03:38.800> and<00:03:39.280> then<00:03:39.580> at<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:39.910> first<00:03:40.330> few<00:03:40.600> times

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
heel and then at the first few times

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.200 
heel and then at the first few times
when<00:03:41.500> they're<00:03:41.680> doing<00:03:42.130> this<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:42.430> can<00:03:42.580> say<00:03:42.850> sit

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
when they're doing this you can say sit

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.480 
when they're doing this you can say sit
and<00:03:43.420> then<00:03:44.110> after<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.500> while<00:03:44.590> then<00:03:45.010> start<00:03:45.310> to

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:45.490 
and then after a while then start to

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.980 
and then after a while then start to
recognize<00:03:45.640> if<00:03:46.000> you<00:03:46.120> say<00:03:46.270> he'll<00:03:46.480> know<00:03:46.720> when<00:03:46.870> you

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
recognize if you say he'll know when you

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.350 
recognize if you say he'll know when you
stop<00:03:47.290> they<00:03:47.860> have<00:03:48.070> to<00:03:48.250> sit<00:03:48.460> next<00:03:48.700> you<00:03:49.030> make<00:03:49.240> sure

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
stop they have to sit next you make sure

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.940 
stop they have to sit next you make sure
they're<00:03:49.540> not<00:03:49.630> sitting<00:03:49.990> in<00:03:50.080> front<00:03:50.290> of<00:03:50.410> you<00:03:50.530> but

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
they're not sitting in front of you but

00:03:50.950 --> 00:04:06.050 
they're not sitting in front of you but
they're<00:03:51.100> sitting<00:03:51.400> next<00:03:51.550> life

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.750 

the<00:04:06.690> sooner<00:04:06.930> she<00:04:07.020> takes<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.709> dog<00:04:07.950> a<00:04:08.220> while<00:04:08.430> to

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
the sooner she takes the dog a while to

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.540 
the sooner she takes the dog a while to
get<00:04:08.940> this<00:04:09.180> like<00:04:09.450> wena<00:04:10.319> didn't<00:04:10.680> sit<00:04:10.920> right<00:04:10.950> away

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
get this like wena didn't sit right away

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.240 
get this like wena didn't sit right away

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
but that's okay it's when they sit then

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.590
