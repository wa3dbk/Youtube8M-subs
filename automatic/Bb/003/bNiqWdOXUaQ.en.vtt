00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.089
 Hello dear friends, swami 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:08.370
 marakasi you watch the show chic 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.550
 position issue 51 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.179
 the first location is on the map 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.400
 mines squared b1 best here 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.699
 ride a medium tank with a sturdy turret 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.010
 and from this place you can effectively 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.380
 shoot enemies who climbed 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.560
 on the slide, itâ€™s mostly of course medium 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.289
 tanks can also be very from here 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.780
 not bad defend if for opponents 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.450
 comes from all sides as possible 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.379
 effectively tank the tower at the expense of 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.719
 uneven terrain next point 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.980
 located on the south coast map 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.350
 square e7 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.230
 best to go there on an average tank 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.020
 although if you have time you can and 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.910
 tyazh and from here you can effectively 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.160
 shine enemies that stand on 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.879
 Balcony can also of course 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.520
 damage 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.340
 but note that if they light you 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.729
 opponents will be able to shoot cities in you 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.040
 and generally interesting place allows 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.770
 a lot of damage especially if 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.470
 opponents down to the down town and 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.180
 from the balcony you nobody shines and 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.540
 In this case, you can shoot 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.580
 enemies will not shine true 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.700
 It is worth noting that if at least once 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.890
 the enemies here will see you for sure 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.229
 will want to destroy you and come straight 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.680
 from here and in that case have to be with them 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.680
 fight and the allies can not always 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.350
 help you as well if prices in the city 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.920
 no more then you can drive up to these 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.229
 a stone 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.079
 especially it can be done effectively 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.570
 on small tanks and so here you can 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.979
 lure opponents on yourself not 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.659
 damage them or just highlight 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.750
 Next is another interesting place 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.170
 position ruinberg map squared q 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.329
 0 there should go on low tanks with 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.700
 strong tower and then you can 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.610
 hide here for this little hill 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.890
 and also here for this house is it true 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.470
 collapses and it's certainly not 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.050
 with but in principle it will not hurt you 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.350
 effectively defit this direction where 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.209
 very often opponents attack and you 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.730
 you can tank well here 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.250
 highlight enemies and of course 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.410
 damage but as you understand here 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.230
 The chance that you can be quite high 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.230
 fly a suitcase from arta and this of course 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.120
 It will be very sad so I advise 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.270
 go here if there is no art 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.450
 or if it is only one then you can 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.430
 less safe to be also 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.610
 It is worth noting that if opponents 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.680
 will go straight at you to attack then this place 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.390
 completely useless but if they are 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.390
 to shoot with you 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.040
 then it will be just as well possible 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:58.769
 go next goes point on the map 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.290
 el hulluf squared j5 best here 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.440
 go aim at a medium tank with 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.200
 good vertical lay angles well 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.140
 and it is also desirable and a good disguise 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.049
 review and from here you will be able to shine the center 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.739
 as well as shoot the enemies that are there 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.590
 are going 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:20.220
 but the most important thing is that you can shine 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.340
 hence the square which is often g9 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.730
 enemy tanks and they are very vulnerable so 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.579
 how after a light immediately take damage 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.500
 Of the minuses worth noting that if you 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.110
 here they will light that is quite large 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.750
 the likelihood that opponents will inflict immediately 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.030
 a lot of damage because very often on 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.239
 this card and the players just wait for 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.030
 somebody will light up well and also to you 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:50.180
 can rise enemy medium tanks 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.180
 but overall the position is very good 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:55.290
 then we have an interesting 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.320
 map location pearl river in 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.570
 e3 square is best to go here 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.940
 tall tanks with a sturdy turret and 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.299
 good overview and from here you can 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.400
 effectively defit your base if 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.040
 opponents will be the truth in that wrong 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.890
 you will hardly get them only 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.450
 some towers will hang around but basically 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.890
 some places in excellent 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.180
 shoot through enemies 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.000
 and most importantly be able to highlight the base 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.190
 what might save the fight for example you 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.380
 be able to bring down the seizure and thus you 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:30.650
 play valuable time and your allies 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.460
 come back and capture the enemy base 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.979
 first 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.780
 there is also a small mound here 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.590
 allows you to effectively tank 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.090
 tower but true this position is very easy 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.570
 shot by art 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.729
 and this of course is a big disadvantage further in 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.169
 us goes point on the fjords map 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:50.930
 squared g3 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:54.410
 it is worth going to the tank with not very 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:57.169
 high hull strong tower or on 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.699
 a tank with a good disguise here you 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.370
 can lean out 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:04.160
 do the bill and then you will hide here 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.770
 for this stone thanks to the fact that before 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:09.949
 you have many trees and bushes 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.710
 glow only after the shot and this 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:16.039
 very well maybe even on 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.169
 Fri-Sau with excellent disguise you at all 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.120
 there will not be a light here but that's for sure 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.820
 I do not know and this is all dear friends 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.860

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.900

00:05:53.949 --> 00:06:01.220
 I flooded my home here 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:04.490
 invisible tree bushes how much 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.979
 distance to opponents on fcm and from his 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.159
 super disguise me here no one ever 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:13.460

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:18.500
 But how did I get a fuck 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:21.020

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:24.710
