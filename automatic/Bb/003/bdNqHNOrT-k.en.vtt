00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.439
 good 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.810
 another key element in the lugubrious 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.810
 atmosphere of amnesia are the effects of 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:38.480
 sound almost everything in the game can be 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.080
 touch or hit to make a sound 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.080
 audible 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.950
 you should be more careful not to do 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.410
 too much noise and sounds 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.410
 strong can attract monsters 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.350
 when you meet the monster 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.199
 you will begin to lose sanity as you can 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.080
 notes begin to feel shivers 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.210
 breathe forcibly to lose vision and 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.119
 to empty the bladder but first of all 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.759
 you must pay close attention and listen 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.770
 the terror meter when you hear this 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.899
 peculiar alarm means that the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.860
 monster has you in the spotlight and 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.860
 that is approaching 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.300
 when you come face to face with the 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.510
 monster the most important thing to do is 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.600
 keep calm breathe deeply squeeze 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.730
 your fists swell your chest and get ready 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.730
 to start running like a babe 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.439
 as expected the monster will start 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.429
 to chase you remember always keep 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.200
 the calm 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.610
 the last thing you have to do when a 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.219
 disfigured monster is 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.890
 chasing is to forget completely 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:54.560
 where you are lucky to practices 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.689
 what you have done before would be your teacher 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.689
 opening and closing doors in amnesia 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.530
 talking about the king of Rome a good method 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.390
 to escape is locking the door and 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.060
 making a barricade that will give you 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.920
 extra time to draw a plan without 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.620
 However, you must know that not only 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.570
 barrier is not permanent but also 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.500
 piss off the monster more and they will give you more 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.500
 I want to kill you 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.349
 you should also know that despite your 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.150
 desperate attempt to survive 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.750
 you also run the risk of losing 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.790
 sanity due to darkness 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.040
 although you can use darkness to your 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.960
 please to hide you can also 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.890
 hurt you if you hide during 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.630
 too much time 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.760
 and now we go to the paradise of the 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.340
 hideouts your best option 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.990
 survival sanctuary of sanctuaries 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.690
 closet when ours is not 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.540
 looking silently and closes 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.069
 the doors this is the last site in 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.040
 the one that the monsters of brandenburg 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.870
 They would expect to find you is indispensable 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.300
 that you stand still inside the closet 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.700
 until you feel that the threat has been 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.980
 gone 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.540
 when I'm ready to go out what 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.879
 first thing you have to do is open up very 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.980
 slowly the doors to make sure 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.760
 that the monster is not stalking 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.760
 around 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.030
 the key is stealth 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.260
 sometimes the monsters are 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.750
 simply hallucinations caused by 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.220
 the lack of sanity and that they could not 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.220
 even kill a fly 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.569
 ah 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.050
 the
