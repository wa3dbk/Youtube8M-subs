00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.080
 make a good serve of a cold the waistband 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.599
 pro classic door is as the name already says 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.990
 no classic, right? 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.619
 It's a small bundle there, it was not 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.350
 low cost but he is a legend as 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.850
 highlight in his box the acclaimed with the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.140
 supposed proof it really is a movie 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.230
 acclaimed well 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.330
 classifying as the technician km 50 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.309
 was not well recommended and everyone 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.170
 knows for this price range of it 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.920
 by sound quality that it picks up a 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:42.000
 so exceptional choice 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.550
 he is a pamphlet and nene and he is well he 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.760
 has this classic construction you 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.940
 people even think ugly a little bad 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.500
 I like it but anyway it stays 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.840
 origins then he has not changed and open the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.730
 box that I used it a lot and if 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.780
 here for stage monitoring 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.420
 I played drums 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.339
 the staff is coming, the door is no good 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.100
 own stage monitoring was not 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.229
 open in the face isotope in theory much 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.650
 It's good to talk, but not practice. 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.409
 It was playing and won. I understood. I played. 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.570
 not always with the door ready never 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.420
 I had a problem 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.310
 it worked very well not only me but the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.619
 personnel personnel who played bass 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.680
 everyone used it because the proof 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.079
 no problem with that 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.450
 solves of course isolates me like henry or 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.270
 some other handset but the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.750
 teacher leaving as a stage monitor 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.430
 quietly 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.500
 both he and the all hg inflated 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.329
 how do you how to use your 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.100
 I only play the drums I do not know what I 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:52.799
 I find it odd to talk about a 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.030
 tank truck 414 said so ah how is it? 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.500
 that you use the sheet of paper 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.070
 battery in the face 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.990
 if you see voice problem on the globe or 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.610
 any other reporter species that is 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.159
 making world cup coverage are 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.099
 watching most of them use the car 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.899
 with 114 were happy and cheap light 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:14.129
 easy to carry and the company 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.840
 understood I do not need to stay I'll touch the 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:19.400
 I'm going to have to spend millions on 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.819
 port discharge approves 1 414 was already 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:28.590
 Good to open that it comes here right? 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:31.739
 here you have it comes with a 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.810
 baby your kind or other proof door 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.799
 I lost it he went for good 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:42.260
 buying another is that the little baby 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.260
 transport is little of the coast 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:51.780
 beauty 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:54.620
 here is the fundese a little paper that the 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.620
 his box 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.639
 this was good for the person to look for and 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.579
 low cost right? 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:08.879
 with low cost and sound quality 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:11.099
 Rumor's choice of quic is that you do not 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.730
 It binds a lot to the beauty of the phone because 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.829
 He is really ugly. 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.139
 It's really cool, the little sound that he made. 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.109
 they provided the house with an absurd price 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:25.049
 Good morning but if you go shopping outside 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:34.489
 Good, let me take it open for you. 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:39.209
 to see the cable a very simple way 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:42.329
 He is much freer, he is not at all well. 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.729
 he hands it on and he appears to be 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.769
 fragile but he can handle it 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:49.530
 enough of that playing held up a lot 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:53.310
 road and crash are and carlos bucket 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:57.000
 and at the end he is the one and 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:03.209
 has that angled zin point the 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.849
 way then he has this require it 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.579
 need to adjust right in your ear 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:12.120
 can see that it is ventilated there he is 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:17.239
 ventilated from a half in and centers 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.239
 here is obviously not aside too 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:25.620
 that raid this here for you to adjust 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.660
 This comfort zone here is what 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.510
 you adjust to reality I never understood 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.670
 right here but never never touch 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.280
 this is not for you to adjust the 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:40.080
 so much so that he's going to shake his head right 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.060
 You can touch it here and I think 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:48.060
 that's what this is for, it does not have a background 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:53.610
 sure he stays like that, he understands 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:56.280
 Anyway, somebody knows I never touch it. 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.190
 here my vine poison so I 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.950
 I made it and it folds here is for you. 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:08.880
 put get put in that case 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:11.700
 well then I repeat the person looking there 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.820
 a low-cost handset 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.650
 the phone that does not need to avoid that 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.250
 absurd isolation so here it will not 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.220
 give you 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:24.260
 but with a really cool sound and if from here 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.260
 Your choice when the door is ready 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:32.120
 that's it was worth seeing but this 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.120
 video the guys went
