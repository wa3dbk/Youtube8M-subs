00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
and that was my major let them based

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.430 
and that was my major let them based
more<00:02:11.270> air<00:02:11.420> in<00:02:11.600> so<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.840> rider<00:02:12.050> could<00:02:12.200> breathe

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
more air in so the rider could breathe

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.110 
more air in so the rider could breathe
easier<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.010> these<00:02:13.550> were<00:02:13.730> like<00:02:13.880> sort<00:02:14.090> of

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
easier and these were like sort of

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.330 
easier and these were like sort of
prototype<00:02:14.540> goggles<00:02:15.050> at<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.230> time<00:02:15.440> which<00:02:16.250> they

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
prototype goggles at the time which they

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.590 
prototype goggles at the time which they
would<00:02:16.610> probably<00:02:16.730> devote<00:02:17.120> a<00:02:17.150> lot<00:02:17.450> of<00:02:17.510> the

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
would probably devote a lot of the

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:30.180 
would probably devote a lot of the
goggles<00:02:17.750> that<00:02:18.020> Jake<00:02:18.230> is<00:02:18.260> using<00:02:18.709> today
