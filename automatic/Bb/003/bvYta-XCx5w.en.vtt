00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello again welcome to another video 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.299
 same our casión we come with another 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.649
 chapter of pokemon xiii likewise 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.330
 I hope the chapter has arrived 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.670
 previous and if they do not go check the inside 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.650
 and leave the link in the description and 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.269
 we went back to talk directly about this 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.300
 chapter that we bring and it's a pretty 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.010
 special equally is a fiction is a 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.050
 mystery that already has some time 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.550
 but I also do not think that many 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.130
 people know since it is an event 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.449
 almost impossible to access and if any of 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.910
 you go to those who are listening to me 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.619
 ever happened to him, believe me 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.510
 you are more than lucky because 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.820
 it's an almost impossible event 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.260
 witness but good the event to which 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.960
 we are going to talk on this occasion they will be 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.210
 the albino pokemon like this is for those 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.040
 people who did not know there is a 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.610
 most bizarre variation in the pokemon 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.559
 although the various color of chinese and 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.820
 these are the albino pokemon and good to 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.530
 continued by showing a small 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.810
 image so they know what we are 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.730
 talking 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.370
 that's right here you can see that they are the 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.760
 pokemon albinos pokemon without any type 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.560
 of color is almost impossible to be 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.170
 appear some but if ever a 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.200
 you appeared to them believe me they are 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.750
 immensely fortunate and good we are going to 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.640
 talk about this mystery about 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.550
 this moment because it is completely 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.440
 true the pokemon several colors in 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.870
 each generation lose more value in 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.550
 pokemon x6 have been greatly facilitated their 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.340
 capture from the different 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.380
 methods like for example the chains of 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.060
 fishing poker swim or the biggest 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.220
 probability of encounter in the safari 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.960
 have been some players are 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.729
 have appeared by burning albinos in the 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.500
 game is about a pokémon that has 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.200
 lost their colors and they are 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.360
 completely in black and white to 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.710
 opposite of the various colors that are 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.200
 a variation of color 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.119
 these pokemon are real but really 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.480
 more you try anything other than a 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.510
 bug 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.090
 although this is like putting these pokemon 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.660
 they are real, there is a way to find them 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.850
 but they really are not at a certain point 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.980
 completely real created by game 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.330
 freak on purpose not only speaks more than 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.160
 a buff then is that me 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.259
 whoever has found it is 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.610
 immensely lucky because within 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.260
 your games could find a buff 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.940
 quite special that allowed them 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.490
 find each other because they show 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.290
 wait a little more in very rare 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.600
 pokemon may appear 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.760
 albinos but disappears nothing else if you're 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.920
 the game and refocus of all 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.750
 probably nintendo ways have already 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.850
 solved this ship with the last 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.650
 update of the games would not be 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.510
 nothing bad that for future editions 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.580
 included in a variation of the 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.670
 pokemon even more rare than the various 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.590
 colors equally as you already know 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.920
 it's very very easy to get a pokemons 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.110
 training especially with the hordes with 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.600
 the safari to friendship with the chains of 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.070
 fishing with radar with all the 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.530
 odds of finding pokemon 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.720
 train and they showed up to seas but 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.140
 now that we have ground now that there is 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.010
 this super weird little variation of 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.750
 pokemon some that actually 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.209
 it's just a bug and that's why 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.760
 He commented that those people who have 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.130
 managed to obtain or at least sight one 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.840
 they have been immensely fortunate they are 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.190
 plus those that can take some 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.940
 Photography 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.480
 that as you can see there is no way 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.430
 legal to conserve these pokemon since 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.800
 once they close and open the game they go 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.320
 to open you think it would be fine 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.040
 that nintendo added some variation 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.200
 in next installments of pokemon someone 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.420
 I would be pretty father who own more 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.400
 hard to get that pokemon 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.710
 training I hope you liked it 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.990
 this episode of mysteries pokemon xiii 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.580
 and if they liked it they like it a lot 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.810
 they gave a like comment action and that 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.480
 subscribe to the channel if they are not 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.120
 subscribed equally at this moment in 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.800
 some upper corner escapes them 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.660
 a little button will be appearing 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.490
 so that they only sting him and 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.840
 a section will appear directly 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.420
 that you can subscribe to the channel 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.220
 if they are not and if they are, please 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.050
 they would be a lot like a comment 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.060
 a subscription remember that once 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.040
