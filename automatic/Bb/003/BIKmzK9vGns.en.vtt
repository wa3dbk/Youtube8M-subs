00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.590
 when they met manrique is 20 years old and on the 26th we met in the 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.910
 Doctor Pedro Sanz's office and the secretary of the office suddenly entered 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.659
 presented in tezanos talk 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:17.869
 we started to leave but it was something hidden nobody knew 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.679
 and the wife of doctor Pedro osarean nosy a gossip wanted to know 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.189
 of the life of all the civil servants arrived already finding out who was walking with 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.230
 who who was with whom out of the flagella that I have 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.660
 and here the doctor pedroza 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.190
 and I have not told you about the other secretariat, well, she did not stop 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.270
 to live pending of us lived finding out everything filling simulated 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.960
 that no one knew they were leaving then we allied ourselves with the 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.690
 dispatch and simulated 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.770
 but finally everyone knew it then that they did not care anymore 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.580
 we hid nothing and since then we are together and since then 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.520
 little time that we are together I think so and that this realizes and in the 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.930
 case and there where Dr. Peter Orszag happened the following 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.500
 There is a job that was not mine, why was it curious? 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.740
 sometimes people talk in a way that nobody supports is not true 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.780
 talking is not just talking to the home 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.780
 talk 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.939
 If your story is too long 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.020
 and whoever hears still does not say anything 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.970
 distrust something is wrong 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.420
 or the matter has no interest for your interlocutor 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.570
 or external is giving the other the opportunity to speak 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.310
 a wise advice tells us 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.970
 master the language 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.650
 the bible makes that clear to us in a text where it says the following 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.740
 like golden apples in silver trays so are the words 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.930
 said in his time 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.340
 On the other hand there are some factors that interest in communication 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.480
 for example 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.380
 the lack of time 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.300
 television 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.050
 and selfishness 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.740
 because when we concentrate 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.520
 in ourselves we do not worry about who is by our side 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.550
 or who is in need of them 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.620
 and that's where the lack of communication comes from, which generates a tremendous 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.620
 wear in the relationship 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:16.909
 friend you know I do not have big problems at home that 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.110
 but there is one thing that is disturbing me you can run away 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.719
 Of course, that's what dv friends are for 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:26.609
 it's julia 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:30.079
 I do not know what's happening at the beginning everything was fine now 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.419
 we do not have dialogue it seems that there is no longer a topic 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:37.719
 that is normal ricardo how many years have been married happens to everyone 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:38.889
 it happened to me 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.889
 only that mine was different did not happen shortly before 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:46.099
 it may even be normal but it should not 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.290
 she complains that I do not tell her anything about my life I want to tell her that 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.159
 if you do not care about anything and you care about it, it's about the things she says 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.709
 To be honest 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.719
 a lope is ricardo 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.430
 if you do not care if you do not get involved in the things he says 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.009
 how will there be dialogue 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:07.009
 I think a little friend 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:12.159
 the lack of communication is one of the most serious problems in marriage 

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:14.530
 and almost always 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.489
 precedes the failure of the relationship 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.250
 to avoid falling into the trap 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.859
 of the lack of communication the first rule is 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.019
 share the feelings 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.019
 exchange opinions show interest 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.189
 and in that way build a relationship based on trust 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.619
 if we see 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:40.899
 the example of Solomon and the urns half reported in the book of songs in 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:45.649
 chapter 2 at the beginning we can check when he tells his wife 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:50.359
 make me hear your beloved voice of mine because pipes are sweet like honey 

00:03:51.529 --> 00:03:54.529
 and that should happen in all relationships 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.010
 communication is a fundamental factor 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.559
 i primordial 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:02.039
 for a happy marriage 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:03.419
 Richard 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.109
 Today in the afternoon I was at the house of Marseille 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.919
 memories that we had agreed to last week did not show work that 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:14.509
 is doing with photography and painting also photographs saddle is now 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:17.019
 doing part of the inner painting 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.509
 poster is very nice 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.039
 ask for the name 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.449
 it's beautiful you should read what prettier technique one of the walls of your 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.449
 house is all decorated 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.599
 and the most interesting thing is that she is selling that technique to the store 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:43.960
 a friend moye cantemus sophisticated 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.800
 and at this moment they have imagination charges 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.340
 then he called me to work with her what do you think 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.729
 Richard 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.050
 you are listening to me we were still clear 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.009
 You could even earn some money by doing another type of manual labor 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.749
 for the store that you think 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:04.219
 general 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:07.159
 sign that ricardo 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:10.159
 all that you said to help in that job 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.949
 it's okay 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:19.009
 you noticed the lack of attention of Ricardo 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:21.900
 in communication with his wife 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.550
 actually he seems not to have understood the biblical advice that says 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.400
 that every man be ready to listen 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.849
 slow to talk 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.849
 and get angry 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:36.830
 that means that he would need to be tuned to the channel 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.800
 in which she was talking 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.199
 to better understand her feelings and also be able to help her 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.819
 that she wanted to ask 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:47.300
 in any dialogue 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.490
 you have to clearly understand what the other has to say 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.189
 to later expose his point of view 

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:57.649
 and if you do not agree, know that not agreeing does not mean fighting 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:01.860
 I think you should not get involved in that now 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.159
 at least one that way if 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:06.960
 that tends to be far away cities 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.539
 dangerous you have to face the traffic every day so that you run that risk 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:15.609
 but love if one gets into the head the fear of the city the creatives all the 

00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:19.069
 time locked inside the house is absurd 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:23.030
 but there may be another way we could buy material amounts a small 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:25.089
 workshop here at home 

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:28.089
 that's a very good idea 

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:31.300
 diouf who easy to understand 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.129
 still without agreeing 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:35.639
 sometimes say some hard word 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:38.969
 and without thinking you can hit your spouse deeply 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.130
 In any way, honesty in communication is fundamental 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.400
 it's useless to hide or hide something 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:52.090
 If you can not converse at that time I spoke later if you can not prove 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.069
 interest 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:56.389
 it is best to say and what that matter 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:57.930
 he dislikes 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.930
 exactly what you think and feel 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.180
 Say what you like and what you do not like 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.090
 Sincerity is usually a key to 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.740
 good communication 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.749
 I the basis of a very healthy relationship 

00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:11.819
 constructive 

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:12.879
 and happy 

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:16.520
 you remember the comment I made about Solomon Tila Shulamit in the 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.759
 chapter 2 of the songs 

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:23.110
 it is impressive that if we continue studying reading and verifying the 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.499
 relationship of the two 

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:27.580
 over there and in chapter 8 we're going to find 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.139
 despite the time that has passed 

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:35.029
 that Solomon repeats the same phrase assumes today in my beloved pipes 

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:37.270
 because they sweet as honey 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.840
 the communication should be constant friends 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.669
 if we want to make our marriage 

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:45.360
 a marriage full of happiness 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.099
 in the next election 

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:49.659
 let's talk about sexuality in marriage
