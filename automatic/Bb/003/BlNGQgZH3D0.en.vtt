00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
that way it doesn't fall off gives you a

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.760 
that way it doesn't fall off gives you a
little<00:00:35.760> bit<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.940> starting<00:00:36.450> point<00:00:36.719> across<00:00:37.440> all

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770

little bit of starting point across all
your<00:00:37.950> seams<00:00:38.190> now<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.030> second<00:00:39.660> step<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.079> where

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
your seams now the second step is where

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.560 
your seams now the second step is where
most<00:00:40.530> people<00:00:40.649> mess<00:00:41.070> up<00:00:41.100> they<00:00:41.790> try<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.329> all

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
out away from our drywall just a little

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.510 
out away from our drywall just a little
bit<00:02:23.970> more<00:02:24.209> in<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.319> top<00:02:25.530> part<00:02:25.770> we<00:02:25.920> want<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.190> push

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
bit more in the top part we want to push

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.550 
bit more in the top part we want to push
the<00:02:26.700> top<00:02:26.880> part<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.240> there<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.660> Bend<00:02:28.080> our<00:02:28.230> trial

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
the top part in there and Bend our trial

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:38.360 
the top part in there and Bend our trial
and<00:02:29.520> run<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:29.940> across<00:02:30.030> there<00:02:37.040> now<00:02:38.040> what<00:02:38.220> we're

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
and run it across there now what we're

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.250 
and run it across there now what we're
doing<00:02:38.610> here<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:39.000> we're<00:02:39.239> taking<00:02:39.390> this<00:02:39.720> seam<00:02:39.989> and

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
doing here is we're taking this seam and

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.170 
doing here is we're taking this seam and
we're<00:02:40.380> blending<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.980> in<00:02:41.130> with<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.910> rest<00:02:42.030> of

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
we're blending it in with the rest of

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.090 
we're blending it in with the rest of
the<00:02:42.270> wall<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:42.780> when<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:42.989> look<00:02:43.230> down<00:02:43.440> there<00:02:43.680> you

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
the wall so when you look down there you

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.790 
the wall so when you look down there you
should<00:02:44.400> notice<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.940> big<00:02:45.150> difference<00:02:45.650> now<00:02:46.650> on

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
should notice a big difference now on

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.320 
should notice a big difference now on
the<00:02:46.890> bottom<00:02:47.280> we're<00:02:47.580> going<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.820> do<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.000> exact

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
the bottom we're going to do the exact

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.850 
the bottom we're going to do the exact
opposite<00:02:48.780> we're<00:02:48.930> going<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.110> push<00:02:49.350> in<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.560> little

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
opposite we're going to push in a little

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.770 
opposite we're going to push in a little
bit<00:02:49.950> harder<00:02:50.190> with<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.430> bottom<00:02:50.760> side<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.330> let

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
bit harder with the bottom side and let

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.120 
bit harder with the bottom side and let
the<00:02:51.810> top<00:02:52.140> flare<00:02:52.560> out<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:55.530> when<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.739> get<00:02:55.890> done

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
the top flare out so when you get done

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.190 
the top flare out so when you get done
you<00:02:56.850> should<00:02:56.880> have<00:02:57.060> just<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.570> little<00:02:57.870> streak

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
you should have just a little streak

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.380 
you should have just a little streak
across<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.590> middle<00:02:59.070> that<00:02:59.790> you'll<00:03:00.030> go<00:03:00.150> through

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
across the middle that you'll go through

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.330 
across the middle that you'll go through
there<00:03:00.540> with<00:03:00.660> your<00:03:00.810> sander<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.470> just<00:03:02.100> sand

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
there with your sander and just sand

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.130 
there with your sander and just sand
that<00:03:02.489> little<00:03:02.760> bit<00:03:02.880> off<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:03.870> way<00:03:03.989> you<00:03:04.050> have

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
that little bit off so that way you have

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.280 
that little bit off so that way you have
a<00:03:04.290> nice<00:03:04.590> clean<00:03:05.459> joint<00:03:05.760> don't<00:03:06.600> be<00:03:06.750> afraid<00:03:07.050> to

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
a nice clean joint don't be afraid to

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.690 
a nice clean joint don't be afraid to
put<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.500> lot<00:03:07.739> of<00:03:07.890> mud<00:03:08.010> on<00:03:08.040> there<00:03:08.310> because<00:03:08.459> you're

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
put a lot of mud on there because you're

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.580 
put a lot of mud on there because you're
going<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.880> be<00:03:08.970> taking<00:03:09.300> most<00:03:09.540> of<00:03:09.690> it<00:03:09.840> all<00:03:09.989> it's

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
going to be taking most of it all it's

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.870 
going to be taking most of it all it's
always<00:03:10.769> better<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.160> have<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.400> little<00:03:11.519> bit<00:03:11.700> too

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
always better to have a little bit too

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.550 
always better to have a little bit too
much<00:03:12.030> mud<00:03:12.300> on<00:03:12.480> there<00:03:12.750> than<00:03:13.320> not<00:03:13.350> enough

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
much mud on there than not enough

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.410 
much mud on there than not enough
because<00:03:14.130> those<00:03:14.489> seams<00:03:14.850> that<00:03:15.090> don't<00:03:15.269> have

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
because those seams that don't have

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.000 
because those seams that don't have
enough<00:03:15.690> you're<00:03:16.350> going<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.530> spend<00:03:16.739> a<00:03:16.799> lot<00:03:16.950> more

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
enough you're going to spend a lot more

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.160 
enough you're going to spend a lot more
time<00:03:17.400> on<00:03:17.430> your<00:03:18.090> muds<00:03:18.360> going<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:18.660> start<00:03:18.870> drying
