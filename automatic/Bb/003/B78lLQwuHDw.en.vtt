00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.810 
rocks and you can very easily just pick
up<00:01:36.570> all<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.990> kills<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.860> super

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
up all the kills like this is a super

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.859 
up all the kills like this is a super
easy<00:01:38.850> spawn<00:01:39.450> trap<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.740> crisis<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.570> unfair<00:01:42.570> how

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
easy spawn trap the crisis is unfair how

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.340 
easy spawn trap the crisis is unfair how
easy<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.290> spawn<00:01:43.560> trap<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:43.979> on<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:45.680> alrighty

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
easy the spawn trap is on it alrighty

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.870 
easy the spawn trap is on it alrighty
you<00:01:49.350> see<00:01:49.530> their<00:01:49.680> spawning<00:01:49.980> there's<00:01:50.700> flying

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
you see their spawning there's flying

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.580 
you see their spawning there's flying
predominantly<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.660> right<00:01:51.870> side<00:01:52.140> here<00:01:52.440> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
predominantly to the right side here and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.070 
predominantly to the right side here and
that's<00:01:53.430> because<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.790> all<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.480> blue<00:01:54.660> guys<00:01:54.870> on

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
that's because of all the blue guys on

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.780 
that's because of all the blue guys on
the<00:01:55.170> left<00:01:55.350> side<00:01:55.500> are<00:01:55.650> way<00:01:55.830> too<00:01:55.890> close<00:01:56.370> and<00:01:56.640> up

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
the left side are way too close and up

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.790 
the left side are way too close and up
so<00:01:57.150> it's<00:01:57.420> forcing<00:01:57.840> their<00:01:58.020> spawn<00:01:58.290> as<00:01:58.500> far<00:01:58.680> as

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
so it's forcing their spawn as far as

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.830 
so it's forcing their spawn as far as
ways<00:01:58.980> humanly<00:01:59.340> possible<00:01:59.820> and<00:01:59.970> they're<00:02:00.660> going

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
ways humanly possible and they're going

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.310 
ways humanly possible and they're going
in<00:02:01.050> to<00:02:01.140> be<00:02:02.240> my<00:02:03.240> only<00:02:03.420> concern<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.170> get

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
in to be my only concern is to get

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.260 
in to be my only concern is to get
toward<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> gunship<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.370> there<00:02:05.610> there's<00:02:05.910> my

never go wrong the famas red dot but
pretty<00:02:55.440> much<00:02:55.500> on<00:02:56.190> crisis<00:02:56.670> especially<00:02:56.940> if<00:02:57.300> you

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
pretty much on crisis especially if you

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.420 
pretty much on crisis especially if you
get<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.570> way<00:02:57.780> this<00:02:58.620> is<00:02:58.800> actually<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.130> harder

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
get this way this is actually the harder

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.460 
get this way this is actually the harder
gunship<00:02:59.820> area<00:03:00.150> because<00:03:00.750> there's<00:03:01.019> because

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
gunship area because there's because

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.949 
gunship area because there's because
they<00:03:01.709> have<00:03:01.800> a<00:03:01.860> certain<00:03:02.250> amount<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.489> spawns<00:03:02.959> but

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
they have a certain amount of spawns but

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.449 
they have a certain amount of spawns but
you<00:03:04.110> pretty<00:03:04.260> much<00:03:04.380> kind<00:03:04.769> of<00:03:04.890> get<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.100> gist<00:03:05.340> of

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
you pretty much kind of get the gist of

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.300 
you pretty much kind of get the gist of
what<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.700> spawns<00:03:05.970> works<00:03:06.269> like<00:03:07.010> you<00:03:08.010> had<00:03:08.160> the

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
what the spawns works like you had the

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.140 
what the spawns works like you had the
benefit<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:09.530> of<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:11.340> mountains<00:03:11.700> blocking<00:03:12.090> you

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
benefit of of the mountains blocking you

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.250 
benefit of of the mountains blocking you
from<00:03:12.180> strollers<00:03:12.690> right<00:03:12.870> away<00:03:13.080> with<00:03:13.230> the

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
from strollers right away with the

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.840 
from strollers right away with the
gunship<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:13.980> we're<00:03:14.100> going<00:03:14.190> to<00:03:14.340> speed<00:03:14.519> this<00:03:14.550> up

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
gunship so we're going to speed this up

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.970 
gunship so we're going to speed this up
to<00:03:15.570> come<00:03:15.810> through<00:03:16.050> and<00:03:16.140> just<00:03:16.200> destroy<00:03:16.739> them

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
to come through and just destroy them

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.229 
to come through and just destroy them
there's<00:03:17.250> only<00:03:17.370> two<00:03:17.549> people<00:03:17.820> left<00:03:17.850> in<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.209> game

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
there's only two people left in the game

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.640 
there's only two people left in the game
at<00:03:18.540> this<00:03:18.630> point<00:03:18.720> so<00:03:19.140> I'm<00:03:19.200> just<00:03:19.290> cool<00:03:19.440> Sarah

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
at this point so I'm just cool Sarah

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.920 
at this point so I'm just cool Sarah
killed<00:03:20.010> them<00:03:20.160> over<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.459> over<00:03:20.580> again<00:03:20.840> but<00:03:21.840> they

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
killed them over and over again but they

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.660 
killed them over and over again but they

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.860 
spawned to the right the spynet burning
building<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.030> they<00:03:24.150> spawn<00:03:24.420> up<00:03:24.600> there<00:03:24.750> near

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
building and they spawn up there near

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.810 
building and they spawn up there near
the<00:03:24.930> silo<00:03:25.470> that's<00:03:25.769> all<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.100> got<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.370> know<00:03:26.400> and
