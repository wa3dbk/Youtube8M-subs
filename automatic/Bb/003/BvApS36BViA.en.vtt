out that luffy was turning black because
the<00:00:16.500> vulcanization<00:00:17.130> if<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.460> don't<00:00:17.640> know<00:00:17.760> that

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
the vulcanization if you don't know that

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.570 
the vulcanization if you don't know that
means<00:00:18.240> that's<00:00:18.539> like<00:00:18.779> do<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:19.800> like<00:00:19.830> like<00:00:20.550> a

hockey<00:00:25.949> puck<00:00:26.310> it's<00:00:26.789> like<00:00:27.029> vulcanized<00:00:27.630> rubber

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
hockey puck it's like vulcanized rubber

i'm not mistaken i'm pretty sure i'm
like<00:00:41.879> 99%<00:00:42.660> sure<00:00:42.690> that's<00:00:42.989> vulcanized<00:00:43.500> rubber

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
like 99% sure that's vulcanized rubber

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.229 
like 99% sure that's vulcanized rubber
anyway<00:00:45.289> that<00:00:46.289> was<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> theory<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.940> recent

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
anyway that was a theory in this recent

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.029 
anyway that was a theory in this recent
episode<00:00:50.329> it<00:00:51.329> was<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:52.140> theory<00:00:52.379> was<00:00:52.739> kind<00:00:52.949> of

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
episode it was just a theory was kind of

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.670 
episode it was just a theory was kind of
sketchy<00:00:53.340> at<00:00:53.730> first<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.570> know<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:55.140> begin<00:00:55.289> with

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
sketchy at first you know to begin with

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.770 
sketchy at first you know to begin with
it<00:00:55.920> made<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.489> lot<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.699> sense<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.210> was<00:00:57.420> highly

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
it made a lot of sense it was highly

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.160 
it made a lot of sense it was highly
possible<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.410> was<00:00:58.500> kind<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.770> sketchy

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
possible it was kind of sketchy

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.299 
possible it was kind of sketchy
especially<00:01:01.170> once<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.469> got<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> burkle

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
especially once we got to the burkle

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.399 
especially once we got to the burkle
thinkers<00:01:02.730> Burgo<00:01:03.210> seemed<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.719> do<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.930> exact

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
thinkers Burgo seemed to do the exact

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.810 
thinkers Burgo seemed to do the exact
same<00:01:04.500> thing<00:01:05.240> now<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.780> episode<00:01:07.820> Luffy

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
same thing now in this episode Luffy

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.480 
same thing now in this episode Luffy
says<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:10.080> he<00:01:10.320> was<00:01:10.500> using<00:01:10.770> something<00:01:11.220> he

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
says that he was using something he

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.960 
says that he was using something he
called<00:01:11.820> hoarding<00:01:12.479> them<00:01:12.720> which<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.950> seems<00:01:14.820> to

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
called hoarding them which it seems to

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.740 
called hoarding them which it seems to
be<00:01:15.150> another<00:01:15.570> form<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.250> armaments<00:01:17.250> hockey<00:01:17.750> now

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
be another form of armaments hockey now

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.100 
be another form of armaments hockey now
this<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.920> dissident<00:01:20.700> discussion<00:01:21.270> which<00:01:21.960> I

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
this is the dissident discussion which I

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.870 
this is the dissident discussion which I
think<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.530> balkanization<00:01:23.009> pretty<00:01:23.670> much

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
think that balkanization pretty much

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.780 
think that balkanization pretty much
stamped<00:01:24.479> out<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:25.159> think<00:01:26.159> they're<00:01:26.310> breaking<00:01:26.700> up

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
stamped out I think they're breaking up

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.920 
stamped out I think they're breaking up
hiking<00:01:27.060> into<00:01:27.420> all<00:01:27.540> these<00:01:27.689> different

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
hiking into all these different

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.179 
hiking into all these different
subcategories<00:01:28.970> so<00:01:30.439> like<00:01:31.439> when<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:31.710> first<00:01:31.950> see

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
subcategories so like when we first see

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.399 
subcategories so like when we first see
how<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.820> be<00:01:33.030> seeing<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.570> ok<00:01:34.290> they

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
how can we be seeing that ok they

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.929 
how can we be seeing that ok they
consist<00:01:34.740> was<00:01:34.860> around<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.369> predictive

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
consist was around on the predictive

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.999 
consist was around on the predictive
abilities<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.860> they<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.220> dumb<00:01:39.590> put<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.710> arm

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
abilities and they can dumb put this arm

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.969 
abilities and they can dumb put this arm
around<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.610> basically<00:01:41.729> take<00:01:42.329> less<00:01:42.570> damage<00:01:42.979> or

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
around and basically take less damage or

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.639 
around and basically take less damage or
inflict<00:01:44.880> damage<00:01:45.090> especially<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:46.079> low<00:01:46.320> gears

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
inflict damage especially on low gears

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.969 
inflict damage especially on low gears
that<00:01:47.460> was<00:01:47.670> our<00:01:47.880> initial<00:01:48.180> thing<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:49.079> think

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
that was our initial thing I think

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.789 
that was our initial thing I think
they're<00:01:50.100> gonna<00:01:50.220> take<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.640> step<00:01:50.670> further<00:01:51.240> and

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
they're gonna take it a step further and

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.580 
they're gonna take it a step further and
I<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:53.040> how<00:01:53.250> one<00:01:53.549> piece<00:01:53.759> is<00:01:53.939> doing<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.390> where

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
I like how one piece is doing it where

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.840 
I like how one piece is doing it where
there's<00:01:55.590> only<00:01:55.979> three<00:01:57.920> divisions<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.189> two<00:01:59.640> is

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
there's only three divisions and two is

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.450 
there's only three divisions and two is
the<00:02:00.000> main<00:02:00.210> ones<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:01.350> we<00:02:01.619> don't<00:02:01.799> have<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.310> you

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
the main ones so we don't have to you

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.130 
the main ones so we don't have to you
know<00:02:02.579> have<00:02:02.880> all<00:02:03.149> these<00:02:03.329> different<00:02:03.390> things<00:02:03.689> out

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
know have all these different things out

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.230 
know have all these different things out
there<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.380> we<00:02:04.590> can't<00:02:04.829> keep<00:02:05.009> up<00:02:05.219> with<00:02:05.250> we<00:02:06.090> can

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
there that we can't keep up with we can

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.300 
there that we can't keep up with we can
be<00:02:06.420> nose<00:02:06.659> won't<00:02:07.020> be<00:02:07.140> one<00:02:07.290> or<00:02:07.439> two<00:02:07.590> days<00:02:07.829> and

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
be nose won't be one or two days and

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.370 
be nose won't be one or two days and
it's<00:02:08.970> going<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.270> be<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> branch<00:02:09.750> off<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.050> them

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
it's going to be a branch off of them

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.140 
it's going to be a branch off of them
now<00:02:12.380> we<00:02:12.590> was<00:02:12.950> thinking<00:02:13.340> that<00:02:13.550> a<00:02:13.790> lot<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.060> people

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
now we was thinking that a lot of people

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.200 
now we was thinking that a lot of people
thought<00:02:14.480> that<00:02:15.220> what's<00:02:16.220> all<00:02:16.430> about<00:02:16.520> that<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.970> lot

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
thought that what's all about that a lot

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.230 
thought that what's all about that a lot
of<00:02:17.270> people<00:02:17.390> don't<00:02:17.780> like<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:18.080> hardening

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
of people don't like that hardening

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.300 
of people don't like that hardening
ability<00:02:20.240> but<00:02:20.810> before<00:02:21.230> we<00:02:21.380> even<00:02:21.500> know<00:02:21.740> you<00:02:22.190> know

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
ability but before we even know you know

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.130 
ability but before we even know you know
that's<00:02:22.550> what<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:22.790> was<00:02:22.940> was<00:02:23.690> specific<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.680> luffy

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
that's what it was was specific to luffy

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.390 
that's what it was was specific to luffy
now<00:02:28.000> I'm<00:02:29.000> starting<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.450> think<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:30.370> really<00:02:31.370> I

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
now I'm starting to think I really I

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.670 
now I'm starting to think I really I
didn't<00:02:31.700> think<00:02:31.820> this<00:02:31.910> at<00:02:32.180> ever<00:02:32.420> but<00:02:32.720> uh<00:02:32.750> I<00:02:33.260> think

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
didn't think this at ever but uh I think

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.520 
didn't think this at ever but uh I think
that<00:02:34.420> it's<00:02:35.420> not<00:02:35.600> really<00:02:35.900> too<00:02:35.990> specific<00:02:36.080> to

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
that it's not really too specific to

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.220 
that it's not really too specific to
anybody<00:02:37.010> I<00:02:37.280> think<00:02:37.670> anybody<00:02:38.120> can<00:02:38.300> use<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.720> but

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
anybody I think anybody can use it but

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.140 
anybody I think anybody can use it but
if<00:02:39.740> you<00:02:40.250> were<00:02:40.430> if<00:02:40.670> we<00:02:41.660> should<00:02:41.900> call<00:02:42.050> him<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.290> um

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
if you were if we should call him and um

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.800 
if you were if we should call him and um
what<00:02:44.150> was<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.540> uh<00:02:45.190> Marie<00:02:46.190> for<00:02:46.490> all<00:02:46.700> right<00:02:47.090> he'll

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
what was it uh Marie for all right he'll

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.960 
what was it uh Marie for all right he'll
netball<00:02:48.320> and<00:02:48.350> Kobe<00:02:48.710> was<00:02:48.950> talking<00:02:49.400> and<00:02:49.610> they

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
netball and Kobe was talking and they

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.760 
netball and Kobe was talking and they
said<00:02:50.300> that<00:02:51.610> hockey<00:02:52.610> is<00:02:52.640> with<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.410> upper<00:02:54.410> level

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
said that hockey is with the upper level

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.720 
said that hockey is with the upper level
Marines<00:02:55.100> using<00:02:55.820> right<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:56.780> basically<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:58.190> kind

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
Marines using right so basically it kind

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.810 
Marines using right so basically it kind
of<00:02:58.910> is<00:02:59.150> exclusive<00:02:59.990> because<00:03:00.530> only<00:03:01.130> the<00:03:01.550> top

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
of is exclusive because only the top

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.770 
of is exclusive because only the top
notch<00:03:02.270> people<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:02.750> think<00:03:02.810> can<00:03:03.200> use<00:03:03.410> it<00:03:03.970> or<00:03:04.970> maybe

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
notch people I think can use it or maybe

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.320 
notch people I think can use it or maybe
it<00:03:06.650> looks<00:03:06.800> like<00:03:07.010> hardening<00:03:07.670> is<00:03:07.910> like<00:03:08.150> the

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
it looks like hardening is like the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.970 
it looks like hardening is like the
hardened<00:03:09.020> is<00:03:09.200> like<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:10.990> it<00:03:11.990> looks<00:03:12.650> like<00:03:12.830> it's

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
hardened is like the it looks like it's

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.560 
hardened is like the it looks like it's
more<00:03:13.130> advanced<00:03:13.670> than<00:03:13.730> me<00:03:13.940> just<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.330> know<00:03:14.390> that

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
more advanced than me just you know that

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.210 
more advanced than me just you know that
the<00:03:14.990> average<00:03:15.020> high<00:03:15.560> can<00:03:15.830> be<00:03:15.950> seen<00:03:16.190> just

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
the average high can be seen just

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.430 
the average high can be seen just
somebody<00:03:16.970> just<00:03:17.030> you<00:03:17.240> know<00:03:17.390> being<00:03:17.930> able<00:03:18.200> just

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
somebody just you know being able just

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.050 
somebody just you know being able just
to<00:03:18.530> land<00:03:18.770> a<00:03:18.950> punch<00:03:19.160> you<00:03:19.370> look<00:03:19.550> like<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:19.820> punch

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
to land a punch you look like the punch

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.030 
to land a punch you look like the punch
is<00:03:20.240> just<00:03:20.450> as<00:03:20.570> strong<00:03:20.690> as<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.320> regular<00:03:21.500> punch

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
is just as strong as the regular punch

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.240 
is just as strong as the regular punch
they<00:03:22.370> just<00:03:22.580> a<00:03:22.760> bit<00:03:22.910> of<00:03:23.000> landing<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.600> uh<00:03:24.250> and

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
they just a bit of landing and uh and

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.700 
they just a bit of landing and uh and
negate<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.330> effect<00:03:26.660> of<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.870> deficit<00:03:27.350> problem

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
negate the effect of the deficit problem

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.380 
negate the effect of the deficit problem
that's<00:03:28.190> all<00:03:28.430> it<00:03:28.460> looked<00:03:28.820> like<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.180> wasn't

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
that's all it looked like it wasn't

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.690 
that's all it looked like it wasn't
really<00:03:29.600> add<00:03:29.840> any<00:03:30.170> kind<00:03:30.440> of<00:03:30.500> power<00:03:30.740> anything<00:03:31.370> to

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
really add any kind of power anything to

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.340 
really add any kind of power anything to
it<00:03:31.850> you<00:03:32.300> know<00:03:32.450> much<00:03:32.750> you<00:03:32.960> know<00:03:33.080> much<00:03:33.320> more

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
it you know much you know much more

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.670 
it you know much you know much more
power<00:03:33.830> to<00:03:34.130> it<00:03:34.160> like<00:03:35.000> when<00:03:35.180> we<00:03:35.300> see<00:03:35.510> me<00:03:35.570> um<00:03:35.990> the

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
power to it like when we see me um the

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.160 
power to it like when we see me um the
Amazons<00:03:37.280> using<00:03:37.820> it<00:03:37.970> really<00:03:38.630> damn<00:03:38.810> you<00:03:39.020> know

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
Amazons using it really damn you know

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.820 
Amazons using it really damn you know
high<00:03:39.500> lipid<00:03:39.950> so<00:03:40.370> much<00:03:40.660> so<00:03:41.660> I<00:03:42.260> think<00:03:42.740> this

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
high lipid so much so I think this

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.620 
high lipid so much so I think this
hardening<00:03:43.340> probably<00:03:43.730> is<00:03:43.820> gonna<00:03:44.030> be<00:03:44.180> you<00:03:44.420> know

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
hardening probably is gonna be you know

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.950 
hardening probably is gonna be you know
is<00:03:44.870> probably<00:03:45.410> like<00:03:45.620> a<00:03:45.650> higher<00:03:46.070> form<00:03:46.460> or<00:03:46.970> a<00:03:47.300> much

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
is probably like a higher form or a much

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.870 
is probably like a higher form or a much
more<00:03:48.260> stronger<00:03:49.100> form<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:50.780> know<00:03:51.050> uh<00:03:51.880> probably

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
more stronger form you know uh probably

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.790 
more stronger form you know uh probably
for<00:03:53.120> somebody<00:03:53.450> that's<00:03:53.600> Doug<00:03:53.900> that's<00:03:54.260> doing<00:03:54.620> uh

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
for somebody that's Doug that's doing uh

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.580 
for somebody that's Doug that's doing uh
like<00:03:55.250> combat<00:03:56.260> somebody's<00:03:57.260> you<00:03:57.470> know

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
like combat somebody's you know

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.530 
like combat somebody's you know
physically<00:03:58.100> come<00:03:58.400> you<00:03:58.640> know<00:03:58.790> compaq<00:03:59.300> the

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
physically come you know compaq the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.300 
physically come you know compaq the
opponent<00:04:00.170> is<00:04:00.320> going<00:04:00.620> to<00:04:00.740> you<00:04:00.860> know<00:04:00.980> really

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
opponent is going to you know really

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.040 
opponent is going to you know really
hide<00:04:01.670> their<00:04:01.970> their<00:04:02.690> battle<00:04:03.230> power<00:04:03.410> but<00:04:04.010> anyway

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
hide their their battle power but anyway

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.650 
hide their their battle power but anyway
for<00:04:06.050> observation<00:04:06.980> we<00:04:07.130> got<00:04:07.370> lifted<00:04:08.000> up<00:04:08.240> where

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
for observation we got lifted up where

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.650 
for observation we got lifted up where
you<00:04:08.690> can<00:04:08.810> predict<00:04:09.260> your<00:04:09.440> opponent's<00:04:09.950> attacks

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
you can predict your opponent's attacks

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.210 
you can predict your opponent's attacks
you<00:04:11.660> can<00:04:11.870> sense<00:04:12.260> where<00:04:12.620> there<00:04:12.830> you<00:04:12.950> know<00:04:13.070> these

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
you can sense where there you know these

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.940 
you can sense where there you know these
people<00:04:13.550> are<00:04:13.700> on<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:14.840> you<00:04:15.200> look<00:04:15.530> like<00:04:15.710> you<00:04:15.830> can

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
people are on and you look like you can

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.539 
people are on and you look like you can
sense<00:04:16.190> power<00:04:16.460> levels<00:04:17.049> and<00:04:18.049> I<00:04:18.890> think<00:04:19.310> maybe

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
sense power levels and I think maybe

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.490 
sense power levels and I think maybe
they're<00:04:19.790> branching<00:04:20.180> off<00:04:20.450> where<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:20.750> can<00:04:21.109> hide

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
they're branching off where you can hide

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.150 
they're branching off where you can hide
your<00:04:21.859> power<00:04:22.130> love<00:04:22.400> every<00:04:22.820> are

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
your power love every are

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.760 
your power love every are
DBZ<00:04:24.000> people<00:04:24.570> can<00:04:24.690> hide<00:04:24.870> their<00:04:25.140> power<00:04:25.380> levels

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
DBZ people can hide their power levels

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.130 
DBZ people can hide their power levels
I'd<00:04:25.860> probably<00:04:26.040> be<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.730> next<00:04:27.000> one<00:04:27.180> and<00:04:27.390> also

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
I'd probably be the next one and also

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.000 
I'd probably be the next one and also
maybe<00:04:28.680> hide<00:04:29.370> your<00:04:29.910> existence<00:04:30.570> meaning<00:04:31.050> let's

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
maybe hide your existence meaning let's

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.350 
maybe hide your existence meaning let's
say<00:04:32.220> you're<00:04:32.400> hiding<00:04:32.790> you<00:04:32.970> don't<00:04:33.150> want

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
say you're hiding you don't want

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.880 
say you're hiding you don't want
somebody<00:04:33.630> to<00:04:33.690> find<00:04:33.930> you<00:04:34.110> somebody<00:04:34.320> has<00:04:34.590> hockey

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
somebody to find you somebody has hockey

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.010 
somebody to find you somebody has hockey
that<00:04:35.310> you<00:04:35.460> didn't<00:04:35.820> you<00:04:36.210> find<00:04:36.450> you<00:04:36.630> like<00:04:36.780> that

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
that you didn't you find you like that

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.650 
that you didn't you find you like that
maybe<00:04:37.680> if<00:04:37.980> you<00:04:38.130> like<00:04:38.580> you<00:04:38.880> can<00:04:39.000> hide<00:04:39.210> yourself

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
maybe if you like you can hide yourself

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.080 
maybe if you like you can hide yourself
enough<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.200> they<00:04:40.620> went<00:04:40.860> baby<00:04:41.070> sense<00:04:41.490> that<00:04:41.790> you

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
enough and they went baby sense that you

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.210 
enough and they went baby sense that you
were<00:04:42.210> there<00:04:42.420> that<00:04:43.080> seems<00:04:43.350> like<00:04:43.410> a<00:04:43.500> logical

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
were there that seems like a logical

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.950 
were there that seems like a logical
thing<00:04:44.730> you<00:04:44.940> know<00:04:45.060> for<00:04:45.090> them<00:04:45.390> to<00:04:45.480> branch<00:04:45.720> off

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
thing you know for them to branch off

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.250 
thing you know for them to branch off
into<00:04:46.820> armaments<00:04:47.820> my<00:04:48.390> next<00:04:48.720> thing<00:04:48.930> about

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
into armaments my next thing about

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.910 
into armaments my next thing about
armaments<00:04:50.070> hockey<00:04:50.520> would<00:04:50.700> be<00:04:51.020> maybe<00:04:52.020> just

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
armaments hockey would be maybe just

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.530 
armaments hockey would be maybe just
maybe<00:04:54.320> they<00:04:55.320> can<00:04:55.590> this<00:04:56.220> may<00:04:56.490> be<00:04:56.520> some<00:04:56.910> maybe<00:04:57.450> a

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
maybe they can this may be some maybe a

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.250 
maybe they can this may be some maybe a
few<00:04:57.750> people<00:04:57.810> out<00:04:58.200> there<00:04:58.470> that<00:04:59.100> are<00:04:59.340> like

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
few people out there that are like

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.440 
few people out there that are like
armaments<00:05:01.260> specialist<00:05:02.220> like<00:05:02.940> that's<00:05:03.210> what

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
armaments specialist like that's what

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.240 
armaments specialist like that's what
they<00:05:03.600> do<00:05:03.660> they<00:05:04.380> don't<00:05:04.530> really<00:05:04.830> do<00:05:04.980> anything

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
they do they don't really do anything

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.480 
they do they don't really do anything
else<00:05:05.610> but<00:05:05.910> use<00:05:06.240> hockey<00:05:06.840> and<00:05:07.130> maybe<00:05:08.130> they<00:05:08.310> could

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
else but use hockey and maybe they could

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.250 
else but use hockey and maybe they could
use<00:05:08.700> like<00:05:08.730> make<00:05:09.240> weapons<00:05:09.750> like<00:05:09.960> let's<00:05:10.170> say

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
use like make weapons like let's say

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.920 
use like make weapons like let's say
there's<00:05:10.590> a<00:05:10.650> swordsman<00:05:11.250> out<00:05:11.430> there<00:05:11.750> and<00:05:12.750> he

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
there's a swordsman out there and he

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.110 
there's a swordsman out there and he
doesn't<00:05:13.200> even<00:05:13.260> carry<00:05:13.650> his<00:05:13.920> sword<00:05:14.220> and<00:05:14.940> they

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
doesn't even carry his sword and they

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.910 
doesn't even carry his sword and they
said<00:05:15.360> well<00:05:15.540> how<00:05:15.930> can<00:05:15.990> you<00:05:16.200> be<00:05:16.350> in<00:05:16.440> short<00:05:16.680> means

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
said well how can you be in short means

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.770 
said well how can you be in short means
i<00:05:17.100> will<00:05:17.310> here's<00:05:17.460> my<00:05:17.670> sword<00:05:17.910> is<00:05:18.090> made<00:05:18.270> of<00:05:18.450> pure

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
i will here's my sword is made of pure

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.590 
i will here's my sword is made of pure
royal<00:05:19.140> hockey<00:05:19.500> I<00:05:19.970> think<00:05:20.970> this<00:05:21.120> might<00:05:21.330> be<00:05:21.360> the

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
royal hockey I think this might be the

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.190 
royal hockey I think this might be the
next<00:05:21.840> step<00:05:22.080> or<00:05:23.510> another<00:05:24.510> good<00:05:24.750> thing<00:05:24.780> would<00:05:25.080> be

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
next step or another good thing would be

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.560 
next step or another good thing would be
like<00:05:25.230> for<00:05:25.620> like<00:05:25.910> we're<00:05:26.910> gonna<00:05:27.090> bring<00:05:27.240> up<00:05:27.420> who

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
like for like we're gonna bring up who

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.560 
like for like we're gonna bring up who
stopped<00:05:27.900> he<00:05:28.620> uses<00:05:29.070> a<00:05:29.100> long-range<00:05:30.060> weaponry

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
stopped he uses a long-range weaponry

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.920 
stopped he uses a long-range weaponry
he's<00:05:31.560> gonna<00:05:31.770> have<00:05:32.250> to<00:05:32.280> I<00:05:32.760> think<00:05:33.000> like<00:05:33.240> I<00:05:33.540> don't

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
he's gonna have to I think like I don't

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.110 
he's gonna have to I think like I don't
know<00:05:34.020> about<00:05:34.080> horn<00:05:34.500> but<00:05:34.950> I<00:05:35.130> think<00:05:35.370> he<00:05:35.490> probably

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
know about horn but I think he probably

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.240 
know about horn but I think he probably
he's<00:05:36.480> probably<00:05:36.510> gonna<00:05:36.960> have<00:05:37.230> to<00:05:37.440> bid<00:05:37.650> you<00:05:37.680> said

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
he's probably gonna have to bid you said

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.560 
he's probably gonna have to bid you said
you<00:05:38.370> know<00:05:38.550> because<00:05:38.790> he's<00:05:38.940> like<00:05:39.090> me<00:05:39.330> to<00:05:39.390> hit

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
you know because he's like me to hit

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.200 
you know because he's like me to hit
anybody<00:05:39.870> with<00:05:40.169> it<00:05:40.460> you<00:05:41.460> know<00:05:41.490> so<00:05:41.910> he's<00:05:42.060> not

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
anybody with it you know so he's not

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.690 
anybody with it you know so he's not
going<00:05:42.270> to<00:05:42.600> hit<00:05:42.750> anybody<00:05:43.230> with<00:05:43.700> potato

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
going to hit anybody with potato

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.350 
going to hit anybody with potato
projectiles<00:05:45.330> if<00:05:45.540> he<00:05:45.630> doesn't<00:05:45.960> have<00:05:46.440> the

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
projectiles if he doesn't have the

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.470 
projectiles if he doesn't have the
hockey<00:05:48.470> next<00:05:49.470> thing<00:05:49.680> is<00:05:49.880> will<00:05:50.880> he<00:05:50.970> be<00:05:51.090> able<00:05:51.120> to

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
hockey next thing is will he be able to

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.800 
hockey next thing is will he be able to
let's<00:05:51.930> say<00:05:52.080> runs<00:05:52.470> out<00:05:52.710> of<00:05:52.880> ammunition<00:05:53.880> could

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
let's say runs out of ammunition could

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.150 
let's say runs out of ammunition could
he<00:05:54.930> even<00:05:55.260> be<00:05:55.590> able<00:05:55.950> to<00:05:56.340> just<00:05:56.550> make<00:05:56.880> you<00:05:57.120> don't

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
he even be able to just make you don't

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.710 
he even be able to just make you don't
projectiles<00:05:59.160> out<00:05:59.400> of<00:05:59.520> raw<00:05:59.760> hockey<00:06:00.240> that's<00:06:00.540> the

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
projectiles out of raw hockey that's the

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.960 
projectiles out of raw hockey that's the
next<00:06:00.930> thing<00:06:01.080> I<00:06:01.320> think<00:06:01.650> so<00:06:02.160> anyway<00:06:02.550> basically

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
next thing I think so anyway basically

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.420 
next thing I think so anyway basically
I'm<00:06:03.330> just<00:06:03.360> saying<00:06:03.890> just<00:06:04.890> put<00:06:05.070> this<00:06:05.190> out<00:06:05.400> there

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
I'm just saying just put this out there

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.650 
I'm just saying just put this out there
to<00:06:05.820> say<00:06:06.030> I<00:06:07.580> hockey's<00:06:08.580> gonna<00:06:08.820> break<00:06:09.120> up<00:06:09.300> to<00:06:09.510> all

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
to say I hockey's gonna break up to all

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.530 
to say I hockey's gonna break up to all
these<00:06:09.780> different<00:06:09.960> subcategories<00:06:11.180> what<00:06:12.180> do

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
these different subcategories what do

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.960 
these different subcategories what do
you<00:06:12.600> think<00:06:12.780> it's<00:06:13.410> going<00:06:14.100> to<00:06:14.160> be<00:06:14.220> the<00:06:14.370> next<00:06:14.580> ones
