00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.770
 three words are enough to tell the interpreter revisit 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.690
 speed and availability of this team 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.219
 but it is not my inter this is the idea 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.610
 I want you 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.089
 but to always be so 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.800
 Inter has always been based on these characteristics 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.449
 later if you get talent for this rose 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.769
 surely when I can get everyone together it's a team 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.960
 no the one who won everything a little more detailed in 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.100
 instead the presentation of the Cesena of the team started very well 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.820
 all the teams that laugh from a good series have always turned out 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.430
 what stimulates important 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.760
 can't stay 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.580
 black in the seat but if greater for the meteocesena motoperego player 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.550
 experts 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.479
 they are not even ex interisti who are used to cesena then 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.400
 feet if a team 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.920
 d-link and also a desire to play have given me back that talented players 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.350
 front with 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.149
 alternative sources do not even two players per role later on players 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.870
 let's say he's doing very well this year 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.280
 so yama team that surely won't be very careful plants in the way of 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.400
 change that garden player different manners 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.700
 changing a player or changing the same players as a system 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.310
 they can find solutions all the last defeats I don't see you 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.670
 really very pretty 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.970
 played very well and I came out to make a very important solid result 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.560
 also in the last games 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.250
 and whoever says a comment on the points lost by the milan does not respond 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.469
 but here we are also because the virtual ranking in which 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:41.770
 we talked about it before and it still didn't change anything because it was done 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.289
 first game to be recovered than tomorrow's so stay there to do i 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.380
 accounts now is a mistake so we don't think about girls' feet they don't think 

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:53.229
 think about playing by hand go ahead with game step because that's what there is 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.260
 will bring 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.230
 has the possibility of fighting in the end 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.140
 first Cesena and then Udine difficult races and with different approaches 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.740
 I sincerely like this team do not take 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.790
 matches for importance 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.589
 if he would not have won for so many years 

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:12.570
 does not take the team take an acquired mindset 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.279
 air with the stimulus d not only 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:17.560
 pharbenia work e 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.360
 and go to compete but also the pleasure of the game 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.619
 gaspare turns 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:26.929
 therefore in heat which one tries to keep always difficult to gardens 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:29.970
 taricone teams very practically attentive 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.040
 they know the mechanisms the players know 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.910
 health also because it is the capital of the study of the study 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.179
 then football 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:40.520
 I'm not always trying to block you 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.879
 and they can do it 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.659
 any team so i guess it's never easy 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.590
 and that because here to print the players that I know well this reality the accounts 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:54.529
 at the end these inter do believe in the scudetto 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:03:00.289
 it is impossible for a team like inter not to think of an important conquest 

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:02.229
 regardless of difficulty 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:04.199
 so I believe that the inter e 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:08.399
 rna and human DNA that we have established now high school 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:09.619
 to do something 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:11.229
 It is always like this 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:12.650
 said this 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.549
 . and we have to think about a game 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:16.659
 after another 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.469
 because there is no other way 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:23.119
 and is that all these right way the way we are facing the 

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:25.740
 most important match for us and tomorrow with the Cesena 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.789
 because the one that will take us to the police to fight again 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:29.600
 then 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.529
 this you that 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:32.470
 to do well 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.340
 and I believe that team understood this always goes capitol has always done 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.529
 we still have to 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:38.699
 to move on 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:40.279
 in this respect in this sense
