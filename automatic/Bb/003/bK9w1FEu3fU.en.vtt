00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 
there were problems with it but I didn't

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.320 
there were problems with it but I didn't

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
found myself on the edge of my seat not

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.440 
found myself on the edge of my seat not
quite<00:02:13.310> sure<00:02:13.340> what<00:02:13.610> was<00:02:13.730> gonna<00:02:13.790> happen<00:02:13.910> next<00:02:14.180> a

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
quite sure what was gonna happen next a

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.420 
quite sure what was gonna happen next a
couple<00:02:14.690> times<00:02:14.780> there<00:02:15.380> was<00:02:15.500> one<00:02:15.710> twist<00:02:16.130> that

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
couple times there was one twist that

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.120 
couple times there was one twist that
did<00:02:16.760> make<00:02:16.940> up<00:02:17.180> for<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:17.630> but<00:02:18.470> I<00:02:18.740> don't<00:02:18.920> think

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
did make up for it but I don't think

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.170 
did make up for it but I don't think
that's<00:02:19.250> enough<00:02:19.460> to<00:02:19.610> save<00:02:19.790> all<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.060> other

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
that's enough to save all the other

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.600 
that's enough to save all the other
twists<00:02:20.540> that<00:02:20.720> were<00:02:20.930> easily<00:02:21.650> recognizable<00:02:22.520> i

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
much he can do with this character I'm

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.810 
much he can do with this character I'm
more<00:03:23.390> forgiving<00:03:23.840> of<00:03:24.019> this<00:03:24.350> because<00:03:24.560> I<00:03:24.820> found

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
more forgiving of this because I found

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.000 
more forgiving of this because I found
to<00:03:26.030> be<00:03:26.120> enjoyable<00:03:26.510> no<00:03:26.660> matter<00:03:26.810> what<00:03:27.080> but<00:03:27.860> my

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
I know you're proving my point it

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:50.860 
I know you're proving my point it
doesn't<00:03:49.640> make<00:03:49.850> sense<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.299> real<00:03:50.480> problem<00:03:50.780> i

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
doesn't make sense the real problem i

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.330 
doesn't make sense the real problem i
had<00:03:51.049> with<00:03:51.170> that<00:03:51.320> though<00:03:51.500> is<00:03:51.530> that<00:03:51.739> they're

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
had with that though is that they're

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.940 
had with that though is that they're
invincible<00:03:52.810> except<00:03:53.810> when<00:03:54.080> they<00:03:54.260> get<00:03:54.500> hit<00:03:54.709> too

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
invincible except when they get hit too

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.250 
invincible except when they get hit too
hard<00:03:55.310> by<00:03:55.640> something<00:03:56.060> too<00:03:56.239> powerful<00:03:56.780> well<00:03:57.110> they

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
hard by something too powerful well they

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.690 
hard by something too powerful well they
needed<00:03:57.560> i<00:03:57.650> guess<00:03:57.799> they<00:03:57.950> needed<00:03:58.190> a<00:03:58.280> villain

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
needed i guess they needed a villain

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.180 
needed i guess they needed a villain
that<00:03:58.849> could

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
that could

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.280 
that could
match<00:03:59.280> up<00:03:59.460> to<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.700> Tony<00:03:59.910> Stark<00:04:00.300> suit<00:04:00.690> because
