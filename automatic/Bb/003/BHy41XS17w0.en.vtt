or<00:00:33.149> just<00:00:33.180> focus<00:00:33.780> camera<00:00:36.860> extremely<00:00:37.860> detailed

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
or just focus camera extremely detailed

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.959 
or just focus camera extremely detailed
it<00:00:38.550> does<00:00:38.790> look<00:00:39.090> great<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.230> back<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.680> also

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
it does look great and the back is also

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.200

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
same with the tiger II and of course the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.330 
same with the tiger II and of course the
Phoenix<00:00:45.660> logo<00:00:48.079> so<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.260> reason<00:00:49.770> why<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.010> think

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
Phoenix logo so the reason why I think

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.850 
Phoenix logo so the reason why I think
Phoenix<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.570> best<00:00:51.840> model<00:00:52.230> producer

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
Phoenix is the best model producer

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.250 
Phoenix is the best model producer
because<00:00:53.550> they<00:00:53.699> always<00:00:53.969> go<00:00:54.180> over<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> top<00:00:54.870> over

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
because they always go over the top over

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.400 
because they always go over the top over
the<00:00:55.379> top<00:00:55.410> with<00:00:55.890> their<00:00:56.070> models<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.079> that<00:00:58.079> means

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the top with their models and that means

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.500 
the top with their models and that means
they<00:00:58.680> excel<00:00:59.129> over<00:00:59.550> German<00:00:59.910> our<00:01:00.030> Jets<00:01:00.300> are<00:01:00.629> mold

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
they excel over German our Jets are mold
