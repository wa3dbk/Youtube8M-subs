 very good to everyone if it's guys always 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.360
 assume that this case has been prescribed 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.890
 on a parkour map what I do not know how 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.970
 it will be called same but good as 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.380
 important all that you are 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.380
 listening with the new micro with the 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.760
 kind of sc 450 thing what to look for 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.170
 by google or being able to buy in the store 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.510
 of form because there are you asked me 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.560
 a lot and I forgot to put the link 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.270
 every time you have so you can 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.980
 buy and good without more 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.090
 I hope my voice does not change much 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.890
 well I say this is the newspaper that I am 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.320
 giving with this micro I hope not to screw it 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.550
 I really hope that it is heard well and that 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.840
 especially do not change my voice much 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.760
 because this is something that he really does 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.949
 I'm scared because there are only people where 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.720
 this time also the same I follow 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.489
 being the same and have another micro that 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.559
 I believe that quality will improve me 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.820
 the truth is that it is suffering a bit to 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.489
 place it because I have a desk 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.470
 something small then nothing else is 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.360
 tell this as suffered game rules 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.309
 do not break anything follow the path or the in 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.650

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.490
 to be very long very short but I 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.799
 often afraid to act I just 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.179
 wake up because they have already returned to 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.649
 classes and have gone back to fuck me life 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:37.299
 then you have to start the march by 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:39.039
 the day now saying yes this is 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.200
 horrible because when I'm done 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.439
 lift up like I have my head in 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.439
 other site 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.849
 let's see let's see if we are a 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:02.439
 map of where we lava parkour 

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:05.319
 our skull 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.579
 and ours is dripping on the neck and 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.170
 let's make this jump 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.170
 things now with rain 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.099
 Williams removes a part and good as 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.600
 well I say ally enough to for 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.600
 place in the micro because 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.910
 because I have the desk very firecracker 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.560
 here the catcher I also have the 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.240
 kind of timer pass with you 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.890
 the videos I have many things if 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.780
 I acquire placed next to the pc that does not 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.130
 I know very well if I catch a lot 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.660
 interference from it because I have it 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.270
 there with the graphics and I do not expect us 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.350
 listen a lot to the process topic of the 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.640
 strong food that we have it 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.120
 identified and change me also makes 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.190
 little but good that does not improve much 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.900
 schiavi that the first and everything we 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.450
 You see and the truth is I just 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.610
 record a map of pixar artists of 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.020
 brutal parkour and he fucked me up a lot 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.120
 because the pit room was very cool was 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.460
 from jason versus freddy for those who 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.100
 like the terror of the know and the 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.180
 parkour was as defective as 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.610
 they have done just head for all 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.650
 sides was impossible and clear in the end I have 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.120
 made a boy to send me the other time 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.250
 the map with the evil by solved thus 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.250
 that this is a message that by the time 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.150
 a boat like this that looks like 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.410
 that you can go wrong in any 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.410
 side because he has put lots of jumps 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.610
 so then nothing happens but if 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.409
 you make a mix to architect nelson for 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.719
 I would ask for your cortices please and 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:28.370
 If you can prove it, see what you can not 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:30.530
 it hits my head or anything or that it's the 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.939
 chito t4 if I do not care I prefer about 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.629
 everything that the head to not forget the 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.629
 part of that cut 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.700
 different materials we do not now go to the 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:48.340
 lava area 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:48.340
 and also that I'm also very creative 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.120
 in the hands 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.930
 perfect 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.080
 We are eating with definitive heroes 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.790
 I asked the other day I also like 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.020
 because I think there is a quantity 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.470
 exaggerated and eat as a challenge to see if the 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.850
 people are encouraged and leave their supports and the 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.160
 truth is that you have given them more than 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.290
 4,000 I like it to be spare and it's humanity 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.820
 by God this is amazing four 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.470
 people who have supported that content 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.940
 by people who want to continue 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.350
 seeing the definitive ones because the truth is 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.890
 that I do it with more emotion and I know that 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.740
 some out there to climb but now 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.210
 same the truth that I have many 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.310
 definitive I think you're being supported 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.120
 a lot and I think it deserves because we go to 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.120
 fact channel 22 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.400
 is complicated right now is the most 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.900
 Tovar from definitive aquariums in fact 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.090
 I came up with more ideas like for example 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.560
 to use one piece of each suit for 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.689
 example I'm going to put the helmet on 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.979
 hulk the legs of deadpool for cÃ©line 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:56.370
 running and having life statement 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:58.550
 with ironman's chest and to have a 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.550
 little bit 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.819
 Gentlemen to this can send our 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.500
 maps because the truth is that I'm 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:15.210
 looking for the map now and do not 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.250
 I have almost none so if someone is 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.050
 encourages me to make a signature map 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.180
 I would be very very grateful because 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.560
 I have many games that I also 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.819
 I like I have perceived all kinds of 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.889
 content but right now there are days that 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:29.069
 I say only make a small fence 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:31.340
 I can not and if I leave here the 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.110
 five contracts 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.490
 I also say that if you send me maps 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.430
 because many great maps that are not 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.410
 your 88 other people and then I 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.270
 they say how system comes for stolen is 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.710
 the map so you can also put me 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.820
 who has done it so I'm going to 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.340
 thank you for that person who has done the 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.630
 map would be fine if everyone else or 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.250
 less what you demand the map 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:54.100
 progressive map is not I is so 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.100
 boy, in case I give him credit because 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.440
 using and right now record heroes 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.300
 definitive because it is what surely 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.880
 up hey, you know, you want to buy with 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.440
 class the time is already dead a 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.700
 sancho and you could see even three videos 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.080
 newspapers like yesterday like for example that 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.639
 without a hundred put a microphone boxing 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.250
 but normally that's not going to be 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.900
 possible because the classes are 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.030
 horrible but good the truth environment 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.750
 what I want little and this jump as 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.660
 long by god 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:26.160
 I have about 48 weeks of classes two 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:28.650
 months and then a gentleman who does any 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.500
 career for people who have a cycle 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:34.250
 with a cycle we see that it is like a 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:41.420
 training portion something 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:41.420
 'the family' customized 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:51.950
 this is the end 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:04.770
 You've also put the touch to continue 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:05.970
 with you are I liked this little map 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.590
 departure that my voice 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.640
 I hope he changed a lot after 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.640
 record is final 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:19.440
 gain of 182 thousand people and good 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:21.340
 Well, we look very big and even the 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.880
 following 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.880
 here it is
