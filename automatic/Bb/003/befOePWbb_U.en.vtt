generation
foods<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.600> have<00:02:21.870> because<00:02:22.650> their<00:02:22.950> feet<00:02:23.160> are

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
foods that I have because their feet are

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.210 
foods that I have because their feet are
longer<00:02:23.910> and<00:02:24.120> skinnier<00:02:25.080> than<00:02:25.230> American<00:02:25.770> girls

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
longer and skinnier than American girls

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.800 
longer and skinnier than American girls
so<00:02:26.610> sometimes<00:02:27.000> their<00:02:27.210> shoes<00:02:27.390> look<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.690> little

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
so sometimes their shoes look a little

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.120 
so sometimes their shoes look a little
weird<00:02:28.080> but<00:02:28.290> these<00:02:28.530> ones<00:02:28.770> they<00:02:28.920> made

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
weird but these ones they made

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.890 
weird but these ones they made
differently<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:29.850> they<00:02:30.000> don't<00:02:30.210> look<00:02:30.390> weird<00:02:30.570> at

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
differently so they don't look weird at

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.790 
differently so they don't look weird at
all<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:32.070> think<00:02:32.100> they're<00:02:32.460> really<00:02:32.550> cute<00:02:32.940> and
