00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.509
 and others such as you are here we are 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.459
 a new tutorial today is tutoring 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.380
 a new robotic dribble of judgment that 

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:11.179
 it is called the screen that consists of doing 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.070
 a round the world for one side and another 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.750
 for the other followed so without further 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.750
 procrastination we will learn to do it 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.129
 álvarez before you start with the steps 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.269
 just tell you that you also want 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.829
 learn to do around the world if 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:38.300
 is that you do not know it is worth either for outside 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.789
 or for inside or with the same left 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.480
 leave more than 1500 laws in this video and 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.480
 the next tutorial 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.519
 It can be in two ways with work 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.839
 from the ground it would be something like that and take the 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.819
 variation the half way around the world and 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:04.129
 re-do the second by tapping 

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:06.180
 with which we have to make jump 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.070
 push it 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.870
 we jump impelled to do the first 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.640
 and just hold it and do the second 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.640
 those are the steps that you have 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.950
 so just when we have the second 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.080
 back to the point already to do we leave 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.940
 from here we just have it and let's do 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.619
 other story something like that you're going to 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.619
 see here below and I will not talk 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.210
 well, that's what kids are assigned, that would be the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.500
 screen or the mirror is pretty easy to 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.909
 it's easier for me to lift it 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.259
 directly from the ground and does in the 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.909
 first round the world and then the 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.280
 second to the contrary but good I say 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.570
 here because it was very windy so 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.159
 that simply if you want a tutorial 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.420
 of a round the world always so much with 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.289
 one side as for another leave it in 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.759
 comments 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.259
 we have reached 1500 likes and also 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.399
 tell you it's called mirror because 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.110
 we make the round the world and the 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.299
 we invite in the same way towards another 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.439
 Then there are no kids who are 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.060
 tutorial today I hope that I have you 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.619
 served that if you also want me to do 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.119
 of the return to the world remember leave the 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.489
 comments and leave a good of gastón 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.060
 2500 as always you have here my 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.060
 social networks 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.459
 natural that you can use it so that 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.290
 come out this screen or this mirror that 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.530
 is so handsome we see you the next 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.530
 video
