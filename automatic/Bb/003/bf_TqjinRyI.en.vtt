that<00:00:39.640> is<00:00:39.729> remote<00:00:40.239> tower<00:00:40.510> this<00:00:41.229> is<00:00:41.379> a<00:00:41.409> very

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
that is remote tower this is a very

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.000 
that is remote tower this is a very
innovative<00:00:42.159> solution<00:00:43.059> and<00:00:43.269> we<00:00:44.260> have<00:00:44.409> taken

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
innovative solution and we have taken

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.500 
innovative solution and we have taken
the<00:00:45.249> knowledge<00:00:45.609> that<00:00:45.639> we<00:00:45.969> have<00:00:46.149> from<00:00:46.389> the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
the knowledge that we have from the

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.479 
the knowledge that we have from the
military<00:00:46.929> side<00:00:47.170> and<00:00:47.440> bringing<00:00:47.859> that<00:00:48.069> into<00:00:48.339> the

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
military side and bringing that into the

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.879 
military side and bringing that into the
civilian<00:00:48.969> side<00:00:49.149> with<00:00:49.449> a<00:00:49.479> completely<00:00:50.019> new<00:00:50.229> set

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:50.889 
civilian side with a completely new set

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:54.539 
civilian side with a completely new set
of<00:00:51.299> sensors<00:00:52.299> so<00:00:52.929> we<00:00:52.960> are<00:00:53.049> using<00:00:53.530> HD<00:00:54.100> cameras

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:54.549 
of sensors so we are using HD cameras

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:56.639 
of sensors so we are using HD cameras
and<00:00:54.760> display<00:00:55.149> and<00:00:55.420> then<00:00:55.929> can<00:00:56.229> remotely

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
and display and then can remotely

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.209 
and display and then can remotely
operate<00:00:57.339> an<00:00:57.999> airport<00:00:58.629> or<00:00:58.870> an<00:00:59.019> airbase<00:00:59.469> from

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
operate an airport or an airbase from

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.189 
operate an airport or an airbase from
another<00:01:00.429> location<00:01:00.789> this<00:01:01.510> is<00:01:01.690> a<00:01:01.719> breakthrough

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
another location this is a breakthrough

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.009 
another location this is a breakthrough
because<00:01:02.859> what<00:01:03.819> we<00:01:03.940> have<00:01:04.089> done<00:01:04.119> is<00:01:04.539> to<00:01:04.719> bring<00:01:04.899> in

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
because what we have done is to bring in

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.859 
because what we have done is to bring in
a<00:01:05.170> new<00:01:05.199> set<00:01:05.740> of<00:01:05.770> infrastructure<00:01:06.759> and<00:01:07.119> actually

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
a new set of infrastructure and actually

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.740 
a new set of infrastructure and actually
can<00:01:08.020> lower<00:01:08.259> the<00:01:08.680> total<00:01:08.920> unit<00:01:09.399> rate<00:01:09.610> by<00:01:09.850> 35<00:01:10.479> to

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
can lower the total unit rate by 35 to

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.469 
can lower the total unit rate by 35 to
50<00:01:11.110> percent<00:01:11.469> and<00:01:11.770> that<00:01:12.430> has<00:01:12.670> been<00:01:12.880> absolutely

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
50 percent and that has been absolutely

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.929 
50 percent and that has been absolutely
breakthrough<00:01:14.110> but<00:01:14.799> that<00:01:15.009> is<00:01:15.130> not<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.460> end<00:01:15.640> we

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
breakthrough but that is not the end we

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.319 
breakthrough but that is not the end we
are<00:01:16.030> as<00:01:16.420> well<00:01:16.719> now<00:01:17.250> discussion<00:01:18.250> with<00:01:18.729> larger

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
are as well now discussion with larger

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:20.940 
are as well now discussion with larger
airport<00:01:19.750> operations<00:01:20.079> so<00:01:20.409> we<00:01:20.439> can<00:01:20.680> combine

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
airport operations so we can combine

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.670 
airport operations so we can combine
this<00:01:21.369> in<00:01:21.700> in<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.210> modular<00:01:22.630> base<00:01:22.840> depending<00:01:23.350> of

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
this in in the modular base depending of

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.740 
this in in the modular base depending of
the<00:01:23.920> needs<00:01:24.130> for<00:01:24.369> a<00:01:24.399> customer<00:01:24.909> and<00:01:25.149> that<00:01:25.390> is<00:01:25.719> a

the needs for a customer and that is a

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.499 
the needs for a customer and that is a
completely<00:01:26.740> new<00:01:26.920> way<00:01:27.159> of<00:01:27.430> bringing<00:01:27.969> tower

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
completely new way of bringing tower

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.870 
completely new way of bringing tower

Spring in the middle of Australia from

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:57.950 
Spring in the middle of Australia from
Adelaide<00:01:56.319> and<00:01:56.710> that's<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.159> distance<00:01:57.549> of

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960

a key solution for the whole operation
Saab<00:02:09.850> is<00:02:10.150> the<00:02:10.390> leading<00:02:10.870> company<00:02:11.590> in<00:02:11.620> those

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
Saab is the leading company in those

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.040 
Saab is the leading company in those
kind<00:02:12.880> of

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
kind of

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.740 
kind of
we<00:02:14.500> are<00:02:14.710> having<00:02:15.370> two<00:02:15.730> third<00:02:16.000> of<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.270> deployed

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
we are having two third of the deployed

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.230 
we are having two third of the deployed
system<00:02:17.230> on<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.500> ACE<00:02:17.650> mix<00:02:17.950> system<00:02:18.310> this<00:02:18.850> is<00:02:19.060> now

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
system on the ACE mix system this is now

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.360 
system on the ACE mix system this is now
a<00:02:19.480> solve<00:02:19.780> solution<00:02:20.380> so<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:21.010> gives<00:02:21.220> an

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
a solve solution so that gives an

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.890 
a solve solution so that gives an
example<00:02:21.550> of<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.270> we<00:02:22.420> can<00:02:22.600> provide

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
example of that we can provide

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.050 
example of that we can provide
everything<00:02:23.380> from<00:02:23.860> small<00:02:24.190> regional<00:02:24.670> airport

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
everything from small regional airport

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.690 
everything from small regional airport
up<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.870> largest<00:02:26.170> one<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:27.160> goes<00:02:27.340> for

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
up to the largest one and that goes for

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.940 
up to the largest one and that goes for
the<00:02:27.940> whole<00:02:28.030> tower<00:02:28.690> cabin<00:02:29.260> with<00:02:29.560> all<00:02:29.740> the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
the whole tower cabin with all the

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.350 
the whole tower cabin with all the
infrastructure<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.350> needed
