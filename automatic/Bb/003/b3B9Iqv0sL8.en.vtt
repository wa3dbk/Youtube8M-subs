00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
going to use five teaspoons of that

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.370 
going to use five teaspoons of that
later<00:00:28.109> on

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
later on

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.970 
later on
and<00:00:28.760> of<00:00:29.760> course<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.090> blender<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.750> then<00:00:30.980> I'm

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
and of course a blender and then I'm

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.470 
and of course a blender and then I'm
going<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.340> cut<00:00:32.520> off<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.790> top<00:00:32.969> part<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
going to cut off the top part of the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.910 
going to cut off the top part of the
carrot<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:33.989> then<00:00:34.230> I'm<00:00:34.350> going<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.590> be<00:00:34.680> peeling

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
carrot and then I'm going to be peeling

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.770 
carrot and then I'm going to be peeling
off<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.160> skin<00:00:35.309> because<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.180> don't<00:00:36.390> want<00:00:36.630> that

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
off the skin because I don't want that

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.850 
off the skin because I don't want that
to<00:00:37.020> be<00:00:37.050> included

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
to be included

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.729 
to be included
later<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:39.030> once<00:00:39.210> blended<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.809> now<00:00:40.500> I'm<00:00:40.620> going

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
later on once blended and now I'm going

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.950 
later on once blended and now I'm going
to<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:40.920> slicing<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> carrots<00:00:41.670> now<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.809> this

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
to be slicing the carrots now in this

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.779 
to be slicing the carrots now in this
recipe<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.559> really<00:00:43.770> depends<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.520> if<00:00:44.640> you

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
recipe it really depends on you if you

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.790 
recipe it really depends on you if you
want<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.329> flavor<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.020> carrots<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.500> stand

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
want the flavor of the carrots to stand

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.990 
want the flavor of the carrots to stand
out<00:00:46.980> even<00:00:47.129> more<00:00:47.600> you<00:00:48.600> can<00:00:48.750> add<00:00:48.960> another

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
out even more you can add another

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.819 
out even more you can add another
another<00:00:51.000> carrot<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:51.750> for<00:00:51.960> me<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.620> like

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
another carrot but for me I just like

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.400 
another carrot but for me I just like
the<00:00:53.010> proportion<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.640> six<00:00:53.910> bananas<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.570> one

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
the proportion of six bananas and one

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.790 
the proportion of six bananas and one
carrot<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.940> that's<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:58.140> really<00:00:58.440> depends<00:00:58.710> on

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
carrot so that's it it really depends on

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:09.100 
carrot so that's it it really depends on
you<00:00:58.920> though

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.020 

and<00:01:10.110> after<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:11.010> am<00:01:11.370> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.820> peel<00:01:12.000> off

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
and after that I am going to peel off

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.020 
and after that I am going to peel off
six<00:01:12.960> bananas<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.800> am<00:01:14.460> also<00:01:14.610> going<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.940> be

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
six bananas I am also going to be

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.840 
six bananas I am also going to be
cutting<00:01:15.480> it<00:01:15.690> as<00:01:15.930> well<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.650> as<00:01:17.310> I've<00:01:17.430> said<00:01:17.640> if

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
cutting it as well and as I've said if

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.820 
cutting it as well and as I've said if
you<00:01:18.090> want<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.600> taste<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.230> banana<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.680> come

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
you want the taste of the banana to come

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.180 
you want the taste of the banana to come
out<00:01:19.980> more<00:01:20.310> than<00:01:20.670> add<00:01:20.970> more<00:01:21.240> banana<00:01:21.570> add<00:01:22.190> less

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
out more than add more banana add less

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.360 
out more than add more banana add less
the<00:01:23.670> carrots<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:24.540> me<00:01:24.690> I<00:01:24.900> actually<00:01:25.770> like

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
the carrots but for me I actually like

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.330 
the carrots but for me I actually like
my<00:01:26.610> proportion<00:01:27.510> like<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> six<00:01:28.680> bananas<00:01:29.100> and

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
my proportion like the six bananas and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.700 
my proportion like the six bananas and
only<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:29.790> carrot<00:01:30.120> so<00:01:30.420> that's<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.110> then<00:01:31.380> I'm

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
only one carrot so that's it then I'm

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.440 
only one carrot so that's it then I'm
going<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.190> fruiting<00:01:32.550> all<00:01:32.730> those<00:01:32.940> things<00:01:33.210> onto

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
going to fruiting all those things onto

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.390 
going to fruiting all those things onto
the<00:01:33.660> blender<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.260> place<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.770> chopped<00:01:34.980> bananas

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the blender so place the chopped bananas

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.370 
the blender so place the chopped bananas
in<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.550> carrots<00:01:35.910> inside<00:01:36.660> the<00:01:36.810> blender<00:01:37.170> and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
in the carrots inside the blender and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:46.520 
in the carrots inside the blender and
I'm<00:01:37.920> going<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.250> blend<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:44.510> now<00:01:45.510> I<00:01:45.540> added<00:01:46.050> 2<00:01:46.260> cups

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
I'm going to blend it now I added 2 cups

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.000 
I'm going to blend it now I added 2 cups
of<00:01:46.650> water<00:01:46.860> just<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:49.229> make<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> blending

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
of water just to make the blending

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.880 
of water just to make the blending
process<00:01:50.270> easier<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.630> there<00:01:51.810> we<00:01:51.930> go<00:01:52.080> just<00:01:52.350> blend

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
process easier so there we go just blend

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.100 
process easier so there we go just blend
it<00:01:53.040> until<00:01:53.160> you<00:01:53.550> can't<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.240> can<00:01:54.390> no<00:01:54.509> longer<00:01:54.720> see

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
it until you can't you can no longer see

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.020 
it until you can't you can no longer see
the<00:01:55.140> particles<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.490> banana<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
the particles of the banana and the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.630 
the particles of the banana and the
carrots

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.180 

all<00:02:03.240> right<00:02:03.390> now<00:02:03.510> in<00:02:03.690> here<00:02:03.990> once<00:02:04.170> I'm<00:02:04.350> done<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.950> am

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
all right now in here once I'm done I am

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.070 
all right now in here once I'm done I am
actually<00:02:05.370> going<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.760> be<00:02:05.940> adding<00:02:06.120> five

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
actually going to be adding five

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.559 
actually going to be adding five
tablespoons<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.220> washed<00:02:08.550> sugar<00:02:08.880> in<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.240> and

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
tablespoons of washed sugar in that and

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.840 
tablespoons of washed sugar in that and
this<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.259> actually<00:02:10.649> sugar<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.039> taste<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.520> if

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
this is actually sugar to taste so if

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.430 
this is actually sugar to taste so if
you<00:02:12.270> don't<00:02:12.480> if<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.930> don't<00:02:13.080> want<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.350> be

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
you don't if you don't want it to be

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.970 
you don't if you don't want it to be
sweet

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
sweet

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.220 
sweet
then<00:02:14.400> just<00:02:14.760> add<00:02:14.970> two<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.930> three<00:02:16.110> tablespoons

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
then just add two to three tablespoons

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.710 
then just add two to three tablespoons
of<00:02:16.709> sugar<00:02:16.830> but<00:02:17.069> I<00:02:17.190> added<00:02:17.520> five<00:02:17.730> tablespoons<00:02:18.450> of

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
of sugar but I added five tablespoons of

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.990 
of sugar but I added five tablespoons of
washing<00:02:19.380> herb<00:02:19.500> in<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:20.310> those<00:02:20.459> of<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.820> who

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
washing herb in to those of you who

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.699 
washing herb in to those of you who
don't<00:02:21.180> really<00:02:21.390> like<00:02:21.660> this<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:21.990> be<00:02:22.110> super<00:02:22.350> sweet

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
don't really like this to be super sweet

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.350 
don't really like this to be super sweet
or<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.010> don't<00:02:23.190> like<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.490> add<00:02:23.610> any<00:02:23.820> sugar<00:02:23.850> then

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
or you don't like to add any sugar then

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.150 
or you don't like to add any sugar then
that'd<00:02:24.570> still<00:02:24.810> be<00:02:24.870> fine<00:02:25.200> as<00:02:25.350> well<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.770> you

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
that'd still be fine as well and you

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.890 
that'd still be fine as well and you
also<00:02:26.280> have<00:02:26.790> an<00:02:26.940> option<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.390> using<00:02:27.450> honey

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
also have an option of using honey

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:36.650 
also have an option of using honey
instead<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.320> sugar<00:02:35.180> so<00:02:36.180> I'm<00:02:36.270> going<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.570> be

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
instead of sugar so I'm going to be

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.360 
instead of sugar so I'm going to be
adding<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.989> evaporated<00:02:37.560> milk<00:02:37.590> I'm<00:02:37.950> going<00:02:38.220> to

adding the evaporated milk I'm going to

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:53.260 
adding the evaporated milk I'm going to
be<00:02:38.430> blending<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.940> again

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.550 

and<00:02:54.270> once<00:02:54.480> you're<00:02:54.660> done<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:54.870> can<00:02:55.140> leave<00:02:55.349> that

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
and once you're done you can leave that

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.400 
and once you're done you can leave that
