00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.130
 Let's go the German Bundestag 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.640
 relates internet from verizon one 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.890
 American internet service applause 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.080
 this information has netzpolitik.org 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.100
 a very good block found out 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.660
 they are simple 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.609
 set and the ip addresses through 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.769
 Wanted and think very guidance finds 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.140
 in the article itself the problem with 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.640
 the whole story is touring 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.710
 is also a company that according to the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.450
 filed his data from snowden 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.760
 the nsa has sold if the German 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.280
 bundestag so now surfing the internet 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.469
 and some kind of secret things go and 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.539
 sent here then that runs over the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.300
 Verizon and the internet 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.340
 internet management of tours collects 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.840
 data and passes them on to the nsa 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.059
 used on top of it ours 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.860
 House of Representatives internet from the colt 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.440
 group and that works with the yes 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.020
 British Secret Service Cage crew 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.659
 together again what only again 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.960
 applause how can I understand it 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.840
 Not 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.850
 the nexus chief developer david berg gave 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.220
 known that you are still interested in 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.720
 the nexus series has it in the fall 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.299
 also give a new nexus smartphone 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.890
 This is rumored by Android Silver 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.330
 and any of that at all 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.080
 nexus is no longer on the market 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.790
 become 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.220
 So maybe we should 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.380
 Push a little more into the rumor kitchen 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.970
 and keep it because apparently 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.790
 it continues nexus smartphones without too 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.619
 Devices indicate if that means now that 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.909
 android silva does not come at all or this one 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.229
 whole premium smartphones at all 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.610
 do not come or or or or 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.900
 we can tell you who we know 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.390
 not we definitely know it 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.920
 still premium variants as type 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.950
 labels of certain devices 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.479
 But what is now with the end what with 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.119
 android silver in itself 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.880
 no idea write your ideas 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.770
 or suggestions below in the comments 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.180
 the Italian company hecking team has 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.840
 a program or an app presented 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.579
 with the name remote control system also 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.250
 acs so you can almost from one 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.079
 Smartphone read everything where you look 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.000
 is what you have just written 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.050
 which contacts you really had 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.630
 everything around it 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.670
 such a really nice trojan can do that 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.620
 You can also buy without problems 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.599
 will become with everything what this thing 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.459
 may be the only problem at the 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.160
 history is you have to be a state 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.840
 his or federal government 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.459
 it is also special that you can do this directly 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.349
 entire data collections with one 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.819
 can combine that action 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.650
 Trojan is on smartphone and power 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.930
 By the way, nothing works by the way 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.010
 also with the iphone that is drink or 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.440
 a windows phone or a 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.840
 blackberry and if at the moment where 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.910
 For example, the battery is all 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.769
 just put a usb cable in there 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.150
 load all the data because all 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.349
 together with the trojan and become the 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.450
 example of where clever luck is 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.190
 I no government and also this week 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.290
 she passes a fair amount 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.540
 android developer preview is now for 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.640
 download available about 460 megabytes 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.530
 big can be easily flashed 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.120
 but still very experimental and 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.680
 also the whole apps the android 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.970
 presented by google 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.760
 they are really real 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.660
 So there just to look at even everyday 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.329
 no 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.100
 nokia has introduced android x2 so 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.470
 the successor of android apps with 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.440
 android from the google glass is there 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.540
 now a hardware version with a new one 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.760
 hardware so an upgrade with more 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.680
 RAM and the whole small one 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.109
 section her down here on the left and 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.700
 Roger Petit is sick of technology 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.829
 do what she does with us and what 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.780
 one should still pay attention to all this 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.190
 Can you find yourself up there you can 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.859
 this week probably the ugliest 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.780
 ever looked at headphones design 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.859
 Look there if you still hearty 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.790
 headphones designs have writes 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:46.049
 comments in and the topic 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.130
 smartphones and memory before 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.170
 all android smartphones and 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.450
 RAM that we call here 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.250
 because there are many questions you have to ask 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.989
 still very easy to answer 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.239
 The linux is a very simple one 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.400
 system that exactly that memory 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.239
 ratio actually very self 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.829
 can manage 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.359
 why that is so why we are with it too 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.790
 a whole lot of battery could save that 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.319
 you can find here at the topic 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.180
 Memory lied at android 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.010
 And of course this week was on the 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.290
 google io a whole whole lot 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.060
 to the new android and new google 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.820
 this is now being introduced in china 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.250
 away and let's take a look at what 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.849
 themes it to android awards android tv 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.930
 android car android and google fit that 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.400
 We have everything here for you again 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.960
 listed and of course, too 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.580
 a video made that comes exactly now 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.460
 just over here 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.990
 and there you can have a short one again 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.410
 give summary by all 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.650
 what about the google i / o 2014 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.479

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.180

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.690
