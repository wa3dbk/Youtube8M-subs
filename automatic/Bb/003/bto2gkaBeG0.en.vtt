00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
ball in the net but a lot of it was our

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.650 
ball in the net but a lot of it was our
own<00:03:29.630> errors<00:03:30.400> our<00:03:31.400> Mexican<00:03:31.970> centre-back<00:03:32.480> is

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
own errors our Mexican centre-back is

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.759 
own errors our Mexican centre-back is
normally<00:03:33.200> very<00:03:33.560> very<00:03:33.860> composed<00:03:34.870> but<00:03:35.870> today<00:03:36.170> he

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
normally very very composed but today he

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.650 
normally very very composed but today he
had<00:03:36.950> an<00:03:37.069> absolute<00:03:37.519> shocker<00:03:37.910> no<00:03:37.970> joke<00:03:38.269> I<00:03:38.540> think

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
had an absolute shocker no joke I think

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.410 
had an absolute shocker no joke I think
we<00:03:38.959> could<00:03:39.140> fairly<00:03:39.700> say<00:03:40.700> that<00:03:40.940> he<00:03:41.060> gave<00:03:41.239> the

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
we could fairly say that he gave the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.479 
we could fairly say that he gave the
ball<00:03:41.600> away<00:03:41.720> twice<00:03:42.140> which<00:03:42.530> led<00:03:42.739> to<00:03:42.769> goals<00:03:43.100> and

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
ball away twice which led to goals and

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:46.020 
ball away twice which led to goals and
then<00:03:44.090> he<00:03:44.209> let<00:03:44.390> one<00:03:44.780> on<00:03:44.900> one<00:03:45.110> he<00:03:45.230> let<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.500> boy

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
then he let one on one he let the boy

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.090 
then he let one on one he let the boy
boy<00:03:47.030> cut<00:03:47.300> in<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:47.630> finish<00:03:47.959> and<00:03:48.260> then<00:03:48.530> Charlie

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
boy cut in and finish and then Charlie

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.190 
boy cut in and finish and then Charlie
are<00:03:49.250> right<00:03:49.459> back<00:03:49.730> again<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.209> poor<00:03:50.690> good

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
are right back again a poor good

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.590 
are right back again a poor good
decision<00:03:51.769> but<00:03:52.670> I<00:03:52.760> think<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:53.060> sixth<00:03:53.390> goal

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
decision but I think the sixth goal

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.060 
decision but I think the sixth goal
trying<00:03:53.930> to<00:03:54.019> play<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.260> ball<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:54.650> hell<00:03:54.829> man<00:03:55.040> I

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
trying to play the ball to hell man I

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.479 
trying to play the ball to hell man I
mix<00:03:55.340> up<00:03:55.519> there<00:03:55.790> and<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.120> boy<00:03:56.299> steps<00:03:56.690> in<00:03:56.900> so

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
mix up there and the boy steps in so

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.160 
mix up there and the boy steps in so
against<00:03:58.489> a<00:03:58.579> good<00:03:58.760> team<00:03:59.030> and<00:03:59.269> I<00:03:59.510> think<00:03:59.540> Brunei

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
against a good team and I think Brunei

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.440 
against a good team and I think Brunei
to<00:04:00.230> be<00:04:00.530> fair<00:04:00.769> and<00:04:00.920> a<00:04:01.040> good<00:04:01.220> team<00:04:01.489> against<00:04:02.299> a

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
to be fair and a good team against a

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.300 
to be fair and a good team against a
good<00:04:02.570> team<00:04:02.630> if<00:04:03.019> you<00:04:03.140> make<00:04:03.440> mistakes<00:04:03.650> like<00:04:04.100> that

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
good team if you make mistakes like that

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.840 
good team if you make mistakes like that
you'll<00:04:04.549> be<00:04:04.610> punished<00:04:05.090> we<00:04:05.989> were<00:04:06.110> punished

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
you'll be punished we were punished

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.759 
you'll be punished we were punished
we're<00:04:07.850> not<00:04:08.030> a<00:04:08.060> great<00:04:08.269> first<00:04:08.510> half<00:04:08.600> but<00:04:09.260> never

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
we're not a great first half but never

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.590 
we're not a great first half but never
been<00:04:09.950> last<00:04:10.190> week<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:10.850> know<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:11.000> I<00:04:11.329> don't

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
been last week you know the I don't

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.170 
been last week you know the I don't
think<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.900> first<00:04:12.110> half<00:04:12.519> we<00:04:13.519> really<00:04:13.760> created

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
think the first half we really created

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.420 
think the first half we really created
many<00:04:14.360> chances<00:04:14.660> but<00:04:15.380> you<00:04:15.680> know<00:04:15.799> credit<00:04:16.160> to<00:04:16.310> the

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
many chances but you know credit to the

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.190 
many chances but you know credit to the
players<00:04:16.579> we<00:04:17.269> change<00:04:17.510> a<00:04:17.630> few<00:04:17.780> things<00:04:17.840> at

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
players we change a few things at

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.940 
players we change a few things at
halftime<00:04:18.380> I<00:04:19.239> felt<00:04:20.239> that<00:04:20.450> you<00:04:21.260> know<00:04:21.380> global<00:04:21.650> war

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950

better<00:04:41.630> to<00:04:41.870> get<00:04:41.960> a<00:04:42.020> clean<00:04:42.260> sheet<00:04:42.440> and<00:04:43.060> but

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
better to get a clean sheet and but

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.560 
better to get a clean sheet and but
probably<00:04:44.979> more<00:04:45.979> important<00:04:46.490> again<00:04:46.669> is<00:04:46.880> the<00:04:47.450> way

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
probably more important again is the way

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.240 
probably more important again is the way
we<00:04:47.750> we<00:04:48.020> don't<00:04:48.200> we<00:04:48.350> are<00:04:48.470> a<00:04:48.500> good<00:04:48.830> seder

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
we we don't we are a good seder

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.469 
we we don't we are a good seder
I<00:04:49.430> felt<00:04:49.760> was<00:04:49.850> were<00:04:49.910> they<00:04:50.030> were<00:04:50.090> a<00:04:50.120> good<00:04:50.270> save

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
I felt was were they were a good save

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.300 
I felt was were they were a good save
it's<00:04:50.630> difficult<00:04:51.289> you<00:04:51.530> know<00:04:51.650> for<00:04:51.860> them<00:04:51.950> once<00:04:52.220> we

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
it's difficult you know for them once we

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.550 
it's difficult you know for them once we
of<00:04:52.370> course<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.669> four<00:04:52.880> and<00:04:53.030> five<00:04:53.210> but<00:04:54.169> you<00:04:54.440> know

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
of course the four and five but you know

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.320 
of course the four and five but you know
when<00:04:55.039> it's<00:04:55.190> zero<00:04:55.370> zero<00:04:55.460> and<00:04:55.910> when<00:04:56.060> it's<00:04:56.180> only

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
when it's zero zero and when it's only

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.740 
when it's zero zero and when it's only
one<00:04:56.539> or<00:04:56.630> two<00:04:56.660> now<00:04:56.930> we're<00:04:57.560> a<00:04:57.590> good<00:04:57.770> site<00:04:57.979> so<00:04:58.750> I

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
one or two now we're a good site so I

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.310 
one or two now we're a good site so I
felt<00:05:00.320> we<00:05:00.409> control<00:05:00.740> the<00:05:00.890> game<00:05:01.039> really<00:05:01.280> well<00:05:01.430> and

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
felt we control the game really well and

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.650 
felt we control the game really well and
you<00:05:03.100> know<00:05:03.220> what<00:05:03.580> we're<00:05:03.760> really<00:05:03.910> looking<00:05:04.270> great

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
you know what we're really looking great

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.550 
you know what we're really looking great
to<00:05:04.840> score<00:05:05.110> what<00:05:05.590> she's<00:05:05.950> really<00:05:06.130> pleasing
