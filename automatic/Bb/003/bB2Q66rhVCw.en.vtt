00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
a different part of the farm so they can

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.070

I<00:02:53.120> think<00:02:53.540> turkey<00:02:53.720> Mama's<00:02:54.290> lead<00:02:54.860> their<00:02:55.130> chicks

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
I think turkey Mama's lead their chicks

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.370 
I think turkey Mama's lead their chicks
around<00:02:55.610> so<00:02:56.270> that<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.660> chicks<00:02:56.930> actually

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
around so that the chicks actually

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.030 
around so that the chicks actually
observe<00:02:57.860> what<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.400> mama<00:02:58.640> is<00:02:58.790> eating<00:02:59.240> and

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
observe what the mama is eating and

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.440 
observe what the mama is eating and

therefore all these guys are always

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.500 
therefore all these guys are always
coming<00:03:02.989> to<00:03:03.410> check<00:03:03.739> out<00:03:03.980> what<00:03:04.310> I'm<00:03:04.459> doing<00:03:04.820> I<00:03:05.030> was

heritage<00:04:55.710> ones<00:04:55.979> so<00:04:56.220> if<00:04:56.340> you<00:04:56.490> lose<00:04:56.820> a<00:04:56.850> few

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
heritage ones so if you lose a few

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.630 
heritage ones so if you lose a few
because<00:04:57.630> they're<00:04:57.810> very<00:04:58.190> finicky<00:04:59.190> and<00:04:59.340> die

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
because they're very finicky and die

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.690 
because they're very finicky and die
really<00:04:59.910> easy<00:05:00.180> it's<00:05:00.419> not<00:05:00.620> $15<00:05:01.620> a<00:05:01.650> Chiklis<00:05:02.460> loss

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
really easy it's not $15 a Chiklis loss

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.310 
really easy it's not $15 a Chiklis loss
it's<00:05:02.940> only<00:05:03.060> five<00:05:03.300> dollars<00:05:03.600> a<00:05:03.720> chick<00:05:04.080> and

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
it's only five dollars a chick and

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.290 
it's only five dollars a chick and
they're<00:05:05.070> easy<00:05:05.280> for<00:05:05.550> someone<00:05:05.729> to<00:05:05.850> raise<00:05:06.090> in

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
they're easy for someone to raise in

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.090 
they're easy for someone to raise in
their<00:05:06.390> backyard<00:05:06.900> and<00:05:07.140> they<00:05:07.530> grow<00:05:07.740> really<00:05:07.979> well

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
their backyard and they grow really well

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.130 
their backyard and they grow really well
they<00:05:08.430> perform<00:05:08.880> well<00:05:09.090> it's<00:05:09.450> a<00:05:09.750> sure<00:05:10.110> bet

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
they perform well it's a sure bet

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.529 
they perform well it's a sure bet
whereas<00:05:10.979> the<00:05:11.100> Heritage<00:05:11.520> ones<00:05:11.789> take<00:05:12.210> a<00:05:12.240> little

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
whereas the Heritage ones take a little

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.740 
whereas the Heritage ones take a little
bit<00:05:12.660> more<00:05:12.900> effort<00:05:13.890> but<00:05:14.700> the<00:05:14.910> return<00:05:15.270> is<00:05:15.539> better

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
bit more effort but the return is better

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.210 
bit more effort but the return is better
because<00:05:15.960> you<00:05:16.110> end<00:05:16.410> up<00:05:16.590> with<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:16.950> flock<00:05:17.190> that

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
because you end up with the flock that

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.490 
because you end up with the flock that
can<00:05:17.610> we<00:05:17.760> produce<00:05:17.970> on<00:05:18.210> its<00:05:18.360> own<00:05:18.510> so<00:05:19.110> to<00:05:19.229> start

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
can we produce on its own so to start

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.350 
can we produce on its own so to start
out<00:05:19.680> you<00:05:20.280> know<00:05:20.400> maybe<00:05:20.550> you<00:05:20.729> get<00:05:20.850> a<00:05:20.910> couple<00:05:21.270> of

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
out you know maybe you get a couple of

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.909 
out you know maybe you get a couple of
those<00:05:21.479> white<00:05:21.810> ones<00:05:22.050> and<00:05:22.229> you<00:05:22.350> end<00:05:22.500> up<00:05:22.620> with<00:05:22.770> an

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
those white ones and you end up with an

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.950 
those white ones and you end up with an
awesome<00:05:23.130> Christmas<00:05:23.640> dinner<00:05:24.060> then<00:05:24.570> the<00:05:24.600> next

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
awesome Christmas dinner then the next

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.120 
awesome Christmas dinner then the next
year<00:05:25.080> you<00:05:25.320> know<00:05:25.440> what<00:05:25.590> you're<00:05:25.710> doing<00:05:25.950> a<00:05:26.010> little

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
year you know what you're doing a little

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.590 
year you know what you're doing a little
bit<00:05:26.250> better<00:05:26.370> so<00:05:27.030> you<00:05:27.120> get<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.360> more<00:05:27.510> expensive

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
bit better so you get the more expensive

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.659 
bit better so you get the more expensive
chicks<00:05:28.320> but<00:05:28.830> then<00:05:29.010> you<00:05:29.130> can<00:05:29.280> hold<00:05:29.490> on<00:05:29.640> to

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
chicks but then you can hold on to

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.700 
chicks but then you can hold on to
longer<00:05:30.650> we're<00:05:31.729> we<00:05:32.729> decided<00:05:33.270> to<00:05:33.710> mainly

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
longer we're we decided to mainly

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.750 
longer we're we decided to mainly
produce<00:05:35.100> lead<00:05:36.090> out<00:05:36.390> of<00:05:36.510> birds<00:05:36.780> because

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.080 

as<00:05:40.760> you<00:05:40.940> can<00:05:41.150> read<00:05:41.330> in<00:05:41.360> smart<00:05:41.930> books<00:05:42.170> that<00:05:43.090> out

as you can read in smart books that out

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.330 
as you can read in smart books that out
of<00:05:44.330> two<00:05:44.630> pounds<00:05:44.990> of<00:05:45.230> grain<00:05:45.560> you<00:05:45.830> can<00:05:45.860> produce

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
of two pounds of grain you can produce

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.660 
of two pounds of grain you can produce
one<00:05:46.820> pound<00:05:47.240> or<00:05:47.480> third<00:05:47.750> week<00:05:48.050> and<00:05:48.500> in<00:05:49.190> mammals

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
one pound or third week and in mammals

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.420 
one pound or third week and in mammals
you<00:05:49.940> and<00:05:50.570> pigs<00:05:50.900> and<00:05:51.140> cows<00:05:51.500> one<00:05:51.860> since<00:05:52.190> you<00:05:52.280> will

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
you and pigs and cows one since you will

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.970 
you and pigs and cows one since you will
probably<00:05:52.850> need<00:05:53.000> more<00:05:53.060> like<00:05:53.630> seven<00:05:54.500> pounds<00:05:54.710> of

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:54.980 
probably need more like seven pounds of

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.790 
probably need more like seven pounds of
grain<00:05:55.280> through<00:05:55.700> one<00:05:55.940> pound<00:05:56.240> of<00:05:56.450> meat<00:05:56.810> which

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
grain through one pound of meat which

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.860 
grain through one pound of meat which
birds<00:05:58.220> are<00:05:58.490> way<00:05:58.730> more<00:05:58.760> efficient<00:05:59.600> in<00:05:59.720> that

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
birds are way more efficient in that

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.530 
birds are way more efficient in that
department<00:06:00.200> and<00:06:00.680> I<00:06:01.130> think<00:06:01.970> they<00:06:02.120> taste<00:06:02.360> good

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540
