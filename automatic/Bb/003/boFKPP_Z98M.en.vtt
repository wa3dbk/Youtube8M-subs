00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
the UMP I would rather use the UMP and

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.120 
the UMP does a little bit more damage
than<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.670> mp5<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:43.680> apparently<00:02:44.680> those

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
than the mp5 and apparently those

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.530
