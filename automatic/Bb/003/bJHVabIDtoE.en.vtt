thing that could negatively impact your

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.330 
thing that could negatively impact your
cars<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.970> having<00:00:24.390> your<00:00:24.539> your<00:00:24.779> your<00:00:25.710> wheels

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
cars is having your your your wheels

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.910 
cars is having your your your wheels
misaligned<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.420> also<00:00:28.080> your<00:00:28.380> tires<00:00:28.619> under

misaligned and also your tires under

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.250 
misaligned and also your tires under
inflated<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:30.179> there's<00:00:30.630> something<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:30.960> that

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
inflated but there's something that that

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.690

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.450 
mind a car that's a line will roll
straighter<00:02:00.539> and<00:02:00.630> bolt<00:02:01.020> easier<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:02.100> second

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
straighter and bolt easier the second

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.770 
straighter and bolt easier the second
thing<00:02:02.549> they<00:02:02.640> can<00:02:02.789> do<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.299> make<00:02:03.420> sure<00:02:03.570> that

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
thing they can do is to make sure that

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.160 
thing they can do is to make sure that
the<00:02:03.930> tires<00:02:04.229> are<00:02:04.500> properly<00:02:04.740> inflated<00:02:05.630> and<00:02:06.630> this

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
the tires are properly inflated and this

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.479 
the tires are properly inflated and this
is<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.409> fact<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.710> perhaps<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.160> lot<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
is the fact that perhaps a lot the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.160 
is the fact that perhaps a lot the
supers<00:02:08.759> don't<00:02:08.880> know<00:02:09.060> about<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.660> that<00:02:10.140> is

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
supers don't know about and that is

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.259 
supers don't know about and that is
tires<00:02:10.679> can<00:02:11.039> lose<00:02:11.220> between<00:02:11.640> one<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.090> four

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
tires can lose between one to four

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.630 
tires can lose between one to four
percent<00:02:12.630> of<00:02:12.690> its<00:02:12.810> air<00:02:12.989> volume<00:02:13.290> every<00:02:13.560> month<00:02:13.739> so

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
percent of its air volume every month so

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.370 
percent of its air volume every month so
in<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:15.000> given<00:02:15.120> year<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.630> could<00:02:15.780> be<00:02:15.959> losing

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
in a given year you could be losing

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.130 
in a given year you could be losing
quite<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:17.010> bit<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.310> air<00:02:17.459> in<00:02:17.640> your<00:02:17.760> tires<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:18.900> for

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
quite a bit of air in your tires so for

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.539 
quite a bit of air in your tires so for
example<00:02:19.410> if<00:02:19.470> you<00:02:19.560> lose<00:02:19.680> about<00:02:19.799> 20<00:02:20.069> percent<00:02:20.459> of

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
example if you lose about 20 percent of

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.009 
example if you lose about 20 percent of
the<00:02:20.640> air<00:02:20.790> volume<00:02:21.120> in<00:02:21.180> your<00:02:21.299> tire<00:02:21.510> that<00:02:21.870> will

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
the air volume in your tire that will

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.380 
the air volume in your tire that will
contribute<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.650> 4<00:02:23.340> percent<00:02:23.519> negative<00:02:24.150> to

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
contribute to 4 percent negative to

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.210 
contribute to 4 percent negative to
contribute<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:25.290> 4<00:02:25.530> percent<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.920> your<00:02:26.100> overall

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
contribute to 4 percent of your overall

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.880 
contribute to 4 percent of your overall
phillip<00:02:27.000> engine<00:02:27.239> so<00:02:27.450> that's<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.720> huge<00:02:27.870> number

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.780 

well<00:02:31.890> there<00:02:32.010> are<00:02:32.070> a<00:02:32.100> couple<00:02:32.220> trips<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.700> it

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
well there are a couple trips to it

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.210 
well there are a couple trips to it
number<00:02:33.630> one<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.650> have<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.860> make<00:02:34.890> sure<00:02:35.130> the

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
number one you have to make sure the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.780 
number one you have to make sure the
tires<00:02:35.430> are<00:02:35.640> cold<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:36.450> means<00:02:37.640> you've<00:02:38.640> been

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
tires are cold that means you've been

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.880 
tires are cold that means you've been
out<00:02:39.210> driving<00:02:39.510> around<00:02:39.720> make<00:02:40.230> sure<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.560> you're

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
out driving around make sure that you're

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.290 
out driving around make sure that you're
part<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.280> city<00:02:41.520> for<00:02:41.730> about<00:02:41.790> good<00:02:42.090> three<00:02:42.270> to

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
part of the city for about good three to

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.150 
part of the city for about good three to
four<00:02:42.570> hours<00:02:42.960> because<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.740> air<00:02:43.890> pressure

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
four hours because the air pressure

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.920 
four hours because the air pressure
varies<00:02:44.670> according<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.390> temperature<00:02:45.750> of

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
varies according to the temperature of

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.400 
varies according to the temperature of
the<00:02:46.020> car<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.440> tire<00:02:46.680> itself<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:48.050> use<00:02:49.050> something

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
the car the tire itself I use something

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.690 
the car the tire itself I use something
like<00:02:49.500> this<00:02:49.650> it's<00:02:50.130> something<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.520> you<00:02:50.580> could

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
like this it's something that you could

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.790 
like this it's something that you could
buy<00:02:50.940> at<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.210> local<00:02:51.660> car<00:02:51.990> park<00:02:52.200> store<00:02:52.440> for<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.650> buck

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
buy at a local car park store for a buck

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.680 
buy at a local car park store for a buck
or<00:02:52.950> two<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.610> this<00:02:53.880> gives<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.240> a<00:02:54.270> very<00:02:54.510> simple

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
or two and this gives you a very simple

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.900 
or two and this gives you a very simple
reading<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.560> where<00:02:55.890> your<00:02:56.070> tire<00:02:56.400> pressures<00:02:56.760> at

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
reading of where your tire pressures at

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.780 
reading of where your tire pressures at
on<00:02:57.150> a<00:02:57.180> monthly<00:02:57.420> basis
