00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.910 
actually is he had been buying up
everything<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.750> he<00:01:36.960> saw<00:01:37.200> for<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> while<00:01:37.680> and

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
everything that he saw for a while and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.530 
everything that he saw for a while and
then<00:01:38.040> one<00:01:38.190> day<00:01:38.340> he<00:01:38.370> realized<00:01:38.940> I<00:01:39.150> could<00:01:39.330> die

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
then one day he realized I could die

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.970 
then one day he realized I could die
tomorrow<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.350> will<00:01:40.500> all<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.680> been<00:01:40.860> a

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
tomorrow and this will all have been a

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.130 
tomorrow and this will all have been a
waste<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.340> time<00:01:41.400> effort<00:01:41.730> and<00:01:41.880> money<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.690> if<00:01:43.020> you

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
waste of time effort and money so if you

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.840 
waste of time effort and money so if you
can't<00:01:43.350> take<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.830> what's<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.670> point

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
can't take it with you what's the point

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.710 
can't take it with you what's the point
and<00:01:45.200> to<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.440> point<00:01:46.850> no<00:01:47.850> not<00:01:48.180> really<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.450> don't

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
and to that point no not really I don't

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.120 
and to that point no not really I don't
struggle<00:01:49.020> especially<00:01:49.590> not<00:01:49.680> anymore<00:01:49.979> because

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
struggle especially not anymore because

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.940 
struggle especially not anymore because
I<00:01:50.310> have<00:01:50.340> almost<00:01:50.850> everything<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.479> want<00:01:51.750> now<00:01:52.380> when

I was buying up a bunch of games I
really<00:01:55.110> didn't<00:01:55.290> struggle<00:01:55.470> with<00:01:55.710> then<00:01:55.860> either

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
really didn't struggle with then either

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.340 
really didn't struggle with then either
I<00:01:56.400> mean<00:01:56.820> there<00:01:57.030> were<00:01:57.150> a<00:01:57.180> few<00:01:57.479> purchases<00:01:57.780> here

and<00:01:58.470> there<00:01:58.650> that<00:01:59.190> I<00:01:59.250> probably<00:01:59.610> shouldn't<00:02:00.150> have

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
and there that I probably shouldn't have

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.990 
and there that I probably shouldn't have
made<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:01.080> for<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.290> most<00:02:01.440> part<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.950> didn't<00:02:02.790> buy

awesome<00:05:10.320> but<00:05:10.950> I<00:05:10.980> guess<00:05:11.070> doing<00:05:11.430> it<00:05:11.520> for<00:05:11.610> myself

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
awesome but I guess doing it for myself

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.300 
awesome but I guess doing it for myself
for<00:05:12.480> the<00:05:12.540> very<00:05:12.690> first<00:05:12.810> time<00:05:12.960> would<00:05:13.200> be<00:05:13.230> okay<00:05:13.560> or

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
for the very first time would be okay or

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.620 
for the very first time would be okay or
maybe<00:05:14.430> be<00:05:14.610> a<00:05:14.640> letdown<00:05:14.880> now<00:05:15.180> knowing<00:05:15.480> what<00:05:15.600> I

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
maybe be a letdown now knowing what I

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.000 
maybe be a letdown now knowing what I
know<00:05:15.830> anyway<00:05:16.830> question<00:05:17.820> number<00:05:17.880> four<00:05:18.600> if<00:05:19.260> you

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
know anyway question number four if you

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.130 
know anyway question number four if you
could<00:05:20.160> be<00:05:20.280> buried<00:05:20.640> with<00:05:20.790> one<00:05:20.970> console<00:05:21.450> what

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
could be buried with one console what

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.300 
could be buried with one console what
would<00:05:22.440> it<00:05:22.470> be<00:05:22.590> and<00:05:23.660> I<00:05:24.660> don't<00:05:25.410> know<00:05:25.530> after

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
would it be and I don't know after

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.210 
would it be and I don't know after
watching<00:05:26.940> his<00:05:27.270> video<00:05:27.540> what<00:05:28.200> he's<00:05:28.320> asking<00:05:28.740> is<00:05:28.920> I

watching his video what he's asking is I

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.460 
watching his video what he's asking is I
thank<00:05:29.670> the<00:05:29.910> crux<00:05:30.150> of<00:05:30.300> it<00:05:30.420> if<00:05:30.600> you<00:05:31.320> could<00:05:31.410> only

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
thank the crux of it if you could only

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.250 
thank the crux of it if you could only
have<00:05:32.010> one<00:05:32.520> video<00:05:32.850> game<00:05:33.090> system<00:05:33.510> on<00:05:33.750> a<00:05:33.780> deserted

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260

have one video game system on a deserted
island<00:05:34.350> or<00:05:35.010> whatever<00:05:35.850> what<00:05:36.450> would<00:05:36.600> it<00:05:36.690> be<00:05:36.720> or

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
island or whatever what would it be or

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.030 
island or whatever what would it be or
if<00:05:37.080> you<00:05:37.200> could<00:05:37.350> play<00:05:37.500> something<00:05:37.800> in<00:05:37.950> the

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
if you could play something in the

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.710 
if you could play something in the
afterlife<00:05:38.370> forever<00:05:38.970> what<00:05:39.240> would<00:05:39.360> it<00:05:39.450> be<00:05:39.480> and

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
afterlife forever what would it be and

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.650 
afterlife forever what would it be and
for<00:05:40.650> me<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:40.890> first<00:05:41.010> answer<00:05:41.580> would<00:05:41.760> be<00:05:41.790> PC<00:05:42.480> but

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
for me the first answer would be PC but

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.540 
for me the first answer would be PC but
if<00:05:42.780> you're<00:05:42.900> excluding<00:05:43.620> pcs<00:05:44.130> and<00:05:44.280> you're<00:05:44.430> only

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
if you're excluding pcs and you're only

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.690 
if you're excluding pcs and you're only
going<00:05:44.760> the<00:05:44.910> console<00:05:46.100> the<00:05:47.100> next<00:05:47.400> thing<00:05:47.520> would

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
going the console the next thing would

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.130 
going the console the next thing would
be<00:05:47.820> to<00:05:47.940> say<00:05:48.090> one<00:05:48.270> of<00:05:48.300> the<00:05:48.390> modern<00:05:48.750> consoles

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
be to say one of the modern consoles

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.630 
be to say one of the modern consoles
that<00:05:49.320> you<00:05:49.440> can<00:05:49.560> emulate<00:05:49.770> off<00:05:50.070> of<00:05:50.280> but<00:05:50.460> if<00:05:50.550> you

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
that you can emulate off of but if you

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.380 
that you can emulate off of but if you
exclude<00:05:51.680> software<00:05:52.680> emulation<00:05:53.360> then<00:05:54.360> I

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
exclude software emulation then I

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.080 
exclude software emulation then I
probably<00:05:54.810> go<00:05:55.020> with<00:05:55.170> the<00:05:55.320> Sega<00:05:55.560> Genesis

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
probably go with the Sega Genesis

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.400 
probably go with the Sega Genesis
because<00:05:57.090> you<00:05:57.330> can<00:05:57.480> play<00:05:57.630> the<00:05:57.660> Sega<00:05:57.960> Genesis
