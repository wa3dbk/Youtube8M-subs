00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
something you could do that but I

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.210 
something you could do that but I
probably<00:05:29.430> won't<00:05:29.669> do<00:05:29.880> that<00:05:30.060> unless<00:05:30.889> I<00:05:31.889> get<00:05:32.039> it

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
probably won't do that unless I get it

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.980 
probably won't do that unless I get it
stick<00:05:32.490> and<00:05:33.020> you<00:05:34.020> could<00:05:34.229> always

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
stick and you could always

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.110

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:33.510 
that I think it's that the weird code

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.930 
that I think it's that the weird code
but<00:07:34.050> I<00:07:34.080> think<00:07:34.320> it's<00:07:34.440> 0-9<00:07:35.070> I<00:07:35.100> have<00:07:35.490> I<00:07:35.730> got<00:07:35.910> that

but I think it's 0-9 I have I got that

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.630 
but I think it's 0-9 I have I got that
one<00:07:36.300> and<00:07:36.510> then<00:07:36.690> another<00:07:36.840> one<00:07:37.140> we<00:07:37.440> just<00:07:37.640> just

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:38.640
