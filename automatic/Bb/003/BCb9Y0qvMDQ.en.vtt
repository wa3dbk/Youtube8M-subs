when<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.870> begin<00:00:37.170> part<00:00:37.410> modeling<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.890> like<00:00:38.160> to

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
when I begin part modeling I like to

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.709 
when I begin part modeling I like to
look<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.640> biggest<00:00:38.850> or<00:00:39.210> most<00:00:39.239> pronounced

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
look for the biggest or most pronounced

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.479 
look for the biggest or most pronounced
feature<00:00:39.989> or<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.590> item<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.950> has<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.219> most

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
feature or the item that has the most

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.310 
feature or the item that has the most
things<00:00:41.730> attached<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.360> as<00:00:42.480> my<00:00:42.719> base<00:00:42.960> feature

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
things attached to it as my base feature

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.500 
things attached to it as my base feature
that<00:00:44.190> way<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.340> have<00:00:44.610> something<00:00:44.940> solid<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.360> can

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
that way I have something solid I can

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.930 
that way I have something solid I can
build<00:00:45.750> out<00:00:45.899> from<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.980> case<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.460> see<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.850> as

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
build out from in this case I see it as

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.250 
build out from in this case I see it as
being<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.300> cube<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.809> that's<00:00:48.960> where<00:00:49.140> we're

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
select a plane to sketch on now because

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.870 
select a plane to sketch on now because
this<00:01:12.869> part<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.290> over<00:01:13.530> all<00:01:13.830> fairly<00:01:14.189> symmetric

this part is over all fairly symmetric

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.390 
this part is over all fairly symmetric
I'm<00:01:15.060> going<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.450> draw<00:01:15.900> my<00:01:16.439> initial<00:01:16.860> rectangle

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
I'm going to draw my initial rectangle

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.789 
I'm going to draw my initial rectangle
in<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.790> specific<00:01:18.270> type<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.509> way<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.650> can

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
in a specific type of way so that we can

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.010 
in a specific type of way so that we can
leverage<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.130> origin<00:01:20.790> planes<00:01:21.060> as<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:21.659> model

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
leverage the origin planes as we model

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.080 
leverage the origin planes as we model

things throughout this chapter I'm going
to<00:01:24.150> start<00:01:24.330> with<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.509> rectangle<00:01:25.049> command<00:01:25.170> but

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
to start with the rectangle command but

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.289 
to start with the rectangle command but
i'm<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.159> select<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.549> specific<00:01:26.670> type<00:01:27.270> of

extrude it to a distance but before we
do<00:02:19.819> that<00:02:19.849> I<00:02:20.269> wanted<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:20.870> talk<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.080> little<00:02:21.319> bit

joined cut and intersect but because

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.360 
joined cut and intersect but because
it's<00:04:00.410> our<00:04:00.530> base<00:04:00.680> feature<00:04:00.980> we're<00:04:01.190> going<00:04:01.310> to

symmetric<00:04:06.019> part<00:04:06.230> and<00:04:06.470> we<00:04:06.560> use<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:06.889> Center
