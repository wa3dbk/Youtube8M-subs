00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.930
 when we talk about small details that make the difference 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.749
 we mean 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:14.749
 not only to prolixity punctuality 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:16.740
 prompt delivery 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.210
 but also 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.429
 to technique 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:21.560
 look for example 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.339
 more than one will find it strange to see how the network takes 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:26.919
 that to avoid 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.639
 that the birds alight is very hard you get 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:32.790
 how dirty it is 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.010
 and what if 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.010
 it is not a natural place of lodging 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.910
 when the place of banding is excluded 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.560
 they were going to bet on kan for a long time was going to keep messing the yard 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.400
 in this way 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.400
 it is entirely possible that this kuehl happen 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.010
 the work is left 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.700
 definitely terminal 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.880
 these little details are what make the difference 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.110
 between 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.760
 a bat an allen beginner without preparation without studies 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.280
 and a serious company like apothecary 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.640
 in the zone 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.640
 more inaccessible where normally the pythons 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.250
 I do not know how to place 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.840
 at a distance so close to each other as in places 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.460
 the main being more easily 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.200
 we always install 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.440
 Largest titans in spicy picasso 8 and 10 millimeters and double left over 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.470
 floor so 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.470
 the network cide well stuck look also 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.070
 kirk there is a surplus of network 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.780
 and not only that 2 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.100
 fuller ita 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.050
 this contribution from the 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.140
 what it does 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.050
 I would like impossible 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.010
 for the birds 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.120
 enter 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.640
 inside the place that has been closed we reach to give 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.330
 the 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.970
 completely 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.770
 the work is finished 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.770
 the pigeons to talk 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.429
 with this modality of venice 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:21.979
 please for more information 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:24.149
 make three double funds
