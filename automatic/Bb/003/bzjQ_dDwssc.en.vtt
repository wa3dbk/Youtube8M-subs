00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
extension really of the four defensive

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.240 
extension really of the four defensive
same<00:00:21.510> key<00:00:21.840> positions<00:00:22.350> from<00:00:22.919> the<00:00:23.070> four

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
defensive and then looking to extend

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.560 
defensive and then looking to extend
your<00:00:26.070> elbow<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.669> your<00:00:26.789> hands<00:00:27.150> through<00:00:27.480> the

your elbow and your hands through the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.100 
your elbow and your hands through the
ball<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:32.120> think<00:00:33.120> when<00:00:33.360> you've<00:00:33.540> picked<00:00:33.840> up<00:00:33.990> the

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
ball I think when you've picked up the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.990 
ball I think when you've picked up the
length<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.470> the<00:00:34.560> ball<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.340> decided<00:00:35.850> you

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
length of the ball and you decided you

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.310 
length of the ball and you decided you
want<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.270> commit<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.720> shot<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.079> look<00:00:37.170> the

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
want to commit to the shot and look the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.200 
want to commit to the shot and look the
score<00:00:37.590> four<00:00:37.739> runs<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.190> next<00:00:38.550> key<00:00:38.760> positions

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
score four runs the next key positions

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.610 
score four runs the next key positions
there<00:00:39.450> really<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.810> to<00:00:39.840> make<00:00:40.080> sure<00:00:40.260> your<00:00:40.410> head

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
there really is to make sure your head

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.710 
there really is to make sure your head
is<00:00:40.770> over<00:00:41.190> your<00:00:41.310> front<00:00:41.520> knee<00:00:41.580> so<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.570> can

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
is over your front knee so that you can

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.170 
is over your front knee so that you can
really<00:00:43.020> get<00:00:43.320> maximum<00:00:43.800> power<00:00:44.010> into<00:00:44.880> the<00:00:44.970> ball

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
really get maximum power into the ball

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.150 
really get maximum power into the ball
you<00:00:45.540> don't<00:00:45.840> want<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.110> be<00:00:46.230> playing<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:46.980> your

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
you don't want to be playing with your

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.980 
you don't want to be playing with your
head<00:00:47.610> sort<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.060> further<00:00:48.240> back<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:48.630> except<00:00:48.870> so

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
head sort of further back here except so

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.930 
head sort of further back here except so
C<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.380> go<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.580> air<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.880> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
C is going to go in the air and the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.670 
C is going to go in the air and the
amount<00:00:51.240> fielder's<00:00:51.990> you'll<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.260> there<00:00:52.500> it's

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
amount fielder's you'll have there it's

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.410 
amount fielder's you'll have there it's
going<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.830> give<00:00:53.010> an<00:00:53.100> opportunity<00:00:53.310> for<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.970> catch

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
going to give an opportunity for a catch

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.240 
going to give an opportunity for a catch
so<00:00:54.900> ideally<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.470> want<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.860> ball<00:00:56.010> right

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
so ideally you want that ball right

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.730 
so ideally you want that ball right
under<00:00:56.550> your<00:00:56.670> nose<00:00:57.060> a<00:00:57.420> real<00:00:57.960> good<00:00:58.200> bend<00:00:58.500> over

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:58.740 
under your nose a real good bend over

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.670 
under your nose a real good bend over
your<00:00:58.860> front<00:00:59.070> knee<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.520> then<00:01:00.440> you<00:01:01.440> know<00:01:01.560> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
your front knee and then you know the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.350 
your front knee and then you know the
elbow<00:01:02.040> really<00:01:02.250> follows<00:01:02.670> through<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.210> nice

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
elbow really follows through in a nice

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.740 
elbow really follows through in a nice
straight<00:01:03.720> line<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.970> ideally<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.540> probably

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
straight line the ideally is probably

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.050 
straight line the ideally is probably
like<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.049> keep<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> foot<00:01:10.560> nice<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.670> sidon<00:01:11.969> you

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
like to keep the foot nice and sidon you

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.830 
like to keep the foot nice and sidon you
don't<00:01:12.270> want<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.509> to<00:01:12.630> be<00:01:12.749> turning<00:01:14.509> the<00:01:15.509> finish

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
don't want it to be turning the finish

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.179 
don't want it to be turning the finish
of<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.049> shot<00:01:16.289> really<00:01:16.649> becomes<00:01:16.950> quite

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
of the shot really becomes quite

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.580 
of the shot really becomes quite
personal<00:01:17.670> for<00:01:18.090> me<00:01:18.119> generally<00:01:18.929> I<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.079> to<00:01:19.289> just

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
personal for me generally I like to just

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.590 
personal for me generally I like to just
finish<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.219> check<00:01:20.520> drive<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.119> know<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.420> lot

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
finish with a check drive I know a lot

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.300 
finish with a check drive I know a lot
of<00:01:21.689> other<00:01:21.840> guys<00:01:22.020> finish<00:01:22.590> with<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.799> back<00:01:23.009> going

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
of other guys finish with the back going

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.800 
of other guys finish with the back going
all<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.520> way<00:01:23.549> through<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.210> all<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.420> way<00:01:24.539> back

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
all the way through and all the way back

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.330 
all the way through and all the way back
over<00:01:24.840> their<00:01:25.170> left<00:01:25.350> shoulder<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.189> think

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
over their left shoulder but I think

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.590 
over their left shoulder but I think
that<00:01:26.429> becomes<00:01:26.579> a<00:01:26.729> very<00:01:26.759> personal<00:01:27.090> thing

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that becomes a very personal thing

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.809 
that becomes a very personal thing
reading<00:01:28.259> over<00:01:28.469> time<00:01:28.710> you'll<00:01:29.189> work<00:01:29.429> out<00:01:29.609> what

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
reading over time you'll work out what

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:31.340 
reading over time you'll work out what
really<00:01:29.999> works<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:30.359> you<00:01:30.569> but<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> key<00:01:31.319> message

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
really works for you but the key message

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.289 
really works for you but the key message
really<00:01:31.920> again<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.310> hitting<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.579> ball<00:01:32.789> right

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
really again is hitting the ball right

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.539 
really again is hitting the ball right
under<00:01:33.659> your<00:01:34.020> eye<00:01:34.079> line<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.950> making<00:01:35.130> sure<00:01:35.369> it's

under your eye line and making sure it's
nice<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.729> straight<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.749> finish<00:01:37.079> with

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
nice and straight and you finish with

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.129 
nice and straight and you finish with
the<00:01:37.799> bat<00:01:38.240> exactly<00:01:39.240> where<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.810> want<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.020> ball

to go

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.889 
to go
and<00:01:42.670> just<00:01:42.850> to<00:01:42.909> recap<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.540> three<00:01:43.750> most

and just to recap the three most
important<00:01:44.290> points<00:01:44.649> it's<00:01:45.460> an<00:01:45.549> extension<00:01:45.880> of

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
important points it's an extension of

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.510 
important points it's an extension of
the<00:01:46.210> four<00:01:46.450> defensive<00:01:46.990> make<00:01:47.979> sure<00:01:48.159> you<00:01:48.399> get
