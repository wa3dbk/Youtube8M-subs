 Hello everyone, Maxim is my phone. 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.920
 you could already see in our site and 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.900
 channel review sony xperia z3 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.790
 now it's time to talk about him 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.859
 small version xperia z3 compact 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.570
 sony company is almost the only 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.100
 pushing the mass of the idea of ​​compact 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.660
 flagship smartphones perfect 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.449
 complementing the larger line 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.800
 fellow and nothing inferior first 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.570
 pancake xperia z1 compact 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.029
 It was excellent proof of that 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.170
 good only he is equal to defects 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.390
 We will usually look at it with a new one. 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.430
 compact flagship sony xperia z3 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.520
 compact there are 4 color variations 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.079
 black white orange and turquoise hotel 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.059
 got an orange legand as you can 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.460
 see on the screen as opposed to the xperia z3 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.420
 there is no 7 that modification but the formation 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.850
 how is the same here 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.530
 on on how do you remember international peppers 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.210
 2 compacts have plastic back 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.660
 panel unlike the Japanese version with 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.280
 glass 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.770
 the plumage panel was sealed with protective 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.579
 film received a new smartphone completely 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.859
 glass case 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.329
 and also lost the film unfortunately a 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.160
 maybe luckily and metal frame 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.320
 gave way to unusual translucent 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.970
 Frames from an interesting polymer side 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.710
 no longer cold on such a fall 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.540
 the frame may be more successful 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.549
 shock absorber rather than metal frame 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.040
 and keep the glass in full growth and 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.450
 the preservation of this however excludes that 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.640
 that now it is easy to scratch and 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.710
 exposed to any hardships however on 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.390
 dough z3 compact secular flotation 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.490
 visible defects are not in front nor behind not 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.900
 Donata left for that and praise the salt 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.880
 so it is for the preservation of length and width 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.640
 there is one comp from for a new smartphone and 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.840
 tangible number and thickness and weight 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.460
 the result is stick compact 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.650
 much better and doesn't seem massive 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.240
 His most remarkable here is that they 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.700
 could almost fit the same body 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.520
 noticeably larger display 46 inches 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.350
 4 inches earlier solution has not changed 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.090
 picture quality is good but like 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.320
 xperia z and there is a noticeable 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.060
 cool dark to image 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.509
 correct and it can only balance 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.820
 white 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.930
 embrace us 8 can be seen perfectly besides 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.159
 screen contrast can 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.659
 adapt to lighting and 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.250
 practically efficiency and nobody and 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.710
 colors for better readability especially 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.299
 noticeable on dark shades arrangement 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.149
 controls and ports customary 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.799
 build quality of the smartphone at the height 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.090
 the capacity of the child is enough but to the calls 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.490
 only upper and lower sounds 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.110
 is conversational and only 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.759
 you protect me from water and dust 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.190
 similar xperia z3 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.230
 sign up 568 so you can swim with 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.090
 them fresh water to half a meter rank 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.959
 half an hour 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.580
 program plan smartphone completely 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.900
 similar to xperia z3 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.599
 so let's not stop at this 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.459
 detail wolf x moved led 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.510
 similar to such a command as a kind of a Kitkata 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.650
 the phone itself is based on version 444 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.080
 upgrade to android 500 and pop 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.790
 will take place first 15 thousand years all 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.209
 branded salt chips and application anywhere 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.620
 don't share 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.450
 they began to look time and and 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.040
 meet all google requirements 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.019
 Not without new chips 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.510
 this and the new high res sound settings 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.000
 audio or candle and the ability to build 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.430
 these 200 microphones and screencast recordings 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.319
 and ultra stamina mode and support 54 i 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.060
 am a plain is also much more about what you 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.620
 Could know this one here xperia z3 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.540
 as expected the quality 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.489
 received photos and videos from xperia z3 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.700
 The CD is completely analogous to xperia z and 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.890
 and 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.110
 the prize in front of us also you can 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.390
 see them on site compare between 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.989
 yourself and consider the pixels in your 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.150
 pleasure 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.950
 on some frames it can be noted only 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.940
 slightly better far detail 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.410
 you are ahead 3 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.870
 however, in most cases the differences 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.980
 minimal and not at all 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.380
 color rendition of the same conditions also 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.870
 equally the camera shoots quite well 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.820
 universally its mass foundation father with 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.890
 I see things worse as they did z3 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.920
 sony xperia z3 compact got chip 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.920
 snapdragon 801 acid version what xperia 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.930
 z3 what is there for 5 eggs given ungulates 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.440
 positive memory and adamenko graphics from 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.660
 thirty 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.190
 This xperia z or a novelty separates only 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.359
 one extra gigabyte operational 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.430
 memory and the older model 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:42.170
 However, it is impossible to say that xperia z3 is 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.150
 needs the phone running faster than 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.829
 elder brother yes what should be thanked 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.420
 hd screen resolution on the wall 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.220
 the operation of this is enough for a smooth

 minimum mark watches 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.560
 we can conclude that xperia z3 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.910
 compact is one of the most powerful and 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.130

 battery for 2600 milliampere hours with 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.940
 this is enough for an active day

 sony promises the same are now full lives 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.980
 a little less and lets you count 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.540
 rather a day and a half than 2 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.950
 when using the function will
