00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
example here's your truggy front tires

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.600 
example here's your truggy front tires
which<00:00:47.210> is<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:47.660> same<00:00:47.870> as<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.230> rears<00:00:48.610> these

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
which is the same as the rears these

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.819 
which is the same as the rears these
narrower<00:00:50.180> ones<00:00:50.510> fit<00:00:50.809> right<00:00:51.050> on<00:00:51.079> onto<00:00:51.739> the

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
narrower ones fit right on onto the

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.369 
narrower ones fit right on onto the
truggy<00:00:52.280> stop<00:00:52.610> application<00:00:53.480> as<00:00:53.780> you<00:00:53.989> can<00:00:54.140> see

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
truggy stop application as you can see

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.619 
truggy stop application as you can see
the<00:00:55.039> bull<00:00:55.250> doesn't<00:00:55.430> stick<00:00:55.820> out<00:00:56.000> of<00:00:56.059> another

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
the bull doesn't stick out of another

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.080 
the bull doesn't stick out of another
nothing<00:00:57.140> that<00:00:57.410> fit<00:00:57.620> right<00:00:57.829> in<00:00:58.070> you<00:00:58.879> get<00:00:59.059> a

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
nothing that fit right in you get a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.299 
nothing that fit right in you get a
little<00:00:59.359> wider<00:00:59.600> up<00:00:59.960> here<00:01:00.260> in<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.500> front<00:01:00.680> if<00:01:01.100> you

little wider up here in the front if you

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.819 
little wider up here in the front if you
would<00:01:01.460> have<00:01:01.699> the<00:01:02.660> truggy<00:01:02.989> wheel<00:01:03.260> on<00:01:03.559> for

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
would have the truggy wheel on for

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.830 
would have the truggy wheel on for
