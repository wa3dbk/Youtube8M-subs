hi<00:00:09.599> welcome<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:09.990> dart<00:00:10.230> University<00:00:10.800> we're

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
hi welcome to dart University we're

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.890 
hi welcome to dart University we're
going<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.130> talk<00:00:11.250> about<00:00:11.400> cam<00:00:11.820> timing<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.780> is

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
going to talk about cam timing this is

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.570 
going to talk about cam timing this is
going<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.080> make<00:00:13.200> sure<00:00:13.320> your<00:00:13.530> valve<00:00:13.769> train<00:00:14.160> is

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
going to make sure your valve train is

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.300 
going to make sure your valve train is
timed<00:00:15.000> correctly<00:00:15.269> it's<00:00:16.049> your<00:00:16.170> prank<00:00:16.470> one<00:00:17.160> it's

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
timed correctly it's your prank one it's

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.200 
timed correctly it's your prank one it's
going<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.460> make<00:00:17.609> sure<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.850> don't<00:00:17.970> hit<00:00:18.090> your

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
going to make sure you don't hit your

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.849 
going to make sure you don't hit your
valves<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.750> stuff<00:00:18.960> like<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.320> but<00:00:19.710> it's

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
valves and stuff like that but it's

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:20.540 
valves and stuff like that but it's
going<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.010> give<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> peak<00:00:20.430> performance

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
going to give you a peak performance

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.759 
going to give you a peak performance
because<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.270> camshaft<00:00:21.869> was<00:00:22.320> designed<00:00:22.680> to

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
because that camshaft was designed to

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.980 
because that camshaft was designed to
open<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.279> close<00:00:23.460> valve<00:00:23.760> at<00:00:24.210> very<00:00:24.600> precise

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
open and close valve at very precise

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.720 
open and close valve at very precise
times<00:00:25.380> that's<00:00:26.010> going<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.250> get<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.460> all<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
times that's going to get you all the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.849 
times that's going to get you all the
performance<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.480> you're<00:00:27.599> looking<00:00:27.900> for<00:00:28.109> now

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
performance that you're looking for now

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:29.870 
performance that you're looking for now
the<00:00:28.920> first<00:00:29.160> thing<00:00:29.220> I'm<00:00:29.310> going<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.519> do<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.699> find

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
the first thing I'm going to do is find

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.560 
the first thing I'm going to do is find
TDC<00:00:30.570> it's<00:00:31.230> pretty<00:00:31.500> simple<00:00:31.890> but<00:00:32.489> because<00:00:33.390> when

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
TDC it's pretty simple but because when

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.270 
TDC it's pretty simple but because when
this<00:00:33.690> crank<00:00:34.020> comes<00:00:34.260> up<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> piston<00:00:35.100> gets

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
this crank comes up and the piston gets

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.010 
this crank comes up and the piston gets
to<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> top<00:00:35.670> there's<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.540> little<00:00:36.809> bit<00:00:36.930> of

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
to the top there's a little bit of

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.170 
to the top there's a little bit of
wiggle<00:00:37.410> here<00:00:37.620> at<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.860> crank<00:00:38.129> pan<00:00:38.399> as<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:39.030> go

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
wiggle here at the crank pan as I go

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.869 
wiggle here at the crank pan as I go
from<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:39.719> under<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.559> over<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
from just under to just over so the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.000 
from just under to just over so the
easiest<00:00:42.180> way<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.420> find<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> exact<00:00:43.200> center<00:00:43.440> is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
easiest way to find the exact center is

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.970 
easiest way to find the exact center is
to<00:00:44.190> drop<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.550> piston<00:00:44.940> down<00:00:45.469> come<00:00:46.469> back<00:00:46.500> around

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
to drop the piston down come back around

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.010 
to drop the piston down come back around
drop<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.399> down<00:00:47.520> again<00:00:47.879> take<00:00:48.629> those<00:00:48.809> two

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
drop it down again take those two

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.569 
drop it down again take those two
readings<00:00:49.500> we're<00:00:49.920> going<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.129> divide<00:00:50.340> them<00:00:50.460> by

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
readings we're going to divide them by

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.090 
readings we're going to divide them by
two<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.149> right<00:00:51.690> smack<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.289> center<00:00:52.649> is

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
two and right smack on the center is

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.299 
two and right smack on the center is
true<00:00:53.550> TDC<00:00:54.210> right<00:00:54.809> down<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.199> degree<00:00:55.559> so

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
true TDC right down to the degree so

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.830 
true TDC right down to the degree so
I've<00:00:56.370> got<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.550> dial<00:00:56.820> indicator<00:00:56.910> sit<00:00:57.600> right<00:00:57.719> up

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
I've got a dial indicator sit right up

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.290 
I've got a dial indicator sit right up
on<00:00:57.930> our<00:00:58.020> piston<00:00:58.469> if<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.579> notice<00:00:59.910> we've<00:01:00.090> got<00:01:00.120> it

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
on our piston if you notice we've got it

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.270 
on our piston if you notice we've got it
right<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.570> center<00:01:00.780> line<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> piston<00:01:02.070> pin

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
right to center line with the piston pin

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.189 
right to center line with the piston pin
now<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.000> piston<00:01:03.420> will<00:01:03.449> rock<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.809> little<00:01:04.049> bit

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
now this piston will rock a little bit

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.859 
now this piston will rock a little bit
so<00:01:05.040> if<00:01:05.159> I'm<00:01:05.339> measuring<00:01:05.549> over<00:01:05.939> here<00:01:06.299> I'm<00:01:06.720> going

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
so if I'm measuring over here I'm going

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.240 
so if I'm measuring over here I'm going
to<00:01:06.960> get<00:01:07.049> some<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.350> rock<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.799> there<00:01:08.040> but

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
to get some of that rock in there but

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.980 
to get some of that rock in there but
right<00:01:08.640> smack<00:01:08.939> Center<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.540> best<00:01:09.720> place<00:01:09.960> to

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
right smack Center is the best place to

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.960 
right smack Center is the best place to
measure<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:11.040> I've<00:01:11.100> got<00:01:11.220> my<00:01:11.310> dial<00:01:11.549> indicator

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
measure so I've got my dial indicator

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.420 
measure so I've got my dial indicator
we've<00:01:12.540> got<00:01:12.689> my<00:01:12.810> degree<00:01:13.110> wheel<00:01:13.290> now<00:01:14.189> I'm<00:01:14.280> going

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
we've got my degree wheel now I'm going

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.030 
we've got my degree wheel now I'm going
to<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.640> my<00:01:15.360> let<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.630> piston<00:01:15.960> come<00:01:16.140> down<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:17.009> I

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
to do my let that piston come down so I

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.630 
to do my let that piston come down so I
look<00:01:17.220> about<00:01:17.430> mmm<00:01:18.299> twenty<00:01:19.340> thousand<00:01:20.340> one

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
look about mmm twenty thousand one

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.609 
look about mmm twenty thousand one
direction<00:01:21.119> I'll<00:01:21.600> look<00:01:21.720> at<00:01:21.869> my<00:01:21.900> degree<00:01:22.259> reading

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
direction I'll look at my degree reading

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.810 
direction I'll look at my degree reading
I'll<00:01:23.430> go<00:01:23.729> bum

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
I'll go bum

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.280 
I'll go bum
20<00:01:25.510> fell<00:01:26.730> the<00:01:27.730> other<00:01:27.880> way<00:01:28.150> look<00:01:28.780> at<00:01:28.900> my<00:01:28.990> degree

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
20 fell the other way look at my degree

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.740 
20 fell the other way look at my degree
reading<00:01:29.620> they<00:01:29.830> should<00:01:30.010> be<00:01:30.130> I<00:01:30.160> I<00:01:30.430> done<00:01:30.700> it<00:01:30.850> I<00:01:31.090> can

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
reading they should be I I done it I can

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.790 
reading they should be I I done it I can
adjust<00:01:32.020> my<00:01:32.140> wheel

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
adjust my wheel

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.780 
adjust my wheel
so<00:01:33.460> I'm<00:01:33.610> sinner<00:01:34.680> I'm<00:01:35.680> right<00:01:35.830> back<00:01:36.040> here<00:01:36.310> to

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
so I'm sinner I'm right back here to

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.260 
so I'm sinner I'm right back here to
zero

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
zero

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.990 
zero
now<00:01:37.690> I'm<00:01:37.870> zero<00:01:38.200> on<00:01:38.380> my<00:01:38.500> wheel<00:01:38.710> my<00:01:39.220> crank<00:01:39.550> is<00:01:39.700> set

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
now I'm zero on my wheel my crank is set

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000 
now I'm zero on my wheel my crank is set
I<00:01:40.240> know<00:01:40.480> where<00:01:40.750> I'm<00:01:40.870> at<00:01:41.050> now<00:01:41.290> I<00:01:41.620> can<00:01:41.680> come<00:01:41.980> over

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
I know where I'm at now I can come over

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.950 
I know where I'm at now I can come over
here<00:01:42.190> and<00:01:42.430> start<00:01:42.580> looking<00:01:42.760> at<00:01:42.970> the<00:01:43.090> can<00:01:43.330> so<00:01:43.930> I

here and start looking at the can so I

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.260 
here and start looking at the can so I
can<00:01:43.990> find<00:01:44.350> zero<00:01:44.950> on<00:01:45.130> my<00:01:45.250> cam<00:01:45.490> once<00:01:45.790> again<00:01:46.030> I<00:01:46.060> can

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
can find zero on my cam once again I can

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.450 
can find zero on my cam once again I can
find<00:01:46.420> my<00:01:46.540> centerline<00:01:46.870> I<00:01:47.230> find<00:01:48.190> a<00:01:48.250> camp

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
find my centerline I find a camp

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.430 
find my centerline I find a camp
centerline<00:01:48.850> same<00:01:49.360> kind<00:01:49.720> of<00:01:49.840> procedure<00:01:50.200> is

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
centerline same kind of procedure is

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.590 
centerline same kind of procedure is
getting<00:01:50.680> your<00:01:50.770> crank<00:01:51.040> TDC<00:01:51.550> you've<00:01:52.180> got<00:01:52.360> kind

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
getting your crank TDC you've got kind

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.810 
getting your crank TDC you've got kind
of<00:01:52.750> a<00:01:52.900> flat<00:01:53.230> area<00:01:53.260> per<00:01:53.830> se<00:01:54.010> on<00:01:54.160> top<00:01:54.370> of<00:01:54.490> your<00:01:54.580> cam

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
of a flat area per se on top of your cam

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.870 
of a flat area per se on top of your cam
so<00:01:55.570> if<00:01:55.990> you<00:01:56.110> watch<00:01:56.350> I'm<00:01:57.160> gonna<00:01:57.310> roll<00:01:57.580> right<00:01:57.820> up

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
so if you watch I'm gonna roll right up

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.830 
so if you watch I'm gonna roll right up
on<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.330> top<00:01:58.570> of<00:01:58.720> my<00:01:58.840> can<00:01:59.140> lift<00:02:00.450> right<00:02:01.450> about

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
on the top of my can lift right about

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.290 
on the top of my can lift right about
zero<00:02:02.380> there<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:03.310> I<00:02:03.430> can<00:02:03.580> keep<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:03.880> turning<00:02:04.180> my

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
zero there and I can keep the turning my

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.020 
zero there and I can keep the turning my
crank<00:02:04.660> and<00:02:04.930> I<00:02:05.860> had<00:02:06.040> quite<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.370> few<00:02:06.850> degrees

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
crank and I had quite a few degrees

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.730 
crank and I had quite a few degrees
there<00:02:07.570> where<00:02:08.200> I<00:02:08.229> didn't<00:02:08.410> have<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.560> lot<00:02:08.710> of

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
there where I didn't have a lot of

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.620 
there where I didn't have a lot of
motion<00:02:09.100> so<00:02:09.369> once<00:02:09.850> again<00:02:10.000> we're<00:02:10.330> gonna<00:02:10.479> go

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
motion so once again we're gonna go

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.010 
motion so once again we're gonna go
about<00:02:10.810> 50<00:02:11.290> thousandths<00:02:12.030> before<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.240> top<00:02:13.480> 50

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
about 50 thousandths before the top 50

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.990 
about 50 thousandths before the top 50
thousands<00:02:14.470> after<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.040> top<00:02:15.250> we're<00:02:15.820> going<00:02:15.940> to

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
thousands after the top we're going to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.490 
thousands after the top we're going to
take<00:02:16.150> those<00:02:16.270> two<00:02:16.510> numbers<00:02:16.540> add<00:02:17.140> them<00:02:17.350> together

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
take those two numbers add them together

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.330 
take those two numbers add them together
divide<00:02:18.070> by<00:02:18.250> two<00:02:18.520> so<00:02:19.140> I'm<00:02:20.140> going<00:02:20.290> to<00:02:20.320> keep<00:02:20.590> back

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
divide by two so I'm going to keep back

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
divide by two so I'm going to keep back
it<00:02:21.520> up<00:02:22.620> now<00:02:23.620> I'm<00:02:23.770> going<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:23.980> load<00:02:24.130> my<00:02:24.160> chain<00:02:24.580> I'm

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
it up now I'm going to load my chain I'm

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.060 
it up now I'm going to load my chain I'm
going<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.540> come<00:02:25.660> right<00:02:25.870> up<00:02:25.990> on<00:02:26.110> fifty<00:02:26.530> thousand

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
going to come right up on fifty thousand

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.949 
going to come right up on fifty thousand
four<00:02:27.580> that's<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.540> number<00:02:28.720> I'm<00:02:28.780> going<00:02:28.900> to

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
four that's the number I'm going to

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.220 
four that's the number I'm going to
write<00:02:29.110> down<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:30.880> can<00:02:31.030> keep<00:02:31.209> it<00:02:31.390> loaded<00:02:31.630> I've

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
write down and I can keep it loaded I've

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.900 
write down and I can keep it loaded I've
got<00:02:32.380> my<00:02:32.530> chain<00:02:32.800> loaded<00:02:33.250> cuz<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.489> directions

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
got my chain loaded cuz the directions

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.250 
got my chain loaded cuz the directions
crank<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:36.040> I'm<00:02:36.220> going<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.370> go<00:02:36.489> 50

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.199 

after<00:02:40.260> bank<00:02:41.220> those<00:02:41.430> are<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.610> two<00:02:41.760> numbers<00:02:42.060> are

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
after bank those are the two numbers are

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.690 
after bank those are the two numbers are
right<00:02:42.360> down<00:02:42.600> once<00:02:43.440> I've<00:02:43.620> divided<00:02:43.920> by<00:02:44.130> two<00:02:44.190> I

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
right down once I've divided by two I

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.340 
right down once I've divided by two I
know<00:02:44.970> exactly<00:02:45.300> where<00:02:45.540> my<00:02:45.600> centre<00:02:46.020> line<00:02:46.200> is

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
know exactly where my centre line is

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.890 
know exactly where my centre line is
that's<00:02:46.920> going<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.370> give<00:02:47.520> me<00:02:47.700> exactly<00:02:48.540> what<00:02:48.780> the

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
that's going to give me exactly what the

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.480 
that's going to give me exactly what the
can<00:02:49.170> was<00:02:49.380> engineered<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.860> do<00:02:49.980> with<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.220> crank

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
can was engineered to do with the crank

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.600 
can was engineered to do with the crank
now<00:02:51.209> if<00:02:51.330> that's<00:02:51.450> off<00:02:51.780> by<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.050> little<00:02:52.230> bit<00:02:52.610> we've

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
now if that's off by a little bit we've

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.820 
now if that's off by a little bit we've
got<00:02:53.819> different<00:02:54.030> types<00:02:54.240> of<00:02:54.630> crank<00:02:55.290> sprockets

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
got different types of crank sprockets

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.860 
got different types of crank sprockets
ham<00:02:56.100> sprockets<00:02:56.730> but<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.270> can<00:02:57.420> make<00:02:57.540> small

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
ham sprockets but I can make small

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.020 
ham sprockets but I can make small
adjustments<00:02:58.160> and<00:02:59.160> I<00:02:59.340> can<00:02:59.459> get<00:02:59.640> you<00:03:00.000> know

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
adjustments and I can get you know

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.210 
adjustments and I can get you know
degree<00:03:00.420> two<00:03:00.630> degrees<00:03:00.959> one<00:03:01.560> direction<00:03:02.010> or<00:03:02.100> the

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
degree two degrees one direction or the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.660 
degree two degrees one direction or the
other

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
other

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.610 
other
or<00:03:03.239> maybe<00:03:04.050> you<00:03:04.170> want<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.319> just<00:03:04.410> change

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
or maybe you want to just change

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.199 
or maybe you want to just change
characteristics<00:03:05.340> of<00:03:05.430> your<00:03:05.550> engine<00:03:05.850> you<00:03:06.120> want

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
characteristics of your engine you want

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.240 
characteristics of your engine you want
to<00:03:06.330> advance<00:03:06.660> or<00:03:06.989> retard<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.500> little<00:03:07.650> bit<00:03:07.860> you

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
to advance or retard it a little bit you

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.890 
to advance or retard it a little bit you
can<00:03:08.340> do<00:03:08.430> it<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.610> same<00:03:08.640> way<00:03:08.850> so<00:03:09.540> that's<00:03:09.720> how<00:03:09.840> you

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
can do it the same way so that's how you

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.540 
can do it the same way so that's how you
get<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.170> most<00:03:10.350> out<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.620> your<00:03:10.769> engine<00:03:10.950> make

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
get the most out of your engine make

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.620 
get the most out of your engine make
sure<00:03:11.700> it's<00:03:11.820> set<00:03:12.000> up<00:03:12.030> right<00:03:12.239> it's<00:03:13.019> dialed<00:03:13.380> in
