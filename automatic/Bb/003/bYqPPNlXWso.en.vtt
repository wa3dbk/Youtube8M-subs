00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
apply the polish to the design I mean

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.910 
apply the polish to the design I mean
you<00:02:17.330> don't<00:02:17.510> have<00:02:17.660> to<00:02:17.810> put<00:02:17.959> a<00:02:18.019> lot<00:02:18.290> on<00:02:18.349> there<00:02:18.739> but

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.900 
you want to make sure you put enough on
there<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.510> cover<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:22.190> design<00:02:22.550> when<00:02:22.819> you

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
there to cover the design when you

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.610 
there to cover the design when you
scrape<00:02:23.150> it<00:02:23.300> across<00:02:23.540> now<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:23.989> have<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.470> work

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
scrape it across now you have to work

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.380 
scrape it across now you have to work
quickly<00:02:24.650> with<00:02:25.160> this<00:02:25.310> because<00:02:25.519> most<00:02:25.790> polishes

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
quickly with this because most polishes

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.619 
quickly with this because most polishes
will<00:02:26.599> dry<00:02:26.870> very<00:02:27.410> quickly<00:02:28.000> stamp<00:02:29.000> down<00:02:29.209> on<00:02:29.450> it
