can use a pin display inside of After
Effects<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.769> make<00:00:10.920> certain<00:00:11.400> types<00:00:11.639> of

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
Effects to make certain types of

Effects to make certain types of
animations<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.450> lot<00:00:12.690> easier<00:00:13.230> you're<00:00:13.679> not<00:00:13.769> gonna

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
animations a lot easier you're not gonna

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.289 
animations a lot easier you're not gonna
have<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.130> use<00:00:14.250> keyframes<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.120> graph

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
have to use keyframes and the graph

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.490 
have to use keyframes and the graph
editor<00:00:15.480> very<00:00:15.839> much<00:00:15.990> you're<00:00:16.109> gonna<00:00:16.170> be<00:00:16.289> able<00:00:16.379> to

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
editor very much you're gonna be able to

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.500 
editor very much you're gonna be able to
act<00:00:16.740> out<00:00:17.039> your<00:00:17.100> movement<00:00:17.910> which<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.359> something

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
act out your movement which is something

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.210 
act out your movement which is something
you<00:00:18.660> can<00:00:18.779> only<00:00:18.960> do<00:00:19.260> on<00:00:19.470> something<00:00:19.680> very<00:00:19.890> cool

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
you can only do on something very cool

you can only do on something very cool
like<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:20.580> awesome<00:00:20.789> Cintiq<00:00:21.270> pen<00:00:21.420> display<00:00:21.720> so

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
like this awesome Cintiq pen display so

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.109 
like this awesome Cintiq pen display so
let's<00:00:22.199> jump<00:00:22.439> in<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.650> get<00:00:22.800> started<00:00:22.970> we've<00:00:23.970> got

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
let's jump in and get started we've got

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.970 
let's jump in and get started we've got
this<00:00:24.269> cool<00:00:24.510> little<00:00:24.810> paper<00:00:25.050> airplane<00:00:25.529> right

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
this cool little paper airplane right

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.769 
this cool little paper airplane right
here<00:00:26.160> it's<00:00:26.400> like<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.580> little<00:00:26.820> 3d<00:00:27.090> layer<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.720> I

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
here it's like a little 3d layer that I

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.929 
here it's like a little 3d layer that I
made<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.949> know<00:00:28.980> paper<00:00:29.279> airplanes<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
made and you know paper airplanes the

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.479 
made and you know paper airplanes the
way<00:00:30.150> they<00:00:30.390> move<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:31.019> very<00:00:31.439> particular<00:00:31.890> when

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
way they move is very particular when

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.100 
way they move is very particular when
they're<00:00:32.640> going<00:00:32.910> up<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.510> they're<00:00:33.780> fighting

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
they're going up and they're fighting

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.540 
they're going up and they're fighting
gravity<00:00:34.440> they're<00:00:34.590> slowing<00:00:34.890> down<00:00:35.070> when

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
gravity they're slowing down when

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.740 
gravity they're slowing down when
they're<00:00:35.700> falling<00:00:36.030> they're<00:00:36.450> going<00:00:36.570> with

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
they're falling they're going with

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.420 
they're falling they're going with
gravity<00:00:37.140> they're<00:00:37.260> speeding<00:00:37.620> up<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.010> they

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
gravity they're speeding up and they

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.270 
gravity they're speeding up and they
make<00:00:38.640> these<00:00:38.760> nice<00:00:39.000> arcing<00:00:39.690> movements<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.649> to

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
make these nice arcing movements and to

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.160 
make these nice arcing movements and to
actually<00:00:41.460> hand<00:00:42.059> animate<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.840> After

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
actually hand animate that in After

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.600 
actually hand animate that in After
Effects<00:00:43.410> using<00:00:43.739> keyframes<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.430> graph

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
Effects using keyframes and the graph

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.000 
Effects using keyframes and the graph
editor<00:00:44.789> can<00:00:45.149> be<00:00:45.180> very<00:00:45.420> tricky<00:00:45.719> what's<00:00:46.710> very

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
editor can be very tricky what's very

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.639 
editor can be very tricky what's very
cool<00:00:47.370> about<00:00:47.820> using<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.420> system<00:00:48.899> like<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.320> you

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
cool about using a system like this you

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.069 
cool about using a system like this you
can<00:00:49.829> actually<00:00:50.460> draw<00:00:50.910> directly<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.840> screen

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
can actually draw directly on the screen

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.080 
can actually draw directly on the screen
and<00:00:52.230> act<00:00:52.530> out<00:00:52.829> your<00:00:53.160> movements<00:00:53.730> all<00:00:53.850> right<00:00:53.969> so

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
and act out your movements all right so

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.310 
and act out your movements all right so
let<00:00:54.210> me<00:00:54.270> show<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.449> what<00:00:54.629> I'm<00:00:54.690> talking<00:00:54.989> about

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
let me show you what I'm talking about

let me show you what I'm talking about
I'm<00:00:55.530> gonna<00:00:55.680> go<00:00:55.860> into<00:00:56.250> or<00:00:57.149> just<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.660> solid<00:00:58.079> layer

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
I'm gonna go into or just a solid layer

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.380 
I'm gonna go into or just a solid layer
and<00:00:58.590> I'm<00:00:58.980> gonna<00:00:59.070> grab<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.489> paintbrush<00:00:59.820> and

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
and I'm gonna grab the paintbrush and

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.689 
and I'm gonna grab the paintbrush and
all<00:01:00.660> I'm<00:01:00.780> gonna<00:01:00.870> do<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.289> draw<00:01:01.620> myself<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.309> motion

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
all I'm gonna do is draw myself a motion

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.189 
all I'm gonna do is draw myself a motion
path<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.180> think<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.480> looks<00:01:03.629> nice<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:03.899> I

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
path that I think it looks nice and I

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.810 
path that I think it looks nice and I
can<00:01:04.350> use<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.589> as<00:01:04.680> reference<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.519> I'm<00:01:05.700> just

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
can use it as reference so I'm just

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.520 
can use it as reference so I'm just
gonna<00:01:05.909> have<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.360> playing<00:01:06.689> conference<00:01:07.229> we've

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
gonna have the playing conference we've

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.370 
gonna have the playing conference we've
been<00:01:08.119> DIPP<00:01:09.119> maybe<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.570> do<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> loop<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.260> then

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
been DIPP maybe you do a loop and then

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.500 
been DIPP maybe you do a loop and then
fall<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.040> okay<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:12.299> see<00:01:12.450> how

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
fall like that okay so you see how

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.000 
fall like that okay so you see how
smooth<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.470> I've<00:01:13.560> got<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.830> nice

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
smooth it is and I've got this nice

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.469 
smooth it is and I've got this nice
reference<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.729> was<00:01:14.880> very<00:01:14.909> easy<00:01:15.270> and

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
reference and that was very easy and

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.200 
reference and that was very easy and
quick<00:01:15.710> one<00:01:16.710> note<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.100> need<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.340> make<00:01:17.490> sure<00:01:17.700> you

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
quick one note you need to make sure you

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.679 
quick one note you need to make sure you
check<00:01:18.479> paint<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.140> transparent<00:01:19.950> okay<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.630> this

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
check paint on transparent okay and this

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.270 
check paint on transparent okay and this
is<00:01:21.840> gonna<00:01:21.990> let<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.229> see<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.619> motion<00:01:22.920> path

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
is gonna let you see this motion path

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.640 
is gonna let you see this motion path
while<00:01:24.000> you're<00:01:24.180> actually<00:01:24.720> animating<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
while you're actually animating the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.560 
while you're actually animating the
airplane<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.909> next<00:01:27.060> thing<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.299> need<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.479> do

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
airplane so the next thing we need to do

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.179 
airplane so the next thing we need to do
is<00:01:27.659> go<00:01:27.750> back<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.990> our<00:01:28.110> composition<00:01:28.439> I'm<00:01:29.009> gonna

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
is go back to our composition I'm gonna

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.499 
is go back to our composition I'm gonna
turn<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> airplane<00:01:29.640> off<00:01:29.939> for<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> minute<00:01:30.240> and

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
turn the airplane off for a minute and

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.999 
turn the airplane off for a minute and
we're<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:30.780> actually<00:01:31.110> going<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.740> put

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
we're not actually going to put

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.980 
we're not actually going to put
keyframes<00:01:32.579> on<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.000> airplane<00:01:33.329> we're<00:01:33.869> gonna

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
keyframes on the airplane we're gonna

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.600 
keyframes on the airplane we're gonna
put<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.229> keyframes<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.890> null<00:01:35.189> object

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
put the keyframes on this null object

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.640 
put the keyframes on this null object
here<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.720> good<00:01:37.020> habit<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.409> get<00:01:37.590> into

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
here it's just a good habit to get into

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.370 
here it's just a good habit to get into
use<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.400> null<00:01:38.579> object<00:01:38.610> because<00:01:39.270> then<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:40.200> can

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
use the null object because then you can

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.950 
use the null object because then you can
have<00:01:40.530> an<00:01:40.650> extra<00:01:41.040> layer<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.400> control<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.420> top<00:01:42.720> of

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
have an extra layer of control on top of

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.569 
have an extra layer of control on top of
what<00:01:43.409> you're<00:01:43.560> doing<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.159> know<00:01:44.189> with<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
what you're doing you know with the

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.490 
what you're doing you know with the
motion<00:01:44.880> path<00:01:45.060> all<00:01:45.659> right<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.140> I'm<00:01:46.200> gonna<00:01:46.290> line

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
motion path all right so I'm gonna line

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.160 
motion path all right so I'm gonna line
this<00:01:46.680> null<00:01:46.950> up<00:01:47.220> here<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:48.149> like<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.509> and

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
this null up here just like that and

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.499 
this null up here just like that and
we're<00:01:49.290> going<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.439> use<00:01:49.740> an<00:01:49.920> old<00:01:50.610> tool<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.210> After

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
we're going to use an old tool in After

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.420 
we're going to use an old tool in After
Effects<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:52.320> dates<00:01:52.530> back<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.070> early

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
Effects this dates back to the early

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.819 
Effects this dates back to the early
days<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.509> called<00:01:54.689> motion<00:01:54.899> sketch<00:01:55.320> it's

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
days and it's called motion sketch it's

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.020 
days and it's called motion sketch it's
one<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.070> these<00:01:56.159> features<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.670> doesn't

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
one of these features that doesn't

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.700 
one of these features that doesn't
really<00:01:57.180> get<00:01:57.329> used<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.659> lot<00:01:57.780> anymore<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.290> I

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
really get used a lot anymore and I

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.740 
really get used a lot anymore and I
think<00:01:58.770> that's<00:01:59.040> probably<00:01:59.280> because<00:01:59.670> if<00:02:00.570> you

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
think that's probably because if you

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.300 
think that's probably because if you
don't<00:02:01.049> have<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> touchscreen<00:02:01.649> system<00:02:02.189> like

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
don't have a touchscreen system like

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.910 
don't have a touchscreen system like
this<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.759> not<00:02:02.969> all<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.299> useful<00:02:03.799> you<00:02:04.799> know

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
this it's not all that useful you know

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.499 
this it's not all that useful you know
as<00:02:05.040> animator<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.790> one<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.090> things<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.479> I

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
as animator is one of the things that I

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.930 
as animator is one of the things that I
would<00:02:06.899> always<00:02:07.079> tell<00:02:07.320> my<00:02:07.380> students<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.009> act<00:02:08.310> out

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
would always tell my students is act out

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.779 
would always tell my students is act out
the<00:02:09.119> movements<00:02:09.539> with

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
the movements with

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:10.919 
the movements with
your<00:02:09.909> hand<00:02:10.179> and<00:02:10.539> when<00:02:10.659> you<00:02:10.750> have<00:02:10.899> a

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
your hand and when you have a

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.690 
your hand and when you have a
touchscreen<00:02:11.200> you<00:02:11.590> can<00:02:11.620> literally<00:02:12.040> draw<00:02:12.640> the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
touchscreen you can literally draw the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.250 
touchscreen you can literally draw the
movement<00:02:13.209> with<00:02:13.360> your<00:02:13.390> hand<00:02:13.689> which<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:13.900> awesome

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
movement with your hand which is awesome

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.170 
movement with your hand which is awesome
so<00:02:14.799> I'm<00:02:14.980> gonna<00:02:15.129> leave<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.459> settings<00:02:15.819> as<00:02:15.939> they

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
so I'm gonna leave the settings as they

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.240 
so I'm gonna leave the settings as they
are<00:02:16.209> smoothing<00:02:16.840> at<00:02:16.959> zero<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.890> I'm<00:02:18.040> gonna<00:02:18.129> to

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
are smoothing at zero and I'm gonna to

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.910 
are smoothing at zero and I'm gonna to
start<00:02:18.459> capture<00:02:18.849> and<00:02:19.030> I'm<00:02:19.599> gonna<00:02:19.810> put<00:02:20.200> this<00:02:20.620> pen

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
start capture and I'm gonna put this pen

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.500 
start capture and I'm gonna put this pen
down<00:02:21.129> and<00:02:21.189> I'm<00:02:21.519> gonna<00:02:21.640> draw<00:02:21.879> this<00:02:22.000> motion<00:02:22.359> path

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
down and I'm gonna draw this motion path

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.360 
down and I'm gonna draw this motion path
and<00:02:22.719> it's<00:02:22.840> gonna<00:02:22.959> record<00:02:23.349> in<00:02:23.590> real<00:02:23.769> time<00:02:24.010> every

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
and it's gonna record in real time every

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.640 
and it's gonna record in real time every
frame<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:27.459> there<00:02:28.209> you<00:02:28.329> go<00:02:28.420> okay<00:02:28.989> now<00:02:29.170> you'll

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
frame and there you go okay now you'll

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.199 
frame and there you go okay now you'll
notice<00:02:29.950> there's<00:02:30.159> a<00:02:30.220> key<00:02:30.400> there's<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.879> keyframe

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
notice there's a key there's a keyframe

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.720 
notice there's a key there's a keyframe
on<00:02:31.299> every<00:02:31.720> single<00:02:32.049> frame<00:02:32.319> and<00:02:32.680> one<00:02:33.519> of<00:02:33.640> the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
on every single frame and one of the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.149 
on every single frame and one of the
downsides<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.540> this<00:02:34.659> is<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:35.049> can<00:02:35.349> tend<00:02:35.769> to<00:02:35.889> make

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
downsides of this is it can tend to make

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.550 
downsides of this is it can tend to make
things<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.670> little<00:02:36.939> bit<00:02:37.420> tricky<00:02:38.049> so<00:02:38.409> what<00:02:38.530> I

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
things a little bit tricky so what I

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.119 
things a little bit tricky so what I
need<00:02:38.739> to<00:02:38.829> do<00:02:38.920> is<00:02:39.040> position<00:02:39.219> my<00:02:39.879> airplane<00:02:41.129> right

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
need to do is position my airplane right

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:44.759 
need to do is position my airplane right
on<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:42.400> null<00:02:42.639> and<00:02:43.349> now<00:02:44.349> I'm<00:02:44.439> gonna<00:02:44.560> Ram

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
on that null and now I'm gonna Ram

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.770 
on that null and now I'm gonna Ram
preview<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.739> right<00:02:48.340> off<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.519> bat<00:02:48.780> it's

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
preview and right off the bat it's

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.629 
preview and right off the bat it's
working<00:02:50.260> pretty<00:02:50.470> well<00:02:50.620> but<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.099> probably<00:02:51.430> are

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
working pretty well but you probably are

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.509 
working pretty well but you probably are
noticing<00:02:52.120> some<00:02:52.299> hitches<00:02:52.750> in<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.169> movement<00:02:53.620> so

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
noticing some hitches in the movement so

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.309 
noticing some hitches in the movement so
this<00:02:54.819> is<00:02:54.939> because<00:02:55.239> we<00:02:55.389> had<00:02:55.510> smoothing<00:02:55.989> at<00:02:56.079> zero

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
this is because we had smoothing at zero

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.960 
this is because we had smoothing at zero
we<00:02:56.530> were<00:02:56.590> literally<00:02:57.069> adding<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.489> keyframe<00:02:57.790> on

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
we were literally adding a keyframe on

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.429 
we were literally adding a keyframe on
every<00:02:58.419> single<00:02:58.750> frame<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.049> if<00:02:59.109> you<00:02:59.169> look<00:02:59.319> at

00:02:59.429 --> 00:02:59.439 
every single frame and if you look at

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:01.470 
every single frame and if you look at
the<00:02:59.560> motion<00:02:59.919> graph<00:03:00.129> you<00:03:00.730> know<00:03:00.819> if<00:03:00.879> you<00:03:01.000> zoom<00:03:01.269> in

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
the motion graph you know if you zoom in

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.149 
the motion graph you know if you zoom in
really<00:03:01.900> closely<00:03:02.379> here<00:03:02.680> you're<00:03:02.799> gonna<00:03:02.919> see<00:03:02.980> a

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 
really closely here you're gonna see a

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.670 
really closely here you're gonna see a
lot<00:03:03.430> of<00:03:03.459> little<00:03:04.120> jumps<00:03:04.780> in<00:03:04.959> the<00:03:05.049> movement<00:03:05.470> okay

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
lot of little jumps in the movement okay

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.399 
lot of little jumps in the movement okay
so<00:03:06.159> we<00:03:06.310> want<00:03:06.519> less<00:03:06.730> keyframes<00:03:07.299> ideally<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.379> a

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
so we want less keyframes ideally so a

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:09.839 
so we want less keyframes ideally so a
great<00:03:08.769> way<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:08.980> do<00:03:09.189> that<00:03:09.220> let's<00:03:09.489> go<00:03:09.609> back<00:03:09.639> to

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
great way to do that let's go back to

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:10.949 
great way to do that let's go back to
the<00:03:09.939> first<00:03:10.150> frame<00:03:10.299> here<00:03:10.540> let's<00:03:10.750> turn<00:03:10.900> the

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
the first frame here let's turn the

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.960 
the first frame here let's turn the
airplane<00:03:11.109> off<00:03:11.470> we're<00:03:12.340> gonna<00:03:12.400> turn<00:03:12.700> up<00:03:12.849> the

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
airplane off we're gonna turn up the

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.000 
airplane off we're gonna turn up the
smoothing<00:03:13.419> setting<00:03:13.780> on<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.500> motion<00:03:14.799> sketch

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
smoothing setting on the motion sketch

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.580 
smoothing setting on the motion sketch
and<00:03:15.609> I'm<00:03:15.669> going<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:15.819> turn<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.060> five<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:17.470> what

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
and I'm going to turn to five and what

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.349 
and I'm going to turn to five and what
this<00:03:17.680> is<00:03:17.829> gonna<00:03:17.919> do<00:03:18.250> is<00:03:18.459> it's<00:03:18.579> gonna<00:03:18.669> sort<00:03:19.299> of

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
this is gonna do is it's gonna sort of

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.210 
this is gonna do is it's gonna sort of
average<00:03:19.780> out<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.109> movement<00:03:20.349> and<00:03:20.739> give<00:03:21.069> me

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
average out the movement and give me

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.439 
average out the movement and give me
less<00:03:21.400> keyframes<00:03:21.819> in<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.060> end<00:03:22.209> so<00:03:22.299> I'm<00:03:22.359> gonna

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:22.449 
less keyframes in the end so I'm gonna

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:24.180 
less keyframes in the end so I'm gonna
hit<00:03:22.569> star<00:03:22.810> catcher<00:03:23.019> I'm<00:03:23.650> gonna<00:03:23.829> do<00:03:23.889> the<00:03:24.010> same

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
hit star catcher I'm gonna do the same

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.719 
hit star catcher I'm gonna do the same
movement<00:03:29.069> and<00:03:30.069> there<00:03:30.190> we<00:03:30.280> go<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:30.519> you<00:03:30.549> can<00:03:30.699> see

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:30.729 
movement and there we go and you can see

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:33.240 
movement and there we go and you can see
now<00:03:31.030> you<00:03:31.810> have<00:03:31.930> less<00:03:32.199> keyframes<00:03:32.799> now<00:03:33.069> I<00:03:33.099> was<00:03:33.220> a

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
now you have less keyframes now I was a

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.219 
now you have less keyframes now I was a
little<00:03:33.489> sloppier<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:34.329> time<00:03:34.569> with<00:03:34.720> my<00:03:34.750> motion

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:35.229 
little sloppier that time with my motion

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:37.500 
little sloppier that time with my motion
path<00:03:35.379> so<00:03:35.560> another<00:03:35.889> cool<00:03:36.099> thing<00:03:36.159> because<00:03:37.120> this

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
path so another cool thing because this

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.420 
path so another cool thing because this
is<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.720> touch<00:03:38.109> screen<00:03:38.139> I<00:03:38.530> can<00:03:38.829> literally<00:03:39.099> just

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
is a touch screen I can literally just

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.250 
is a touch screen I can literally just
manipulate<00:03:40.299> it<00:03:40.419> just<00:03:40.449> like<00:03:40.720> this<00:03:40.900> it's<00:03:41.139> almost

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
manipulate it just like this it's almost

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.780 
manipulate it just like this it's almost
like<00:03:41.530> playing<00:03:41.739> with<00:03:41.979> play-doh<00:03:42.220> or<00:03:42.489> something

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
like playing with play-doh or something

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.159 
like playing with play-doh or something
it's<00:03:42.879> really<00:03:42.909> kind<00:03:43.209> of<00:03:43.269> fun<00:03:43.449> and<00:03:43.690> if<00:03:43.930> I<00:03:44.019> need

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
it's really kind of fun and if I need

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:45.869 
it's really kind of fun and if I need
the<00:03:44.260> precision<00:03:44.709> I<00:03:44.799> can<00:03:44.979> always<00:03:45.159> go<00:03:45.459> in<00:03:45.639> with

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
the precision I can always go in with

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.960 
the precision I can always go in with
the<00:03:46.000> pen<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.900> get<00:03:47.470> really<00:03:47.949> really<00:03:48.519> precise

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
the pen and get really really precise

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.270 
the pen and get really really precise
just<00:03:49.389> like<00:03:49.510> that<00:03:49.659> alright<00:03:50.500> so<00:03:50.889> now<00:03:51.010> let's<00:03:51.040> look

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
just like that alright so now let's look

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.379 
just like that alright so now let's look
at<00:03:51.370> what<00:03:51.519> we<00:03:51.609> have<00:03:51.729> let's<00:03:51.879> swing<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.120> airplane

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:52.389 
at what we have let's swing the airplane

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:57.030 
at what we have let's swing the airplane
back<00:03:52.569> on<00:03:52.859> let's<00:03:53.859> Ram<00:03:54.040> preview<00:03:55.500> right<00:03:56.500> much

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
back on let's Ram preview right much

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.039 
back on let's Ram preview right much
much<00:03:57.549> smoother<00:03:58.030> and<00:03:58.060> now<00:03:58.449> the<00:03:58.510> great<00:03:58.870> thing

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
much smoother and now the great thing

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.990 
much smoother and now the great thing
about<00:03:59.079> this<00:03:59.409> also<00:03:59.709> because<00:04:00.609> there's<00:04:00.819> less

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
about this also because there's less

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.580 
about this also because there's less
keyframes<00:04:01.479> it's<00:04:01.689> gonna<00:04:01.780> be<00:04:01.959> really<00:04:02.169> easy<00:04:02.290> to

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
keyframes it's gonna be really easy to

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.339 
keyframes it's gonna be really easy to
go<00:04:02.889> in<00:04:03.099> and<00:04:03.430> actually<00:04:03.939> tweak<00:04:04.479> any<00:04:04.720> hard<00:04:05.199> edges

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
go in and actually tweak any hard edges

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.319 
go in and actually tweak any hard edges
so<00:04:05.680> like<00:04:05.859> right<00:04:06.069> here<00:04:06.400> there's<00:04:06.609> a<00:04:06.669> little<00:04:07.150> bit

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
so like right here there's a little bit

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.809 
so like right here there's a little bit
of<00:04:07.540> a<00:04:08.290> corner<00:04:08.739> happening<00:04:09.250> on<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.519> motion

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
of a corner happening on the motion

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.330 
of a corner happening on the motion
graph<00:04:10.000> right<00:04:10.500> so<00:04:11.500> typically<00:04:12.040> when<00:04:12.250> you're

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
graph right so typically when you're

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.890 
graph right so typically when you're
animating<00:04:12.669> in<00:04:12.879> After<00:04:13.120> Effects<00:04:13.329> this<00:04:13.569> is<00:04:13.750> what

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
animating in After Effects this is what

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.089 
animating in After Effects this is what
you're<00:04:14.019> looking<00:04:14.349> at<00:04:14.439> alright<00:04:14.709> and<00:04:14.859> this<00:04:14.919> is

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
you're looking at alright and this is

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:16.949 
you're looking at alright and this is
called<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.400> value<00:04:15.790> graph<00:04:16.000> editor<00:04:16.209> this<00:04:16.599> red

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
called the value graph editor this red

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.670 
called the value graph editor this red
line<00:04:17.289> is<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:18.190> value<00:04:18.219> of<00:04:18.639> the<00:04:19.239> X

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
line is the value of the X

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.099 
line is the value of the X
position<00:04:20.130> of<00:04:20.220> this<00:04:20.370> airplane<00:04:20.669> and<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.780> Green

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
position of this airplane and the Green

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.990 
position of this airplane and the Green
Line<00:04:22.139> is<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.830> Y<00:04:23.160> position<00:04:23.460> of<00:04:23.789> the<00:04:23.850> airplane

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
Line is the Y position of the airplane

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.939 
Line is the Y position of the airplane
and<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:24.449> can<00:04:24.600> see<00:04:24.780> that<00:04:25.020> sometimes<00:04:25.770> they

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
and you can see that sometimes they

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.460 
and you can see that sometimes they
converge<00:04:26.310> sometimes<00:04:26.820> they<00:04:26.970> go<00:04:27.120> apart<00:04:27.470> and

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
converge sometimes they go apart and

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.409 
converge sometimes they go apart and
it's<00:04:28.740> it's<00:04:28.949> very<00:04:29.039> tricky<00:04:29.490> and<00:04:29.669> it<00:04:30.150> takes<00:04:30.330> a

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
it's it's very tricky and it takes a

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:31.969 
it's it's very tricky and it takes a
while<00:04:30.449> to<00:04:30.630> get<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:30.990> hang<00:04:31.199> of<00:04:31.320> manipulating

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
while to get the hang of manipulating

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:33.610 
while to get the hang of manipulating
these<00:04:32.070> curves<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.520> get<00:04:32.699> a<00:04:32.729> movement<00:04:33.030> like<00:04:33.360> this

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
these curves to get a movement like this

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.350 
these curves to get a movement like this
you're<00:04:34.620> probably<00:04:34.800> also<00:04:35.100> familiar<00:04:35.580> with<00:04:35.610> the

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
you're probably also familiar with the

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.350 
you're probably also familiar with the
dreaded<00:04:36.840> speed<00:04:37.229> graph<00:04:37.530> right<00:04:37.910> but<00:04:38.910> this<00:04:39.120> is

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
dreaded speed graph right but this is

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.909 
dreaded speed graph right but this is
typically<00:04:39.840> what<00:04:40.080> you<00:04:40.199> would<00:04:40.289> use<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.740> do<00:04:40.889> a

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
typically what you would use to do a

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.550 
typically what you would use to do a
very<00:04:41.190> curvy<00:04:41.699> movement<00:04:42.330> like<00:04:42.449> this<00:04:42.660> and<00:04:42.900> you

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
very curvy movement like this and you

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.320 
very curvy movement like this and you
know<00:04:43.680> if<00:04:43.889> you<00:04:44.070> need<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.460> after<00:04:44.729> drawing<00:04:45.150> this

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
know if you need to after drawing this

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.029 
know if you need to after drawing this
you<00:04:45.509> can<00:04:45.660> still<00:04:45.900> go<00:04:46.110> in<00:04:46.289> and<00:04:46.530> you<00:04:46.620> can<00:04:46.770> still

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
you can still go in and you can still

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.029 
you can still go in and you can still
manipulate<00:04:47.340> all<00:04:48.300> of<00:04:48.660> these<00:04:48.810> points<00:04:49.050> to<00:04:49.770> try

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
manipulate all of these points to try

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:52.760 
manipulate all of these points to try
and<00:04:50.190> smooth<00:04:50.550> out<00:04:50.729> your<00:04:50.970> motion<00:04:51.389> and<00:04:51.680> you<00:04:52.680> know

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
and smooth out your motion and you know

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.200 
and smooth out your motion and you know
this<00:04:52.919> is<00:04:53.070> where<00:04:53.220> having<00:04:53.400> a<00:04:53.550> little<00:04:53.970> bit<00:04:54.090> of

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
this is where having a little bit of

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.850 
this is where having a little bit of
animation<00:04:54.570> know<00:04:54.900> how<00:04:55.050> inside<00:04:55.440> of<00:04:55.590> After

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
animation know how inside of After

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.070 
animation know how inside of After
Effects<00:04:56.039> is<00:04:56.160> helpful<00:04:56.580> but<00:04:57.030> to<00:04:57.300> get<00:04:57.509> basically

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
Effects is helpful but to get basically

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.529 
Effects is helpful but to get basically
a<00:04:58.410> good<00:04:58.830> starting<00:04:59.250> point<00:04:59.460> takes<00:04:59.789> no<00:05:00.090> time<00:05:00.479> at

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
a good starting point takes no time at

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:01.100 
a good starting point takes no time at
all

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
all

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.110 
all
but<00:05:01.470> I<00:05:01.500> can<00:05:01.860> use<00:05:02.130> it<00:05:02.160> to<00:05:02.550> smooth<00:05:02.910> out<00:05:03.060> the

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
but I can use it to smooth out the

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.730 
but I can use it to smooth out the
motion<00:05:03.270> a<00:05:03.599> little<00:05:03.810> bit<00:05:03.930> I<00:05:04.110> can<00:05:04.470> select

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
motion a little bit I can select

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.249 
motion a little bit I can select
keyframes<00:05:05.280> and<00:05:06.150> I<00:05:06.240> can<00:05:06.419> auto<00:05:06.599> bezzie<00:05:07.020> a<00:05:07.050> them

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
keyframes and I can auto bezzie a them

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:08.839 
keyframes and I can auto bezzie a them
and<00:05:07.470> it'll<00:05:07.680> just<00:05:07.830> smooth<00:05:08.130> things<00:05:08.370> out<00:05:08.490> just<00:05:08.550> a

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
and it'll just smooth things out just a

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:10.670 
and it'll just smooth things out just a
little<00:05:09.090> bit<00:05:09.210> it's<00:05:09.720> always<00:05:09.960> good<00:05:10.139> to<00:05:10.169> take<00:05:10.620> a

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
little bit it's always good to take a

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.529 
little bit it's always good to take a
second<00:05:11.160> pass<00:05:11.310> through<00:05:11.550> your<00:05:11.669> animation<00:05:12.120> make

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
second pass through your animation make

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:13.999 
second pass through your animation make
things<00:05:12.720> a<00:05:12.840> little<00:05:12.960> bit<00:05:13.139> smoother<00:05:13.560> right<00:05:13.800> here

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
things a little bit smoother right here

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:15.770 
things a little bit smoother right here
there's<00:05:14.220> a<00:05:14.250> little<00:05:14.310> corner<00:05:14.729> I'm<00:05:15.360> gonna<00:05:15.630> turn

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
there's a little corner I'm gonna turn

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.510 
there's a little corner I'm gonna turn
on<00:05:15.840> motion<00:05:16.229> blur<00:05:16.349> now<00:05:16.530> and<00:05:16.740> I'm<00:05:17.220> going<00:05:17.340> to<00:05:17.430> turn

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
on motion blur now and I'm going to turn

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.980 
on motion blur now and I'm going to turn
off<00:05:17.580> my<00:05:17.820> reference<00:05:18.180> line<00:05:18.360> and<00:05:18.389> let's<00:05:18.720> see<00:05:18.870> what

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
off my reference line and let's see what

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.210 
off my reference line and let's see what
our<00:05:19.020> animation<00:05:19.470> looks<00:05:19.620> like<00:05:21.440> cool<00:05:22.440> so<00:05:23.009> with<00:05:23.190> a

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
our animation looks like cool so with a

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.159 
our animation looks like cool so with a
little<00:05:23.550> more<00:05:23.669> work<00:05:23.940> this<00:05:24.300> would<00:05:24.539> be<00:05:24.630> ready<00:05:24.960> for

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
little more work this would be ready for

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.980 
little more work this would be ready for
Showtime<00:05:25.320> and<00:05:25.919> to<00:05:26.460> do<00:05:26.699> this<00:05:26.909> by<00:05:27.330> a<00:05:27.360> manually

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
Showtime and to do this by a manually

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.649 
Showtime and to do this by a manually
keyframe<00:05:28.440> would<00:05:29.250> probably<00:05:29.699> take<00:05:29.970> I<00:05:30.270> don't

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:30.659 
keyframe would probably take I don't

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:32.870 
keyframe would probably take I don't
know<00:05:30.720> an<00:05:30.960> hour<00:05:31.260> it<00:05:31.560> would<00:05:31.620> take<00:05:31.680> way<00:05:32.159> more<00:05:32.190> time

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
know an hour it would take way more time

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.189 
know an hour it would take way more time
than<00:05:32.909> it<00:05:33.150> just<00:05:33.360> took<00:05:33.510> that<00:05:33.659> literally<00:05:34.020> took

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
than it just took that literally took

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.409 
than it just took that literally took
two<00:05:34.470> minutes<00:05:34.650> so<00:05:35.490> hopefully<00:05:36.030> that<00:05:36.180> gives<00:05:36.210> you

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
two minutes so hopefully that gives you

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:37.730 
two minutes so hopefully that gives you
some<00:05:36.599> ideas<00:05:36.930> about<00:05:36.960> what<00:05:37.320> you<00:05:37.349> can<00:05:37.590> actually

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
some ideas about what you can actually

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.430 
some ideas about what you can actually
do<00:05:37.979> inside<00:05:38.400> of<00:05:38.520> After<00:05:38.729> Effects<00:05:39.150> so<00:05:40.020> that's<00:05:40.169> it

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
do inside of After Effects so that's it

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.050 
do inside of After Effects so that's it
we<00:05:40.620> just<00:05:40.800> used<00:05:40.949> motion<00:05:41.370> sketch<00:05:41.580> on<00:05:41.789> a<00:05:41.820> null

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
we just used motion sketch on a null

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.939 
we just used motion sketch on a null
object<00:05:42.090> we<00:05:42.630> parented<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.110> paper<00:05:43.289> airplane<00:05:43.500> to

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:43.949 
object we parented the paper airplane to

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:46.640 
object we parented the paper airplane to
it<00:05:44.099> we<00:05:44.490> acted<00:05:45.120> out<00:05:45.270> and<00:05:45.659> the<00:05:45.840> motions<00:05:46.320> sketched

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
it we acted out and the motions sketched

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.379 
it we acted out and the motions sketched
our<00:05:46.860> object<00:05:47.220> directly<00:05:47.370> on<00:05:47.909> the<00:05:48.060> touch<00:05:48.240> display

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
our object directly on the touch display

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.330 
our object directly on the touch display
and<00:05:48.870> then<00:05:49.440> we<00:05:49.590> just<00:05:49.740> cleaned<00:05:49.979> it<00:05:50.039> up<00:05:50.159> in<00:05:50.280> the

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:50.340 
and then we just cleaned it up in the

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.890 
and then we just cleaned it up in the
graph<00:05:50.520> editor<00:05:50.699> a<00:05:50.909> little<00:05:51.180> bit<00:05:51.300> so<00:05:51.479> you<00:05:51.539> saw<00:05:51.780> how

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
graph editor a little bit so you saw how

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.570 
graph editor a little bit so you saw how
much<00:05:52.020> easier<00:05:52.440> how<00:05:52.530> much<00:05:52.650> faster<00:05:53.099> it<00:05:53.159> was<00:05:53.310> and

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
much easier how much faster it was and

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.460 
much easier how much faster it was and
frankly<00:05:54.000> how<00:05:54.090> fun<00:05:54.419> it<00:05:54.509> is<00:05:54.630> so<00:05:54.840> I<00:05:54.960> hope<00:05:55.229> you<00:05:55.349> can

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
frankly how fun it is so I hope you can

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:04.220 
frankly how fun it is so I hope you can
try<00:05:55.650> it

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.290
