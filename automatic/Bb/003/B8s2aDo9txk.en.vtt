00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
ability to combine inventory items so we

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.770 
ability to combine inventory items so we
haven't<00:02:18.310> had<00:02:18.489> that<00:02:18.519> in<00:02:18.670> telltale<00:02:19.090> games

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
haven't had that in telltale games

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.509 
haven't had that in telltale games
before<00:02:20.019> but<00:02:20.350> for<00:02:20.500> monkey<00:02:20.739> island--<00:02:20.769> we

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
before but for monkey island-- we

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:22.650 
before but for monkey island-- we
thought<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.730> important<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.090> have<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.269> that

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
thought it important to have that that

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.970 
thought it important to have that that
kind<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.900> diversity<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:23.530> that<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.709> could<00:02:23.860> have

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
kind of diversity so that you could have

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.690 
kind of diversity so that you could have
a<00:02:24.840> combining<00:02:25.840> inventory<00:02:26.350> and<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:27.610> know

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
a combining inventory and you know

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.100 
a combining inventory and you know
puzzles<00:02:27.910> that<00:02:28.120> really<00:02:28.480> are<00:02:28.570> true<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.989> the

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
puzzles that really are true to the

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.530 
puzzles that really are true to the
spirit<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.709> original<00:02:29.950> games<00:02:30.459> but<00:02:31.209> but

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
spirit of the original games but but

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.560 
spirit of the original games but but
again<00:02:31.720> if<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:31.900> want<00:02:31.930> accessibility<00:02:32.739> the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
again if you want accessibility the

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.000 
again if you want accessibility the
hints<00:02:34.570> are<00:02:34.690> contextual<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:35.440> if<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.590> get<00:02:35.709> stuck

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
hints are contextual so if you get stuck

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.069 
hints are contextual so if you get stuck
you<00:02:36.040> get<00:02:36.850> some<00:02:37.060> environmental<00:02:37.540> clues<00:02:37.900> that

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
you get some environmental clues that

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:38.910 
you get some environmental clues that
kind<00:02:38.260> of<00:02:38.290> help<00:02:38.440> point<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.739> in<00:02:38.769> the<00:02:38.860> right

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
kind of help point you in the right

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.170 
kind of help point you in the right
direction<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.459> figure<00:02:39.700> out<00:02:39.730> we<00:02:39.880> were<00:02:39.970> doing

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
direction and figure out we were doing

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.430 
direction and figure out we were doing
we<00:02:40.269> want<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.540> games<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:40.750> be<00:02:40.900> completed<00:02:41.260> will

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
we want the games to be completed will

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.220 
we want the games to be completed will
too<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:42.340> then<00:02:42.519> it's<00:02:42.700> really<00:02:42.970> as<00:02:43.180> an<00:02:43.600> epic<00:02:43.840> saga

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
know to 24 hours is what we say usually

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.720 
know to 24 hours is what we say usually
depends<00:03:04.650> on<00:03:04.740> your<00:03:04.830> skill<00:03:05.040> level<00:03:05.100> and<00:03:05.430> clues
