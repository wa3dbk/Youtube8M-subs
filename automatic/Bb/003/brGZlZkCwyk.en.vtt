static position that way balancing is

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.990 
static position that way balancing is
easier<00:00:46.409> and<00:00:46.589> you<00:00:46.979> can<00:00:47.010> see<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> emphasize

most<00:00:56.940> people<00:00:57.239> are<00:00:57.360> problems<00:00:57.750> with<00:00:57.930> balance<00:00:58.110> so

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
most people are problems with balance so

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.560 
most people are problems with balance so
a<00:00:58.530> good<00:00:58.769> drill<00:00:58.979> to<00:00:59.010> practice<00:00:59.580> is<00:00:59.790> the<00:01:00.119> scooter
