00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello dear internet readers 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.900
 I decided to shoot this video for those who 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.719
 thinks zombie guitar 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.670
 is the cheapest and the worst 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.119
 guitars that are generally possible now 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:22.170
 buy in a music store here 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.949
 it's not so the cheapest guitar which 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.680
 could find was purchased by me your not 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:34.370
 called us sonic and it costs 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:39.930
 attention 1490 rubles 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:47.910
 one and a half thousand rubles here not to be 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:56.120
 unfounded in taste rus and here 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:58.920
 please with vintage 1490 rubles test 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.430
 a logical question arises if the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.739
 a cheap zombie is worth about three 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:10.170
 half a thousand rubles now in Moscow 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:12.150
 and the guitar purchased in Tambov given 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.240
 what can offer for a half 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:21.210
 thousand rubles in principle in principle for 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.110
 one and a half thousand rubles they offer us well 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:32.460
 as I understand something like pine 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:35.360
 strata because I know the look well 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:40.500
 probably it does not seem that it is made of 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:46.140
 pines but I don't know how it feels 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.970
 feeling to the vulture feels like 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.979
 like a maple neck it really isn't 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.880
 maple just cut off a piece of pine it 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.880
 loved the court 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:09.030
 it is very light perhaps even easier than 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:13.319
 Zombies are clearly lighter, but seem to be like a tree 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.299
 whole piece to the word on the package and 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.730
 it is written that it is made of wood 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:20.129
 here is how you see it is written that the neck and 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.239
 the hull is made of wood and stannis grass 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:27.540
 and dillon respectively in china where 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.340
 Neighing is still done in although the weight is written 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.750
 that four kilos is not really 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.680
 it seems much easier much easier 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.410
 complete with guitar everything as always 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.519
 standard wires most ordinary 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:45.420
 turnkey and well 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:50.010
 lever for typewriter what else can i 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:53.640
 say but the guitar looks pretty 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.930
 impressive to yourself if in principle not 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:02.150
 pay attention to this 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.150
 weird weird tree drawing 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.389
 just striking that build 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.310
 pretty cheap and this one here is the standard 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.540
 tremolo 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.480
 although the machine seems to be working fine 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:22.100
 it is worth orit almost does not lose in 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.100
 mostly sinning on the sixth string 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:33.090
 opened the back cover in which hoping 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.739
 discover something strange but nothing i 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.450
 I did not find that I could here 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.450
 striking that here so here I am 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.970
 I realized that the guitar is made incomprehensibly from 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.069
 what and washed down some pressed from 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.290
 what is nothing absolutely clean guitar 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:53.629
 absolutely 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:56.150
 Normal body although judged by ease 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.829
 and which do not smell at which it 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.519
 publishes in principle it seems that all the same 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:05.260
 this is a pine now and the sound is a sound and a half 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.260
 thousand pays off with interest 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.150
 Now 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.490
 Well 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.669
 both 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.820
 need to 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.960
 It was 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:14.080
 by and large it doesn't seem like a guitar 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:16.569
 justifies its half thousand and not 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.509
 I know if it's worth it. I just 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:22.330
 passed by and saw her think why 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:24.069
 would not damn it in the end if 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:28.740
 something doesnâ€™t work for me i can always i 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:34.770
 return but by and large I am satisfied 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:34.770
 I hope they fall apart the next day
