00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
it's kind of too bad that so many people

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.010 
it's kind of too bad that so many people
have<00:00:40.160> sort<00:00:40.430> of<00:00:40.520> a<00:00:40.640> negative<00:00:41.090> attitude<00:00:41.390> like

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
have sort of a negative attitude like

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.410 
have sort of a negative attitude like
this<00:00:42.260> towards<00:00:43.220> electric-assist<00:00:43.670> they<00:00:44.059> seem

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
this towards electric-assist they seem

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.450 
this towards electric-assist they seem
to<00:00:44.450> have<00:00:44.540> this<00:00:44.690> attitude<00:00:44.870> that<00:00:45.170> you<00:00:45.350> know<00:00:45.559> they

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
to have this attitude that you know they

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.930 
to have this attitude that you know they
need<00:00:46.640> to<00:00:46.730> be<00:00:46.850> macho<00:00:47.059> and<00:00:47.720> or<00:00:48.380> whatever<00:00:48.940> gung-ho

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
need to be macho and or whatever gung-ho

need to be macho and or whatever gung-ho
and<00:00:50.150> sporty<00:00:50.600> gung-ho<00:00:50.930> and<00:00:51.440> you<00:00:51.650> know<00:00:51.800> that

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
and sporty gung-ho and you know that

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.680 
and sporty gung-ho and you know that
they<00:00:52.400> can't<00:00:52.730> do<00:00:52.879> with<00:00:53.030> their<00:00:53.180> own<00:00:53.270> leg<00:00:53.480> power

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
they can't do with their own leg power

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.740 
they can't do with their own leg power
well<00:00:54.050> then<00:00:54.470> damn<00:00:55.190> it<00:00:55.370> all<00:00:55.460> you<00:00:55.760> know<00:00:55.790> shouldn't

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
well then damn it all you know shouldn't

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.200 
well then damn it all you know shouldn't
be<00:00:56.840> done<00:00:57.020> but<00:00:57.920> you<00:00:58.280> know<00:00:58.550> it<00:00:58.700> just<00:00:58.730> really

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
be done but you know it just really

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.810 
be done but you know it just really
makes<00:00:59.390> it<00:00:59.600> so<00:00:59.960> much<00:01:00.079> easier<00:01:00.140> that<00:01:00.770> it's<00:01:01.400> doable

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
makes it so much easier that it's doable

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.229 
makes it so much easier that it's doable
and<00:01:02.300> I<00:01:02.390> don't<00:01:02.540> have<00:01:02.720> to<00:01:02.870> think<00:01:02.900> about<00:01:03.200> it<00:01:03.350> and

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
and I don't have to think about it and

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.249 
and I don't have to think about it and
except<00:01:05.239> when<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:05.540> leave<00:01:05.690> your<00:01:05.810> battery<00:01:06.140> on

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
except when you leave your battery on

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:07.510 
except when you leave your battery on
charge<00:01:06.290> when<00:01:06.710> i<00:01:06.740> leave<00:01:06.950> my<00:01:07.040> battery<00:01:07.400> on<00:01:07.490> charge

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
charge when i leave my battery on charge

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.310 
charge when i leave my battery on charge
and<00:01:08.090> that<00:01:08.150> i<00:01:08.210> think<00:01:08.300> about<00:01:08.570> how<00:01:08.810> much<00:01:08.930> i<00:01:09.110> miss

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
and that i think about how much i miss

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.490 

well<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.450> other<00:01:16.570> thing<00:01:16.690> about<00:01:17.050> having<00:01:17.290> the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
well the other thing about having the

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.050 
well the other thing about having the
battery<00:01:17.860> is<00:01:17.980> that<00:01:18.190> you<00:01:18.280> keep<00:01:18.430> up<00:01:18.640> with<00:01:18.760> traffic

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
battery is that you keep up with traffic

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.200 
battery is that you keep up with traffic
