goofy rachels Luria whoops yeah yeah we

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.770 
goofy rachels Luria whoops yeah yeah we
should<00:03:08.549> probably<00:03:08.579> we<00:03:09.299> should<00:03:09.480> buy<00:03:09.569> new

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
should probably we should buy new

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.300 
should probably we should buy new
controllers<00:03:10.290> more<00:03:10.530> often<00:03:10.799> well<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.010> was
