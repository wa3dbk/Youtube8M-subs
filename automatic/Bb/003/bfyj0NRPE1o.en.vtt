Everyone knows that there is a recyclebin in computer

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
From where we can restore deleted files

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
similarly everyone gets the doubt is this option is available in our smart phones

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
now,i am going to say the technique that definitely will help you 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
through which you can restore all types of files like videos,photos etc than you restore them to your smartphone like you do it in your computer

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000
lets see this in practical 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:44.000
go to google play store and type Dumpster and install it in your smartphone 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and then open the installed dumpster app you can see different folders like videos,images etc..,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
By selecting ON or OFF option whether to store them in recyclebin after deleting from your smartphone

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
for example if you select ON option for images folder you can see your deleted files here

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
so,lets see this in practical

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
go to dumpster app and here you can see the previous image deleted by me in my smartphone

13
00:01:14.00 --&gt; 00:01:16.oo
i deleted this image file by   clicking on the deleted image file you are able to see the preview of that

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.000
at the same time you can see restore and delete options shown in the screen 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
now by selecting the restore option in the screen you can restore the image then it will go to the previous location 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
or else if you select the delete option the image file will be deleted permanently from your smartphone

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
i am selecting the restore option 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
then it will get automatically restored to the previous location in your smart phone from where you deleted

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
now you can see the dumpster is empty which means the recyclebin is empty

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
so,next if you delete any file in your smartphone you can see it in dumpster app in your smartphone

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
then you can decide whether you can restore or delete those files from dumpster 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
