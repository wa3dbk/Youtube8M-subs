 show you how to lie in tennis 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.179
 cheating and nasty tricks can win 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.179
 and still keep a white vest 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:36.590
 the indian art takes a branch too 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.400
 beat the baroque your opponent demands 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.410
 after a ball 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:44.870
 you give him two with the hans 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.730
 look in the air just in the summer though 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.160
 the sun patters from above and the 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.750
 Axillary sweat directly from above the hand 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:57.320
 running down you have the perfect one 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:58.489
 excuse for the grip your opponent has 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.920
 just a decisive sentence 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.979
 won the audience's eye on then 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.220
 brought him back with the twilight and that 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.140
 Game is reopened 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.040
 in a suboptimal attack case though 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.040
 the multi ahead 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.630
 You do not always have to have a butterball 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.340
 to place in the field 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.590
 you can put it on the head again 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.630
 opponent's goal of the opponent has in Metz 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.729
 pretty powerful eggs proved 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.729
 This is now mashed with the ovary 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.750
 cheap sterilization milan 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.009
 tailor for the last set for you 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.619
 to decide you can the 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:49.929
 Grape sugar done by the white line 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:58.420
 pull when your opponent becomes a plague 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:02:00.100
 if we take the mousetrap because seriously 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.140
 schneider ends every game with one 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.849
 fair gesture in this case with the 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:15.459
 Ottoman office switches next 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:16.840
 week again if it means you 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.670
 Asshole is if you find that here 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.680
 I can then smash that 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.540
 Yes, but I have to 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:32.190
 I want butterflies and that's what I want 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:34.629
 here in front are only the Indian 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:42.880
 the indian art takes a branch too 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:44.049
 I still turn away with a beat 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.660
 top down 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:51.940
 here start off the game if I 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.720
 sound match if your opposition 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.639
 the trap will turn to the mousetrap 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.590
 if your opponent becomes a pest if the 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:03.609
 mousetrap recorded much too early 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.870
 if we have the mousetrap on and above all 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:07.440
 even further flashed the one 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.440
 black man 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:25.480
 in a suboptimal attack around the 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.480
 decisive sentence for you 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.110
 decide for the last sentence for you 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.069
 you can decide it you can 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.560
 sometimes to the opponent of the head play 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.940
 Why are the pros but now he is 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.819
 again not so far next or me 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.470
 next says next week will also switch 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:50.200
 again when the next week again 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.519
 a will not switch does not switch 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.810
 but next week if it is 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:59.260

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:03.450
