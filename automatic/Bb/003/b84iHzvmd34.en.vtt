00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:08.990
 by the suns the h2o yes I already know that you know the basics our planet has 97 by 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.400
 percent of salt water the 3% of acs then say 3 percent the set xerecista 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.069
 available for consumption 

00:00:16.069 --> 00:00:19.969
 but do not worry that mexico ranks seventh worldwide byrd 

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:21.039
 hydraulic structure 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.179
 and only 12 million people lack drinking water and 23 million 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:29.650
 sewage stosur that thanks to the hydraulic system of siam brother 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:34.359
 Andalusian water stagnant by 267 pits that feed their remains 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:37.359
 and through a tunnel enters the valley into the water 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.170
 To reach the highest parts of the country it is necessary that the water be 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.950
 pumped by 102 seats which is very expensive 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.720
 as expensive as filling according to the foundation 250 milliliters thousand five hundred 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.350
 Sometimes it will be the same thing to buy a six pack of arrest and you still think that 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.180
 he paid too much 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.540
 when you wasted your opportunity while you wash your teeth in this 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.300
 sense 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.050
 to bathe you need 6 to 7 liters 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.410
 efe and that's it 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.690
 well it happened because even though you need 3 liters for cleaning 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.420
 dishes 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.970
 better 53 percent to 7 times besides the pope probably neither cedimat but 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.299
 so they could dress in leather shoes and a cotton shirt 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.220
 Two thousand 100 liters were used 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.229
 to this they add 1 51 with an apple milk coffee 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.100
 and two hysteria games 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.100
 which is equivalent to hundreds per chen talita 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.399
 and so we are forming what is known as her 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.669
 fortunately there are people who use 20 liters dohc growing the 

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:47.830
 more conscious starts 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.770
 true that we are wasting water or going to the village we are going to 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.610
 recover 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.680
 because the train mission and blessing every December 12 dismissed 160 liters 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.180
 but quiet sabotage will use and is known as residual water you 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.920
 use 9% 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.819
 the rest is eliminated the same happens with agriculture 55% of the water never arrive 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.230
 and that watermelon needs 400 liters to be produced 

00:02:15.399 --> 00:02:19.709
 that a kilo of apples every time he talks to them besides radar allows to escape 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.559
 in two thousand liters of water a month enough to bathe a hundred times 

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:28.189
 compose 44 people and to make them feel they survive on a planet where on the 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.429
 6 percent water point is available for consultation 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.429
 you really know the term h2o 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.359
 p 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:47.189
 two
