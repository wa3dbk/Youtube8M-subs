00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
scale so it starts on zero I'm going to

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.630 
scale so it starts on zero I'm going to
switch<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.299> over<00:03:02.329> to<00:03:02.660> grams<00:03:03.220> all<00:03:04.220> right<00:03:04.400> so<00:03:04.519> now

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
switch it over to grams all right so now

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.250 
switch it over to grams all right so now
