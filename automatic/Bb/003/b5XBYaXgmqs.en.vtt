00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
but more of a gimmick

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.010 
but more of a gimmick

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
he has 2 GN submachine guns

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.589 
he has 2 GN submachine guns
and<00:00:27.410> each<00:00:28.410> arm<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:29.580> have<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.820> take<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.240> outer

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
and each arm you have to take this outer

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.450 
and each arm you have to take this outer
piece<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.080> armor<00:00:31.349> off<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:31.920> can<00:00:32.070> see<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
piece of armor off and you can see the

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.060 
piece of armor off and you can see the
two<00:00:32.759> little<00:00:32.910> barrels<00:00:33.329> right<00:00:33.540> there<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.070> just

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
two little barrels right there and just

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.250 
two little barrels right there and just
move<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.579> over<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.149> side<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:38.000> then<00:00:39.260> you've

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
move it over to the side and then you've

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.580 
move it over to the side and then you've
got<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.360> GN<00:00:42.360> submachine<00:00:43.110> gun

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
got the GN submachine gun

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.860 
got the GN submachine gun
but<00:00:44.250> because<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> back<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.480> his<00:00:45.570> arm

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
but because it's on the back of his arm

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.090 
but because it's on the back of his arm
and<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.590> way<00:00:46.710> his<00:00:46.950> shoulder<00:00:47.460> joint<00:00:47.730> is

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
and the way his shoulder joint is

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.889 
and the way his shoulder joint is
situated<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.309> kind<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.180> awkward<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.660> get

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
situated it's kind of awkward to get

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.830 
situated it's kind of awkward to get
them<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.170> pose<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.890> quite<00:00:53.129> right<00:00:53.570> as<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.690> can

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
them to pose it quite right as you can

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.810 
them to pose it quite right as you can
see<00:00:55.020> his<00:00:55.230> shoulder<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.890> kind<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.160> sticking<00:00:56.699> out

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
see his shoulder is kind of sticking out

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.840 
see his shoulder is kind of sticking out
funny<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:58.250> anyway<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.340> wanted<00:00:59.760> to

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
part one so now on to airy OSes

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.080 
part one so now on to airy OSes
transformation<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.720> it's<00:01:09.720> actually<00:01:10.260> quite

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
transformation and it's actually quite

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.469 
transformation and it's actually quite
smoother<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:13.130> lot<00:01:14.130> more<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.670> lot<00:01:15.420> more

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
smoother and a lot more a lot more

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.300 
smoother and a lot more a lot more
complete<00:01:16.170> looking<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.740> looks<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.979> lot<00:01:17.100> more

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
complete looking it looks a lot more

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.910 
complete looking it looks a lot more
solid<00:01:17.549> than<00:01:17.909> kurios<00:01:18.630> as<00:01:18.840> transformation<00:01:19.560> so

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
solid than kurios as transformation so

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.770 
solid than kurios as transformation so
let's<00:01:20.790> get<00:01:20.939> right<00:01:21.119> into<00:01:21.330> it

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
let's get right into it

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.929 
let's get right into it
I<00:01:24.530> guess<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:26.070> guess<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.520> could<00:01:26.790> really

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
I guess you I guess you could really

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.460 
I guess you I guess you could really
start<00:01:27.210> with<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.360> top<00:01:27.630> half<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.229> bottom

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
start with the top half of the bottom

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.499 
start with the top half of the bottom
half<00:01:28.500> first<00:01:28.950> I'll<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:29.790> go<00:01:30.090> ahead<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.360> start

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
half first I'll just go ahead and start

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.800 
half first I'll just go ahead and start
with<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.689> top<00:01:30.900> half<00:01:31.729> you've<00:01:32.729> got<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> kind<00:01:33.720> of

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
with the top half you've got a kind of

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.350 
with the top half you've got a kind of
bend<00:01:33.990> his<00:01:34.140> head<00:01:34.170> down<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.890> then<00:01:35.640> these<00:01:35.790> spiky

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
bend his head down and then these spiky

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.620 
bend his head down and then these spiky
things<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.930> side<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.970> camera<00:01:39.360> up<00:01:39.509> a

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
things on the side and the camera up a

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.149 
things on the side and the camera up a
little<00:01:39.780> bit<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.380> naturally<00:01:40.590> see<00:01:40.979> what's

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
little bit so you naturally see what's

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.749 
little bit so you naturally see what's
going<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.540> go<00:01:42.540> out<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.170> then<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.250> shoulder

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
going on go out and then the shoulder

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.870 
going on go out and then the shoulder
armor<00:01:45.860> comes<00:01:46.860> together<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.860> there's

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
armor comes together like so and there's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.600 
armor comes together like so and there's
two<00:01:50.880> little<00:01:51.149> connectors<00:01:51.869> at<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.140> top<00:01:52.350> here<00:01:52.770> so

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
two little connectors at the top here so

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.090 
two little connectors at the top here so
it<00:01:53.939> just<00:01:54.119> snaps<00:01:54.479> together<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.290> point<00:01:55.680> at<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
it just snaps together to a point at the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.880 
it just snaps together to a point at the
top<00:01:57.829> and<00:01:58.829> then<00:02:00.409> actually<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.500> know<00:02:01.619> what<00:02:01.770> I'm

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
top and then actually you know what I'm

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.620 
top and then actually you know what I'm
just<00:02:01.920> gonna<00:02:02.070> leave<00:02:02.340> these<00:02:02.520> arms<00:02:02.939> out<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:03.479> now

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
just gonna leave these arms out for now

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.510 
just gonna leave these arms out for now
because<00:02:04.439> they'll<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:04.860> in<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.070> way<00:02:05.189> when<00:02:05.399> I'm

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
because they'll get in the way when I'm

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.719 
because they'll get in the way when I'm
trying<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.850> do<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.090> legs<00:02:07.220> this<00:02:08.220> little<00:02:08.489> black

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
trying to do the legs this little black

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.990 
trying to do the legs this little black
thing<00:02:09.229> flips<00:02:10.229> all<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.649> way<00:02:10.770> up<00:02:11.009> there's<00:02:11.790> that

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
thing flips all the way up there's that

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.210 
thing flips all the way up there's that
clear

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
clear

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.170 
clear

rotation below the hip joint and then on
the<00:03:16.850> back<00:03:17.060> of<00:03:17.360> each<00:03:17.480> leg<00:03:17.870> there<00:03:18.140> is<00:03:18.320> a<00:03:18.350> little

the back of each leg there is a little

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.780 
the back of each leg there is a little
switch<00:03:19.130> right<00:03:19.160> here<00:03:19.820> that<00:03:21.220> locks<00:03:22.220> into<00:03:22.580> place

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
switch right here that locks into place

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.860 
switch right here that locks into place
all<00:03:23.209> this<00:03:23.480> all<00:03:24.140> these<00:03:24.320> fins<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:24.920> things<00:03:25.160> and

the leg and then switch it back down

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.800 
the leg and then switch it back down
walks<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:42.799> back<00:03:42.920> into<00:03:43.100> place

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
walks it back into place

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.110 
walks it back into place
and<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:45.200> foot<00:03:45.500> folds<00:03:45.890> down<00:03:46.070> on<00:03:46.400> this<00:03:46.549> ankle

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
and the foot folds down on this ankle

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.900 
and the foot folds down on this ankle
guard<00:03:47.360> folds<00:03:47.750> down<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.549> you'll<00:03:49.549> see<00:03:49.730> how<00:03:49.850> the

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
guard folds down and you'll see how the

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.610 
guard folds down and you'll see how the
ankle<00:03:50.239> guard<00:03:50.420> kind<00:03:50.690> of<00:03:52.150> fits<00:03:53.150> in<00:03:53.390> with<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.870> big

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
ankle guard kind of fits in with the big

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.770 
ankle guard kind of fits in with the big
fin<00:03:54.950> on<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.220> knee<00:03:55.970> armor<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:58.209> that's<00:03:59.209> pretty

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
fin on the knee armor and that's pretty

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.740 
fin on the knee armor and that's pretty
much<00:03:59.930> one<00:04:00.380> leg<00:04:00.620> down<00:04:01.150> then<00:04:02.150> we<00:04:02.330> just<00:04:02.510> do<00:04:02.630> the

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
much one leg down then we just do the

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.940 
much one leg down then we just do the
same<00:04:02.989> thing<00:04:03.049> on<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:04.130> other<00:04:04.310> leg<00:04:05.620> this<00:04:06.620> comes

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
same thing on the other leg this comes

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.840 
same thing on the other leg this comes
down<00:04:07.250> ankle<00:04:08.030> armor<00:04:08.299> slides<00:04:08.570> up<00:04:09.519> and<00:04:10.519> you<00:04:10.640> can't

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
down ankle armor slides up and you can't

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.670 
down ankle armor slides up and you can't
really<00:04:10.970> hear<00:04:11.390> it<00:04:11.420> on<00:04:11.600> the<00:04:11.660> video<00:04:11.870> but<00:04:12.320> it<00:04:12.500> does

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
really hear it on the video but it does

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.590 
really hear it on the video but it does
make<00:04:12.890> a<00:04:12.950> faint<00:04:13.310> little<00:04:13.489> clicking<00:04:14.030> sound<00:04:14.299> to

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
make a faint little clicking sound to

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.960 
make a faint little clicking sound to
let<00:04:14.750> you<00:04:14.870> know<00:04:15.019> when<00:04:15.200> you've<00:04:15.350> got<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:16.580> armor

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
in the right place and then there's some

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.240 
in the right place and then there's some
little<00:04:20.900> holes<00:04:21.080> on<00:04:21.500> the<00:04:21.620> bottom<00:04:21.739> of<00:04:21.950> the<00:04:22.010> skirt

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
little holes on the bottom of the skirt

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.969 
little holes on the bottom of the skirt
rama<00:04:22.669> they<00:04:23.270> connect<00:04:23.660> onto<00:04:23.960> these<00:04:24.080> pegs<00:04:24.500> on<00:04:24.860> the

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
rama they connect onto these pegs on the

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:25.650 
rama they connect onto these pegs on the
leg

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
leg

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.540 
leg
so<00:04:26.560> you'll<00:04:27.190> want<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.550> line<00:04:28.360> those<00:04:28.750> up<00:04:29.400> it's<00:04:30.400> not

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
so you'll want to line those up it's not

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.970 
so you'll want to line those up it's not
really<00:04:30.850> a<00:04:30.880> big<00:04:31.150> deal<00:04:31.390> they<00:04:31.660> just<00:04:31.690> it<00:04:32.470> just<00:04:32.710> kind

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
really a big deal they just it just kind

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.070 
really a big deal they just it just kind
of<00:04:33.010> helps<00:04:33.640> things<00:04:33.880> stay<00:04:34.150> in<00:04:34.300> order<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:36.490> then

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
of helps things stay in order and then

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.650 
of helps things stay in order and then
you<00:04:38.080> can<00:04:38.170> rotate<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.740> arms<00:04:39.100> out<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:40.390> hands

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
you can rotate the arms out the hands

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.130 
you can rotate the arms out the hands
actually<00:04:40.990> kind<00:04:41.380> of<00:04:41.470> go<00:04:41.620> in<00:04:41.830> like<00:04:42.070> that<00:04:42.430> which<00:04:42.760> I

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
actually kind of go in like that which I

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.840 
actually kind of go in like that which I
guess<00:04:44.140> helps<00:04:44.500> kind<00:04:44.980> of<00:04:45.070> fold<00:04:45.340> things<00:04:45.550> in

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
guess helps kind of fold things in

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.930 
guess helps kind of fold things in
better<00:04:47.400> like<00:04:48.400> so<00:04:49.500> then<00:04:50.500> you'll<00:04:50.740> take<00:04:50.980> actually

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
better like so then you'll take actually

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.740 
better like so then you'll take actually
pull<00:04:52.180> this<00:04:52.300> back<00:04:52.510> out<00:04:52.660> take<00:04:53.530> the<00:04:53.910> GN<00:04:54.910> twin<00:04:55.420> beam

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
pull this back out take the GN twin beam

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.460 
pull this back out take the GN twin beam
rifle<00:04:56.230> put<00:04:57.160> it<00:04:57.310> in<00:04:57.370> the<00:04:57.430> hand<00:04:58.260> rotate<00:04:59.260> that

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
rifle put it in the hand rotate that

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.500 
rifle put it in the hand rotate that
handle<00:05:00.070> that's<00:05:00.430> where<00:05:00.670> the<00:05:00.760> rotating<00:05:01.180> handle

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
handle that's where the rotating handle

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.610 
handle that's where the rotating handle
comes<00:05:01.720> in<00:05:01.990> handy<00:05:03.030> up<00:05:04.030> so<00:05:04.750> that<00:05:04.990> it's<00:05:05.170> pointing

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
comes in handy up so that it's pointing

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.000 
comes in handy up so that it's pointing
forward<00:05:08.160> although<00:05:09.160> being<00:05:09.520> on<00:05:09.700> the<00:05:09.820> underside

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
forward although being on the underside

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.270 
forward although being on the underside
it<00:05:12.010> may<00:05:12.430> fall<00:05:12.850> out<00:05:13.030> pretty<00:05:13.300> easily<00:05:13.540> so<00:05:14.280> you'll

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
it may fall out pretty easily so you'll

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.130 
it may fall out pretty easily so you'll
just<00:05:15.310> kind<00:05:16.300> of<00:05:16.360> want<00:05:16.540> to<00:05:16.570> be<00:05:16.690> careful<00:05:17.050> with

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
just kind of want to be careful with

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.600 
just kind of want to be careful with
that<00:05:17.910> and<00:05:18.910> there<00:05:19.450> we<00:05:19.630> go<00:05:19.780> this<00:05:20.080> fan<00:05:20.830> right<00:05:21.070> here

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
that and there we go this fan right here

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.770 
that and there we go this fan right here
can<00:05:22.450> come<00:05:22.750> down<00:05:23.790> but<00:05:24.790> in<00:05:25.000> the<00:05:25.120> manual<00:05:25.480> it<00:05:25.570> has

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
can come down but in the manual it has

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.970 
can come down but in the manual it has
it<00:05:25.960> up<00:05:26.200> I<00:05:26.470> believe<00:05:26.770> yeah<00:05:27.580> so<00:05:28.570> it<00:05:28.960> does<00:05:29.230> move<00:05:29.560> but

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
it up I believe yeah so it does move but

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.860 
it up I believe yeah so it does move but
in<00:05:30.250> the<00:05:30.490> manual<00:05:30.820> it's<00:05:30.970> like<00:05:31.180> that<00:05:31.360> anyway<00:05:31.810> so

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
in the manual it's like that anyway so

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.870 
in the manual it's like that anyway so
there's<00:05:32.200> really<00:05:32.320> not<00:05:32.560> much<00:05:33.220> of<00:05:33.280> a<00:05:33.460> point<00:05:33.670> in

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
there's really not much of a point in

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.680 
there's really not much of a point in
moving<00:05:34.060> it<00:05:34.380> and<00:05:35.380> there<00:05:36.010> we<00:05:36.160> go<00:05:36.360> I'm<00:05:37.360> just<00:05:37.420> going

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
moving it and there we go I'm just going

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.850 
moving it and there we go I'm just going
to<00:05:37.720> back<00:05:37.930> up<00:05:38.140> a<00:05:38.170> little<00:05:38.290> bit<00:05:38.500> so<00:05:38.710> you<00:05:38.770> can

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
to back up a little bit so you can

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.370 
to back up a little bit so you can
actually<00:05:38.980> see<00:05:39.370> it<00:05:39.520> and<00:05:39.670> it's<00:05:40.420> actually<00:05:40.930> quite

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
actually see it and it's actually quite

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.750 
actually see it and it's actually quite
large<00:05:41.650> its<00:05:42.070> larger<00:05:42.490> than<00:05:42.670> kurios<00:05:43.300> is<00:05:43.570> a<00:05:44.760> flight

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
large its larger than kurios is a flight

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.730 
large its larger than kurios is a flight
mode<00:05:46.060> and<00:05:47.340> very<00:05:48.340> very<00:05:48.640> tall<00:05:48.880> its<00:05:49.210> I<00:05:49.620> put<00:05:50.620> it

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
mode and very very tall its I put it

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.830 
mode and very very tall its I put it
next<00:05:50.890> to<00:05:51.070> my<00:05:51.190> perfect<00:05:51.430> grade<00:05:51.730> astray<00:05:52.240> and<00:05:52.480> it

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
next to my perfect grade astray and it

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.680 
next to my perfect grade astray and it
was<00:05:53.050> a<00:05:53.080> good<00:05:53.520> one<00:05:54.520> maybe<00:05:54.790> two<00:05:55.090> inches<00:05:55.300> taller

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
was a good one maybe two inches taller

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.640 
was a good one maybe two inches taller
than<00:05:55.870> the<00:05:56.140> perfect<00:05:56.350> grade<00:05:56.730> so<00:05:58.530> definitely<00:05:59.530> a

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
than the perfect grade so definitely a

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.010 
than the perfect grade so definitely a
really<00:06:00.520> large<00:06:00.960> flight<00:06:01.960> mode<00:06:02.260> and<00:06:03.150> then<00:06:04.150> like<00:06:04.870> I

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
really large flight mode and then like I

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.360 
really large flight mode and then like I
told<00:06:05.200> you<00:06:05.350> in<00:06:05.440> part<00:06:05.650> one<00:06:05.830> you've<00:06:06.040> got<00:06:06.070> this

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
told you in part one you've got this

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.240 
told you in part one you've got this
special<00:06:07.300> action-based<00:06:07.900> connector<00:06:08.560> that<00:06:09.130> I'd

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
special action-based connector that I'd

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.170 
special action-based connector that I'd
keep<00:06:09.520> dropping<00:06:09.970> and<00:06:10.930> it<00:06:11.890> just<00:06:12.250> connects<00:06:12.910> right

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
keep dropping and it just connects right

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.260 
keep dropping and it just connects right
here<00:06:13.740> up<00:06:14.740> on<00:06:14.980> the<00:06:15.300> lower<00:06:16.300> torso<00:06:16.690> crotch<00:06:17.380> area

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
here up on the lower torso crotch area

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.670 
here up on the lower torso crotch area
just<00:06:19.270> connects<00:06:19.630> just<00:06:19.870> like<00:06:20.050> that<00:06:20.260> and<00:06:20.530> it

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
just connects just like that and it

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.330 
just connects just like that and it
still<00:06:20.920> lets<00:06:21.160> this<00:06:21.430> tail<00:06:22.030> fin<00:06:22.300> come<00:06:22.600> down<00:06:23.340> and

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
still lets this tail fin come down and

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.880 
still lets this tail fin come down and
put<00:06:25.000> down<00:06:25.180> the<00:06:25.390> action<00:06:25.660> base<00:06:25.870> and<00:06:26.230> you<00:06:26.710> can

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
put down the action base and you can

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.990 
put down the action base and you can
display<00:06:27.190> eros<00:06:27.820> and<00:06:28.150> flight<00:06:28.480> mode<00:06:29.430> so<00:06:30.430> I<00:06:30.730> guess

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
display eros and flight mode so I guess

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.650 
display eros and flight mode so I guess
that's<00:06:31.270> about<00:06:31.420> it<00:06:31.570> for<00:06:31.960> this<00:06:32.080> review<00:06:32.260> uh<00:06:33.660> this

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
that's about it for this review uh this

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.960 
that's about it for this review uh this
is<00:06:34.840> definitely<00:06:35.110> a<00:06:35.290> really<00:06:35.530> really<00:06:35.860> nice<00:06:36.010> kit<00:06:36.460> I

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
is definitely a really really nice kit I

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.029 
is definitely a really really nice kit I
mean<00:06:37.780> I<00:06:37.810> recommend<00:06:38.410> it

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 
mean I recommend it

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:41.309 
mean I recommend it
I<00:06:39.069> got<00:06:39.369> it<00:06:39.520> just<00:06:39.759> because<00:06:40.089> I<00:06:40.240> wanted<00:06:40.509> all<00:06:40.960> the

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:41.319 
I got it just because I wanted all the

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:44.719 
I got it just because I wanted all the
one<00:06:42.189> to<00:06:42.309> 100<00:06:42.729> scale<00:06:42.849> Gundams<00:06:43.839> from<00:06:44.110> double-o

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:44.729 
one to 100 scale Gundams from double-o

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:48.689 
one to 100 scale Gundams from double-o
and<00:06:46.409> I've<00:06:47.409> actually<00:06:47.589> been<00:06:47.830> impressed<00:06:48.430> with

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:51.909 
I don't think I've had a single one that

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:54.809 
I don't think I've had a single one that
I<00:06:51.939> haven't<00:06:52.419> been<00:06:52.539> satisfied<00:06:53.050> with<00:06:53.080> so<00:06:53.819> really

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:57.849 
if it's reo sorcery or double O or XE or

00:06:57.849 --> 00:06:58.589 
if it's reo sorcery or double O or XE or
any<00:06:58.089> of<00:06:58.270> them

00:06:58.589 --> 00:06:58.599 
any of them

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:01.379 
any of them
I<00:06:58.629> recommend<00:06:59.499> any<00:06:59.710> of<00:06:59.860> the<00:06:59.979> 1/100<00:07:00.610> scale<00:07:00.639> kits

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:01.389 
I recommend any of the 1/100 scale kits

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:04.649 
I recommend any of the 1/100 scale kits
