00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
through now I overbaked mine a little I

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.110 
through now I overbaked mine a little I
kind<00:02:59.410> of<00:02:59.470> didn't<00:02:59.980> set<00:03:00.160> my<00:03:00.190> kitchen<00:03:00.640> timer<00:03:00.850> this

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
kind of didn't set my kitchen timer this

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.360 
kind of didn't set my kitchen timer this
time<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:02.320> over<00:03:02.680> baked<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:02.980> a<00:03:03.010> bit<00:03:03.160> so<00:03:03.280> the

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
time and I over baked it a bit so the

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.400 
time and I over baked it a bit so the
edges<00:03:03.670> are<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:03.820> little<00:03:03.880> bit<00:03:04.420> browner<00:03:04.780> than<00:03:05.260> they

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
edges are a little bit browner than they

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.120 
edges are a little bit browner than they
should<00:03:05.770> be

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
should be

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.640 
should be
however<00:03:06.880> it<00:03:07.270> was<00:03:07.690> still<00:03:07.959> delicious<00:03:08.290> it

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
however it was still delicious it

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.320 
however it was still delicious it
certainly<00:03:08.980> was<00:03:09.190> not<00:03:09.400> burnt<00:03:09.670> by<00:03:09.880> any<00:03:10.090> stretch

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
certainly was not burnt by any stretch

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.440 
certainly was not burnt by any stretch
of<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.540> imagination<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:11.880> we<00:03:12.880> really<00:03:13.239> like

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
of the imagination and we really like

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.130 
of the imagination and we really like
this<00:03:13.660> one

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
enjoyed it they reminded me a little bit

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.040 
enjoyed it they reminded me a little bit
of<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:21.640> black<00:03:21.820> forest<00:03:22.209> cheesecake<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:22.900> had

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
made before what's great about it is

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.590 
made before what's great about it is
it's<00:03:26.050> so<00:03:26.080> fast<00:03:26.590> because<00:03:27.220> you're<00:03:27.790> using<00:03:27.970> mixes

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
it's so fast because you're using mixes

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.509 
it's so fast because you're using mixes
for<00:03:28.810> this<00:03:28.959> for<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.380> most<00:03:29.530> part<00:03:29.920> give<00:03:30.100> it<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:30.250> try

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
for this for the most part give it a try

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.850 
for this for the most part give it a try
if<00:03:30.940> you<00:03:31.390> were<00:03:31.720> to<00:03:31.840> ask<00:03:31.989> me<00:03:32.380> what<00:03:32.650> my<00:03:32.680> two
