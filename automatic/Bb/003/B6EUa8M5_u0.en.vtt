00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.410 

the<00:00:06.500> risk<00:00:06.710> is<00:00:06.980> to<00:00:07.130> eject<00:00:07.430> inside<00:00:07.910> the<00:00:08.059> vessel

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.420 
the risk is to eject inside the vessel

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.110 
the risk is to eject inside the vessel
this<00:00:08.840> is<00:00:08.900> why<00:00:09.260> I<00:00:09.290> inject<00:00:10.040> only<00:00:10.460> by<00:00:10.610> cannula

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
this is why I inject only by cannula

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.660 
this is why I inject only by cannula
when<00:00:11.360> I<00:00:11.389> inject<00:00:11.690> this<00:00:12.080> area<00:00:12.550> otherwise

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.510 

otherwise<00:00:16.670> I<00:00:17.119> inject<00:00:17.689> really<00:00:18.050> close<00:00:18.560> to<00:00:19.400> the

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
otherwise I inject really close to the

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.240 
otherwise I inject really close to the
orbital<00:00:20.029> border<00:00:20.450> in<00:00:20.810> the<00:00:21.110> orbicularis<00:00:21.710> oculi

why I prefer this point the picanha line

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.910 
why I prefer this point the picanha line
goes<00:00:33.770> vertically<00:00:34.700> and<00:00:34.969> I<00:00:35.719> have<00:00:35.960> less<00:00:36.530> risk

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
goes vertically and I have less risk

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.790 
goes vertically and I have less risk
