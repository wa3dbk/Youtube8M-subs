second day clear dry shampoo i believe
that's<00:00:06.450> what<00:00:06.600> it's<00:00:06.750> called

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.710 

and<00:00:09.540> it's<00:00:10.110> backwards<00:00:10.710> on<00:00:10.950> here<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.660> because<00:00:12.660> i

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:12.720

and we'll see if it helps so it says to

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.529 
and we'll see if it helps so it says to
lift<00:01:24.920> it<00:01:25.039> up<00:01:25.189> to<00:01:25.729> shake<00:01:26.030> it<00:01:26.060> quite<00:01:26.420> a<00:01:26.450> bit
