00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.610 
my photos at home and here's why
I<00:00:04.080> tried<00:00:04.920> it<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.250> lot<00:00:05.970> and<00:00:06.330> it<00:00:06.839> was<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:06.990> hassle<00:00:07.230> and

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
I tried it a lot and it was a hassle and

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.980 
I tried it a lot and it was a hassle and
an<00:00:08.040> expensive<00:00:08.460> hassle<00:00:08.849> at<00:00:08.970> that<00:00:09.150> my<00:00:09.809> biggest

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
an expensive hassle at that my biggest

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.350 
an expensive hassle at that my biggest
problem<00:00:10.500> was<00:00:10.620> clogs<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.280> my<00:00:11.700> lab<00:00:11.910> prints

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
problem was clogs and my lab prints

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.610 
problem was clogs and my lab prints
always<00:00:12.660> looked<00:00:12.870> better<00:00:13.019> anyway

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
always looked better anyway

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.890 
always looked better anyway
so<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:13.950> thought<00:00:14.280> why<00:00:15.089> am<00:00:15.120> i<00:00:15.299> spending<00:00:15.540> all<00:00:15.780> this

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
so I thought why am i spending all this

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.710 
so I thought why am i spending all this
money<00:00:15.960> on<00:00:16.379> ink<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:17.279> get<00:00:17.460> prints<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.150> don't

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
money on ink to get prints that don't

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.779 
money on ink to get prints that don't
have<00:00:18.869> as<00:00:18.990> high<00:00:19.020> quality<00:00:19.199> as<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.130> lab<00:00:20.340> prints

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
have as high quality as the lab prints

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.910 
have as high quality as the lab prints
that<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:20.970> can<00:00:21.119> get<00:00:21.300> for<00:00:21.750> decent<00:00:22.080> prices<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.680> a

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
that I can get for decent prices and a

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.679 
that I can get for decent prices and a
quick<00:00:23.189> turnaround<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.090> stopped<00:00:24.420> printing

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
quick turnaround so I stopped printing

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.439 
quick turnaround so I stopped printing
for<00:00:25.590> years<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.070> had<00:00:26.400> someone<00:00:26.820> else<00:00:26.970> print<00:00:27.240> for

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
for years I had someone else print for

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.990 
for years I had someone else print for
me<00:00:27.599> as<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:28.349> result<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.949> didn't<00:00:29.550> get<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.730> lot<00:00:29.970> of

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
me as a result I didn't get a lot of

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.240 
me as a result I didn't get a lot of
personal<00:00:30.480> stuff<00:00:30.660> printed<00:00:30.929> not<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.040> much

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
personal stuff printed not so much

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.459 
personal stuff printed not so much
because<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.850> expense<00:00:33.300> more<00:00:34.110> because

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
because of the expense more because

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.280 
because of the expense more because
there<00:00:35.190> was<00:00:35.340> no<00:00:35.460> instant<00:00:35.820> gratification<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.750> was

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
there was no instant gratification I was

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.049 
there was no instant gratification I was
going<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.500> have<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.770> wait<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> few<00:00:38.399> days<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.910> see

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
going to have to wait a few days to see

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.780 
going to have to wait a few days to see
the<00:00:39.149> prints<00:00:39.450> anyway<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:39.899> I<00:00:40.260> just<00:00:40.710> figured<00:00:41.040> well

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
the prints anyway so I just figured well

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.220 
the prints anyway so I just figured well
I'll<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.180> wait<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.540> look<00:00:42.629> at<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.870> photos<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
I'll just wait to look at the photos and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.260 
I'll just wait to look at the photos and
to<00:00:43.500> edit<00:00:43.680> them<00:00:43.950> until<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.850> more<00:00:45.030> time

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
to edit them until I have more time

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.290 
to edit them until I have more time
which<00:00:45.840> mostly<00:00:46.739> turned<00:00:47.340> into<00:00:47.579> never<00:00:47.879> looking

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
which mostly turned into never looking

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.880 
which mostly turned into never looking
at<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.510> photos<00:00:48.750> at<00:00:48.930> all<00:00:49.079> then<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.440> discovered

pros and cons of dye vs. pin ink
basically<00:01:39.840> pigment<00:01:40.500> has<00:01:40.530> higher<00:01:40.950> longevity

ink one thing I noticed right away is
that<00:01:52.799> these<00:01:53.340> are<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.299> most<00:01:54.540> durable<00:01:54.960> dye

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
really I don't so much care about the

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.170 
really I don't so much care about the
relatively<00:04:07.829> small<00:04:08.010> difference<00:04:08.609> between<00:04:09.030> the

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
relatively small difference between the

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.970 
relatively small difference between the
price<00:04:09.420> of<00:04:09.660> me<00:04:10.019> printing<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.799> lab

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
price of me printing and the lab

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.610 
price of me printing and the lab
printing<00:04:11.430> because<00:04:12.150> now<00:04:12.540> printing<00:04:13.319> isn't<00:04:13.560> a

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
printing because now printing isn't a

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.800 
printing because now printing isn't a
team<00:04:13.799> effort<00:04:13.980> it's<00:04:14.489> now<00:04:14.670> all<00:04:14.880> about<00:04:15.060> me<00:04:15.389> and<00:04:15.420> my

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
team effort it's now all about me and my
