00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
it's more cleansing energizing and then

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.980 
it's more cleansing energizing and then
naturally<00:01:11.250> intuitively<00:01:12.250> I<00:01:12.340> generally<00:01:15.990> later

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990

stuff for the building I've already lost

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.430 
stuff for the building I've already lost
about<00:01:23.799> 15<00:01:24.549> pounds<00:01:25.620> ten<00:01:26.620> days<00:01:27.870> which<00:01:28.870> is<00:01:29.020> not<00:01:29.229> my

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
about 15 pounds ten days which is not my

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.480 
about 15 pounds ten days which is not my
intention<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:31.500> no<00:01:32.500> big<00:01:32.710> deal<00:01:32.920> right<00:01:33.159> whatever

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
intention but no big deal right whatever

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.660 
intention but no big deal right whatever
it<00:01:33.610> takes<00:01:33.850> to<00:01:34.810> regenerate<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.950> organs<00:01:36.430> and

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
it takes to regenerate the organs and

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.789 
it takes to regenerate the organs and
glands<00:01:37.120> get<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.630> lymphatic<00:01:38.170> system<00:01:38.200> moving

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
glands get the lymphatic system moving

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.080 
glands get the lymphatic system moving
and<00:01:39.130> basically<00:01:39.970> rest<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.690> mind<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:42.310> rest<00:01:42.909> the

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
and basically rest the mind and rest the

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.730 
and basically rest the mind and rest the
body<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:45.460> really<00:01:45.760> about<00:01:46.049> alkalization<00:01:47.049> and

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
body it's really about alkalization and

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.580 
body it's really about alkalization and
detoxification<00:01:48.750> which<00:01:49.750> of<00:01:49.930> course<00:01:49.960> when<00:01:50.500> you

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
detoxification which of course when you

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.260 
detoxification which of course when you
combine<00:01:50.979> those<00:01:51.250> two<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.970> get<00:01:52.680> regeneration<00:01:53.680> a

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
combine those two you get regeneration a

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.380 
combine those two you get regeneration a
renewing<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:56.409> I'm<00:01:56.530> just<00:01:56.770> stuck<00:01:57.390> cutting

renewing so I'm just stuck cutting

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.450 
renewing so I'm just stuck cutting
around<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.900> edge<00:01:59.080> here<00:01:59.530> it's<00:01:59.799> pretty<00:02:00.070> simple

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
around the edge here it's pretty simple

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.219 
around the edge here it's pretty simple
I<00:02:00.580> hope<00:02:00.760> you<00:02:00.880> can<00:02:01.060> see<00:02:01.330> at<00:02:01.450> home<00:02:01.659> I've<00:02:01.930> got<00:02:02.110> to

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
around the outside edge leaving as much

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.240

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
from 1 to maybe 8 ingredients at the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.340 
from 1 to maybe 8 ingredients at the
most<00:03:09.310> but<00:03:10.180> after<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.630> it<00:03:10.780> starts<00:03:11.050> to<00:03:11.140> get<00:03:11.290> a

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
most but after that it starts to get a

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.170 
most but after that it starts to get a
little<00:03:11.440> complicated<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.580> I'm<00:03:12.700> really<00:03:12.940> happy

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
little complicated and I'm really happy

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.920 
little complicated and I'm really happy
I<00:03:14.140> feel<00:03:14.530> like<00:03:14.770> the<00:03:15.700> more<00:03:15.910> simple<00:03:16.420> that<00:03:16.540> you<00:03:16.600> go

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
I feel like the more simple that you go

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.990 
I feel like the more simple that you go
with<00:03:17.200> your<00:03:17.380> foods<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.980> clearer<00:03:18.280> the<00:03:18.400> mind<00:03:18.790> is

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
with your foods the clearer the mind is

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.110

the<00:03:19.150> easier<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.690> digestion<00:03:20.670> that's<00:03:21.670> been<00:03:21.940> my

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
the easier to digestion that's been my

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.240 
the easier to digestion that's been my
experience<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:23.260> I<00:03:23.290> like<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.709> keep<00:03:23.860> it<00:03:24.040> nice<00:03:24.190> and

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
experience so I like to keep it nice and

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.110 
experience so I like to keep it nice and
simple<00:03:25.530> and<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:26.709> don't<00:03:26.770> like<00:03:27.010> to<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.790> know<00:03:27.820> I

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
simple and I don't like to you know I

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.690 
simple and I don't like to you know I
don't<00:03:28.420> like<00:03:28.510> all<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.810> complicated<00:03:29.470> I<00:03:29.890> used<00:03:30.580> to

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
don't like all the complicated I used to

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.370 
don't like all the complicated I used to
do<00:03:30.850> that<00:03:31.030> years<00:03:31.330> ago<00:03:31.570> when<00:03:31.720> I<00:03:31.750> first<00:03:31.810> started

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
this does that basically this is just

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.070 
this does that basically this is just
liquid<00:03:41.220> energy<00:03:42.220> it's<00:03:42.550> gonna<00:03:42.670> it's<00:03:43.600> basically

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
liquid energy it's gonna it's basically

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.380 
liquid energy it's gonna it's basically
a<00:03:44.200> waterwheel<00:03:44.980> it<00:03:45.280> just<00:03:45.459> spins<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:46.120> cells

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
a waterwheel it just spins the cells
