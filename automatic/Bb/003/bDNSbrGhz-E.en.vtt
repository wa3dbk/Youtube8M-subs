opens the most important thing to pay
attention<00:02:10.709> here<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.489> destination<00:02:12.000> folder

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
attention here is a destination folder

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.270 
attention here is a destination folder
the<00:02:14.940> by<00:02:15.060> default<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:15.660> C<00:02:15.900> colon<00:02:16.530> backslash<00:02:16.560> I

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
the by default is C colon backslash I

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.320 
the by default is C colon backslash I
just<00:02:17.610> leave<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.790> alone<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:20.060> then<00:02:21.060> go<00:02:21.239> ahead

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
just leave it alone and then go ahead

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.100 
just leave it alone and then go ahead
and<00:02:21.480> instant

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.309

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
this this exercise I would just

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:19.610 
this this exercise I would just
disregard<00:04:15.000> and<00:04:15.150> click<00:04:15.569> enter<00:04:17.690> ok<00:04:18.690> so<00:04:18.750> you're

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
zap disable HTTP wall let's just go

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.870 
zap disable HTTP wall let's just go
ahead<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:29.220> start<00:04:30.000> it<00:04:30.090> up<00:04:30.210> so<00:04:31.190> click<00:04:32.190> was<00:04:32.460> type

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
ahead and start it up so click was type

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.990 
ahead and start it up so click was type
1<00:04:33.680> enter<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:37.039> you<00:04:38.039> could<00:04:38.190> see<00:04:38.370> down<00:04:38.520> here<00:04:38.580> it

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
1 enter and you could see down here it

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.600 
1 enter and you could see down here it
opens<00:04:39.479> up<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.930> control<00:04:40.410> panel<00:04:40.850> now<00:04:43.490> we<00:04:44.490> don't

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
opens up the control panel now we don't

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.070 
opens up the control panel now we don't
need<00:04:44.729> this<00:04:44.850> command<00:04:45.180> prompt<00:04:45.539> anymore<00:04:45.840> so<00:04:46.020> you

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
need this command prompt anymore so you

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.750 
need this command prompt anymore so you
could<00:04:46.229> go<00:04:46.620> ahead<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:46.860> type<00:04:47.460> X<00:04:47.789> and<00:04:48.150> then<00:04:48.300> enter

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
could go ahead and type X and then enter

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.180 
could go ahead and type X and then enter
so<00:04:50.760> right<00:04:50.970> now<00:04:51.090> you<00:04:51.150> can<00:04:51.270> see<00:04:51.570> that<00:04:52.190> nothing

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
so right now you can see that nothing

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.850 
so right now you can see that nothing
has<00:04:53.460> started<00:04:53.849> so<00:04:54.599> let's<00:04:54.840> go<00:04:55.050> ahead<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:55.320> start

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
has started so let's go ahead and start

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.070 
has started so let's go ahead and start
your<00:04:56.330> your<00:04:57.710> Apache<00:04:58.710> web<00:04:59.039> server<00:04:59.900> so<00:05:00.900> right

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
your your Apache web server so right

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.409
