00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hello everyone in one of the comments 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.130
 Received a request to make a mosaic or from 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.900
 fused bead shaped halloween kitty and 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:16.170
 albeit belatedly but today 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:19.710
 i'm going to need a bone of course 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.710
 the same bead drawing on which 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.590
 we will lay out a mosaic 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.429
 you can draw my find on the internet 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:35.130
 new beads I needed white black 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.690
 and pink and orange shape or like 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.410
 say platform for putting it out 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.899
 mosaic a piece of baking paper and 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.340
 if you will just like me do 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.110
 keychain then you will need you 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.090
 need Koltsovo chain space 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.750
 chains can of course take a glass 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.109
 and here are these thick needles with a needle 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.390
 in the mosaic did bulan hole 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.050
 through which i 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.940
 who then wore a chain I 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.640
 specially now so close to the world 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.190
 showing you 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.460
 drawing you can for example put 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:17.360
 Now pause and draw already 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.180
 take a picture or alternative 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.110
 of course it's always just to go to 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:28.070
 google and find another drawing better 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.259
 draw on the paper in the box i'm here 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.350
 made on plain paper and 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:37.119
 my drawing turned out too big 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.850
 doesn't quite fit my 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.960
 platform as you can see these pimples 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.479
 columns they do not match with 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.390
 drawn dots 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:53.539
 if i took the paper cell then 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.570
 they exactly fit it I already say from 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.570
 of experience 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.219
 on 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.219
 I started the business from the bottom up 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.390
 the most crucial moment is so 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.920
 say melting 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.410
 in general, we will definitely need 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.260
 baking paper I already explained a 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.510
 why do you need it if you are immediately hot 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.640
 irons go for beads then you just 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.640
 spoil and mosaic turkey 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.680
 the iron should not be too hot 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:38.290
 better walk a few times and very 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:40.390
 hot iron than immediately once 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.070
 hot and all at once 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.070
 Moscow you fly to yourself 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.440
 beads cool quickly enough 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.440
 wait a bit 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.470
 Well, now depending on what you are 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.270
 You want this mosaic to make you his I 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.790
 already offered to do for example magnets 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.120
 for the refrigerator for the refrigerator then 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.630
 now you just take 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:26.140
 take glue and magnet maybe you 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:30.270
 want to make a brooch then was 30 years old 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:33.390
 and he is best hot glue and pin 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.340
 as i said i do today 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.000
 key chain so i'm on the other side too 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.000
 melt 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.569
 I hope you enjoyed the lesson and 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.220
 came in handy 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:59.840
 do not forget to put your comments 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.880

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:06.220
