00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:13.749 

alright

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:15.740 

so<00:01:14.759> it<00:01:14.820> doesn't<00:01:14.970> really<00:01:15.149> change<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.689> much

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
so it doesn't really change that much

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.920 
so it doesn't really change that much
whoops<00:01:16.740> little<00:01:17.310> bike<00:01:17.460> yeah<00:01:18.210> says<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.540> triple

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
whoops little bike yeah says the triple

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.100 
whoops little bike yeah says the triple
firing<00:01:19.200> mode<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.860> addition<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.750> is

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
firing mode in addition to it is it is

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.929 
firing mode in addition to it is it is
pretty<00:01:22.500> decent<00:01:24.830> like<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> triple<00:01:26.159> fire<00:01:26.399> mode<00:01:26.579> is

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
pretty decent like a triple fire mode is

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.580 
pretty decent like a triple fire mode is
like<00:01:27.420> actually<00:01:27.630> good<00:01:29.539> it<00:01:30.539> does<00:01:30.689> us<00:01:30.810> 30<00:01:31.140> mo<00:01:31.439> now

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
like actually good it does us 30 mo now

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.240 
like actually good it does us 30 mo now
instead<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.390> 25<00:01:33.390> um<00:01:33.720> he<00:01:34.530> actually<00:01:34.740> has<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.130> go

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
instead of 25 um he actually has to go

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.230 
instead of 25 um he actually has to go
so<00:01:35.580> let's<00:01:35.759> actually<00:01:36.950> do<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.159> um<00:01:41.210> yeah<00:01:42.210> I

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
so let's actually do that um yeah I

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.789 
so let's actually do that um yeah I
can't<00:01:42.479> say<00:01:42.600> much<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.289> hell<00:01:43.439> most<00:01:43.590> really

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
can't say much that the hell most really

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.590 
can't say much that the hell most really
good<00:01:43.979> like<00:01:44.369> compared<00:01:44.940> to<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.119> fungus

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
good like compared to the fungus

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.480 
good like compared to the fungus
actually<00:01:46.080> love<00:01:46.319> the<00:01:46.470> slope<00:01:46.740> but<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.100> chemist

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
actually love the slope but the chemist

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.139 
actually love the slope but the chemist
is<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:47.789> awesome<00:01:48.119> um<00:01:49.039> die<00:01:50.039> accuracy<00:01:50.429> um<00:01:50.640> it's

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
is so awesome um die accuracy um it's

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.690 
is so awesome um die accuracy um it's
good<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.470> with<00:01:52.679> the<00:01:52.770> burst<00:01:53.009> it's<00:01:53.399> almost

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
good like with the burst it's almost

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.130 
good like with the burst it's almost
accurate<00:01:56.060> and<00:01:57.060> obviously<00:01:57.479> you're<00:01:57.959> going<00:01:58.080> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
accurate and obviously you're going to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.460 
accurate and obviously you're going to
be<00:01:58.200> hitting<00:01:58.440> up<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.649> bit<00:01:58.830> and<00:01:59.959> I'm<00:02:00.959> fine<00:02:01.319> with

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
be hitting up a bit and I'm fine with

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.510 
be hitting up a bit and I'm fine with
that<00:02:01.590> as<00:02:01.860> long<00:02:01.890> as<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.610> like<00:02:02.850> they're<00:02:04.520> of

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
that as long as it's like they're of

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.870 
that as long as it's like they're of
course<00:02:06.209> like<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.560> no<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:08.519> have<00:02:08.670> no

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
course like it is no you have no

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.280 
course like it is no you have no
possible<00:02:09.119> way<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:10.670> like<00:02:11.670> going<00:02:12.569> sideways<00:02:12.900> it

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
possible way of like going sideways it

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
possible way of like going sideways it
just<00:02:13.440> go<00:02:13.620> straight<00:02:13.920> up<00:02:14.099> which<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.459> weird

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
just go straight up which is weird

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.400 
just go straight up which is weird
of<00:02:16.880> course<00:02:17.120> in<00:02:17.270> spray<00:02:17.660> mode<00:02:17.900> is<00:02:18.110> something

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
of course in spray mode is something

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.979 
of course in spray mode is something
else<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.739> goes<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.459> corner<00:02:19.880> and<00:02:20.000> I<00:02:20.690> don't

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
else it goes to the corner and I don't

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.780 
else it goes to the corner and I don't
know<00:02:21.080> why<00:02:21.290> I<00:02:21.319> just<00:02:21.650> feel<00:02:21.770> like<00:02:21.860> this<00:02:22.069> ammo<00:02:22.310> runs
