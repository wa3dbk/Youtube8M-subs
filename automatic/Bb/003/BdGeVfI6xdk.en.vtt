getting a custom stall converter for it

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.070 
getting a custom stall converter for it
from<00:01:20.700> monster<00:01:21.030> transmission<00:01:21.600> as<00:01:21.689> well<00:01:21.869> this

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
from monster transmission as well this

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.249 
from monster transmission as well this
is<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> 2100<00:01:22.950> stall<00:01:23.159> converter<00:01:23.990> she'll<00:01:24.990> work<00:01:25.140> a

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
is a 2100 stall converter she'll work a

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.050 
is a 2100 stall converter she'll work a
lot<00:01:25.409> better<00:01:25.619> with<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.860> lift<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
lot better with the lift and the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.910 
lot better with the lift and the
duration<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.689> cam<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.590> Pontiac

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
duration on the cam in this Pontiac

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.149 
duration on the cam in this Pontiac
engine<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.840> so<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.170> looking<00:01:31.799> forward<00:01:32.040> to

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
engine and so this is looking forward to

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.770 
engine and so this is looking forward to
seeing<00:01:32.220> how<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.670> thing<00:01:32.880> performs<00:01:33.299> inside

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
seeing how this thing performs inside

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.039 
seeing how this thing performs inside
this<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.470> body<00:01:35.340> as<00:01:35.610> opposed<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.570> old<00:01:36.600> turbo

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
this a body as opposed to the old turbo

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.440 
this a body as opposed to the old turbo
400<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.549> pretty<00:01:38.729> transit<00:01:39.180> start

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
400 you know it's a pretty transit start

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.980 
400 you know it's a pretty transit start
the<00:01:39.600> install<00:01:39.930> process<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:41.689> we'll<00:01:42.689> see<00:01:42.869> what

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
the install process and we'll see what

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.660 
the install process and we'll see what
it<00:01:43.079> looks<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.320> when<00:01:44.040> we're<00:01:44.159> going<00:01:44.310> down<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
it looks like when we're going down the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.210 
it looks like when we're going down the
road<00:01:44.960> but<00:01:45.960> for<00:01:45.990> now<00:01:46.229> here's<00:01:46.619> some<00:01:46.799> more<00:01:46.920> video

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
road but for now here's some more video

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.670 
road but for now here's some more video
on<00:01:47.549> what<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.210> looks<00:01:48.390> like<00:01:48.600> or<00:01:49.290> what<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.530> did

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
on what it looks like or what it did

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.520 
on what it looks like or what it did
look<00:01:49.829> like<00:01:50.100> with<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.119> turbo<00:01:51.420> 400<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.350> let's

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
look like with the turbo 400 and let's

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:00.030 
look like with the turbo 400 and let's
see

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.219 

okay<00:02:01.040> so<00:02:01.100> we<00:02:01.369> saw<00:02:01.549> what<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.850> turbo<00:02:02.659> 400<00:02:02.869> look

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
okay so we saw what the turbo 400 look

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.090 
okay so we saw what the turbo 400 look
like<00:02:03.700> let's<00:02:04.700> take<00:02:04.850> a<00:02:04.909> look<00:02:05.149> and<00:02:05.270> see<00:02:05.479> what<00:02:05.630> the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
like let's take a look and see what the
