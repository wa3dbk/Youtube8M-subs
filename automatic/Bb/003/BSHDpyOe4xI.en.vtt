 robin came to batman there are fees and the 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:47.570
 obvious question you are or you do I

 I am because I am flesh and blood put me the 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.329
 low hand I am but it is a movie that 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.010
 you really ride everything that you 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.320
 company in your songs 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.320
 that's how raw is it in your life 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.460
 I touch wrong I was spontaneously not 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.229
 they understand but there are people who do know 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.939
 that what I want to make clear I 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.250
 feel that right now with all the 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.659
 artists that there are of the urban genre for 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.399
 achieve hitting reach people there 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.920
 be a little different maybe leave your 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.649
 own their own brand have their own 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.240
 style how is your case in this case not 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.939
 I would know how to say it because I know that in my 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.740
 I am different, I believe 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.049
 against it if the difference is not 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.569
 towards another one it is but pocket 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.299
 how it hits me that's unintentionally it was me 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:41.610
 I started like that and France has talked about 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.709
 change your letters do not think not be 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.310
 imagined I think a lot of people are going 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:49.319
 to move away by by changing the direction and not 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.329
 what it is what you started and you 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.220
 base fanatic just like you 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.049
 you are that your true fan now 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.929
 is that it follows you for the moment with what 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.179
 what you are doing at the moment is 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:03.149
 they will automatically get a term change 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.369
 because it was never your candidate is 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.520

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.290
