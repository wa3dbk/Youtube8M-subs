00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.460
 Last year 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.490
 this monster at 4-1 is the best of today I also 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.289
 robotics 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.740
 it is this machine that will not operate to wait we are in geneva to 

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:18.290
 the general clinic take place 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.290
 taisho equips the 30 rock optics 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.359
 and that's the goal of the prostate removal operation 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:28.060
 4 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.640
 cost for that the future of better than robotics comfortably settled at 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.100
 his console the next doctor how do I see him distance 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.380
 this new number 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.680
 ap 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.500
 precision 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.319
 ergonomics 

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:50.360
 indeed the comfortable for us 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.570
 to see the whole 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.290
 indeed our world 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.540
 even more need long summer dresses 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.140
 tomorrow by manipulating its requirements 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.269
 the video camera 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.649
 5 all the instruments are introduced into the patient's stomach 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.630
 to have holes less than one centimeter early 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.760
 sir wiley keyhole 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.280
 small incision 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.870
 for the strong movement 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.240
 in principle less pain less bleeding recovery more 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.969
 quick 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.800
 but I had been hoping for a year 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.370
 in his console the surgeon times the organs of the patient in 3d recently 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.070
 thanks to these father's glasses during this week the whole team that can 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.730
 follow the operation in three dimensions 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.710
 rebelote 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.390
 today stop fighting and operating theaters after geneva 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.000
 direction the room 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.400
 the clinic of the source have just afforded this operating room nor 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.400
 800000 francs 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.240
 she is for the moment 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.240
 in fact europe 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.360
 visibly still put on training on a dummy 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.390
 ap for the first time to the operation one must become familiar 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.390
 with all his commands 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:12.299
 the peculiarity of operating rooms invest en this touch screen for 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.259
 crying the press that the whole 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:17.570
 water equipment for example 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.640
 the brown and that of the nation 14 for proof the gers all the flights 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.150
 to batta on the part of the operation it is possible to ferment effervescentre the table 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:32.989
 the ultimate luxury the surgeon 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.969
 he is no longer alone in case of proven complications 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:39.759
 after thirty gold deaths have rarely made% 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:45.369
 so how to make his fellow direct donations of bordeaux he is on the 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:49.059
 point of reference and without passion, so here is the beautiful part to the performing arts 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:52.249
 thanks to the text 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:57.040
 there was an event from lausanne we can follow the Bordeaux operation 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:00.279
 in the smallest details 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:04.290
 and to meet the experts of the surgery version new technologies 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.049
 meet at 1:30 pm 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.360
 it's reliable it's the temple of robotic surgery 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.150
 the boss is him jacques marescaux a real star of the surgery of the future 

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:19.400
 six months I am personally convinced that one day 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.250
 the thing it will become automatic as the aeronautics goes more and more in 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.160
 the complete automatism the show in June will be just what we can call 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.570
 a superb yzeure he presses the button the gesture is done civil support 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.220
 interrupted he can at any time to resume the joysticks it is and 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.609
 Something is wrong 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.319
 here every year we train more than 3500 geosciences new technologies 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:42.799
 upon arrival 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:44.949
 but he looked tired 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:48.149
 the six added the Russian 

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:51.319
 it is in this room not less than 17 years operating table 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.319
 and to make the hand we practice on pigs 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.189
 direction now the research department of the institute this is where the 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.029
 mouse that has replaced the scalpel the researchers are able to create a 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:10.079
 exact copy of the patient's organs the principle was to replace 

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:13.109
 swimmer cqfd 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.269
 for a three-dimensional image that will see each publication 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.699
 by afssaps here for example tomorrow but if I play for each of the organs 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.510
 a rape Sunday ten days the heart 

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:31.609
 and then finally for the oldest is easier to prepare his act 

00:04:31.609 --> 00:04:33.740
 On the other hand 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.900
 m and it's a world first on this simulator the students can 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.279
 train on a virtual patient 

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:43.279
 after 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.520
 a piece at petanque level 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.050
 these are systems say around common efforts 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.490
 how to see in video games and pieces of forces same thing but 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.559
 for surgery 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.900
 the more the purpose of the exercise 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.900
 it's wasting the bleeding 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.409
 now 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:05.759
 the idea is to superimpose this virtual image 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.520
 on the patient and this is called augmented reality it allows to see 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.569
 in transparency and kill the patient 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:13.779
 it's an hour these ships 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:17.169
 as well as to replace exactly the same tools that we were 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.069
 previously passed through this one looks like science fiction 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:22.650
 but it already exists 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.990
 in the future surgeons will become more and more 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.810
 computer products
