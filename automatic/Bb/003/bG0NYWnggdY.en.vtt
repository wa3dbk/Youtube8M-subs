00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.500
 hello pleasure too goes family having 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.570
 only isolating itself chemistry technician from the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.290
 population living along the big river 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.020
 southern 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.160
 What I want now is the idea for this 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.499
 project that I have been developing 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.769
 started long before entering the 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:25.140
 research laboratory was in 2006 I 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.120
 had only 11 he missed region of the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.440
 disaster to my calm that university 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.320
 after a series of problems 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.390
 environmental company was contaminated 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.580
 throwing their toxic waste exactly 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.950
 in what is crowded into a 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.080
 time oil to use what means 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.730
 oxygen and all the animals that 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.360
 depended on this ecosystem 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.160
 dying 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.250
 I kept wondering if I had a 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.739
 sponge pneumonia to absorb all 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.750
 would not be too much trouble that it was 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.280
 that the sports governance laboratory 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.200
 I think that this material does not 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.390
 responds to nothing else was that this piece 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.630
 What are you giving here are pieces 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.490
 of milan tape that what I believe in her is 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.920
 a bone mineral from a shirt that 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.360
 factory people through a non- reaction 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.980
 identify with me of this material 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.090
 absorbs up to less than two centimeters 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.750
 cubic of sponge oil and there we 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.750
 can 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.039
 those who had eyes inside the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.640
 structure of this material by doing what it 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:33.179
 role of partner who is ten times 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.670
 other regions and also although separate 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.829
 and back would not be so resold 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.780
 when I started doing this project already 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.579
 had done several times if nobody 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.750
 has managed to do so far because it is 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.240
 you will succeed 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.039
 I spent about 15 hours a day in the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.649
 laboratory and every line I 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.360
 could be negative but the more 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.399
 aberrant no more he realizing the 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.500
 how passionate she was for research and 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.200
 How I wanted to make it happen? 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.599
 receive many nanos until the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.030
 get some simple and this sense and 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:05.819
 of institutions such as intel 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.560
 marketing need google marketing and 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.970
 several other national fairs and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.970
 events that was held at these events 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.920
 that I had the opportunity to know how the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.500
 has the potential to win 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.819
 for any challenge and I believe that 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.680
 The Brazilian is still going a long way. 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.470
 especially if we have this 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.470
 opportunity as is the movement I want 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.670
 I want to share our desires 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.819
 of our projects 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:34.790
 our struggle and joined forces to 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.790
 really change this country and this world
