00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.449
 we are all human 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:43.870
 each of us is not able to 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.870
 continue enough injustice 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.250
 a growing number of terrorist attacks 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.789
 emphasizes emanating from altered 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.789
 citizens danger 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:59.270
 I once remember that I can save the world and 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.270
 that's what came out of this magic to me 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:20.500
 sometimes you need to let go of the past and 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.500
 take long found to 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.460
 they worked in secrecy for years 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:31.100
 future managing lives 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.690
 managing information while not playing 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.690
 your game innocent die 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.140
 we will no longer sit back and 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:48.170
 not allowed to deny us rights and keep in 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:51.020
 fear and ignorance we will not allow 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.509
 painted themselves into ghettos and treat us 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:02:00.080
 as with outcasts we are ready to go to the extreme 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:02.770
 measures are not exchanged former rules 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.770
 no longer act 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.670
 too much pain 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.640
 too many lies 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.780
 their darkness is time to end 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.650
 it's a fight and your brother too 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.360
 the golden age will not come 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.810
 I will not allow it
