hose which goes up like this so there we

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.350 
hose which goes up like this so there we
go

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
go

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.200 
go
now<00:03:20.140> this<00:03:20.320> is<00:03:20.500> an<00:03:20.590> actual<00:03:20.740> faucet<00:03:21.400> but<00:03:22.030> due<00:03:22.180> to

the fence being here

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.580 
the fence being here
we<00:03:24.340> can't<00:03:24.610> pull<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.880> PVC<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.660> mean<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.020> copper

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
we can't pull the PVC I mean the copper

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.460 
we can't pull the PVC I mean the copper
pipe<00:03:26.770> out<00:03:27.010> we<00:03:27.910> put<00:03:28.120> a<00:03:28.180> male<00:03:28.420> plastic<00:03:29.170> thread

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
pipe out we put a male plastic thread

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.880 
pipe out we put a male plastic thread
into<00:03:29.770> the<00:03:29.860> copper<00:03:30.250> tight<00:03:31.180> seal<00:03:31.540> so<00:03:31.810> far<00:03:32.320> no

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
into the copper tight seal so far no

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.830 
into the copper tight seal so far no
leaks<00:03:33.160> strong<00:03:33.910> enough<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.270> support<00:03:34.450> this

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
leaks strong enough to support this

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.810 
leaks strong enough to support this
thing<00:03:35.110> -<00:03:35.610> so<00:03:36.690> we<00:03:37.690> have<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:38.020> PvP<00:03:38.620> back<00:03:39.550> the

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
thing - so we have the PvP back the

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.350 
thing - so we have the PvP back the
pressure<00:03:40.030> back<00:03:40.360> back<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:41.200> pressure<00:03:42.360> vacuum

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
pressure back back the pressure vacuum

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.290 
pressure back back the pressure vacuum
breaker<00:03:44.190> those<00:03:45.190> into<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.490> copper<00:03:45.820> this<00:03:45.940> was

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
breaker those into the copper this was

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.220 
breaker those into the copper this was
actually<00:03:46.510> a<00:03:47.910> faucet<00:03:48.910> we<00:03:49.600> took<00:03:49.750> it<00:03:49.900> out<00:03:50.020> and

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.160 
actually a faucet we took it out and
that's<00:03:50.980> constantly<00:03:51.340> on<00:03:51.820> now<00:03:52.060> but<00:03:52.570> we<00:03:52.660> cap<00:03:52.900> that

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
that's constantly on now but we cap that

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.370 
that's constantly on now but we cap that
and<00:03:54.040> then<00:03:54.310> it<00:03:54.400> goes<00:03:54.520> out<00:03:54.670> that<00:03:54.880> way<00:03:55.110> this<00:03:56.110> was

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
and then it goes out that way this was

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.830 
and then it goes out that way this was
actually<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:57.040> threads<00:03:57.820> are<00:03:57.970> very<00:03:58.000> very<00:03:58.480> small

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
actually the threads are very very small

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:06.000 
actually the threads are very very small
but<00:03:59.080> somehow<00:03:59.530> it<00:03:59.800> grips<00:04:00.070> so<00:04:02.880> that's<00:04:03.880> there<00:04:05.010> and

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
but somehow it grips so that's there and

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.699 
but somehow it grips so that's there and
now<00:04:06.190> we'll<00:04:06.430> do<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:06.730> back<00:04:07.060> zoom<00:04:07.360> which<00:04:08.350> is<00:04:08.500> zone

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
now we'll do the back zoom which is zone

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:18.380 
now we'll do the back zoom which is zone
4

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:31.610 

one<00:04:20.010> to<00:04:21.360> shoot

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.090 

there's<00:04:32.620> one<00:04:32.800> over<00:04:32.830> there<00:04:33.210> one<00:04:34.210> right<00:04:34.420> there

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
there's one over there one right there

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.550 
there's one over there one right there
that's<00:04:36.100> on<00:04:36.400> 4<00:04:36.760> and<00:04:37.240> this<00:04:37.720> is<00:04:37.780> their<00:04:37.990> last<00:04:38.200> thing

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
that's on 4 and this is their last thing

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:48.040 
that's on 4 and this is their last thing
so<00:04:39.550> 5

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.110 

that's<00:04:48.590> one<00:04:49.569> one<00:04:50.569> over<00:04:50.780> there<00:04:50.960> I<00:04:51.940> went<00:04:52.940> over

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
that's one one over there I went over

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:01.089 
that's one one over there I went over
there<00:04:53.270> and<00:04:56.949> that<00:04:57.949> would<00:04:58.099> be<00:04:58.220> zone<00:04:58.430> five<00:05:00.099> we

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
there and that would be zone five we

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:13.570 
there and that would be zone five we
shut<00:05:01.460> that<00:05:01.490> off<00:05:11.770> and<00:05:12.770> that<00:05:12.830> would<00:05:13.099> be<00:05:13.220> the<00:05:13.370> end

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
shut that off and that would be the end

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.770 
shut that off and that would be the end
the<00:05:13.970> irrigation<00:05:14.539> system<00:05:15.610> again<00:05:16.610> all<00:05:17.150> these<00:05:17.509> I

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
the irrigation system again all these I

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.550 
the irrigation system again all these I
dug<00:05:18.080> myself<00:05:18.770> here<00:05:19.639> are<00:05:19.729> the<00:05:19.819> trenches<00:05:20.560> about

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
dug myself here are the trenches about

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.180 
dug myself here are the trenches about
five<00:05:21.830> hundred<00:05:22.009> feet<00:05:22.190> of<00:05:22.490> pipe<00:05:23.500> was<00:05:24.500> dug<00:05:24.740> for

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
five hundred feet of pipe was dug for

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.860 
five hundred feet of pipe was dug for
this<00:05:25.280> project<00:05:25.759> very<00:05:26.259> very<00:05:27.259> tiring<00:05:27.759> all<00:05:28.870> five

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
this project very very tiring all five

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.080 
this project very very tiring all five
to<00:05:30.169> eight<00:05:30.319> inches<00:05:30.530> deep<00:05:30.860> and<00:05:33.849> that<00:05:34.849> would<00:05:34.940> be

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
to eight inches deep and that would be

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.529 
to eight inches deep and that would be
it<00:05:35.530> um<00:05:36.530> the<00:05:37.130> only<00:05:37.280> place<00:05:37.639> I<00:05:37.789> could<00:05:37.849> see<00:05:38.090> leak<00:05:38.330> is

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
it um the only place I could see leak is

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:41.830 
it um the only place I could see leak is
here<00:05:38.990> just<00:05:39.860> hoping<00:05:40.039> this<00:05:40.250> will<00:05:40.400> hold<00:05:40.840> because

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
here just hoping this will hold because

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.980 
here just hoping this will hold because
that<00:05:41.990> was<00:05:42.110> very<00:05:42.440> very<00:05:42.770> small<00:05:43.360> female<00:05:44.360> threads

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
that was very very small female threads

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.110 
that was very very small female threads
in<00:05:45.169> there<00:05:45.610> very<00:05:46.610> very<00:05:46.729> small<00:05:47.349> so<00:05:48.580> anyway<00:05:49.580> I'll

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
in there very very small so anyway I'll

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.749 
in there very very small so anyway I'll
keep<00:05:50.330> everybody<00:05:50.840> updated<00:05:51.050> and<00:05:51.500> that<00:05:51.639> would<00:05:52.639> be

pipe 3/4 tubing so is the mainline
copper<00:05:59.090> is<00:05:59.240> 1/2<00:05:59.449> inch<00:06:01.330> thank<00:06:02.330> you<00:06:02.419> for
