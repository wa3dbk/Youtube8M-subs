do in the PS 5 we're taking something

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.810 
do in the PS 5 we're taking something
that<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.920> notoriously<00:00:10.920> very<00:00:11.219> difficult<00:00:11.670> to

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
that is notoriously very difficult to

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.640 
that is notoriously very difficult to
photograph<00:00:12.000> especially<00:00:12.929> on<00:00:13.049> white<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.530> that

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.519 
photograph especially on white and that
is<00:00:13.710> glass<00:00:14.719> one<00:00:15.719> being<00:00:15.990> because<00:00:16.260> it's<00:00:16.410> very

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
is glass one being because it's very

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.710 
is glass one being because it's very
shiny<00:00:16.890> 2<00:00:17.279> because<00:00:17.640> it's<00:00:17.789> clear<00:00:18.240> it<00:00:18.539> doesn't

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
shiny 2 because it's clear it doesn't

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.240 
shiny 2 because it's clear it doesn't
show<00:00:18.960> up<00:00:19.109> really<00:00:19.260> well<00:00:19.470> on<00:00:19.650> white<00:00:19.890> there's<00:00:20.130> not

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
show up really well on white there's not

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.859 
show up really well on white there's not
a<00:00:20.279> lot<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.460> contrast<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.210> I'm<00:00:21.390> gonna<00:00:21.600> take<00:00:21.840> a

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
a lot of contrast so I'm gonna take a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.060 
a lot of contrast so I'm gonna take a
photo<00:00:22.340> just<00:00:23.340> as<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.910> with<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.330> PS<00:00:24.570> 5<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.260> show

photo just as is with the PS 5 and show

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.339 
photo just as is with the PS 5 and show
you<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.640> glass<00:00:27.599> jar<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.019> then<00:00:28.109> we're<00:00:28.230> going

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
you the glass jar and then we're going

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.620 
you the glass jar and then we're going
to<00:00:28.380> add<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:29.130> accent<00:00:29.580> lights<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.179> give<00:00:30.510> it

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
to add the accent lights and give it

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.389 
to add the accent lights and give it
some<00:00:30.810> backlighting<00:00:31.410> some<00:00:31.619> rim<00:00:31.800> lighting<00:00:32.160> you

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
some backlighting some rim lighting you

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.190 
some backlighting some rim lighting you
can<00:00:32.550> get<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.820> be<00:00:32.910> able<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.210> see<00:00:33.420> kind<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
can get to be able to see kind of the

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.870 
can get to be able to see kind of the
different<00:00:34.559> effects<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:34.950> can<00:00:35.130> get<00:00:35.610> with

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
different effects you can get with

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.180 
different effects you can get with
adding<00:00:36.300> separate<00:00:36.989> lights<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.860> we're<00:00:37.950> gonna<00:00:38.040> go

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
adding separate lights so we're gonna go

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.260 
adding separate lights so we're gonna go
ahead<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.399> take<00:00:38.489> this<00:00:38.579> first<00:00:38.820> photo

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
ahead and take this first photo

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.270 
ahead and take this first photo
I've<00:00:39.930> actually<00:00:40.110> switched<00:00:40.559> out<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> 50

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
I've actually switched out to a 50

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.860 
I've actually switched out to a 50
millimeter<00:00:41.460> lens<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.149> last<00:00:42.360> lens<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.719> was

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
millimeter lens the last lens I was

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.540 
millimeter lens the last lens I was
using<00:00:43.170> was<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> hundred<00:00:43.829> millimeter<00:00:44.250> macro

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
using was a hundred millimeter macro

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.880 
using was a hundred millimeter macro
lens<00:00:45.079> because<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.110> wanted<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.469> get<00:00:46.649> real

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
lens because I wanted to get real

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.190 
lens because I wanted to get real
close-up<00:00:47.370> detail<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> 50<00:00:48.809> millimeter

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
close-up detail this is a 50 millimeter

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.830 
close-up detail this is a 50 millimeter
lens<00:00:49.340> it's<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.399> little<00:00:50.579> bit<00:00:50.700> wider<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.629> if<00:00:51.750> you

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
lens it's a little bit wider so if you

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.270 
lens it's a little bit wider so if you
have<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> camera<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.440> maybe<00:00:52.559> has<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> zoom<00:00:53.039> lens

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
have a camera that maybe has a zoom lens

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.750 
have a camera that maybe has a zoom lens
on<00:00:53.520> obviously<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.399> smaller

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
on obviously for the the smaller

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.189 
on obviously for the the smaller
products<00:00:57.239> you're<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.660> zoomed<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.079> on

the larger products you're gonna zoom

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.099 
the larger products you're gonna zoom
out<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.670> little<00:00:59.789> bit<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.629> still<00:01:00.840> want<00:01:01.020> the

depth perception so we're going to go

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.590 
depth perception so we're going to go
ahead<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.170> take<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.530> photo<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.369> jar<00:01:14.820> we

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
left the glass jar in the exact same

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.730 
left the glass jar in the exact same
position<00:01:56.219> I've<00:01:56.700> added<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.600> al1<00:01:58.229> accent

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740

lights just kind of to the side and
behind<00:02:01.409> about<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.950> 45<00:02:02.399> degree<00:02:02.430> angle<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.299> either

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
behind about a 45 degree angle to either

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.130 
behind about a 45 degree angle to either
side<00:02:04.740> these<00:02:05.490> are<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.729> al1<00:02:06.030> accent<00:02:06.570> lights<00:02:06.750> and

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
we're going to go ahead and take a photo

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.160 
we're going to go ahead and take a photo
and<00:02:08.759> then<00:02:09.330> I'm<00:02:09.420> gonna<00:02:09.539> move<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.810> accent

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
kind of look you're going for so we just

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.870 
kind of look you're going for so we just
kind<00:02:23.620> of<00:02:23.650> play<00:02:23.830> around<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.160> lights<00:02:24.370> with<00:02:24.850> the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
kind of play around the lights with the

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.280 
kind of play around the lights with the
lights<00:02:25.240> until<00:02:25.540> you<00:02:25.660> get<00:02:25.840> something<00:02:26.170> you're

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
lights until you get something you're

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.270 
lights until you get something you're
looking<00:02:26.500> for<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:26.770> now<00:02:26.890> I'm<00:02:26.980> going<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.160> bring

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
looking for so now I'm going to bring

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.510 
looking for so now I'm going to bring
the<00:02:27.370> lights<00:02:27.580> a<00:02:28.050> little<00:02:29.050> bit<00:02:29.170> more<00:02:29.500> directly<00:02:30.280> to

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
the lights a little bit more directly to

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.520 
the lights a little bit more directly to
the<00:02:30.640> side<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:31.270> it<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:34.110> also<00:02:35.110> because<00:02:35.380> I've

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
the side of it and also because I've

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.530 
the side of it and also because I've
added<00:02:35.680> more<00:02:35.950> light<00:02:36.190> I<00:02:36.400> have<00:02:37.000> increased<00:02:37.330> the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
added more light I have increased the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.870 
added more light I have increased the
shutter<00:02:37.780> speed<00:02:38.110> to<00:02:38.140> about<00:02:38.500> 200<00:02:39.130> of<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.490> second

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
shutter speed to about 200 of a second

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.020 
shutter speed to about 200 of a second
so<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.150> don't<00:02:40.390> over<00:02:40.690> expose<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.350> image<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:42.030> see

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
so I don't over expose the image and see

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.960 
so I don't over expose the image and see
how<00:02:43.180> that<00:02:43.330> changes<00:02:43.720> everything

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
how that changes everything

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.340 
how that changes everything
so<00:02:45.970> again<00:02:46.209> just<00:02:46.420> some<00:02:46.540> real<00:02:46.750> subtle

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
so again just some real subtle

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.400 
so again just some real subtle
differences<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.700> accent<00:02:49.060> lights<00:02:49.239> add<00:02:49.570> just

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
differences the accent lights add just

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.590 
differences the accent lights add just
another<00:02:50.709> measure<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.100> flexibility<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:52.570> you

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
another measure of flexibility so you

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.090 
another measure of flexibility so you
can<00:02:52.810> be<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:52.959> little<00:02:53.170> bit<00:02:53.290> more<00:02:53.410> creative<00:02:53.800> and

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
can be a little bit more creative and

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.160 
can be a little bit more creative and
get<00:02:54.280> some<00:02:54.489> different<00:02:54.640> looks<00:02:55.030> with<00:02:55.900> different

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
get some different looks with different

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.900 
get some different looks with different
types<00:02:56.350> of<00:02:56.500> items<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:57.190> next<00:02:57.370> we're<00:02:57.550> gonna<00:02:57.610> do

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
types of items so next we're gonna do

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.210 
types of items so next we're gonna do
one<00:02:58.840> more<00:02:58.870> shot<00:02:59.320> but<00:02:59.560> we're<00:02:59.680> going<00:02:59.770> to<00:02:59.830> use<00:03:00.010> a

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
one more shot but we're going to use a

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.140 
one more shot but we're going to use a
white<00:03:00.790> item<00:03:01.209> on<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.480> colored<00:03:01.870> background<00:03:02.440> and

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
white item on a colored background and

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.380 
white item on a colored background and
show<00:03:04.150> you<00:03:04.209> how<00:03:04.390> that<00:03:04.450> works<00:03:05.880> all<00:03:06.880> right<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:07.239> now

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
show you how that works all right so now

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.030 
show you how that works all right so now
we've<00:03:07.600> put<00:03:07.870> in<00:03:08.140> here<00:03:08.410> with<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.620> gray

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
we've put in here with the gray

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.699 
we've put in here with the gray
background<00:03:09.870> some<00:03:10.870> white<00:03:11.050> candles<00:03:11.560> they're

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
background some white candles they're

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.350 
background some white candles they're
slightly<00:03:11.980> off-white<00:03:12.280> but<00:03:12.760> they<00:03:12.940> still<00:03:13.209> would

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
slightly off-white but they still would

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.300 
slightly off-white but they still would
not<00:03:13.540> show<00:03:13.870> up<00:03:14.050> very<00:03:14.590> well<00:03:14.709> on<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.100> white

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
not show up very well on the white

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.250 
not show up very well on the white
background<00:03:15.519> so<00:03:16.120> we've<00:03:16.360> put<00:03:16.930> in<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.110> gray

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
background so we've put in the gray

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.350 
background so we've put in the gray
insert<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:17.860> we're<00:03:17.950> going<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:18.130> take<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.670> photo

insert and we're going to take a photo
with<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.769> turn<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:20.890> lights<00:03:21.070> off<00:03:21.250> again<00:03:21.930> and
