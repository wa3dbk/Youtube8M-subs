00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:08.370
 hello channel people 12 projects 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:12.780
 today I came to bring my brand knife 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.469
 model 168-a from the bay here to 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:01:43.860
 you 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:01:45.570
 the bay already have and I do not think lead to 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.700
 piece for seating 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.180
 I think it's more of a collection 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.100
 because it is not of low quality but 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:00.240
 also the reason is very low 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.570
 so I would not recommend relying on it for 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.560
 sing practice 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.560
 the piece any such thing is then the 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.460

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.830

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.140
 video my cell phone and take me face 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.750
 What happened is happening at school? 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:25.430

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.020
