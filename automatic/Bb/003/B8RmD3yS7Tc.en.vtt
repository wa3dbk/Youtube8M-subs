 In this tutorial, I'll show you how to change the wallpaper. 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:21.600
 Basically, you have a wallpaper on your iPhone. 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.519
 Users can change them at will 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.910
 Wallpapers am able to set the home screen and lock screen 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.560
 You can change both places at the same time with the same text or photos. 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.560
 You can change each one right 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.480
 It is home row that you look at seeing . 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.480
 And 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.460
 This is the lock screen 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.560
 Changing the wallpaper is very simple 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:00.610
 Open the Settings app and change it. 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:06.190
 Set app is used to set the iPhone's small Eun environment 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:12.580
 Therefore, given the circumstances of the iPhone when the highs if you switch to open the solution 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:16.420
 Let's set it up . 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:20.670
 I will select the picture below this wallpaper 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:24.690
 I have a list of diplomatic contacts. 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:30.450
 The top of the wallpaper is to be built 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:32.130
 And the camera roll is a picture taken from the iPhone or taken from another place 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.690
 There are 5 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.860
 Then, to change the photo stream, 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.740
 Will 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:48.030
 For example, on my other iPhone, iPod touch or iPad, 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:52.619
 The photos are automatically shown on this iPhone. 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.830
 This is a setup that you do not have. 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:00.210
 I'll explain this in more detail next. 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:03.540
 First of all, we will use the default background picture 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.110
 I'll touch the backdrop 2 times 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.190
 Here I am 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.350
 I will choose a fall foliage. 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:17.250
 I tried setting up 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.250
 I'll set up the lock screen . 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.310
 If you are healthy 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:33.300
 Haryeoni leaves you can see jangdong 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.300

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:43.010
 So this time the change Well's home screen to change the wallpaper on the screen form 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.010
 I'll do it 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.680
 For further explanation, this time 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.680
 Let's use Palm Era Roll. 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.860
 If it is for you 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.780
 uh 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:08.800
 You might have noticed that it was a little bit different last year and two chapters . 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:15.630
 Imagine that there's a phrase about movement and resizing. 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:18.970
 This is basically what is on the iPhone, 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.510
 You do not have to resize it because it's set. 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:26.980
 But is this a picture from another place? 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:30.760
 You need to Newark seasons so that'm going to be especially temperance 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:35.049
 I open it like this and control the air. 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:38.829
 So I can adjust it again and go 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:47.340
 I did the adjustment and I tried to set it up. 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:47.340
