00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.920
 hello to the whole world 6 leo face 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.050
 we find some new news 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.570
 about minecraft and specifically about 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.280
 minecraft for everyone who does not know 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.710
 that is your ruiz are the servers 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.330
 that you can get on the page 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.860
 mollendo moment are working a year 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.090
 good are servers that lend you 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.100
 minecraft in exchange for a certain 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.660
 amount of money and servers where 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.830
 You can play with your friends and others but 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.630
 as I say they are servera that also 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.710
 developed the moment they are in beta 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.510
 and testing different things and have 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.190
 established a new idea and that is in 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.630
 those minecraft servers and the power 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.430
 make your world I'm going to make a world 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.559
 normal and current can be a world of 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.000
 mini games here in question be 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.930
 seeing the first image say that the 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.430
 full video I'll leave it at the 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.950
 description of a video uploaded by jeff 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.540
 to the youtube page of May but now 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.829
 Take some snapshots to explain 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.239
 what is this spanish video about? 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.969
 logically since the video is in English 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.260
 and well this snapshot is the menu 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.149
 options of your world from other mixtures 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.480
 real and how you see and an option that you 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.430
 allows in English says suites your mini 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.619
 game means configure by 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.080
 say it a mini game and once you hit 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.270
 that option will show you a message that 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.930
 says this change to replace your 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.750
 normal world 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.700
 to a mini game world but over time 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.080
 you can change to the normal world is 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.120
 say you can establish that the world of 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.980
 Suddenly it's a game or a mini game 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.300
 better said but then you can remove that 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.740
 option when you want and go back to 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.330
 world normal and current survival without 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.250
 lose nothing if you have a house there 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.160
 you will lose that house is to alternate between 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.540
 two worlds and once you select a 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.610
 minigame you give the option to please 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.810
 mega selection and within sanction that 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.490
 this option will appear and appreciate the 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.890
 different maps of mini-games that 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.450
 you can put the moment there are five are 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.390
 you are looking at the screen where 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.490
 there are defenses 2 dsv of black disk 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.950
 zombie version that of being blind the 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.690
 world the hype and be auto split of set 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.000
 blind also like we also 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.860
 we find with hof dum drag that is 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.210
 I do not know him I took him earlier 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.460
 I know him but this one what is the 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.350
 dragon dragons sweet queens insurance name 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.840
 quite strange I know but good as 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.130
 you see a video game that currently a lot 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.930
 people know the minecraft servers 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.590
 like high pixel a well-known server 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.330
 the world and a well-known pvp game 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.680
 for the people who play minecraft and 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.239
 basically what you can do is that 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.739
 your server is during a period of 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.100
 time when you want 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.230
 wolf 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.090
 splif or the currency you want 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.070
 basically it's that and once elections 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.170
 the mini-games you give to select and 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.480
 when you enter the game you will have your 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.310
 world turned into a video game in 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.650
 this case screen is boiling the of 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.510
 zombie see his blog that is created by 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.910
 simple and if I remember correctly and it is 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.230
 hold waves of zombie is already and 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.340
 will set the news of guys 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.840
 the idea is really quite good 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.730
 to be able to turn your world into a world 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.350
 minigame as long as it's in the 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.450
 if you have a server 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.560
 minecraft you have to emphasize that only 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.900
 will serve minecraft servers 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.610
 final this idea that has a lot and is a 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.930
 walk in process ie they are 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.000
 working on it is a job that 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.680
 is a process is still a beta and 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.140
 they are trying it hard so that the 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.880
 better in the best way possible and this 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.230
 it really is a marketing strategy 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.850
 since with this option 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.230
 many people will need to buy the 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.060
 servers of my creation because if 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.080
 you have this option things that others 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.430
 normal and current servers that 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.080
 buy out there do not have that option 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.910
 you will have to download the plug and in 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.370
 install them and so on and in this way 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.780
 you will have everything at once with mike himself 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.340
 you put them I want this minigame and if 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.660
 they are automatically without you doing anything 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.730
 and it is quite in this strategy of 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.050
 marketing by moya and show 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.060
 that here below leave in your 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.890
 opinions and what ego told me 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.200
 you there are a lot of 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.290
 minigames that as you see here alone and 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.300
 five but my class total modality and 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.470
 very broad of different video games and 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.819
 good to comment why you think the 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.860
 news to me I love as I say 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.989
 first nothing more guys if you liked 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.610
 the video on is the comment x but 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.650
 costs nothing and we see that the next 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.310
 video to another 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.310
 goodbye
