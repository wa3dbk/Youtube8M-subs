00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
that I could get the pump on the same

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.150 
that I could get the pump on the same
connect<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.079> right<00:00:43.230> up<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> existing

included with that were included with
the<00:01:06.270> pump<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.490> adapted

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the pump and I I adapted

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.039 
the pump and I I adapted
I<00:01:10.280> bought<00:01:11.280> their<00:01:11.490> 3-way<00:01:11.850> switch<00:01:12.180> but<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.720> didn't

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
I bought their 3-way switch but I didn't

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.170 
I bought their 3-way switch but I didn't
really<00:01:13.140> like<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.799> I<00:01:14.430> bought<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> couple<00:01:14.909> of

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
really like it so I bought a couple of

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.200 
really like it so I bought a couple of
different<00:01:15.540> switches<00:01:15.930> here<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.170> bought<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
different switches here I bought a

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.539 
different switches here I bought a
switch<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.600> left<00:01:18.810> here<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.799> 3-way

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
switch on the left here is a 3-way

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.399 
switch on the left here is a 3-way
switch<00:01:20.820> just<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.450> normal<00:01:21.720> household<00:01:22.049> 3-way

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
switch just a normal household 3-way

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.899 
switch just a normal household 3-way
switch<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.920> one<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.430> right<00:01:23.610> is<00:01:23.880> a

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
switch and the one on the right is a

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.910 
switch and the one on the right is a
standard<00:01:25.460> just<00:01:26.460> on/off<00:01:27.150> two-way<00:01:27.920> and

basically what I did was I I tapped in
the<00:01:33.240> 3<00:01:33.479> way<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> control<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> high<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.500> low

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the 3 way to control the high and low

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.950 
the 3 way to control the high and low
speed<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.820> can<00:01:35.850> see<00:01:36.180> here<00:01:36.450> I've<00:01:36.630> got<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
speed and you can see here I've got the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.569 
speed and you can see here I've got the
blue<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.619> red<00:01:37.650> wire<00:01:38.009> which<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
blue and the red wire which is the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.149 
blue and the red wire which is the
orange<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.360> Eco<00:01:39.840> pump<00:01:41.570> schematic<00:01:42.570> and

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
orange on the Eco pump schematic and

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.440 
orange on the Eco pump schematic and
that's<00:01:44.159> controlling<00:01:44.670> again<00:01:44.970> high<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.299> low

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
that's controlling again high and low

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.039 
that's controlling again high and low
speed<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.990> then<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.890> white<00:01:47.100> on<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.420> 3-way<00:01:48.780> is

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
speed and then the white on the 3-way is

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.870 
speed and then the white on the 3-way is
the<00:01:49.229> common<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.250> can<00:01:50.369> see<00:01:50.520> I've<00:01:50.640> got<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
the common and you can see I've got the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.179 
the common and you can see I've got the
common<00:01:51.299> fed<00:01:51.479> over<00:01:51.630> here<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.200> I'm<00:01:52.920> breaking

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
common fed over here and I'm breaking

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.800 
common fed over here and I'm breaking
that<00:01:53.520> power<00:01:53.880> off<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:55.229> line<00:01:55.740> 1<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.299> then<00:01:57.299> line<00:01:57.540> 2

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
that power off of line 1 and then line 2

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.620 
that power off of line 1 and then line 2
is<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.369> white<00:01:59.369> with<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.670> black<00:01:59.939> tape<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.450> it

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
is this white with a black tape on it

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.179 
is this white with a black tape on it
that<00:02:00.780> goes<00:02:01.020> that's<00:02:01.469> going<00:02:01.680> directly<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.159> the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
that goes that's going directly to the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.600 
that goes that's going directly to the
pump<00:02:02.490> for<00:02:02.850> line<00:02:03.030> 2<00:02:03.799> and<00:02:04.799> basically<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.579> way

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
pump for line 2 and basically the way

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.330 
pump for line 2 and basically the way
I've<00:02:05.909> got<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.149> set<00:02:06.479> up<00:02:06.509> here<00:02:06.960> it's<00:02:07.170> not<00:02:07.409> powered

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
I've got it set up here it's not powered

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.880 
I've got it set up here it's not powered
right<00:02:08.520> now<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:10.560> when<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.459> you

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
right now is when the you

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.250 
right now is when the you
when<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.980> pool<00:02:14.160> pump<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.580> timer<00:02:14.850> is<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:15.270> and

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
when the pool pump the timer is on and

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.390 
when the pool pump the timer is on and
it's<00:02:16.410> gonna<00:02:16.500> run<00:02:16.800> my<00:02:16.980> idea<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.430> run<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.640> 24/7

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
it's gonna run my idea is to run a 24/7

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
it's gonna run my idea is to run a 24/7
this<00:02:20.400> switch<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:21.000> going<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.660> break<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:23.580> power

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
this switch is going to break the power

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.080 
this switch is going to break the power
to<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.750> pump<00:02:24.960> on<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.710> common<00:02:26.100> side<00:02:26.310> there<00:02:26.580> so

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
to the pump on the common side there so

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.890 
to the pump on the common side there so
what<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.270> can<00:02:27.450> do<00:02:27.570> is<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.870> can<00:02:27.980> turn<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.100> pump<00:02:29.310> off

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
what I can do is I can turn the pump off

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.080 
what I can do is I can turn the pump off
and<00:02:30.900> change<00:02:31.200> my<00:02:31.410> speed<00:02:31.710> higher<00:02:31.980> low<00:02:32.250> highs<00:02:32.670> up

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
and change my speed higher low highs up

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.530 
and change my speed higher low highs up
low<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.720> down<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.730> checked<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.240> last<00:02:36.360> night

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
low is down and I checked it last night

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.560 
low is down and I checked it last night
and<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.930> pump<00:02:37.170> is<00:02:37.350> working<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:38.190> it's<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.450> if

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
and the pump is working and it's and if

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.000 
and the pump is working and it's and if
not<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.900> all<00:02:39.990> you<00:02:40.080> have<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:40.350> is<00:02:40.500> swap<00:02:40.740> the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
not you all you have to do is swap the

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.250 
not you all you have to do is swap the
red<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.370> blue<00:02:42.110> connections<00:02:43.110> on<00:02:43.230> the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
red and the blue connections on the

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260 
red and the blue connections on the
switch<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:44.070> you've<00:02:44.250> got<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.460> switching<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.210> the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
switch so you've got a switching in the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.540 
switch so you've got a switching in the
right<00:02:45.420> direction<00:02:45.570> I<00:02:46.050> just<00:02:46.710> felt<00:02:46.860> like<00:02:46.920> high<00:02:47.190> up

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
right direction I just felt like high up

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.970 
right direction I just felt like high up
make<00:02:47.970> more<00:02:48.180> sense<00:02:48.420> low<00:02:48.840> down<00:02:49.140> made<00:02:49.440> sense<00:02:49.710> and

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
make more sense low down made sense and

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.440 
make more sense low down made sense and
I'm<00:02:50.160> gonna<00:02:50.280> mark<00:02:50.520> these<00:02:50.760> switches<00:02:51.150> with<00:02:51.300> some

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
I'm gonna mark these switches with some

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.530 
I'm gonna mark these switches with some
stickers<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.050> again<00:02:52.770> here<00:02:52.980> on<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.430> off<00:02:53.550> so<00:02:54.180> I

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
stickers and again here on and off so I

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.180 
stickers and again here on and off so I
don't<00:02:54.900> want<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.320> change<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.710> speed<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:56.010> the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
don't want to change the speed of the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.550 
don't want to change the speed of the
pump<00:02:56.400> while<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.820> pump<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.150> running<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:58.020> turn

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
pump while the pump is running so turn

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.100 
pump while the pump is running so turn
the<00:02:58.680> pump<00:02:58.890> off<00:02:59.100> change<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.030> speed<00:03:00.300> turn<00:03:00.990> the

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
the pump off change the speed turn the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.320 
the pump off change the speed turn the
pump<00:03:01.320> on<00:03:01.500> works<00:03:02.490> out<00:03:02.670> really<00:03:02.850> well

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
pump on works out really well

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.140 
pump on works out really well
and<00:03:03.420> I'm<00:03:04.110> satisfied<00:03:04.380> with<00:03:04.860> that<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:05.070> this<00:03:05.940> is

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
and I'm satisfied with that so this is

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.110 
and I'm satisfied with that so this is
the<00:03:06.630> electrical<00:03:07.170> is<00:03:07.290> done<00:03:07.670> again<00:03:08.670> I've<00:03:08.850> got<00:03:09.000> it

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
the electrical is done again I've got it

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.580 
the electrical is done again I've got it
wired<00:03:09.300> up<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.750> pump<00:03:09.990> I<00:03:10.170> just<00:03:10.410> need<00:03:10.500> to

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
wired up to the pump I just need to

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.870 
wired up to the pump I just need to
connect<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:10.920> grounds<00:03:11.340> in<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.460> back<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.820> the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
connect the grounds in the back of the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.000 
connect the grounds in the back of the
chassis<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.330> motors<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:12.990> right<00:03:13.710> now<00:03:13.830> I'm

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
chassis the motors and right now I'm

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.150 
chassis the motors and right now I'm
starting<00:03:14.550> my<00:03:14.580> plumbing<00:03:15.620> made<00:03:16.620> a<00:03:16.650> couple<00:03:16.920> of

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
starting my plumbing made a couple of

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.240 
starting my plumbing made a couple of
small<00:03:17.610> changes<00:03:17.640> one<00:03:18.270> being<00:03:18.480> I<00:03:18.690> added<00:03:19.140> I<00:03:19.350> used

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
small changes one being I added I used

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.550 
small changes one being I added I used
to<00:03:20.340> have<00:03:20.460> a<00:03:20.640> spigot<00:03:21.480> here<00:03:21.960> that<00:03:22.170> would<00:03:22.320> for

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
to have a spigot here that would for

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.710 
to have a spigot here that would for
draining<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.010> pool<00:03:23.160> I<00:03:23.490> added<00:03:24.240> a<00:03:24.330> 3-way<00:03:24.690> valve

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
draining the pool I added a 3-way valve

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.710 
draining the pool I added a 3-way valve
now<00:03:25.500> if<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.550> turn<00:03:26.820> it<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.360> know<00:03:27.450> into<00:03:27.630> the

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
now if I turn it you know into the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.750 
now if I turn it you know into the
opposite<00:03:28.050> direction<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:29.160> water<00:03:29.400> is<00:03:29.580> diverted

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
opposite direction the water is diverted

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.760 
opposite direction the water is diverted
and<00:03:30.270> pumped<00:03:30.570> out<00:03:30.690> of<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.930> pool<00:03:31.110> and<00:03:31.440> into<00:03:31.560> the

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
and pumped out of the pool and into the

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.700 
and pumped out of the pool and into the
yard<00:03:31.980> towards<00:03:32.490> the<00:03:32.760> camera<00:03:33.000> here<00:03:33.360> and<00:03:33.710> and

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
yard towards the camera here and and

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.380 
yard towards the camera here and and
then<00:03:34.860> of<00:03:34.980> course<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.430> had<00:03:35.670> to<00:03:35.700> relocate

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
then of course I had to relocate

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.930 
then of course I had to relocate
I<00:03:36.660> had<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.290> move<00:03:37.380> things<00:03:37.530> around<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.950> bit<00:03:37.980> the

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
I had to move things around a bit the

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.580 
I had to move things around a bit the
pump<00:03:39.180> needed<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.540> move<00:03:39.690> over<00:03:40.080> was<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.350> little

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
pump needed to move over was a little

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.640 
pump needed to move over was a little
bit<00:03:40.680> different<00:03:41.570> from<00:03:42.570> the<00:03:42.780> Jandy<00:03:43.170> that<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.410> had

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
bit different from the Jandy that I had

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.230 
bit different from the Jandy that I had
and<00:03:43.950> then<00:03:44.190> I<00:03:44.250> moved<00:03:44.460> the<00:03:44.520> pump<00:03:44.730> over<00:03:44.850> so<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.060> have

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
and then I moved the pump over so I have

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.110 
and then I moved the pump over so I have
to<00:03:45.330> replumb<00:03:45.690> all<00:03:45.870> this<00:03:46.520> so<00:03:47.520> I'm<00:03:47.730> gonna<00:03:47.850> come

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
to replumb all this so I'm gonna come

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.630 
to replumb all this so I'm gonna come
back<00:03:48.330> here<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.840> about<00:03:49.290> in<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.340> next<00:03:50.460> video

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
back here and about in the next video
