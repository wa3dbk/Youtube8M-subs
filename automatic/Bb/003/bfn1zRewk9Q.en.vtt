00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:17.400
 Tell me guys about gamer 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.259
 today we are here with another video and 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.090
 today, as you can see on the 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.539
 video description I'm with a 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.239
 automatic sensor concealer that same 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.070
 You did not see anything at all, nothing that I 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:32.850
 I tightened it 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.910
 I simply relay this in this block 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.930
 here I just leaned in and it's not the right 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.450
 that it will open or close our 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.499
 door that our hiding place here 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:50.539
 inside and here I did just that 

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:52.350
 a simple yes for enchantment is 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.149
 of items 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.159
 I will not use this just for the 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.739
 demonstration right here or press the 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:02.489
 button, or close the button. 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.040
 it opens so it's very simple 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.690
 This hiding place and I'm going to teach you 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.620
 how do you do 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.450
 Let's go to our tutorial then you 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.260
 who is interested to see how this 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.780
 it works 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.150
 first let's put two benches in the 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.280
 diagonal I do not know if the diagonal but 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.890
 put two blocks that way I go 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.170
 I laughed at three in height 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.910
 in this one you will put three blocks 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.090
 1 2 3 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:32.190
 The third you put another one here you 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.130
 put on a regular workout and a workout 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.500
 normal here again and here in the middle 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.140
 you put previous of the sector that has 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.420
 this red business in the middle here and 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.520
 You can already break and put a block 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.980
 so the car would not go out 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.430
 You can already leave your cart and 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:54.060
 when you touch here is he 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.700
 Will go back slowly and will 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.450
 catch what you want but have a 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.070
 however 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.680
 We're going to have to do it in a 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.260
 it does not take so long because the 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.120
 Our final door will take a century 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.970
 to be able to be activated 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.269
 so here it is on the side of the detector 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.000
 you put a block leaves a space and 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.970
 put two more that you did not put 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.019
 nothing to leave the issue with the slime and 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.750
 a block 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:25.230
 This way up ahead you 're going to leave 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:29.580
 a level 3 repeater 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:33.840
 on the front you put a redstone and a 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.819
 repeater after you take your that 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.060
 they are with the slime here in front and 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:42.569
 put a deer in here and another one upset 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.000
 here is two blocks away 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.340
 that's when you put a stone and more 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.280
 two stones here on top of one side you 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:55.049
 will put two torches of tony network and 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.900
 here's the head tone here in this block 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:02.549
 you gonna break it 's put a band 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:05.640
 redstone here you will leave a 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.579
 stone network is now how to leave this theme 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.019
 here aside and let's do our door 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.239
 we do our part and we 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.510
 do that system that can not do it for you 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:19.379
 see nothing and you put 24 blocks in 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:24.569
 blocks 14 issues with islaine so 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:27.180
 four more here you jump 12 341 room 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.419
 you will put four more pistons with 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:35.160
 online 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:37.470
 So there are people put here then 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.290
 continuing it will stay this way 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.440
 here you can put your stone and here 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.230
 in front and puts more stone in our 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.489
 Taken today admiring hit is nothing. 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.950
 But beauty then you cover here and in the 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.079
 We will break the bottom you do not 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.540
 know this system I'm going through 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.060
 quickly if you know you can skip 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.280
 this part here because it's very simple 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.410
 I think most of you there. 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:10.980
 I know it's you, you want, you leave one. 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.799
 level more by a ladder and copper 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.549
 here with redstone you put a fee 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.139
 1 in each corner and a repeater here 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.830
 put a stone in front a stone in 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:25.110
 Above and a net stone here you go 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:28.919
 do the same procedure here as the other 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:32.510
 side puts our our repeater one 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:38.169
 block on the front and another on top tony 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:41.139
 level 4 and if repeat here puts level 4 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.840
 here in that corner that the stone level 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:46.210
 the larger you want a two blocks of 12 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.939
 blocks so we can put a 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:52.240
 repeater which is a torch and see if it is 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:55.090
 working right our envy is not 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.810
 weave tapping ti night I did wrong 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.810
 here if not so wrong but you will see 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.930
 on top of that rate you put a block 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.749
 and puts another blow and then on the 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:12.249
 from above you cover copper like this 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:14.680
 I'm showing up there after you 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:18.189
 you're covered all this you're going 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.039
 put here a redstone and here a 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:23.259
 repeater here at the front and place 27 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.189
 Tony a block forward but two seven 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:27.819
 tony 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:29.979
 so we can disable and 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:31.870
 after you've been there to see if you're 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:36.069
 everything will be fine, there will be 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:39.370
 normalzinho then we break it 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:41.800
 will close this wall will be smooth if 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.020
 it's flat like that, it 's you 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.800
 is doing everything right if it did not work 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.800
 This review to make it right I know 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.830
 that ours is not your hiding place 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.949
 here you can break and we will have 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:06:00.550
 Let's hook it up here. 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:04.509
 I do not think we 'll do better. 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.729
 on this other side there is no connection 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:09.490
 so here you will break what the 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.889
 our competitor and here our network 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:16.089
 Tony, how can we make a ladder for us? 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:20.499
 call up and if that redstone here then 

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:24.099
 Let's see, here, we lean, it's worth going. 

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:25.210
 change the block and it will pass energy and 

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:27.550
 open the door 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:31.960
 ready we made to open the door 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:34.569
 but we have not yet made the button on the 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:38.289
 inside to be able to close when 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:40.330
 you're hiding there so let's do 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:42.879
 our part here for us 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:46.240
 put our button and I'll do this 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:49.509
 wall not so big and I think until 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.729
 Only the missing ceiling is here. 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:54.819
 then our botton is 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:57.669
 that only wall the button after that I 

00:06:54.819 --> 00:07:02.680
 I'll leave a block and I'll get it. 

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:04.240
 redstone and a deck on the side of this 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:08.889
 redstone you will leave two more 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:11.229
 blocks a nif front repeater and a 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:14.229
 Make network here I'll get the button 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:16.029
 To put it here, I did it here. 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:18.849
 I picked the button then when people 

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:21.759
 press here 

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:23.710
 here he will change the globe and will close 

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:26.740
 our door and when we are here 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:30.939
 it will open and when we touch 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:32.919
 here it will close you already can is so 

00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:35.830
 pathogen here just the way you want it 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:37.569
 so no link can appear 

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.729
 but be careful not to cut any 

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:43.180
 because otherwise it will give error 

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:44.699
 you only make the wall and straight is that already 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:48.099
 closed 

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:49.029
 It may already be the way you want it 

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:52.509
 behind 

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:55.330
 If you liked it and want to help me judge it 

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:57.729
 this video do not forget to collaborate 

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.830
 with the US and what a favorite if you do not 

00:07:57.729 --> 00:08:03.669
 enrolled in the channel is enrolled by clicking 

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:06.999
 in on the button then remembering 

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:10.569
 video every friday a hug one 

00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:13.379
 big hug and another hug a kiss and 

00:08:10.569 --> 00:08:13.379
 went
