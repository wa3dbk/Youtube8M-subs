can<00:02:49.430> line<00:02:49.700> them<00:02:49.880> up<00:02:50.060> for<00:02:50.600> doing<00:02:50.840> you<00:02:51.500> know<00:02:51.590> up

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
can line them up for doing you know up

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.430 
can line them up for doing you know up
to<00:02:51.770> six<00:02:52.220> feet<00:02:52.460> long<00:02:52.490> five<00:02:53.120> feet<00:02:53.480> long<00:02:53.720> and

to six feet long five feet long and

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.420 
to six feet long five feet long and
they'll<00:02:55.370> line<00:02:55.610> up<00:02:55.640> parallel<00:02:56.030> or<00:02:56.720> together

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
they'll line up parallel or together

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.280 
they'll line up parallel or together
then<00:02:58.430> we<00:02:58.640> make<00:02:58.850> another<00:02:58.880> batch<00:02:59.540> for<00:03:00.140> these

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
two by four foot well now use this for

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.100 
two by four foot well now use this for
doing<00:03:12.770> your<00:03:13.040> smaller<00:03:13.400> parts<00:03:16.240> and<00:03:17.240> it's<00:03:17.840> just<00:03:18.020> a

and all the rest of stuff to kind of
trick<00:03:25.580> underneath<00:03:26.120> but<00:03:26.630> it's<00:03:26.810> got<00:03:26.960> the<00:03:27.170> best

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
trick underneath but it's got the best

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.800 
trick underneath but it's got the best
of<00:03:27.710> everything<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.490> this<00:03:29.180> does<00:03:29.420> not<00:03:29.450> make

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
of everything and this does not make

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.220 
of everything and this does not make
much<00:03:30.080> death<00:03:30.670> much<00:03:31.670> dust<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:32.660> where<00:03:32.870> he<00:03:32.960> said
