00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.120
 accompanied by the n 94 cross charger 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.120

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.800
 94 gameplay this will be the third of the 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.660
 week 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.160
 yes it's not live I had planned 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.350
 to make you live but ultimately 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.100
 I could not really play this week 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.450
 I was able to really coc that Wednesday 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.290

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.450
 support etc 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.370
 so it's true that I do not play too much 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.540
 not too much housing to record 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.829
 voice because I did not know yet 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.030
 how to do good there they explained to me 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.520
 so normally I should be able to you 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.720
 get out more than 150 kg live with 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.660
 all we say to the microphone and that's 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.220
 like that you can see but here it is 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.809
 today I had to do live I 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.480

 first promised the weekend is going to be 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.080
 really crazy crazy crazy 

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:11.030
 bartering and I can do in e mode by 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.350
 10 year old meuse 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.720
 what is this weekend really 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.000
 gameplay goes crazy who have me with the 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.850
 so today we start with 1,160 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.440
 at 4 as Thursday on the map mme haidar 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.150
 tomorrow we're going to have one hundred and seventy 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.799
 seven to eight I remember of course the 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.479
 map yemen and finally we will finish Sunday 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.670
 with a new more than 200 t he so 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.260
 208 in troyes where I will make you 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.939
 small explanations on the more than 200 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.619
 they pass that there are people 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.240
 who say yeah it 's bouilh it's 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.439
 all because it is true that there are 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.119
 people who play sports ladle but that 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.950
 I'll come back on Sunday it's 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.299
 not the subject of the day even if it's true 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.140
 that today actually I have no subject 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.990
 short 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.000
 so this gameplay 1.94 cross charger 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.100
 fast I was accompanied two subscribers 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.229
 so this adia gameplay maybe a 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.810
 week and a half I think that's the 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.530
 same afternoon as the 200+ yeah I 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.420
 believe it's the best gameplay 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.100
 that we realized before the 200 plus 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.020
 the day his rage leaves to morlaÃ s and that 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.329
 finally I finally felt the 240 to 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.820
 2 in this vein the same team after 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.710
 so at the level of strict drones scores 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.269
 scores of little stars and group of 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.069
 hunting and a little chelou in general it's 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.209
 rather escort at a hunting group 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.099
 on this map and have not let go 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.780
 why I wanted to try this 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.130
 combination finally place of stars has 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.480
 not done a lot of damage because 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.910
 you will see that there have been a lot of 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.470
 rage quit at certain times so that's it 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.630
 way it was the afternoon of rage quit 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.599
 I will not complain that he was 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.500
 always good so if not today 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.959
 I wanted to talk to you about a little 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.510
 subject so the merit on call of duty 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.980
 so lately on youtube 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.150
 it's a bit of a playground 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.800
 the impression there are always people who 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.300
 are here to come and tell me I play 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.190
 always a solo so it's me who have 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.870
 more pink here seriously i'm not going 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.879
 get into this debate there we fight the 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.110
 balls I want to say of any 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.420
 way so I will give you my opinion 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.530
 basically so according to me go gameplay 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.239
 this game so that from a certain 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.709
 score it's several realized that 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.550
 support for example in support you 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:57.260
 know more easily there than 160 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.980
 140 kg solo go I mean 140 like 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.620
 it's a bit random 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.660
 the thing is that a gameplay in support 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.160
 it's pretty little based on the 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.930
 luck because if you have a good 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.640
 team so like I currently 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.870
 frankly I find that support 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.690
 we currently have it is really 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.519
 practically perfect people with whom 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.280
 I'm playing I'm really happy and I 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.480
 to thank once again a 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.280
 to tell you a little bit about our support team 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.290
 the guys are at least 3 2 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.030
 ratios and 552 score per minute so I 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.319
 know that stats does not mean 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.670
 great thing but it's to tell you in 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.709
 big that even the guys who camp at the 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.760
 thresher for me or to use by 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.890
 example when we play on redd 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.120
 it's really fucking pgm and 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.690
 that's why we're doing it 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.159
 as well so what did I say 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.030
 already yes so the merit at the level of 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.250
 solo gameplay etc 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.780
 so yes certainly I recognize it too 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.890
 anyway I played a lot in 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.810
 solo one these last two months I 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.220
 practically done that here it makes it to 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.110
 about a week a week and a half 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.330
 that I started to really play 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.340
 support but it's true that before I 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.360
 played everything solo and it's true that 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.709
 it's harder I'm not going to say the 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.360
 contrary but the thing also with the 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.000
 solo is that it really takes a lot 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.489
 a lot more chances already of the 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.870
 luck in the pure state because I'm in 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.549
 solo i do not know i feel like we 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.980
 can easily get killed in the 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.390
 back ex everything with the flip spawn with the 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.920
 ali who do anything that 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.790
 capture the flag a bit when they 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.440
 fly no matter how 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.879
 while for example when we support 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.409
 the spawn is more or less fixed so 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.639
 already finally we take less risks 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.870
 when there is less chance of being 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.019
 bum in the back by a guy with 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.489
 ghosts or who caress ya 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.360
 allag is a little bit passed under the 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:28.120
 orbital station so solo this is in 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.590
 solo let's say it's harder 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.509
 achieve very high score but in 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.979
 same time it requires a lot more 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.539
 luck because there is a big problem 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.240
 in any case me this is the program the 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.009
 problem by major gift that I had 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.300
 when playing solo it was the triple cap 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.979
 so the ali who takes advantage of the power 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.319
 of your strict scores to capture all 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.180
 the flag and it ended the parties 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:48.520
 really very very quickly a frankly 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.509
 I will tell you there a good part ok 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.580
 it was big we are in front 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.919
 but one day the day I had done 146 0 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.539
 on red with the fal there I had arrived 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.949
 a minute and a half after the start of the 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.690
 part the party it was over again 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.979
 with two minutes of advanced wholesale 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.560
 I was barely five minutes in 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:05.110
 the game and a party like that a lobby 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.400
 like that with the party that makes itself a 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.110
 little player from beginning to end that lasts 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.150
 10 minutes I'll tell you it's 250 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.099
 minimum king solo the problem is 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.539
 that it will never last 10 minutes because 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.949
 elite triple cap and that's why 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.360
 I prefer to play with support 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:17.830
 because already you play several 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.680
 it's much more user-friendly even if 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.509
 sometimes I'll admit you courage it's 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.250
 much more user friendly and it requires 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.539
 also less luck to get out of 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.919
 big gameplay we can get out more 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.810
 often because here it get drunk 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.099
 to tell me that every time 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.050
 I start to chain to unlock but 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.090
 strict score that there are guys who are going 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.289
 triple capped and that in the end the party is going 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.090
 to finish in 3 minutes and that I could 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.680
 not to make a crazy score after certainly 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.090
 the goal is to win the game so I 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.469
 can not spit on my friends for that 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.180
 but on the other hand it's pretty 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:43.479
 frustrating if you really manage the 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.430
 part 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:47.110
 anyway I still have very big 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.389
 solo gameplay which offer a 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.139
 I am particularly 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.779
 especially proud when I arrive 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.219
 more to speak than I would put you bah 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:55.270
 I do not know when I will start 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:56.590
 maybe does it by three to four 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.150
 weeks in any case I'm not going to 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.819
 put right away and also a 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.620
 last ad so the record fr solo 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:04.300
 so the number of solo kills has been 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.560
 beaten but not by month and a half by a 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.659
 rage guy actually it's just a 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.550
 subscriber to us who offered me to put 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:12.039
 the gameplay on the on my channel so I 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.349
 should meter by Monday so here is 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.009
 106 says that if you see what you see 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:16.990
 this video 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.610
 know that I should be the master in fact 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.060
 Wednesday here I think I would put 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:24.159
 your gameplay Wednesday so 588 solo on 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.050
 fashion plaza to the classy man and I
