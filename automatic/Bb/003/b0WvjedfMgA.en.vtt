 First of all, I heard the word "technical staff" for the first time, but 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.790
 Do you have been a what kind of your job 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.950
 Technical staff

 Analysis of their team and analysis of the other team looking at the match of the other team 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.330
 Thought about 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:59.700
 I have to work specifically 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:04.410
 Because there is a concept that Han Chinese is seeking , based on that concept in the game 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.809
 Remained firm that the Tteyuu how kind of phenomenon is happening it is their

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:49.590
 Do you use 4 or do you mean too much to give too much information? 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:54.090
 Because the product will have an adverse effect on the product, which information will be given to the players and which information 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.110
 Be careful of that while thinking a little about not giving feedback to the players 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.420
 White coat masu Shimasu 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:04.210
