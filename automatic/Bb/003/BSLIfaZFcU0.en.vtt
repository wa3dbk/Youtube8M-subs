00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.030
 rpk everything turns out in the basics 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.790
 the word revanche is really that 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.590
 essential to the whole story 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.710
 So for me it is here and for 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.960
 the team three points emotion 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.910
 I did not have it now, it certainly was 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.560
 so that the bridge in the first leg must also 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.390
 honestly deserve to win 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.670
 and we just want tomorrow evening 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.109
 show that we are much better 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.570
 can and we really want the 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.199
 Of course , keep points here 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.690
 you also deal with the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.149
 somebody else has to someday 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.110
 always catch it again 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.540
 then you can deal with it 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.850
 when it actually is so in the run-up to 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.160
 I think I find employment 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.780
 inappropriate no no we look 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.940
 easy from game to game still 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.980
 and tomorrow hamann heavy opponents with 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.039
 seven projects we just know one 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.660
 heavy but nevertheless we can 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.180
 I think with a big chest in the pack 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.590
 go that part and everything about it 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.859
 keep the points 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.750
 so does not have enough quality in all 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.780
 Team you quality one 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.770
 nice stability in the team 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.320
 team alliance in the morning the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.479
 qualities any forward play resulting in what 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.520
 can make the world get in 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.060
 Umschaltspiel so a good one 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.369
 team the quite very long on 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.049
 proper word has been talking to now 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.630
 maybe a bit of a spin 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.740
 but nevertheless very noteworthy 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.659
 Staffing is the must know during 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.289
 replace what's synonymous in thank you games 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.170
 where victor mayer or more 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.189
 Victor Maier is the most obvious 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.810
 personal but maybe if it is 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.700
 Actually, that's how it happens today 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.960
 watch after the training and 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.780
 probably also from new ones in the course 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.579
 of the day as so often mind games 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.259
 There are always many but you have to 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.880
 look what suits the opponent best 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.069
 which suits us best at the moment 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.399
 what do we have the biggest ones with? 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.399
 chances of success 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.000
 as I have for some time but me 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.920
 Nonetheless, it's just that 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.170
 Maybe I'm somebody in training 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.390
 over weeks so serving say 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.979
 okay, you can not stop by there and 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.830
 then you can show it in the game 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.450
 that he can implement that accordingly 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.700
 Such possibilities are always 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.200
 be separate or such considerations 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.299
 See what tomorrow actually is 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.799
 This happens in the short term 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:28.749
 as much as possible 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:30.579
 logged in yes that may be the camp 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:33.129
 keep in mind that this cup game 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.180
 ultimately took so long to 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.519
 was terminated 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.680
 in principle we want to have it before 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.870
 season very much likes to play types 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.030
 Friday evenings just in the morning until 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.439
 The Bundesliga go out of the way and 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.090
 The team plays on Friday evening 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:47.920
 the opponents play eye on friday evening 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.790
 especially under floodlights here with us 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.959
 in the stadium 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.700
 there is a special one 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.450
 atmosphere and that may well be 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.450
 every tenant lives
