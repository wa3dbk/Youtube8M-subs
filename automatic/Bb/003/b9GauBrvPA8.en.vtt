00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
you guys how to not get rated on a MC

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.900 
you guys how to not get rated on a MC
teams<00:00:18.060> or<00:00:18.270> any<00:00:18.420> server<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.720> guys<00:00:18.840> play<00:00:19.910> by

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
teams or any server you guys play by

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.870 
teams or any server you guys play by
x-ray<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:21.570> it's<00:00:21.990> not<00:00:22.140> like<00:00:22.650> preventing<00:00:23.580> how<00:00:23.820> to

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
x-ray so it's not like preventing how to

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.480 
x-ray so it's not like preventing how to
get<00:00:24.410> tracked<00:00:25.410> or<00:00:25.680> anything<00:00:25.859> like<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.070> cuz

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
get tracked or anything like that cuz

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.419 
get tracked or anything like that cuz
like<00:00:26.699> that's<00:00:27.359> your<00:00:27.480> problem<00:00:27.750> but<00:00:28.130> I'm<00:00:29.130> trying

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
to show you how to make it harder for

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.889 
to show you how to make it harder for
that<00:00:32.130> traders<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.850> MC<00:00:33.149> team<00:00:33.329> turns<00:00:33.540> over<00:00:33.750> you

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
that traders on MC team turns over you

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.750 
that traders on MC team turns over you
guys<00:00:33.989> plan<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.469> find<00:00:34.980> your<00:00:35.040> base<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.550> I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
guys plan to find your base so I

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.330 
guys plan to find your base so I
downloaded<00:00:36.480> them<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:36.930> x-ray<00:00:37.530> settle<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.219> is

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
downloaded them on x-ray settle this is

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.020 
downloaded them on x-ray settle this is
ice<00:00:38.460> right<00:00:38.610> here<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:40.550> pretty<00:00:41.550> much<00:00:41.640> what<00:00:42.000> I

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
ice right here and pretty much what I

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.779 
ice right here and pretty much what I
did<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:43.469> would<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.620> do<00:00:43.800> them<00:00:44.129> MC<00:00:44.370> teams<00:00:44.579> is

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
did and this would I do them MC teams is

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.840 
did and this would I do them MC teams is
when<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.450> make<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.690> base<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.289> don't<00:00:47.039> like<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.460> make<00:00:47.670> I

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
when I make a base I don't like I make I

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.459 
when I make a base I don't like I make I
make<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.239> look<00:00:48.360> nice<00:00:48.570> never<00:00:48.840> think<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.200> so

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
make it look nice never think that so

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.700 
make it look nice never think that so
I'll<00:00:49.739> show<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.780> so<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.079> like<00:00:52.199> my<00:00:52.230> basic<00:00:52.649> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
I'll show you so this is like my basic a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.979 
I'll show you so this is like my basic a
this<00:00:52.860> my<00:00:52.980> pretend<00:00:53.309> base<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:53.940> oh<00:00:54.059> my<00:00:54.239> by

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
this my pretend base I like oh my by

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.310 
this my pretend base I like oh my by
loosing<00:00:55.350> hearing<00:00:55.620> aid<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.809> so<00:00:57.809> that's<00:00:58.020> that's

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
loosing hearing aid and so that's that's

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.500 
loosing hearing aid and so that's that's
my<00:00:58.469> base<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.859> 1x<00:00:59.280> rates<00:00:59.579> look<00:00:59.760> x-ray<00:01:00.149> or<00:01:00.180> see

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
my base and 1x rates look x-ray or see

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.020 
my base and 1x rates look x-ray or see
this<00:01:00.660> stuff<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.739> usually<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.190> let<00:01:02.940> me<00:01:03.000> just

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
this stuff it's usually like let me just

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.080 
this stuff it's usually like let me just
do<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.949> I'll<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:05.010> like<00:01:05.250> dig<00:01:05.430> down<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.820> little

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
do this I'll just like dig down a little

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.320 
do this I'll just like dig down a little
chest<00:01:06.510> here<00:01:06.799> like<00:01:07.799> something<00:01:08.130> like<00:01:08.610> this

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.330 

and<00:01:13.720> that's<00:01:14.110> okay<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.700> we'll<00:01:15.850> just<00:01:15.970> do<00:01:16.150> this

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
and that's okay and we'll just do this

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.380 
and that's okay and we'll just do this
right<00:01:18.340> so<00:01:18.370> x-ray<00:01:18.790> should<00:01:19.000> just<00:01:19.120> be<00:01:19.240> like

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
right so x-ray should just be like

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.200 
right so x-ray should just be like
walking<00:01:19.960> around<00:01:20.050> like<00:01:20.740> that<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:21.250> they<00:01:22.060> see

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
walking around like that and they see

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.790 
walking around like that and they see
this<00:01:22.390> right<00:01:22.630> they<00:01:22.840> say<00:01:22.960> like<00:01:23.080> this<00:01:23.260> slop<00:01:23.560> is

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
this right they say like this slop is

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.130 
this right they say like this slop is
stand<00:01:24.280> you<00:01:24.430> know<00:01:24.460> I<00:01:24.850> don't<00:01:25.480> know<00:01:25.600> where<00:01:25.780> the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
stand you know I don't know where the

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.140 
stand you know I don't know where the
chest<00:01:26.380> owed<00:01:26.590> so<00:01:26.860> yeah<00:01:27.010> it's<00:01:27.190> easy<00:01:27.370> to<00:01:27.610> x-ray

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
chest owed so yeah it's easy to x-ray

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.450 
chest owed so yeah it's easy to x-ray
that<00:01:28.330> stuff<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:29.020> like<00:01:29.140> um<00:01:29.410> just<00:01:30.160> you<00:01:30.430> know

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
that and that's not that's not good but

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.640 
that and that's not that's not good but
what<00:01:36.370> I<00:01:36.400> do<00:01:36.550> is<00:01:37.080> this<00:01:38.080> is<00:01:38.170> how<00:01:38.260> I<00:01:38.290> can<00:01:38.440> you

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
what I do is this is how I can you

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.100 
what I do is this is how I can you
prevent<00:01:38.980> x-rays<00:01:39.610> so<00:01:39.850> what<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.030> do<00:01:40.120> is<00:01:40.720> you<00:01:40.990> make

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
prevent x-rays so what I do is you make

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.980 
prevent x-rays so what I do is you make
your<00:01:41.320> base<00:01:41.440> like<00:01:41.650> that<00:01:41.830> so<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:43.600> as<00:01:43.720> you<00:01:43.840> can<00:01:43.930> see

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
your base like that so so as you can see

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.870 
your base like that so so as you can see
that<00:01:44.350> base<00:01:44.560> right<00:01:44.680> there<00:01:44.890> which<00:01:45.130> what<00:01:45.640> I<00:01:45.670> would

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
that base right there which what I would

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
that base right there which what I would
do<00:01:46.030> is<00:01:46.330> uh<00:01:47.050> what<00:01:47.860> you<00:01:47.950> do<00:01:48.070> is<00:01:48.310> uh<00:01:48.630> okay<00:01:49.630> you<00:01:49.720> get

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
do is uh what you do is uh okay you get

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.930 
do is uh what you do is uh okay you get
you<00:01:50.050> can<00:01:50.200> get<00:01:50.290> any<00:01:50.470> type<00:01:50.980> of<00:01:51.010> war<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.430> want<00:01:51.580> so

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
you can get any type of war you want so

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.980 
you can get any type of war you want so
that's<00:01:52.780> either<00:01:53.110> coal<00:01:53.800> iron<00:01:54.220> diamonds

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
that's either coal iron diamonds

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.690 
that's either coal iron diamonds
redstone<00:01:55.990> or<00:01:56.170> anything<00:01:56.350> like<00:01:56.530> that<00:01:56.590> I<00:01:56.950> would

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
redstone or anything like that I would

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.480 
redstone or anything like that I would
recommend<00:01:57.940> to<00:01:58.150> coal<00:01:58.510> because<00:01:58.750> it's<00:01:59.050> uh<00:01:59.190> it's<00:02:00.190> a

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
recommend to coal because it's uh it's a

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.250 
recommend to coal because it's uh it's a
lot<00:02:00.690> easier<00:02:01.690> to<00:02:01.990> find<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:03.720> it's<00:02:04.720> a<00:02:04.840> lot<00:02:05.020> like

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
lot easier to find and it's a lot like

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.800 
lot easier to find and it's a lot like
it's<00:02:05.440> a<00:02:05.500> lot<00:02:05.650> when<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.550> see<00:02:06.790> it<00:02:06.880> cool<00:02:07.240> it<00:02:07.600> comes

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
it's a lot when you see it cool it comes

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.040 
it's a lot when you see it cool it comes
again<00:02:08.110> a<00:02:08.170> huge<00:02:08.440> bunch<00:02:08.770> of<00:02:09.100> coal<00:02:09.310> so<00:02:09.780> I'd<00:02:10.780> rather

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
again a huge bunch of coal so I'd rather

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.290 
again a huge bunch of coal so I'd rather
use<00:02:11.530> coal<00:02:11.800> than<00:02:12.040> iron<00:02:12.250> see<00:02:12.580> I<00:02:12.670> used<00:02:12.850> iron<00:02:13.060> over

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
use coal than iron see I used iron over

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.040 
use coal than iron see I used iron over
there<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:13.750> get<00:02:14.620> like<00:02:14.770> some<00:02:15.010> get<00:02:15.550> some<00:02:15.700> coal<00:02:16.050> ore

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
there so get like some get some coal ore

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.400 
there so get like some get some coal ore
and<00:02:18.150> pretty<00:02:19.150> much<00:02:19.209> what<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.450> want<00:02:19.570> to<00:02:19.630> do<00:02:19.780> is

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
and pretty much what you want to do is

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.220 
and pretty much what you want to do is
go<00:02:20.590> around<00:02:20.739> your<00:02:21.160> base<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:22.870> put<00:02:23.110> the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
go around your base and just put the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.449 
go around your base and just put the
bore<00:02:23.410> around<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:24.220> so<00:02:24.850> it's<00:02:25.000> less<00:02:25.180> obvious<00:02:25.360> so

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
bore around it so it's less obvious so

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:36.720 
bore around it so it's less obvious so
just<00:02:27.459> do<00:02:27.580> this<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:34.560> just<00:02:35.560> want<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.890> put<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.520> or

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
just do this I just want to put the or

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.320 
just do this I just want to put the or
just<00:02:37.480> around<00:02:37.840> any<00:02:38.680> parts<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.910> loft<00:02:40.090> as<00:02:40.209> you

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
just around any parts of the loft as you

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.720 
just around any parts of the loft as you
can<00:02:40.480> see<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:41.290> can<00:02:41.500> see<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.709> lapis<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:42.550> can

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
can see you can see the lapis you can

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.940 
can see you can see the lapis you can
get<00:02:42.880> x-rayed<00:02:43.300> which<00:02:44.230> is<00:02:44.350> not<00:02:44.470> good<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:44.860> we'll

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
get x-rayed which is not good so we'll

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.570 
get x-rayed which is not good so we'll
do<00:02:45.070> that<00:02:45.190> here

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.220 

then<00:02:48.580> what<00:02:48.730> you<00:02:48.850> want<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.030> do<00:02:49.180> is<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:50.050> want<00:02:50.200> to

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
then what you want to do is you want to

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.430 
then what you want to do is you want to
put<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.980> coal<00:02:51.610> on<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.760> top<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.360> then<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.290> can

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
put the coal on the top and then you can

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.170 
put the coal on the top and then you can
make<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:53.590> huge<00:02:53.920> base<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.459> out<00:02:54.580> of<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:54.790> like<00:02:54.970> you

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
make a huge base to out of this like you

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.910 
make a huge base to out of this like you
make<00:02:55.300> a<00:02:55.360> huge<00:02:55.570> base<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:55.959> just<00:02:56.080> put<00:02:56.230> coal

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
make a huge base and just put coal

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.010 
make a huge base and just put coal
around<00:02:57.250> it<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:58.150> it's<00:02:58.239> less<00:02:58.420> obvious<00:02:58.630> for

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
around it so it's less obvious for

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.050 
around it so it's less obvious for
x-rays<00:02:59.350> you<00:02:59.470> see<00:02:59.680> so<00:03:00.430> let<00:03:00.520> me<00:03:00.580> just<00:03:00.670> put<00:03:00.910> the

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
x-rays you see so let me just put the

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.400 
x-rays you see so let me just put the
stone<00:03:01.330> up<00:03:01.510> here<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.730> boom<00:03:03.989> as<00:03:04.989> you<00:03:05.110> can<00:03:05.230> see

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
stone up here and boom as you can see

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.380 
stone up here and boom as you can see
you<00:03:05.620> can't<00:03:05.860> really<00:03:06.070> see<00:03:06.370> oh<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:06.820> can't<00:03:07.060> see<00:03:07.239> it

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
you can't really see oh you can't see it

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.060 
you can't really see oh you can't see it
at<00:03:07.480> all<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:08.140> base<00:03:08.320> you<00:03:08.560> can't<00:03:08.739> see<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:08.950> law

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
at all the base you can't see the law

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.280 
at all the base you can't see the law
office<00:03:09.310> or<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.610> chest<00:03:09.880> this<00:03:10.780> is<00:03:10.900> what<00:03:11.019> I<00:03:11.050> need

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
office or the chest this is what I need

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.990 
office or the chest this is what I need
to<00:03:11.410> prevent<00:03:11.620> x-rays<00:03:12.100> so<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.459> know<00:03:12.700> if<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:12.880> see

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
to prevent x-rays so you know if you see

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.680 
to prevent x-rays so you know if you see
an<00:03:13.090> x-ray<00:03:13.420> just<00:03:13.830> walking<00:03:14.830> by<00:03:14.950> this<00:03:15.690> they

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
an x-ray just walking by this they

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.270 
an x-ray just walking by this they
probably<00:03:16.810> won't<00:03:17.080> even<00:03:17.230> see<00:03:17.350> that<00:03:17.650> anything<00:03:18.070> at

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
probably won't even see that anything at

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.390 
probably won't even see that anything at
that<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:19.390> will<00:03:19.510> prevent<00:03:19.780> raids<00:03:20.650> or<00:03:21.040> any

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
that and it will prevent raids or any

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.870 
that and it will prevent raids or any
vault<00:03:21.780> or<00:03:22.780> anything<00:03:23.260> like<00:03:23.410> that<00:03:23.470> in<00:03:23.830> I<00:03:24.310> also

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
vault or anything like that in I also

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.590 
vault or anything like that in I also
I<00:03:25.970> made<00:03:26.600> a<00:03:26.630> bigger<00:03:27.320> base<00:03:27.560> so<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.010> can<00:03:28.100> also

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
I made a bigger base so you can also

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.530 
I made a bigger base so you can also
make<00:03:29.600> a<00:03:29.630> huge<00:03:30.080> inside<00:03:30.620> base<00:03:30.830> and<00:03:31.010> just<00:03:31.180> on<00:03:32.180> the

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
make a huge inside base and just on the

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.850 
make a huge inside base and just on the
outside<00:03:32.810> just<00:03:32.930> put<00:03:33.080> like<00:03:33.200> a<00:03:33.230> bunch<00:03:33.530> of<00:03:33.620> coal

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
outside just put like a bunch of coal

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.470 
outside just put like a bunch of coal
and<00:03:34.120> that's<00:03:35.120> how<00:03:35.240> I<00:03:35.270> prevent<00:03:35.690> x-rays<00:03:36.380> and<00:03:37.480> yeah

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
and that's how I prevent x-rays and yeah

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.450 
and that's how I prevent x-rays and yeah
so<00:03:39.200> if<00:03:39.260> you<00:03:39.320> guys<00:03:39.380> enjoyed<00:03:39.770> that<00:03:39.980> video<00:03:40.100> and
