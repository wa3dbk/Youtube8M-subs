a<00:00:00.060> friend<00:00:00.930> of<00:00:01.020> mine<00:00:01.230> asked<00:00:01.620> a<00:00:01.709> great<00:00:01.920> question

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:02.149 
a friend of mine asked a great question

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:04.309 
a friend of mine asked a great question
what<00:00:03.149> do<00:00:03.300> you<00:00:03.330> do<00:00:03.540> if<00:00:03.689> you<00:00:03.810> want<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.110> switch

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
what do you do if you want to switch

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.440 
what do you do if you want to switch
from<00:00:04.470> these<00:00:04.710> needles<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.970> another<00:00:06.210> set<00:00:06.420> of

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
from these needles to another set of

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.059 
from these needles to another set of
needles<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.049> I<00:00:07.379> thought<00:00:07.560> I<00:00:07.620> would<00:00:07.830> show<00:00:08.010> you

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
needles and I thought I would show you

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.490 
needles and I thought I would show you
on<00:00:08.309> these<00:00:08.490> toe<00:00:08.760> up<00:00:08.910> socks<00:00:08.940> because<00:00:09.510> after<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.410> do

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
on these toe up socks because after I do

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.009 
on these toe up socks because after I do
the<00:00:10.710> increases<00:00:11.309> here<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.759> don't<00:00:12.330> have<00:00:12.630> any<00:00:12.809> need

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
the increases here I don't have any need

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.600 
the increases here I don't have any need
for<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.380> sharp<00:00:13.620> points<00:00:13.920> anymore<00:00:14.130> since<00:00:14.429> I'm

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
for the sharp points anymore since I'm

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.160 
for the sharp points anymore since I'm
just<00:00:14.790> knitting<00:00:15.030> stockinette<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.540> since<00:00:16.020> I'm

just knitting stockinette and since I'm

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.470 
just knitting stockinette and since I'm
spoiled<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.800> have<00:00:17.039> every<00:00:17.789> kind<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.210> needle

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
and every size I'm going to switch to a

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.150 
and every size I'm going to switch to a
size<00:00:21.240> seven<00:00:21.660> just<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.500> 47<00:00:23.220> inch<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.660> teeter<00:00:24.660> bow

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
so I'm making sure that yarns back there

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.810 
so I'm making sure that yarns back there
like<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:28.019> all<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.310> do<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.640> switch

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
like that all you have to do to switch

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.370 
like that all you have to do to switch
from<00:00:29.970> one<00:00:30.090> needle<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.510> other<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.960> begin

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
from one needle to the other is begin

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.139 
from one needle to the other is begin
knitting<00:00:31.590> with<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.070> new<00:00:32.219> needle<00:00:32.550> we<00:00:33.000> can

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
knitting with the new needle we can

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.530 
knitting with the new needle we can
actually<00:00:33.300> even<00:00:33.570> pull<00:00:33.840> out<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.230> back<00:00:34.380> needle

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
actually even pull out the back needle

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.610 
actually even pull out the back needle
like<00:00:36.540> we're<00:00:36.719> going<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.960> knit<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.320> but

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
like we're going to knit with it but

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.780 
like we're going to knit with it but
instead<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.950> knitting<00:00:38.160> with<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.399> just<00:00:38.579> let<00:00:38.700> it

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
instead of knitting with it just let it

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.780 
instead of knitting with it just let it
drop<00:00:38.969> use<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.989> new<00:00:40.170> needle<00:00:40.550> to<00:00:41.550> start

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
drop use the new needle to start

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.729 
drop use the new needle to start
knitting<00:00:41.910> your<00:00:42.120> stitches<00:00:45.379> like<00:00:46.379> that

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
knitting your stitches like that

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.130 
knitting your stitches like that
and<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.070> will<00:00:47.250> basically<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:48.210> transfer<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
and you will basically just transfer the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.380 
and you will basically just transfer the
stitches<00:00:49.640> without<00:00:50.640> having<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.030> move<00:00:51.210> them

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
stitches without having to move them

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:05.229 
stitches without having to move them
over

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.120 

let<00:01:05.750> me<00:01:05.870> show<00:01:06.020> you<00:01:06.080> what<00:01:06.350> happens<00:01:06.680> when<00:01:06.860> we<00:01:06.980> get

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
let me show you what happens when we get

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.890 
let me show you what happens when we get
to<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.430> second<00:01:07.820> sock<00:01:08.030> just<00:01:08.090> so<00:01:08.540> that<00:01:08.660> it's<00:01:08.780> not

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
to the second sock just so that it's not

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:16.180 
to the second sock just so that it's not
confusing<00:01:13.540> so<00:01:14.540> I<00:01:14.570> think<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:15.440> ADI<00:01:15.620> turbos<00:01:16.040> are

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
confusing so I think the ADI turbos are

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.300 
confusing so I think the ADI turbos are
going<00:01:16.310> to<00:01:16.370> be<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.520> lot<00:01:16.910> faster<00:01:17.600> when<00:01:17.750> it's<00:01:17.930> just

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
going to be a lot faster when it's just

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.160 
going to be a lot faster when it's just
stockinette<00:01:19.510> all<00:01:20.510> right<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:20.750> I've<00:01:20.840> gotten<00:01:21.110> to

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
stockinette all right so I've gotten to

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.110 
stockinette all right so I've gotten to
the<00:01:21.260> end<00:01:21.290> I've<00:01:21.560> got<00:01:21.800> this<00:01:22.280> half<00:01:22.550> of<00:01:22.670> this<00:01:22.850> sock

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
the way we do that by rotating that

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.700 
the way we do that by rotating that
needle<00:01:37.970> like<00:01:38.090> that<00:01:38.149> out<00:01:38.600> of<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.810> way<00:01:38.960> all

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.889 

okay<00:02:06.380> when<00:02:06.530> we<00:02:06.650> get<00:02:06.830> to<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.100> end<00:02:07.600> we'll<00:02:08.600> drop

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
okay when we get to the end we'll drop

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.610 
okay when we get to the end we'll drop
that<00:02:08.959> empty<00:02:09.740> left-hand<00:02:10.610> needle<00:02:11.350> just<00:02:12.350> let<00:02:12.530> it

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
that's escaping there we go

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.080 
that's escaping there we go
we'll<00:02:27.890> get<00:02:28.010> back<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.280> ready<00:02:28.430> position<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:28.910> can
