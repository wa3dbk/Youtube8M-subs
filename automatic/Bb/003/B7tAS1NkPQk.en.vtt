00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.679
 since 2010 he has been in berlin since then 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.049
 season captain 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.389
 it looks like peter 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.379
 niemeyer at the hertha his second 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.960
 home found 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.390
 born in the northernmost tip of nrw 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.670
 as a footballer matured in bremen and now 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.670
 arrived in the capital 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.599
 I've learned to appreciate berlin feel 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.399
 me is very well swim yet 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.250
 in the wrong league moment but me 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.660
 hope that changes from summer and yes 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.030
 I can not imagine anything better 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.800
 to live here in berlin 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.670
 especially niemeyer in march for the first time 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.850
 becomes father 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.039
 a boy becomes a real berliner 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.289
 friend thierer niemeyer looks for a house 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.149
 in Berlin but first is still the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.539
 common apartment for the offspring 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:59.850
 prepared yes we are busy 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:04.049
 Of course the credit card is glowing 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.080
 meanwhile that's what it's all about 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.170
 cot the usual utensils the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.960
 one then it suits it fits for Peter 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.340
 Niemeyer privately is sporty hertha 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.000
 on the best way back to the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.689
 Bundesliga 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.670
 As in 2011, it was well known that the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.369
 direct descent and now again the 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.560
 In every case, this is going on 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.720
 season much better for peter niemeyer 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.850
 as the last one it is natural 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.909
 much more pleasant if you go on 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.249
 the street 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.630
 is and sometimes a smile back 

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:39.189
 and not just any 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.439
 But you have to listen to abuse 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.850
 the other side of the medal too 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.049
 We've seen that and that's why we know that 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.429
 also to relativize a bit 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.450
 Of course, now it's going well 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.259
 As I said before, you usually agree 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.869
 qualify 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.490
 in the middle of life in the middle of berlin 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.289
 peter niemeyer writes on his 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.020
 personal success story and that 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.020
 in the future hopefully only first-class
