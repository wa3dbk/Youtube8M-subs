00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.280
 hello I am aldo and this is a hedgehog 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.410
 and this is a little spin 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.929
 do not 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.750
 the animals hits but that most 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.300
 considers equal but not only in 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.859
 Spanish this mistake is made 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.900
 English is also well known for 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:25.929
 hays seal but almost nobody calls the 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.640
 porcupines because bread could that 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.230
 talk now about families or families 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.820
 species and subspecies but that would be 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.420
 enter a little to taxonomic categories 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.339
 I probably will not do it because 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.739
 we have little time, I do not think 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:40.449
 that nobody is 30 of memory with his error 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.650
 common is to confuse the rabbit with 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.960
 Hare 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.580
 the rabbit is domestic tiny and it 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.800
 develops better in groups while 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.100
 the much larger wild hare already 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.899
 he is very well alone 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.199
 part of this driving may be due 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.760
 for myself I do not mean the name 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.510
 rabbit bucks but whose all 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.010
 characteristics are those of a hare 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.510
 bats and vampires in this case 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.339
 the opposite happens a bit because 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.049
 Vampires and bats are no different 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.750
 but they are not the same either because 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.460
 Vampires are Murcians 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.290
 or vampires are a kind of 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.210
 bats there is no bat is 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.040
 Blind indeed if he does not have his eyes 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.180
 who use it to see things the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.650
 advantage it has is that it has a lot 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.930
 additional sense called 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.360
 echolocation that allows them to navigate 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.730
 in the world in complete darkness 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.340
 let's talk now about the dinosaurs of 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.950
 Greek dinosaurs what do you mean 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.600
 terrible lizard if you want to qualify to 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.340
 some animal like lizard terrill or 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.100
 dinosaur to certain things that you have 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.990
 have to consider first be quick 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.670
 is to tell them we have temporary things to 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.979
 each side of the skull after the orbit 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.479
 eyepiece have these two holes help goes 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.670
 to be the gigantic skull much more 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.620
 lightweight and more bearable mammals 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.610
 we have only one for what we are 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.610
 synapse 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.400
 to have chains like that is if they look good 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.260
 the dinosaurs had joints of 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.760
 hips that allowed them to walk 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.180
 differently from how some do 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.180
 reptiles 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.100
 now the last thing is that all the 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.110
 we were terrestrial or the 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.980
 terrestrial animals of some 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.340
 reconception 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.420
 this is not a dinosaur this either and 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.420
 that is not a dinosaur either 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.849
 and here it follows something very simple, not everything 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.980
 animal whose name ends with a saurian 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.920
 dinosaur now you already know thanks for 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.810
 this video that you learned to share it if 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.470
 you like the knowledge subscribe to 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.470
 much more videos 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.540
