00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
and then I really cut down on drinking

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.560 
and then I really cut down on drinking
and<00:02:22.860> it's<00:02:22.980> like<00:02:23.190> been<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.460> totally<00:02:23.940> spiritual

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
and it's like been a totally spiritual

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.440 
and it's like been a totally spiritual
experience<00:02:25.230> for<00:02:25.320> me<00:02:25.560> with<00:02:25.770> my<00:02:25.950> music<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:27.000> I

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.160 

and<00:02:37.720> it's<00:02:38.520> I<00:02:39.520> think<00:02:39.790> it's<00:02:40.150> mostly<00:02:40.480> because<00:02:40.690> to

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
and it's I think it's mostly because to

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.870 
and it's I think it's mostly because to
the<00:02:41.769> design<00:02:42.250> of<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.879> marijuana<00:02:43.239> leaving
