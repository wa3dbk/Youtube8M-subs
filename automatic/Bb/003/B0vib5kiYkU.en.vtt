every<00:00:01.379> morning<00:00:01.619> you<00:00:01.739> see<00:00:02.040> your<00:00:02.220> reflection<00:00:02.400> in

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:02.880 
every morning you see your reflection in

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.369 
every morning you see your reflection in
the<00:00:03.030> mirror<00:00:05.629> every<00:00:06.629> summer<00:00:06.870> your<00:00:07.169> friend

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
the mirror every summer your friend

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.420 
the mirror every summer your friend
looks<00:00:07.529> squiggly<00:00:07.919> in<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.160> bottom<00:00:08.430> of<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.670> pool

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:10.430 
looks squiggly in the bottom of the pool

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.500 
looks squiggly in the bottom of the pool
but<00:00:11.430> how<00:00:11.580> can<00:00:11.640> we<00:00:11.880> use<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.330> make<00:00:12.360> a

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.510 
but how can we use this to make a

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.710 
but how can we use this to make a

yourself in a mirror you probably do

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.540 
yourself in a mirror you probably do
this<00:00:39.870> often<00:00:40.110> enough<00:00:40.440> but<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.190> were<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.370> get

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
this often enough but you were to get

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.660 
this often enough but you were to get
anyway<00:00:41.910> what<00:00:42.840> do<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.020> see<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:44.070> yourself<00:00:44.280> of

anyway what do you see it's yourself of
course<00:00:44.750> but<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:46.020> ever<00:00:46.140> wondered<00:00:46.500> why

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
course but have you ever wondered why

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.700 
course but have you ever wondered why
this<00:00:46.829> happens<00:00:48.230> you<00:00:49.230> may<00:00:49.350> have<00:00:49.500> heard<00:00:49.649> that

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
this happens you may have heard that

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.190 
this happens you may have heard that
light<00:00:50.070> travels<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> wave<00:00:51.090> sort<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.079> like

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.200 
light travels like a wave sort of like

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.770 
light travels like a wave sort of like
these<00:00:52.379> water<00:00:52.559> waves<00:00:53.059> the<00:00:54.059> water<00:00:54.239> ripples<00:00:54.420> have

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
these water waves the water ripples have

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.510 
these water waves the water ripples have
high<00:00:54.930> parts<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.410> low<00:00:55.500> parts<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.040> travel<00:00:56.370> out

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
high parts and low parts that travel out

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.459 
high parts and low parts that travel out
and<00:00:57.059> if<00:00:57.210> they<00:00:57.329> hit<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> wall<00:00:57.570> they<00:00:57.989> bounce<00:00:58.320> right

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
and if they hit a wall they bounce right

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.979 
and if they hit a wall they bounce right
back<00:00:58.760> that's<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> same<00:01:00.059> sort<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.390> thing<00:01:00.629> going

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
back that's the same sort of thing going

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.319 
back that's the same sort of thing going
on<00:01:01.289> with<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.770> mirror<00:01:02.100> light<00:01:02.850> coming<00:01:03.180> from

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
on with the mirror light coming from

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.240 
on with the mirror light coming from
your<00:01:03.510> cell<00:01:03.750> phone<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.199> hitting<00:01:04.619> your<00:01:04.739> face<00:01:04.979> and

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
your cell phone is hitting your face and

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.490 
your cell phone is hitting your face and
bouncing<00:01:05.610> off<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.930> bouncing<00:01:07.380> is

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
bouncing off of it this bouncing is

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.710 
bouncing off of it this bouncing is
called<00:01:07.770> reflection<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.610> lot<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.570> that

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
called reflection a lot of that

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.870 
called reflection a lot of that
reflected<00:01:10.229> light<00:01:10.470> bounces<00:01:11.130> off<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.549> mirror

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
reflected light bounces off the mirror

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.140 
reflected light bounces off the mirror
and<00:01:12.030> goes<00:01:12.360> into<00:01:12.540> your<00:01:12.630> eyes<00:01:13.700> crazy<00:01:14.700> way<00:01:14.940> number

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
and goes into your eyes crazy way number

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.440 
and goes into your eyes crazy way number
two<00:01:15.439> bending<00:01:16.790> now<00:01:17.790> let's<00:01:18.060> look<00:01:18.150> at<00:01:18.270> this

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
two bending now let's look at this

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.870 
two bending now let's look at this
pencil<00:01:18.840> underwater<00:01:19.260> why<00:01:20.220> does<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> part<00:01:20.790> of

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
pencil underwater why does the part of

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.490 
pencil underwater why does the part of
the<00:01:20.970> pencil<00:01:21.390> that's<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.140> water

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
the pencil that's in the water

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.830 
the pencil that's in the water
look<00:01:23.010> bent<00:01:23.400> compared<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.150> part<00:01:24.390> above<00:01:24.630> it

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
look bent compared to the part above it

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.530 
look bent compared to the part above it
of<00:01:25.229> course<00:01:25.890> for<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.790> see<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.090> pencil<00:01:27.450> at

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
of course for you to see the pencil at

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.560 
of course for you to see the pencil at
all<00:01:27.720> light<00:01:28.350> needs<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.680> reflect<00:01:29.040> off<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.729> but

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
all light needs to reflect off of it but

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.969 
all light needs to reflect off of it but
it<00:01:30.659> also<00:01:30.750> has<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.140> travel<00:01:31.470> through<00:01:31.650> different

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
it also has to travel through different

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.820 
it also has to travel through different
materials<00:01:32.310> before<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.450> hits<00:01:33.659> your<00:01:33.869> eye<00:01:33.900> light

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.010 
materials before it hits your eye light
generally<00:01:35.310> takes<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.670> fastest<00:01:36.270> path<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.840> get

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
generally takes the fastest path to get

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.170 
generally takes the fastest path to get
between<00:01:37.320> two<00:01:37.680> points<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.759> might<00:01:39.000> not

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
between two points and that might not

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.810 
between two points and that might not
always<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> straight<00:01:40.200> line<00:01:40.369> light<00:01:41.369> travels

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
always be a straight line light travels

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.330 
always be a straight line light travels
slower<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.360> water<00:01:42.390> than<00:01:43.020> an<00:01:43.140> air<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
slower in water than an air so the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.240 
slower in water than an air so the
fastest<00:01:44.790> path<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.270> actually<00:01:45.420> Bank<00:01:46.009> it's<00:01:47.009> just

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
fastest path is actually Bank it's just

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.980 
fastest path is actually Bank it's just
like<00:01:47.369> when<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.549> travel<00:01:47.939> from<00:01:48.060> your<00:01:48.150> house<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
like when you travel from your house the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.899 
like when you travel from your house the
shortest<00:01:49.350> path<00:01:49.530> isn't<00:01:50.040> always<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.430> fastest

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
shortest path isn't always the fastest

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.880 
shortest path isn't always the fastest
like<00:01:51.570> here<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.990> could<00:01:52.170> travel<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.470> shorter

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
like here you could travel the shorter

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.999 
like here you could travel the shorter
route<00:01:53.070> along<00:01:53.909> slower<00:01:54.479> smaller<00:01:55.020> roads<00:01:55.320> or<00:01:55.860> you

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
route along slower smaller roads or you

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.740 
route along slower smaller roads or you
could<00:01:56.159> go<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> little<00:01:56.490> farther<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.060> take<00:01:57.630> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
could go a little farther and take the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.830 
could go a little farther and take the

crazy<00:02:09.060> way<00:02:09.330> number<00:02:09.629> three<00:02:10.140> mixing<00:02:11.269> let's<00:02:12.269> look

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
crazy way number three mixing let's look

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.300 
crazy way number three mixing let's look
at<00:02:12.569> water<00:02:12.750> waves<00:02:13.050> which<00:02:13.590> actually<00:02:14.040> behave

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
at water waves which actually behave

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.040 
at water waves which actually behave
pretty<00:02:14.640> similarly<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.390> light<00:02:15.569> waves

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
pretty similarly to light waves

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.960 
pretty similarly to light waves
I<00:02:16.080> made<00:02:16.739> these<00:02:16.920> waves<00:02:17.190> by<00:02:17.400> dropping<00:02:17.760> two

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
I made these waves by dropping two

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.119 
I made these waves by dropping two

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.920 
droplets some distance apart each
droplet<00:02:20.489> forms<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:21.000> set<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.300> waves<00:02:21.480> going<00:02:21.750> out

to<00:02:59.280> mess<00:02:59.430> with<00:02:59.579> light<00:02:59.790> together<00:03:00.500> how<00:03:01.500> can<00:03:01.680> this

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
to mess with light together how can this

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.520 
to mess with light together how can this
cloak<00:03:02.040> make<00:03:02.280> someone<00:03:02.579> invisible<00:03:03.349> let's<00:03:04.349> say

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
cloak make someone invisible let's say

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.009 
cloak make someone invisible let's say
this<00:03:04.709> camera<00:03:05.130> is<00:03:05.250> your<00:03:05.459> eye<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:06.690> green

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
this camera is your eye and this green

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.750 
this camera is your eye and this green
fabric<00:03:07.349> is<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.920> cloak<00:03:08.160> we<00:03:08.340> want<00:03:08.519> to<00:03:08.610> make

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
fabric is the cloak we want to make

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.780 
fabric is the cloak we want to make
invisible<00:03:09.390> you're<00:03:10.349> probably<00:03:10.680> thinking<00:03:11.040> let's

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
invisible you're probably thinking let's

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.330 
invisible you're probably thinking let's
make<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:12.180> cloak<00:03:12.420> itself<00:03:12.900> invisible<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:14.130> that

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
make the cloak itself invisible so that

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.610 
make the cloak itself invisible so that
light<00:03:14.549> would<00:03:14.730> pass<00:03:14.970> through<00:03:15.299> it<00:03:15.420> but<00:03:16.380> if<00:03:16.470> we

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
light would pass through it but if we

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.099 
light would pass through it but if we
did<00:03:16.799> that<00:03:17.040> light<00:03:18.000> would<00:03:18.239> still<00:03:18.510> be<00:03:18.660> able<00:03:18.810> to

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
did that light would still be able to

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.379 
did that light would still be able to
bounce<00:03:19.290> off<00:03:19.650> what<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.069> cloak<00:03:20.310> covers<00:03:20.760> pass

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
bounce off what the cloak covers pass

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.210 
bounce off what the cloak covers pass
through<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.870> cloak<00:03:22.139> and<00:03:22.319> get<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.920> your<00:03:23.040> eyes

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
through the cloak and get to your eyes

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.440 
through the cloak and get to your eyes
and<00:03:23.900> that's<00:03:24.900> no<00:03:25.200> good<00:03:25.639> what<00:03:26.639> the<00:03:26.730> cloak<00:03:26.940> really

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
and that's no good what the cloak really

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.030 
and that's no good what the cloak really
needs<00:03:27.630> to<00:03:27.810> do<00:03:27.959> is<00:03:28.230> take<00:03:28.470> light<00:03:28.709> from<00:03:28.920> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
needs to do is take light from the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.949 
needs to do is take light from the
opposite<00:03:29.459> side<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.910> camera<00:03:30.120> channel<00:03:30.870> it

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
opposite side of the camera channel it

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.559 
opposite side of the camera channel it
through<00:03:31.139> the<00:03:31.290> fabric<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.769> out<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.220> front

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
through the fabric and out the front

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.390 
through the fabric and out the front
unchanged<00:03:33.569> no<00:03:34.440> light<00:03:34.680> would<00:03:34.859> bounce<00:03:34.980> off<00:03:35.220> the

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
unchanged no light would bounce off the

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.580 
unchanged no light would bounce off the
cloak<00:03:35.639> or<00:03:35.819> what<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.239> covers<00:03:36.389> inside<00:03:36.870> so<00:03:37.530> you

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
cloak or what it covers inside so you

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.080 
cloak or what it covers inside so you
would<00:03:37.799> just<00:03:37.829> see<00:03:38.250> what's<00:03:38.459> on<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:38.670> opposite

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
would just see what's on the opposite

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.910 
would just see what's on the opposite
side<00:03:39.299> of<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.480> cloak<00:03:39.690> kind<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.769> like

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
side of the cloak kind of like

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.330 
side of the cloak kind of like
camouflage<00:03:41.340> in<00:03:42.350> every<00:03:43.350> other<00:03:43.620> side<00:03:44.069> of<00:03:44.250> the

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
camouflage in every other side of the

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.069 
camouflage in every other side of the
cloak<00:03:44.639> which<00:03:44.880> is<00:03:45.060> channel<00:03:45.329> light<00:03:45.630> to<00:03:45.840> its

cloak which is channel light to its
opposite<00:03:46.769> side<00:03:47.040> so<00:03:47.880> none<00:03:48.630> of<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.900> light<00:03:49.079> would

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
opposite side so none of the light would

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.550 
opposite side so none of the light would
even<00:03:49.590> get<00:03:49.889> to<00:03:50.069> what's<00:03:50.310> inside<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:50.940> cloak<00:03:51.239> and

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
even get to what's inside the cloak and

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.750 
even get to what's inside the cloak and
none<00:03:52.560> of<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.829> light<00:03:52.980> hitting<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.400> cloak

none of the light hitting the cloak
would<00:03:53.970> be<00:03:54.150> reflected<00:03:54.450> into<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:54.989> camera<00:03:55.470> lens

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
would be reflected into the camera lens

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.970 
would be reflected into the camera lens
so<00:03:56.670> there<00:03:56.819> would<00:03:56.910> be<00:03:56.940> nothing<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.359> see<00:03:57.980> all

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
so there would be nothing to see all

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.849 
so there would be nothing to see all
this<00:03:59.430> depends<00:03:59.819> on<00:04:00.030> channeling<00:04:00.930> light<00:04:01.230> which

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
this depends on channeling light which

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.089 
this depends on channeling light which
is<00:04:02.010> not<00:04:02.280> easy<00:04:02.579> but<00:04:03.450> nature<00:04:04.079> can<00:04:04.290> help

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
is not easy but nature can help

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:07.830 
is not easy but nature can help

alternating layers of air and chitin and
chitin<00:04:16.900> is<00:04:16.989> what<00:04:17.139> lobster<00:04:17.500> shells<00:04:17.709> are<00:04:17.859> made

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
of these alternating layers take

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.070 
of these alternating layers take
advantage<00:04:21.250> of<00:04:21.459> how<00:04:21.699> light<00:04:21.970> bounces<00:04:22.479> bends<00:04:22.900> and

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
advantage of how light bounces bends and

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.140 
advantage of how light bounces bends and
mixes<00:04:23.440> to<00:04:23.860> channel<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.400> reds<00:04:24.610> yellows<00:04:24.759> greens

oranges<00:04:25.449> basically<00:04:26.440> every<00:04:26.800> color<00:04:27.039> of<00:04:27.280> light

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520

except<00:04:28.150> blue<00:04:28.509> all<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:29.349> way<00:04:29.440> to<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.740> back<00:04:29.919> of

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099 
except blue all the way to the back of

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:32.999 
except blue all the way to the back of
the<00:04:30.190> wing<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:31.690> blues<00:04:31.930> don't<00:04:32.349> get<00:04:32.650> channeled

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
the wing the blues don't get channeled

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:34.800 
the wing the blues don't get channeled
through<00:04:33.160> so<00:04:33.820> this<00:04:34.000> is<00:04:34.120> why<00:04:34.240> you<00:04:34.300> see<00:04:34.509> blue<00:04:34.660> on

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
through so this is why you see blue on

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.650 
through so this is why you see blue on
the<00:04:34.930> surface<00:04:35.320> but<00:04:35.650> no<00:04:35.830> other<00:04:36.009> color<00:04:36.250> if<00:04:37.060> you

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
the surface but no other color if you

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.330 
the surface but no other color if you
could<00:04:37.870> take<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.349> color<00:04:38.620> channeling

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
could take the color channeling

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.790 
could take the color channeling
structures<00:04:39.849> of<00:04:40.090> a<00:04:40.180> butterfly<00:04:40.660> wing<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:41.110> weave

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
structures of a butterfly wing and weave

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.189 
structures of a butterfly wing and weave
them<00:04:42.070> together<00:04:42.280> into<00:04:42.759> a<00:04:42.880> fabric<00:04:43.240> you<00:04:44.110> would

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
them together into a fabric you would

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:45.990 
them together into a fabric you would
have<00:04:44.380> a<00:04:44.410> cloak<00:04:44.800> that<00:04:44.830> would<00:04:45.220> be<00:04:45.340> invisible<00:04:45.639> to

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
have a cloak that would be invisible to

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.920 
have a cloak that would be invisible to
every<00:04:46.360> color<00:04:46.660> of<00:04:46.960> light<00:04:47.229> except<00:04:47.860> blue<00:04:48.660> if<00:04:49.660> we

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
every color of light except blue if we

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.320 
every color of light except blue if we
lived<00:04:50.139> in<00:04:50.229> a<00:04:50.349> world<00:04:50.500> with<00:04:50.800> no<00:04:50.830> blue<00:04:51.280> light<00:04:51.550> no

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
lived in a world with no blue light no

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.390 
lived in a world with no blue light no
blue<00:04:52.599> could<00:04:52.840> ever<00:04:52.990> be<00:04:53.199> reflected<00:04:53.860> so<00:04:54.340> our

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
blue could ever be reflected so our

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.839 
blue could ever be reflected so our
cloak<00:04:54.729> would<00:04:54.910> work<00:04:55.090> great<00:04:56.430> with<00:04:57.430> someone

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
cloak would work great with someone

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:59.370 
cloak would work great with someone
shined<00:04:58.060> a<00:04:58.240> blue<00:04:58.449> light<00:04:58.660> on<00:04:58.690> you<00:04:59.020> and<00:04:59.199> your

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380 
shined a blue light on you and your

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.920 
shined a blue light on you and your
cloak<00:04:59.789> it<00:05:00.789> would<00:05:00.910> look<00:05:01.030> kind<00:05:01.210> of<00:05:01.360> silly<00:05:01.660> to

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
cloak it would look kind of silly to

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.800 
cloak it would look kind of silly to
work<00:05:02.889> in<00:05:03.070> our<00:05:03.220> world<00:05:03.250> your<00:05:04.060> cork<00:05:04.419> would<00:05:04.599> have

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
work in our world your cork would have

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
work in our world your cork would have
to<00:05:04.990> channel<00:05:05.440> all<00:05:05.560> colors<00:05:06.389> including<00:05:07.389> blue<00:05:07.830> so

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
to channel all colors including blue so

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.620 
to channel all colors including blue so
how<00:05:09.009> do<00:05:09.070> you<00:05:09.430> invent<00:05:09.789> a<00:05:09.910> true<00:05:10.120> photonic

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
how do you invent a true photonic

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.850 
how do you invent a true photonic
invisibility<00:05:11.139> cloak

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
invisibility cloak

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.189 
invisibility cloak
well<00:05:12.520> any<00:05:12.849> proton<00:05:13.570> a<00:05:13.599> cloak<00:05:13.840> should<00:05:14.080> be

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
well any proton a cloak should be

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:15.719 
well any proton a cloak should be
possible<00:05:14.380> right<00:05:14.680> because<00:05:15.130> you<00:05:15.250> can<00:05:15.460> mess<00:05:15.699> with

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
possible right because you can mess with

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.180 
possible right because you can mess with
how<00:05:16.000> light<00:05:16.240> bounces<00:05:16.509> bends<00:05:17.080> and<00:05:17.320> mixes<00:05:17.620> all

how light bounces bends and mixes all
right<00:05:18.370> well<00:05:18.669> I'm<00:05:19.000> going<00:05:19.330> to<00:05:19.389> invent<00:05:19.720> a

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
right well I'm going to invent a

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.279 
right well I'm going to invent a
photonic<00:05:20.199> cork<00:05:20.560> first<00:05:20.860> I<00:05:21.280> already<00:05:22.150> had<00:05:25.289> you

photonic cork first I already had you

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.000 
photonic cork first I already had you
