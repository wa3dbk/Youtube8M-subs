00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:25.790 
are also a few things about the spotting

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.850 
are also a few things about the spotting
mechanic<00:00:26.240> that<00:00:26.419> many<00:00:26.930> players<00:00:27.230> are<00:00:27.500> not<00:00:27.590> aware

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
mechanic that many players are not aware

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.249 
mechanic that many players are not aware
of<00:00:28.040> and<00:00:28.310> that<00:00:28.390> is<00:00:29.390> what<00:00:29.660> we<00:00:29.810> will<00:00:29.960> have<00:00:30.110> a<00:00:30.140> look

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
of and that is what we will have a look

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.180 
of and that is what we will have a look
at<00:00:30.500> in<00:00:30.710> this<00:00:30.890> video<00:00:32.290> so<00:00:33.290> in<00:00:33.530> front<00:00:33.740> of<00:00:33.920> me<00:00:34.070> we

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
at in this video so in front of me we

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.980 
at in this video so in front of me we
have<00:00:34.220> an<00:00:34.430> enemy<00:00:34.550> and<00:00:34.910> when<00:00:35.329> I<00:00:35.360> now<00:00:35.510> take<00:00:35.750> one

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:35.990 
have an enemy and when I now take one

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:37.600 
have an enemy and when I now take one
more<00:00:36.140> step<00:00:36.380> towards<00:00:36.440> him<00:00:37.010> then<00:00:37.220> this<00:00:37.400> will

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
more step towards him then this will

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.390 
more step towards him then this will
trigger<00:00:37.850> a<00:00:37.940> 3d<00:00:38.480> spotting<00:00:38.720> triangle<00:00:39.500> and<00:00:39.650> then

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
trigger a 3d spotting triangle and then

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.550 
trigger a 3d spotting triangle and then
I<00:00:40.430> now<00:00:40.610> change<00:00:40.850> my<00:00:41.090> few<00:00:41.420> to<00:00:41.630> look<00:00:41.810> at<00:00:41.989> him<00:00:42.170> then

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.710 
I now change my few to look at him then
I<00:00:42.650> will<00:00:42.800> also<00:00:42.920> see<00:00:43.370> his<00:00:43.550> name<00:00:43.820> Tech<00:00:44.090> and<00:00:44.330> the

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
I will also see his name Tech and the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.900 
I will also see his name Tech and the
health<00:00:44.930> bar<00:00:45.200> in<00:00:45.800> addition<00:00:46.220> to<00:00:46.340> that<00:00:46.490> we<00:00:46.700> also

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
health bar in addition to that we also

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.820 
health bar in addition to that we also
get<00:00:47.240> the<00:00:47.390> triangle<00:00:47.900> on<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:48.170> mini-map<00:00:48.500> for

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830

if<00:01:06.890> I<00:01:07.130> want<00:01:07.400> that<00:01:07.759> my<00:01:08.150> teammates<00:01:08.659> can<00:01:08.930> also<00:01:09.140> see

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
if I want that my teammates can also see

if I want that my teammates can also see
the<00:01:09.439> 3d<00:01:09.890> triangle<00:01:10.369> then<00:01:10.790> I<00:01:10.820> actually<00:01:11.090> have<00:01:11.630> to

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
the 3d triangle then I actually have to

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.039 
the 3d triangle then I actually have to
spot<00:01:12.140> this<00:01:12.320> player<00:01:12.590> manually<00:01:13.600> now<00:01:14.600> what<00:01:14.899> will

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
spot this player manually now what will

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.719 
spot this player manually now what will
happen<00:01:15.079> when<00:01:15.439> I'm<00:01:15.560> not<00:01:15.799> looking<00:01:16.219> at<00:01:16.340> him<00:01:16.549> and

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
happen when I'm not looking at him and

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.819 
happen when I'm not looking at him and
he<00:01:16.939> is<00:01:16.999> firing<00:01:17.299> his<00:01:17.479> weapon<00:01:17.570> without<00:01:18.170> using<00:01:18.740> a

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
he is firing his weapon without using a

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.399 
he is firing his weapon without using a
suppressor<00:01:19.329> then<00:01:20.329> this<00:01:20.600> will<00:01:20.749> trigger<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.109> 2d

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
suppressor then this will trigger the 2d

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.230 
suppressor then this will trigger the 2d
spotting<00:01:21.829> which<00:01:22.369> means<00:01:22.609> that<00:01:22.820> even<00:01:22.939> show<00:01:23.210> up

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
spotting which means that even show up

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.929 
spotting which means that even show up
on<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.570> mini-map<00:01:23.899> for<00:01:24.170> my<00:01:24.289> entire<00:01:24.710> team<00:01:25.159> but

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
on the mini-map for my entire team but

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.849 
on the mini-map for my entire team but
he<00:01:26.030> will<00:01:26.179> not<00:01:26.270> only<00:01:26.450> show<00:01:26.749> up<00:01:26.990> there<00:01:27.319> we<00:01:27.740> will

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
he will not only show up there we will

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:29.709 
he will not only show up there we will
also<00:01:28.069> be<00:01:28.310> able<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.609> track<00:01:28.939> his<00:01:29.119> movement<00:01:29.600> and

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:29.719 
also be able to track his movement and

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:32.739 
also be able to track his movement and
where<00:01:30.289> he's<00:01:30.439> looking<00:01:30.710> at<00:01:31.069> in<00:01:31.280> real<00:01:31.490> time<00:01:31.850> this

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
where he's looking at in real time this

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:37.510 
where he's looking at in real time this
system<00:01:33.229> is<00:01:33.380> called<00:01:33.619> audio<00:01:34.280> spotting<00:01:35.859> if<00:01:36.859> he<00:01:37.280> is

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
system is called audio spotting if he is

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.520 
system is called audio spotting if he is
using<00:01:37.789> a<00:01:38.060> suppressor<00:01:38.450> then<00:01:38.749> he<00:01:38.899> will<00:01:39.049> not<00:01:39.289> show

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
using a suppressor then he will not show

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.020 
using a suppressor then he will not show
up<00:01:39.679> on<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.889> mini-map<00:01:40.249> anymore<00:01:40.700> when<00:01:40.880> he's

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
up on the mini-map anymore when he's

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.160 
up on the mini-map anymore when he's
firing<00:01:41.299> his<00:01:41.539> weapon<00:01:43.060> now<00:01:44.060> we<00:01:44.389> could<00:01:44.569> debate<00:01:44.719> if

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
firing his weapon now we could debate if

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.959 
firing his weapon now we could debate if
he<00:01:45.439> should<00:01:45.499> show<00:01:45.799> up<00:01:45.920> on<00:01:46.039> the<00:01:46.159> mini-map<00:01:46.490> at<00:01:46.729> all

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
he should show up on the mini-map at all

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.669 
he should show up on the mini-map at all
when<00:01:47.179> he<00:01:47.210> is<00:01:47.329> using<00:01:47.600> his<00:01:47.869> gun<00:01:48.079> without<00:01:48.499> the

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
when he is using his gun without the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.279 
when he is using his gun without the
suppressor<00:01:49.039> I<00:01:49.429> would<00:01:50.329> argue<00:01:50.539> that<00:01:50.719> the<00:01:51.079> point

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
suppressor I would argue that the point

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:52.809 
suppressor I would argue that the point
of<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:51.499> suppressor<00:01:51.859> is<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:52.249> get<00:01:52.399> rid<00:01:52.579> of<00:01:52.609> the

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
of the suppressor is to get rid of the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:54.760 
of the suppressor is to get rid of the
noise<00:01:52.999> of<00:01:53.209> the<00:01:53.329> weapon<00:01:53.719> and<00:01:53.899> that<00:01:54.469> noise<00:01:54.709> is

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
noise of the weapon and that noise is

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.730 
noise of the weapon and that noise is
how<00:01:55.100> I<00:01:55.310> identify<00:01:56.179> if<00:01:56.420> an<00:01:56.539> enemy<00:01:56.689> is<00:01:56.959> nearby<00:01:57.259> I

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
how I identify if an enemy is nearby I

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.770 
how I identify if an enemy is nearby I
don't<00:01:58.310> need<00:01:58.520> some<00:01:58.729> 2d<00:01:59.030> icon<00:01:59.359> on<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.569> mini-map

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
don't need some 2d icon on the mini-map

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.419 
don't need some 2d icon on the mini-map
that<00:02:00.079> shows<00:02:00.319> up<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.709> lets<00:02:00.889> me<00:02:00.979> track<00:02:01.249> the

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
that shows up and lets me track the

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.639 
that shows up and lets me track the
enemy<00:02:01.700> in<00:02:01.819> real<00:02:01.999> time<00:02:02.359> because<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.020> have<00:02:03.350> ears

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
enemy in real time because I have ears

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.830 
enemy in real time because I have ears
for<00:02:03.979> that<00:02:04.189> and<00:02:04.399> in<00:02:04.969> my<00:02:05.179> opinion<00:02:05.299> players

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
for that and in my opinion players

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.449 
for that and in my opinion players
should<00:02:06.139> be<00:02:06.259> aware<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.649> what<00:02:06.979> is<00:02:07.069> going<00:02:07.249> on

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
should be aware of what is going on

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.999 
should be aware of what is going on
around<00:02:07.639> them<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.270> this<00:02:08.990> includes<00:02:09.470> listening

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
around them and this includes listening

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.760 
around them and this includes listening
to<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.280> sounds<00:02:10.729> around<00:02:11.000> them<00:02:11.470> but<00:02:12.470> that

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
to the sounds around them but that

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.530 
to the sounds around them but that
change<00:02:13.069> would<00:02:13.250> be<00:02:13.459> too<00:02:13.730> big<00:02:13.910> for<00:02:13.940> battlefield

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
change would be too big for battlefield

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.449 
change would be too big for battlefield
4<00:02:14.750> at<00:02:15.050> least<00:02:15.319> for<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.650> normal<00:02:15.980> mode<00:02:16.130> I<00:02:16.370> can

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
4 at least for the normal mode I can

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.070 
4 at least for the normal mode I can
imagine<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.270> it<00:02:17.480> could<00:02:17.630> be<00:02:17.750> done<00:02:17.840> in<00:02:17.990> the

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
imagine that it could be done in the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.559 
imagine that it could be done in the
classic<00:02:18.439> mode<00:02:18.590> but<00:02:19.189> for<00:02:19.370> normal<00:02:19.549> I<00:02:19.939> want<00:02:20.420> to

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
classic mode but for normal I want to

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.750 
classic mode but for normal I want to
suggest<00:02:20.720> something<00:02:21.260> else<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.310> is<00:02:22.580> to

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
suggest something else and that is to

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.920 
suggest something else and that is to
get<00:02:22.879> rid<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.420> real-time

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
get rid of the real-time

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.259 
get rid of the real-time
I'm<00:02:23.959> tracking<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.829> player<00:02:25.040> this<00:02:26.030> means

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
I'm tracking of the player this means

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.849 
I'm tracking of the player this means
that<00:02:26.450> if<00:02:26.599> a<00:02:26.689> player<00:02:26.900> fires<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.469> weapon<00:02:27.739> without

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:27.859 
that if a player fires a weapon without

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.550 
that if a player fires a weapon without
a<00:02:28.069> suppressor<00:02:28.579> then<00:02:29.180> this<00:02:29.629> will<00:02:29.870> only<00:02:30.109> trigger

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
a suppressor then this will only trigger

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.800 
a suppressor then this will only trigger
a<00:02:30.650> ping<00:02:31.040> on<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.370> mini-map<00:02:31.609> that<00:02:32.180> flashes<00:02:32.659> up

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
a ping on the mini-map that flashes up

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.959 
a ping on the mini-map that flashes up
at<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.140> location<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.769> player<00:02:34.010> was<00:02:34.310> at<00:02:34.579> when

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:34.969 
at the location the player was at when

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:35.830 
at the location the player was at when
he<00:02:35.209> fired

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
he fired

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.039 
he fired
so<00:02:36.379> no<00:02:36.560> more<00:02:36.799> real-time<00:02:37.010> tracking<00:02:37.579> I<00:02:38.049> would

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
so no more real-time tracking I would

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.959 
so no more real-time tracking I would
also<00:02:39.200> limit<00:02:39.439> a<00:02:39.590> distance<00:02:40.099> inside<00:02:40.579> which<00:02:40.790> this

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:40.969 
also limit a distance inside which this

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:42.970 
also limit a distance inside which this
system<00:02:41.420> is<00:02:41.540> active<00:02:41.959> so<00:02:42.139> that<00:02:42.260> it<00:02:42.620> does<00:02:42.799> not

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
system is active so that it does not

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.399 
system is active so that it does not
work<00:02:43.159> across<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.819> map<00:02:44.000> in<00:02:44.659> my<00:02:44.810> opinion<00:02:45.230> this

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:45.409 
work across the map in my opinion this

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.349 
work across the map in my opinion this
would<00:02:45.620> be<00:02:45.859> a<00:02:45.889> good<00:02:46.430> compromise<00:02:46.730> for<00:02:47.299> the

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:47.359 
would be a good compromise for the

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.929 
would be a good compromise for the
normal<00:02:47.780> mode<00:02:48.069> so<00:02:49.069> as<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.459> showed<00:02:49.489> you<00:02:49.819> before

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
normal mode so as I showed you before

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.179 
normal mode so as I showed you before
you<00:02:50.239> can<00:02:50.450> get<00:02:50.629> the<00:02:50.840> 3d<00:02:51.230> triangle<00:02:51.799> by<00:02:51.889> just

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
you can get the 3d triangle by just

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:53.890 
you can get the 3d triangle by just
looking<00:02:52.400> at<00:02:52.760> an<00:02:52.879> enemy<00:02:53.150> player<00:02:53.389> when<00:02:53.659> you<00:02:53.780> are

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
looking at an enemy player when you are

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.020 
looking at an enemy player when you are
close<00:02:54.170> enough<00:02:54.530> but<00:02:55.189> to<00:02:55.430> provide<00:02:55.760> all<00:02:56.000> your

team members with that triangle you

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.559

to spot the enemy the problem we have

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.530 
to spot the enemy the problem we have
here<00:03:06.739> is<00:03:06.980> that<00:03:07.069> you<00:03:07.280> can<00:03:07.459> easily<00:03:07.700> exploit<00:03:08.299> the

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
here is that you can easily exploit the

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.599 
here is that you can easily exploit the
active<00:03:08.840> spotting<00:03:09.200> function<00:03:09.650> to<00:03:09.889> reveal<00:03:10.340> or

active spotting function to reveal or

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:12.429 
active spotting function to reveal or
find<00:03:10.969> enemy<00:03:11.359> players<00:03:11.719> that<00:03:11.870> are<00:03:11.959> relatively

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:12.439 
find enemy players that are relatively

find enemy players that are relatively
well<00:03:12.709> hidden<00:03:12.980> all<00:03:13.579> you<00:03:13.819> need<00:03:13.969> to<00:03:14.090> do<00:03:14.239> is<00:03:14.450> to

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
well hidden all you need to do is to

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.970 
well hidden all you need to do is to
constantly<00:03:15.109> press<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.709> spotting<00:03:16.189> button<00:03:17.980> the

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
constantly press the spotting button the

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.979 
constantly press the spotting button the
reason<00:03:19.310> why<00:03:19.459> you<00:03:19.519> can<00:03:19.819> find<00:03:20.180> players<00:03:20.540> that<00:03:20.810> way

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
reason why you can find players that way

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.929 
reason why you can find players that way
is<00:03:21.260> because<00:03:21.500> spotting<00:03:22.040> works<00:03:22.250> like<00:03:22.489> a<00:03:22.519> cone

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:22.939 
is because spotting works like a cone

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.229 
is because spotting works like a cone
inside<00:03:23.689> which<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:23.989> can<00:03:24.200> see<00:03:24.500> enemy<00:03:24.950> players

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
inside which it can see enemy players

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.640 
inside which it can see enemy players

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
change this area to be more like a

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.960 
change this area to be more like a
diamond<00:03:30.290> this<00:03:31.010> means<00:03:31.280> that<00:03:31.459> over<00:03:31.790> longer

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
diamond this means that over longer

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.430 
diamond this means that over longer
distances<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:32.780> need<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:33.079> be<00:03:33.199> much<00:03:33.409> more

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
distances you need to be much more

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.589 
distances you need to be much more
accurate<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.430> be<00:03:34.549> able<00:03:34.699> to<00:03:34.879> spot<00:03:35.150> enemy

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
accurate to be able to spot enemy

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.809 
accurate to be able to spot enemy
players<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:36.739> cannot<00:03:37.159> exploit<00:03:37.579> it

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
players and so you cannot exploit it

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.030 
players and so you cannot exploit it
anymore<00:03:38.060> at<00:03:38.690> least<00:03:38.959> that's<00:03:39.199> the<00:03:39.319> theory<00:03:39.650> which

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
anymore at least that's the theory which

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.270 
anymore at least that's the theory which
we<00:03:40.189> can<00:03:40.370> hopefully<00:03:40.549> test<00:03:41.030> soon<00:03:41.299> in<00:03:41.569> the<00:03:41.689> CTE

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
we can hopefully test soon in the CTE

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.710 
we can hopefully test soon in the CTE
now<00:03:43.280> that's<00:03:43.549> one<00:03:43.729> more<00:03:43.879> thing<00:03:43.939> that<00:03:44.120> I<00:03:44.299> want<00:03:44.569> to

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
now that's one more thing that I want to

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.309 
now that's one more thing that I want to
show<00:03:44.930> you<00:03:45.159> about<00:03:46.299> 130<00:03:47.299> metres<00:03:47.780> away<00:03:47.900> there<00:03:48.260> is

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
show you about 130 metres away there is

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.589 
show you about 130 metres away there is
an<00:03:48.470> enemy<00:03:48.620> when<00:03:49.579> he<00:03:49.699> now<00:03:49.819> walks<00:03:50.090> out<00:03:50.389> of<00:03:50.419> his

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
an enemy when he now walks out of his

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.569 
an enemy when he now walks out of his
cupboard<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.109> he<00:03:51.169> suddenly<00:03:51.379> shows<00:03:51.919> up<00:03:51.949> on<00:03:52.400> the

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
cupboard and he suddenly shows up on the

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:52.990 
cupboard and he suddenly shows up on the
mini-map

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
mini-map

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.390 
mini-map
this<00:03:53.540> means<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.259> 2d<00:03:54.709> or<00:03:54.919> mini-map

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
this means that the 2d or mini-map

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.879 
this means that the 2d or mini-map
spotting<00:03:55.849> just<00:03:56.329> became<00:03:56.659> active<00:03:57.139> again<00:03:57.349> I

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
spotting just became active again I

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.369 
spotting just became active again I
didn't<00:03:58.280> do<00:03:58.400> anything<00:03:58.970> here<00:03:59.269> he<00:03:59.689> simply<00:04:00.169> walked

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
didn't do anything here he simply walked

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.460 
didn't do anything here he simply walked
into<00:04:00.859> my<00:04:00.979> crosshair<00:04:01.549> I<00:04:01.759> was<00:04:02.750> aware<00:04:03.049> that<00:04:03.290> this

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
into my crosshair I was aware that this

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.920 
into my crosshair I was aware that this
is<00:04:03.620> possible<00:04:04.040> at<00:04:04.129> close<00:04:04.400> range<00:04:04.729> but<00:04:05.359> as<00:04:05.659> one<00:04:05.900> of

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
is possible at close range but as one of

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.259 
is possible at close range but as one of
my<00:04:06.169> viewers<00:04:06.229> told<00:04:06.739> me<00:04:06.919> recently<00:04:07.099> this<00:04:07.790> also

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
my viewers told me recently this also

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.629 
my viewers told me recently this also
works<00:04:08.509> at<00:04:08.659> much<00:04:08.870> longer<00:04:09.319> distances<00:04:09.889> and<00:04:10.129> they

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
works at much longer distances and they

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.429 
works at much longer distances and they
really<00:04:10.909> do<00:04:11.030> not<00:04:11.180> have<00:04:11.359> to<00:04:11.509> be<00:04:11.629> accurate<00:04:12.109> at<00:04:12.259> all

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:12.439 
really do not have to be accurate at all

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.249 
really do not have to be accurate at all
the<00:04:12.889> area<00:04:13.189> inside<00:04:13.790> which<00:04:14.269> that<00:04:14.659> automatic

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:15.259 
the area inside which that automatic

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:17.949 
the area inside which that automatic
spotting<00:04:15.680> is<00:04:15.799> working<00:04:16.250> is<00:04:16.729> really<00:04:16.789> big<00:04:17.539> as<00:04:17.810> you

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
spotting is working is really big as you

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.529 
spotting is working is really big as you
can<00:04:17.989> see<00:04:18.440> here<00:04:18.769> now<00:04:19.519> let's<00:04:19.820> try<00:04:20.030> this<00:04:20.090> again<00:04:20.239> at

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
can see here now let's try this again at

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.540 
can see here now let's try this again at
a<00:04:20.630> much<00:04:20.780> longer<00:04:21.259> distance<00:04:21.380> and<00:04:21.919> for<00:04:22.250> that<00:04:22.370> we

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
a much longer distance and for that we

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.850 
a much longer distance and for that we
also<00:04:22.759> need<00:04:23.030> to<00:04:23.090> bring<00:04:23.330> up<00:04:23.479> the<00:04:23.630> large<00:04:23.840> map<00:04:24.110> so

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
also need to bring up the large map so

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.159 
also need to bring up the large map so
now<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.580> enemy<00:04:25.940> player<00:04:26.150> will<00:04:26.419> start<00:04:26.449> to<00:04:26.960> walk

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
now the enemy player will start to walk

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.860 
now the enemy player will start to walk
into<00:04:27.440> my<00:04:27.710> crosshair<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.460> bam<00:04:29.090> he<00:04:29.570> got<00:04:29.750> too

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
into my crosshair and bam he got too

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.700 
into my crosshair and bam he got too
distorted<00:04:30.380> over<00:04:30.530> a<00:04:30.590> distance<00:04:30.800> of<00:04:31.099> 200<00:04:31.539> meters

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
distorted over a distance of 200 meters

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.959 
distorted over a distance of 200 meters
this<00:04:33.710> means<00:04:33.950> that<00:04:34.159> all<00:04:34.370> of<00:04:34.400> my<00:04:34.610> team<00:04:34.789> members

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:34.969 
this means that all of my team members

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:36.580 
this means that all of my team members
were<00:04:35.270> close<00:04:35.570> to<00:04:35.810> him<00:04:35.930> heaven

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
were close to him heaven

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.070 
were close to him heaven
on<00:04:36.800> their<00:04:37.160> mini-map<00:04:37.700> so<00:04:38.090> even<00:04:38.690> if<00:04:38.780> that<00:04:38.810> enemy

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
on their mini-map so even if that enemy

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.200 
on their mini-map so even if that enemy
tried<00:04:39.410> to<00:04:39.620> be<00:04:39.740> stealthy<00:04:40.250> and<00:04:40.430> sneak<00:04:40.730> up<00:04:40.940> on<00:04:41.180> a

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
tried to be stealthy and sneak up on a

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.960 
tried to be stealthy and sneak up on a
teammate<00:04:41.690> then<00:04:42.410> just<00:04:43.010> by<00:04:43.190> walking<00:04:43.580> through<00:04:43.610> my

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
teammate then just by walking through my

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.000 
teammate then just by walking through my
crosshair<00:04:44.480> which<00:04:44.600> is<00:04:44.750> 200<00:04:45.260> meters<00:04:45.560> away<00:04:45.680> he

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
crosshair which is 200 meters away he

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.850 
crosshair which is 200 meters away he
revealed<00:04:46.430> his<00:04:46.639> position<00:04:47.180> to<00:04:47.330> my<00:04:47.810> entire<00:04:48.350> team

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
revealed his position to my entire team

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.400 
revealed his position to my entire team
so<00:04:49.190> if<00:04:50.000> one<00:04:50.300> of<00:04:50.419> my<00:04:50.540> team<00:04:50.720> members<00:04:50.870> would<00:04:51.230> now

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
so if one of my team members would now

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.650 
so if one of my team members would now
turn<00:04:51.470> around<00:04:51.980> and<00:04:52.250> shoot<00:04:52.490> him<00:04:52.730> then<00:04:53.180> he<00:04:53.510> would

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:53.660 
turn around and shoot him then he would

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.570 
turn around and shoot him then he would
surely<00:04:53.840> wonder<00:04:54.350> how<00:04:54.500> that<00:04:54.800> could<00:04:54.830> happen<00:04:55.250> so

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
surely wonder how that could happen so

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.300 
surely wonder how that could happen so
in<00:04:56.480> my<00:04:56.660> opinion<00:04:56.780> this<00:04:57.230> mechanic<00:04:57.740> should<00:04:57.980> just

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
in my opinion this mechanic should just

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.670 
in my opinion this mechanic should just
be<00:04:58.520> completely<00:04:58.790> removed<00:04:59.419> because<00:05:00.230> of<00:05:00.440> how

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
be completely removed because of how

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.800 
be completely removed because of how
easily<00:05:00.919> you<00:05:01.220> can<00:05:01.250> constantly<00:05:01.970> spot<00:05:02.330> the<00:05:02.510> enemy

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
easily you can constantly spot the enemy

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.140 
easily you can constantly spot the enemy
players<00:05:03.050> without<00:05:03.590> actively<00:05:04.340> doing<00:05:04.520> anything

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
players without actively doing anything

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.750 
players without actively doing anything
or<00:05:05.360> even<00:05:06.080> noticing<00:05:06.680> that<00:05:06.919> you<00:05:07.070> just<00:05:07.280> spotted

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
or even noticing that you just spotted

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.140 
or even noticing that you just spotted
someone<00:05:08.120> who<00:05:08.510> is<00:05:08.600> 200<00:05:09.200> meters<00:05:09.530> away<00:05:10.030> let<00:05:11.030> me

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
someone who is 200 meters away let me

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.550 
someone who is 200 meters away let me
know<00:05:11.240> what<00:05:11.389> you<00:05:11.479> think<00:05:11.660> about<00:05:11.960> this<00:05:12.169> in<00:05:12.440> the

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
know what you think about this in the

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.530
