00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
really fun for me so in comparison to

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.800 
really fun for me so in comparison to
the<00:01:53.040> actual<00:01:53.369> original<00:01:53.670> movie<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.420> VP<00:01:54.990> of

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
the actual original movie a VP of

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.490 
the actual original movie a VP of
similar<00:01:57.810> atmosphere<00:01:58.250> better<00:01:59.250> worse<00:02:00.110> true<00:02:01.110> to

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
similar atmosphere better worse true to

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.959 
similar atmosphere better worse true to
the

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.770 
the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
Mercedes movie AVP blue let's make this

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.720 
Mercedes movie AVP blue let's make this
makes<00:02:08.140> it<00:02:08.410> it<00:02:08.860> kinda<00:02:09.310> sucked<00:02:09.759> but<00:02:10.420> okay<00:02:11.700> no<00:02:12.700> I

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
makes it it kinda sucked but okay no I

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.430 
makes it it kinda sucked but okay no I
don't<00:02:13.090> I<00:02:13.239> don't<00:02:13.300> I<00:02:13.660> like<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.170> don't<00:02:14.230> like<00:02:14.410> to

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
don't I don't I like I don't like to

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.350 
don't I don't I like I don't like to
think<00:02:14.709> of<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:14.950> as<00:02:15.130> like<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.610> AVP<00:02:15.940> movie

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
think of this as like the AVP movie

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.970 
think of this as like the AVP movie
considering<00:02:16.810> most<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.260> has<00:02:17.290> nothing<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.860> do

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
considering most of it has nothing to do

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.470 
considering most of it has nothing to do
with<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.190> AVP<00:02:18.400> movie<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:18.849> like<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.090> think<00:02:19.209> of<00:02:19.390> as

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
with the AVP movie I like to think of as

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.790 
with the AVP movie I like to think of as
more<00:02:19.690> as<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.260> as<00:02:20.530> aliens<00:02:21.519> with<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.269> predator

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
more as the as aliens with a predator

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.400 
more as the as aliens with a predator
yeah<00:02:23.800> see<00:02:24.250> you<00:02:24.430> or<00:02:25.239> to<00:02:25.420> see<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:25.870> prefer<00:02:26.260> the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
yeah see you or to see you prefer the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.259 
yeah see you or to see you prefer the
alien<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.220> human<00:02:27.489> gameplay<00:02:28.470> over<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:30.269> not

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
alien and human gameplay over the not

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.880 
alien and human gameplay over the not
necessarily<00:02:31.870> no<00:02:31.989> no<00:02:32.380> that's<00:02:32.590> know<00:02:32.709> what<00:02:32.830> I'm

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
necessarily no no that's know what I'm

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.710 
necessarily no no that's know what I'm
just<00:02:33.760> saying<00:02:33.970> I<00:02:34.090> don't<00:02:34.120> like<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.420> think<00:02:34.540> of<00:02:34.630> as

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
just saying I don't like to think of as

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.050 
just saying I don't like to think of as
a<00:02:34.870> VP<00:02:35.140> because<00:02:35.319> that<00:02:35.410> movie<00:02:35.620> blue<00:02:35.860> I<00:02:36.099> like<00:02:36.970> I

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
a VP because that movie blue I like I

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.880 
a VP because that movie blue I like I
think<00:02:37.269> of<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:37.420> as<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.569> this<00:02:38.440> much<00:02:38.650> more

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
think of it as the this much more

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.070 
think of it as the this much more
similar<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.760> aliens<00:02:40.330> really<00:02:40.569> there's<00:02:40.959> a

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
similar to aliens really there's a

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.509 
similar to aliens really there's a
colonial<00:02:41.530> Marines<00:02:41.799> they<00:02:41.980> all<00:02:42.099> have<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.340> same

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
colonial Marines they all have the same

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.809 
colonial Marines they all have the same
weapons<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.000> they're<00:02:43.090> fighting<00:02:43.360> aliens<00:02:43.480> in<00:02:43.959> a

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
weapons and they're fighting aliens in a

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.180 
weapons and they're fighting aliens in a
colonial<00:02:45.819> call<00:02:46.420> colony<00:02:46.989> for<00:02:47.739> most<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:48.069> it

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
colonial call colony for most of it

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.770 
colonial call colony for most of it
that's<00:02:48.340> most<00:02:48.610> of<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.880> game<00:02:49.090> you<00:02:49.360> go<00:02:49.510> into<00:02:49.720> a

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
that's most of the game you go into a

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.509 
that's most of the game you go into a
jungle<00:02:50.049> at<00:02:50.200> some<00:02:50.410> point<00:02:50.650> yeah<00:02:51.069> and<00:02:51.280> then<00:02:51.489> I

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
jungle at some point yeah and then I

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.009 
jungle at some point yeah and then I
like<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.819> think<00:02:51.940> there's<00:02:52.299> there's<00:02:52.630> an<00:02:52.780> alien

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019

like to think there's there's an alien
there's<00:02:53.680> like<00:02:53.799> a<00:02:53.950> li<00:02:54.130> there's<00:02:54.400> predators

also<00:05:48.919> really<00:05:49.280> really<00:05:49.400> hard<00:05:50.150> sometimes<00:05:50.510> it's

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
also really really hard sometimes it's

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.839 
also really really hard sometimes it's
like<00:05:51.289> it's<00:05:51.530> basically<00:05:51.860> like<00:05:52.099> you<00:05:52.400> stand<00:05:52.669> there

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:52.849 
like it's basically like you stand there

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:54.879 
like it's basically like you stand there
and<00:05:52.910> then<00:05:53.300> every<00:05:53.630> time<00:05:53.870> a<00:05:54.139> lien<00:05:54.500> stack<00:05:54.710> you

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
and then every time a lien stack you

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:55.960 
and then every time a lien stack you
there's<00:05:55.070> more<00:05:55.280> of<00:05:55.400> them<00:05:55.490> and<00:05:55.669> you're<00:05:55.820> in<00:05:55.910> a

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
there's more of them and you're in a

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.129 
there's more of them and you're in a
different<00:05:56.240> place<00:05:56.330> that's<00:05:56.660> harder<00:05:56.840> to<00:05:56.870> deal

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 
different place that's harder to deal

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
with the alien campaign i thought the

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.480 
with the alien campaign i thought the
alien<00:06:11.539> campaign<00:06:11.900> was<00:06:12.050> also<00:06:12.500> very<00:06:12.889> fun<00:06:13.160> as<00:06:13.280> well

alien campaign was also very fun as well

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.750 
alien campaign was also very fun as well
um<00:06:14.770> so<00:06:15.770> yeah<00:06:15.950> I<00:06:15.979> would<00:06:16.190> have<00:06:16.220> to<00:06:16.370> disagree<00:06:16.400> with

um so yeah I would have to disagree with

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.250 
um so yeah I would have to disagree with
most<00:06:17.000> of<00:06:17.270> most<00:06:17.659> what<00:06:17.810> people<00:06:18.020> are<00:06:18.110> saying
