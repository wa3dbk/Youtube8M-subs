In this guide we will see how to format a computer, by following simple procedures.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The first thing to do is get the OS disk to install  for windows
can buy from electronic stores for linux instead burn the downloaded ISO  to a DVD.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
In this video we will see the installation of Windows 7 that still comes to installations of other operating systems.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Place  in the DVD player without starting anything setup.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:49.000
In the second step we have to save files or programs more important. Obviously if you want to format all without saving anything you can skip this step.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If the data store are so many I recommend a portable hard disk or partition, if the quantity (data) is small enough to a pendrive or a DVD.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:11.000
To save any serial programs already installed you can use the program SoftKey, where just click on SAVE and choose your destination text document containing all the serials.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Now we have to change some BIOS settings, it represents a set of functions that provide information to access to hardware and PC peripherals

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
To access bisognia crush a particular key in the moment in which it appears the logo of the brand of your PC

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This button changes depending on the PC but generally uses f4 f2 or del, otherwise do a search on google.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:53.000
nce in the bios go in the boot and try the approach that manages the execution priority of the start, and bring option cdrom first

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Without going into this section Exit and save settings

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
After you restart press any key when asked to boot the dvd.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Now the screen will appear asking you where you usually language and in some cases information on the devices.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:19.000
After you've clicked on in this case we find a screen in Windows 7 that allows us to format our system

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
we just go to the item after you select Custom, and the disk containing the system, click on format.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Once this process click on forward
and wait for the end of the installation.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Before finishing the video I suggest you follow the next ladder to complete the best arrangement of the PC when you have finished formatting.I greet you and look to the next video.
