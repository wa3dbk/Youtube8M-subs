that live there's too many of them in
our<00:00:58.800> area<00:00:59.160> because<00:00:59.550> uh<00:00:59.579> because<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:01.170> global

warming<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:02.219> think<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.670> they<00:01:03.120> they're

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
warming I think and they they're

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.119 
warming I think and they they're
basically<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:03.840> overlords<00:01:04.619> would<00:01:04.799> scourge

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
basically like overlords would scourge

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.010 
basically like overlords would scourge
attach<00:01:05.460> them<00:01:05.760> because<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.540> could<00:01:06.659> hunt<00:01:06.869> them

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
attach them because you could hunt them

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.600 
attach them because you could hunt them
down<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.229> eat<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> Overlord<00:01:08.070> part<00:01:08.340> but<00:01:08.520> then

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
down and eat the Overlord part but then

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.830 
down and eat the Overlord part but then
the<00:01:08.729> scourge<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.210> get<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.510> at<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.689> same

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the scourge just get you at the same

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.600 
the scourge just get you at the same
time<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.260> she<00:01:10.290> could<00:01:10.500> spin<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> hit<00:01:11.250> by<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.430> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
time so she could spin a hit by that a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.090 
time so she could spin a hit by that a
few<00:01:11.820> times<00:01:11.850> she<00:01:12.570> also<00:01:13.020> fights<00:01:13.350> chick<00:01:13.740> ADA's

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
few times she also fights chick ADA's

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.130 
few times she also fights chick ADA's
which<00:01:14.640> are<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.030> well<00:01:15.659> she<00:01:15.840> only<00:01:15.869> gets

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
which are like well she only gets

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.240 
which are like well she only gets
someone<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.619> their<00:01:16.740> ground<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.159> they're

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
someone on their ground and they're

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.370 
someone on their ground and they're
about<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.460> hatch<00:01:17.759> out<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.060> those<00:01:18.330> shells<00:01:19.229> that

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
about to hatch out of those shells that

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.690 
about to hatch out of those shells that
come<00:01:19.530> out<00:01:19.650> every<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:20.070> seven<00:01:20.369> years<00:01:20.400> or

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
come out every like seven years or

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.580 
come out every like seven years or
whatever<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:21.119> guess<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:21.960> scourge<00:01:22.320> eggs

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
whatever I guess so like scourge eggs

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.260 
whatever I guess so like scourge eggs
she's<00:01:23.220> done<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.520> few<00:01:23.580> times<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.150> then

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
she's done that a few times and then

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.539 
she's done that a few times and then
those<00:01:25.170> chickens<00:01:25.680> have<00:01:25.770> woken<00:01:25.979> up<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.310> flown

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
those chickens have woken up and flown

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.969 
those chickens have woken up and flown
away<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:26.820> she<00:01:27.570> really<00:01:28.409> hasn't<00:01:28.560> been<00:01:28.710> able<00:01:28.829> to

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
away so she really hasn't been able to

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.920 
away so she really hasn't been able to
tag<00:01:29.189> them<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:30.090> sometimes<00:01:30.450> they<00:01:30.509> attack<00:01:30.750> her

help<00:04:58.930> towards<00:04:59.349> those<00:04:59.740> those<00:05:00.070> dreams<00:05:00.370> of<00:05:00.520> mine

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
help towards those those dreams of mine

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.400 
help towards those those dreams of mine
and<00:05:01.509> the<00:05:01.570> second<00:05:01.810> major<00:05:01.930> reason<00:05:02.259> it's<00:05:02.380> just

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
and the second major reason it's just

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.839 
and the second major reason it's just
because<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:02.800> time<00:05:03.039> takes<00:05:03.340> to<00:05:03.520> do<00:05:03.729> these

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 
because the time takes to do these

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:06.060 
because the time takes to do these
videos<00:05:03.910> um<00:05:04.509> as<00:05:04.780> those<00:05:05.380> of<00:05:05.410> you<00:05:05.560> who've<00:05:05.800> done

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
videos um as those of you who've done

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.950 
videos um as those of you who've done

movies before or commentaries would know

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.260 
movies before or commentaries would know
it<00:05:08.830> takes<00:05:09.009> quite<00:05:09.190> a<00:05:09.250> long<00:05:09.340> time<00:05:09.460> to<00:05:09.849> make<00:05:10.090> these

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:54.099 
descriptions for the videos I make

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:56.490 
descriptions for the videos I make
playlists<00:05:54.550> and<00:05:54.909> all<00:05:55.780> that<00:05:55.930> to<00:05:56.080> try<00:05:56.259> to<00:05:56.289> make<00:05:56.469> it

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
playlists and all that to try to make it

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.649 
playlists and all that to try to make it
as<00:05:56.710> easily<00:05:57.009> accessible<00:05:57.669> as<00:05:57.729> possible<00:05:57.789> so<00:05:58.570> I'd

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:58.659 
as easily accessible as possible so I'd

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.510 
as easily accessible as possible so I'd
say<00:05:58.810> it<00:05:58.900> takes<00:05:58.960> about<00:05:59.199> 30-40<00:05:59.860> minutes<00:06:00.130> and<00:06:00.310> if

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
say it takes about 30-40 minutes and if

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.050 
say it takes about 30-40 minutes and if
you<00:06:00.639> consider<00:06:01.270> that<00:06:01.449> I<00:06:01.509> have<00:06:01.840> about<00:06:02.789> 400<00:06:03.789> video

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
you consider that I have about 400 video

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.010 
you consider that I have about 400 video
parts<00:06:04.500> each<00:06:05.500> about<00:06:05.919> 10<00:06:06.159> minutes<00:06:06.370> and<00:06:06.759> if

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
parts each about 10 minutes and if

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.029 
parts each about 10 minutes and if
there's<00:06:08.020> 3d<00:06:08.530> minutes<00:06:09.070> per<00:06:09.340> part<00:06:09.909> then<00:06:10.180> it's

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
there's 3d minutes per part then it's

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:15.209 
there's 3d minutes per part then it's
12,000<00:06:12.039> minutes<00:06:12.310> which<00:06:12.639> is<00:06:13.409> 200<00:06:14.409> hours<00:06:14.770> so

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:15.219 
12,000 minutes which is 200 hours so

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:17.540 
12,000 minutes which is 200 hours so
rather<00:06:16.060> significant<00:06:16.780> investment<00:06:17.229> of<00:06:17.289> my<00:06:17.380> time

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
rather significant investment of my time

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.159 
rather significant investment of my time
so<00:06:18.550> it's<00:06:19.300> something<00:06:19.449> that<00:06:19.659> would<00:06:19.750> be<00:06:19.810> nice<00:06:19.960> to

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169 
so it's something that would be nice to

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:21.959 
so it's something that would be nice to
get<00:06:20.289> a<00:06:20.650> little<00:06:20.919> bit<00:06:21.070> of<00:06:21.159> something<00:06:21.340> for<00:06:21.550> it<00:06:21.789> and

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:21.969 
get a little bit of something for it and

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:25.409 
get a little bit of something for it and
finally<00:06:22.659> it's<00:06:22.960> it's<00:06:23.949> a<00:06:24.070> great<00:06:24.370> major<00:06:24.669> to<00:06:24.969> be<00:06:25.150> to

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419 
finally it's it's a great major to be to

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:26.580 
finally it's it's a great major to be to
be<00:06:25.539> in<00:06:25.630> a<00:06:25.690> history<00:06:26.020> major<00:06:26.169> in<00:06:26.320> international
