you guys are going to want to do is

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.970 
you guys are going to want to do is
start<00:00:45.030> up<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.300> game<00:00:45.539> mode<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.710> quick

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
start up this game mode and this quick

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.740 
start up this game mode and this quick
side<00:00:47.190> note<00:00:47.219> here<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.700> ps3<00:00:47.969> users<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.629> can

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
side note here for ps3 users you can

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.299 
side note here for ps3 users you can
simply<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.110> create<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> small<00:00:49.920> little<00:00:50.070> death

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
simply just create a small little death

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.490 
simply just create a small little death
match<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.300> essentially<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> main<00:00:52.079> idea<00:00:52.260> of

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
match so essentially the main idea of

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.080 
match so essentially the main idea of
this<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.250> create<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.579> death<00:00:53.879> match

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
this is you have to create a death match

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.240 
this is you have to create a death match
with<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.899> melee<00:00:55.230> weapons<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.800> want<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
with the melee weapons that you want and

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.130 
with the melee weapons that you want and
you<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:57.000> pretty<00:00:57.120> much<00:00:57.210> keep<00:00:57.480> them<00:00:57.660> afterwards

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
you can pretty much keep them afterwards

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.959 
you can pretty much keep them afterwards
so<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.320> made<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> premade<00:00:59.010> game<00:00:59.190> mode<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.850> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
so I made a premade game mode in the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.729 
so I made a premade game mode in the
