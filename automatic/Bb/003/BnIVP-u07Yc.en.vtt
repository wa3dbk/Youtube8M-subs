situation especially the printer in the

situation especially the printer in the
past<00:00:36.719> our<00:00:37.020> printer<00:00:37.290> tended<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.649> be<00:00:37.739> connected

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
past our printer tended to be connected

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.770 
past our printer tended to be connected
directly<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.579> our<00:00:38.610> printer<00:00:39.000> using<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.360> USB

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
directly to our printer using a USB

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.119 
directly to our printer using a USB
cable<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.230> that's<00:00:40.410> not<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> case<00:00:40.829> anymore

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
cable and that's not the case anymore

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.650 
cable and that's not the case anymore
now<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.610> our<00:00:41.760> computer<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.270> mobile<00:00:42.629> and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
now that our computer is mobile and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.450 
now that our computer is mobile and
moving<00:00:43.110> around<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.379> house<00:00:43.530> unless<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.219> want

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
moving around the house unless you want

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.920 
moving around the house unless you want
to<00:00:44.550> carry<00:00:44.850> around<00:00:44.969> your<00:00:45.180> printer<00:00:45.510> everywhere

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
to carry around your printer everywhere

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.510 
to carry around your printer everywhere
you<00:00:46.079> go<00:00:46.260> now<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.920> course<00:00:47.129> when<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.399> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
you go now of course when you have a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.650 
you go now of course when you have a
printer<00:00:47.850> that's<00:00:48.000> connected<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.510> your<00:00:48.600> network

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
printer that's connected to your network

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.270 
printer that's connected to your network
like<00:00:49.110> one<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.379> our<00:00:49.469> wireless<00:00:49.649> printers<00:00:50.129> here

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
like one of our wireless printers here

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.619 
like one of our wireless printers here
that's<00:00:50.550> not<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.730> problem<00:00:51.000> anymore

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
that's not a problem anymore

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.090 
that's not a problem anymore
now<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.960> trick<00:00:52.260> is<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.440> make<00:00:52.559> sure<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.949> your

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
now the trick is to make sure that your

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.889 
now the trick is to make sure that your
computer<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.699> actually<00:00:54.180> connect<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
computer can actually connect to the

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.049 
computer can actually connect to the
printer<00:00:55.350> over<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.829> network<00:00:56.010> now<00:00:56.850> when<00:00:56.969> you

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
printer over the network now when you

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.549 
printer over the network now when you
get<00:00:57.149> one<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.329> these<00:00:57.480> printers<00:00:57.870> they<00:00:58.230> typically

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
get one of these printers they typically

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.799 
get one of these printers they typically
come<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.949> set-up<00:00:59.280> disk<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.329> past<00:01:00.570> this

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
come with a set-up disk in the past this

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.180 
come with a set-up disk in the past this
would<00:01:00.960> put<00:01:01.109> printer<00:01:01.440> drivers<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.949> little

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
would put printer drivers in a little

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.830 
would put printer drivers in a little
bit<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.370> software<00:01:02.730> onto<00:01:03.149> your<00:01:03.180> computer<00:01:03.300> for

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
bit of software onto your computer for

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.719 
bit of software onto your computer for
connecting<00:01:04.199> directly<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> printer<00:01:05.100> now

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
connecting directly to the printer now

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.580 
connecting directly to the printer now
this<00:01:06.000> setup<00:01:06.210> process<00:01:06.479> also<00:01:06.869> includes<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.409> bit

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
this setup process also includes a bit

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.620 
this setup process also includes a bit
to<00:01:07.770> connect<00:01:08.070> over<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.430> network<00:01:08.760> now<00:01:09.390> many<00:01:09.540> of

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
to connect over the network now many of

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.850 
to connect over the network now many of
these<00:01:09.720> setup<00:01:10.049> discs<00:01:10.320> are<00:01:10.409> good<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.680> both

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
these setup discs are good for both

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.350 
these setup discs are good for both
Windows<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.280> Mac<00:01:11.460> machines<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.150> in<00:01:12.210> some

Windows and Mac machines but in some

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.969 
Windows and Mac machines but in some
cases<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.810> may<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.200> go<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.530> site<00:01:13.740> for

cases you may have to go to the site for

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.679 
cases you may have to go to the site for
your<00:01:14.130> printer<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.610> download<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> driver<00:01:15.299> from

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
your printer and download a driver from

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.359 
your printer and download a driver from
there<00:01:15.900> running<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.560> setup<00:01:16.770> program<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
disk that you get with these wireless

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.120 
disk that you get with these wireless
printers<00:01:18.840> will<00:01:19.080> automatically<00:01:19.680> install<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
printers will automatically install the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.890 
printers will automatically install the
drivers<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.790> printer<00:01:21.180> but<00:01:21.600> they'll<00:01:21.720> also

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
drivers for the printer but they'll also

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.570 
drivers for the printer but they'll also
look<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> printer<00:01:22.979> over<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.280> network

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
look for the printer over the network

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.820 
look for the printer over the network
and<00:01:23.790> set<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.240> from<00:01:24.450> there<00:01:24.830> alternatively
