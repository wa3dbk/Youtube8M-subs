00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.560
 thank you very much for your time the 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.450
 lathe 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.310
 it's a little weird for america the two 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.500
 defeats to the thread receive seven goals 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.270
 but after a moment to another 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.520
 begin to link victories start at 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.440
 hanging the zero in the goal was a 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:21.349
 very fast change very what do you attribute to 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.349
 this to the adaptation we had of 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.079
 the way nacho wants us 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.860
 let's try on the court I think it has given 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:30.500
 priority to order 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.620
 that has helped us a lot because we 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.380
 we have compacted in a cross way 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.940
 results in the field of the game both 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.700
 when we attack like when we defend 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.910
 the team stays very close together 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.760
 united and that has allowed us to be 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.190
 and have control of the ball can 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.710
 recover soon and in certain 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.100
 moment 70 get into our last 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.469
 zone then defend well then 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.010
 and I think that it has been this adaptation to 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.539
 this system this or this order that both 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.250
 He already asked us to which we have given 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.080
 priority what helps us a lot what 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.080
 important is the result always the 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.659
 wins does not matter if it's 3 0 3 1 2 0 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.190
 but if together they have circumstantially 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.860
 could hang the zero and in five 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.659
 matches but obsesses if you 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.039
 like is the way to continue to maintain 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.039
 to be here is today we're going for good 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:24.280
 way I think it's not that it's a 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.280
 obsession 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.890
 the zero back certainly help 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:33.380
 quite then while we have the 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.390
 possibility to continue on the right path 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.579
 and give confidence to colleagues 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.100
 front of knowing that with only one goal 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:43.039
 we can get a victory because it is 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.170
 very important I do not think it's too much 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.319
 greater pressure for our 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.719
 Forwards know that if they write us two 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.159
 goals have to put three or if they tie us 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.649
 three must commit four to be able 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.149
 win the game and in this way with a 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.799
 just so much 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.629
 we would have possibilities to get the 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.099
 triumph is always going to be good is a lot 

00:01:59.629 --> 00:02:02.929
 of what happened the previous tournament not to 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:04.969
 Sometimes the defense is very careless in 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.399
 certain parties several occasions of 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.410
 america got 23 goals and now you see 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.849
 a little more solid in the defense this is 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.709
 attributed to the difference between 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.290
 tactical unemployed of what it was with kills 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.079
 towards what is hungry that and above all 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.280
 also the same discipline that we have 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:24.100
 maintained in this tournament we do not know 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.990
 the order in the field is very important 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.930
 never rush to the front to try 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.810
 of getting a result is going to be the 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.170
 best option always have the patience 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.850
 enough to be able to understand when 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.319
 we can attack to be able to understand 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.270
 when we have to defend when 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.280
 we have to stay together when 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.980
 we have to go out and press if it is 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.920
 necessary when we have to unfold 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.410
 to the front all these ideas and all 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.340
 these concepts I think we have 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.340
 understood in a good way 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.370
 and because of that, we can or have 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.870
 had the opportunity to handle the 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.370
 rhythm of the matches we've had 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.830
 the opportunity to have access to the arch 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.390
 opposite and this if you add the order 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.400
 that we have maintained we can has given the 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.530
 foundation of success today on a personal level 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.150
 of the current players template 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.830
 that more time have the team three 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.800
 years three and a half years since you 're 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.140
 here in coapa you have already won two leagues the 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.830
 atomic nation champions that you lack in 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.870
 america to you more titles I think that 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.599
 hunger for triumph can never 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.519
 faint I am very happy here 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.739
 I have manifested it all the time I have not 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.379
 come to the team that I always wanted 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.640
 from small then defend this 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:43.050
 T-shirt for me is the best 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.480
 the lake proudly next to 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.490
 with all the desire to part of the 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.660
 professionalism that I must show and that 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.090
 has shown in my previous teams 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.360
 Well now I add that pride and that and 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.590
 that love for the shirt that I have 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.770
 because it 's the team that I'm going to 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.510
 since boy then 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.250
 I would like to get more titles here 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.430
 obviously we are playing the league 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.330
 we are playing another concacaf tournament 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.980
 and in December a tournament is coming 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.290
 very important to us that is the 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.080
 world club will be the first time 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.510
 let me play this tournament if God 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.850
 wants and allows me to continue here and 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.730
 be in this club to enjoy it 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.400
 for me it will be spectacular and power 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.620
 and will win this tournament really not 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.750
 no no I do not intend to go to 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.640
 participate and I think that we have already 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.490
 talked with my colleagues and it's something 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.080
 that right now we are working 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.670
 mentally to know that this 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.440
 tournament we are not going to participate or 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.650
 let's go let's go with the intention of 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.610
 to win the rival that they put us in front 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.830
 so 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.199
 have the opportunity to be able to get 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.699
 something important in this tournament without a doubt 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.800
 some is also an objective that 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.840
 now I can trace it in the long term not 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.849
 because it is until the end of the year it seduces 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.680
 much that tournament if they are of course 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:03.090
 if it is a very important tournament it is the most 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.889
 important at the club level in the world 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.539
 I say is the champions league 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.449
 that is played in europe but this is from 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:11.979
 all of the world not only 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.280
 Europe then having the opportunity 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.300
 to transcend in this tournament pge is 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.250
 very important for the institution and 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.020
 for us as players today you 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.310
 I was commenting a couple of weeks ago about 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.110
 the performance of the renewal of 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:27.279
 contract you feel calm in that 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.659
 respect and you see go with another shirt 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:31.090
 that is not the one of the america to these 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:33.279
 heights definitely not me 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.439
 I would love to be able to retire here and 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:37.990
 retire in many years 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:40.020
 I really believe that I still have quality 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.159
 of experience ability to be able 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.060
 defend this shirt for several 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:45.650
 years more 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.750
 and I really do not see myself with another shirt 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.210
 I'm telling you honestly, no, no, 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.510
 like to finish a cycle here and 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:56.150
 continue somewhere else I want 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:59.300
 think that the day that I touch me 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:02.310
 leaving America is going to be because 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.990
 will be my definitive retreat then 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:08.540
 and I want to continue playing many more years 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:11.790
 here now practically 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.610
 I just need to sign my contract now 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:17.070
 I have reached an agreement to continue 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.470
 here then I'm even more 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.150
 quiet today I thank you very much for 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.470
 true your time that there is much success in 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.610
 the tournaments to dispute and in what 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.610
 personal thank you very much
