00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
then there we go okay so as you can see

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.690 
then there we go okay so as you can see
there's<00:01:58.660> a<00:01:58.750> little<00:01:59.170> bit<00:01:59.410> of<00:01:59.560> a<00:01:59.710> you<00:02:00.250> can<00:02:00.280> see

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
there's a little bit of a you can see

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.570 
there's a little bit of a you can see
the<00:02:00.730> difference<00:02:01.300> there<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.290> that's<00:02:03.100> kind<00:02:03.310> of

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
the difference there and that's kind of

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.810 
the difference there and that's kind of
annoying<00:02:03.850> so<00:02:04.630> you<00:02:04.800> path<00:02:05.800> won't<00:02:06.070> be<00:02:06.250> extended

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
annoying so you path won't be extended

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.270 
annoying so you path won't be extended
or<00:02:06.940> it<00:02:07.060> won't<00:02:07.150> be<00:02:07.420> by<00:02:07.750> default<00:02:07.810> at<00:02:08.350> least<00:02:08.560> but

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
or it won't be by default at least but

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.670 
or it won't be by default at least but
extend<00:02:09.820> that<00:02:10.030> go<00:02:10.210> to<00:02:10.270> fiber<00:02:10.570> type<00:02:10.899> click<00:02:11.530> it

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
extend that go to fiber type click it

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.280 
extend that go to fiber type click it
make<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.100> both<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.670> make<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.720> feather<00:02:13.960> type

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
make it both and make the feather type

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.150 
make it both and make the feather type
let's<00:02:14.680> say<00:02:14.890> 20<00:02:15.780> there<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.050> that<00:02:17.560> makes<00:02:18.010> it

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
let's say 20 there and that makes it

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.500 
let's say 20 there and that makes it
blur<00:02:18.430> together<00:02:18.760> really<00:02:19.030> well

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
blur together really well

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.000 
blur together really well
this<00:02:20.080> looks<00:02:20.350> pretty<00:02:20.590> good<00:02:20.950> it's<00:02:21.730> just<00:02:22.800> but<00:02:23.800> you

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
this looks pretty good it's just but you

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.270 
this looks pretty good it's just but you
can<00:02:24.160> see<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.490> how<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.209> clip<00:02:25.540> changes<00:02:26.110> so<00:02:26.860> what

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
can see the how the clip changes so what

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.250 
can see the how the clip changes so what
I'm<00:02:27.370> going<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.580> do<00:02:27.760> is<00:02:27.970> I'm<00:02:28.300> going<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.600> fix<00:02:29.140> that

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
I'm going to do is I'm going to fix that

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.410 
I'm going to do is I'm going to fix that
drag<00:02:30.100> this<00:02:30.250> clip<00:02:30.490> back<00:02:30.790> and<00:02:31.120> make<00:02:32.020> it<00:02:32.140> fade<00:02:32.560> I

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
drag this clip back and make it fade I

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.420 
drag this clip back and make it fade I
really<00:02:34.420> wish<00:02:34.630> Premiere<00:02:35.140> Pro<00:02:35.170> had<00:02:35.709> that<00:02:35.920> fading

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
really wish Premiere Pro had that fading

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.310 
really wish Premiere Pro had that fading
thing<00:02:36.700> that<00:02:37.000> would<00:02:37.150> be<00:02:37.300> so<00:02:37.600> useful<00:02:37.840> if<00:02:38.230> you

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
thing that would be so useful if you

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.740 
thing that would be so useful if you
could<00:02:38.500> just<00:02:38.650> drag<00:02:39.160> this<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.580> fade<00:02:39.820> anyway<00:02:40.360> just

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
could just drag this to fade anyway just

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.780 
could just drag this to fade anyway just
fade<00:02:41.200> this<00:02:41.440> out<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:43.740> then<00:02:44.740> he<00:02:44.860> just<00:02:45.040> comes<00:02:45.580> in

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
fade this out and then he just comes in

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.310 
fade this out and then he just comes in
it<00:02:46.060> just<00:02:46.330> blends<00:02:46.660> in<00:02:46.870> you<00:02:46.990> don't<00:02:47.110> really

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
it just blends in you don't really

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.030 
it just blends in you don't really
notice<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.800> that<00:02:48.010> well

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
notice it that well

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.590 
notice it that well
well<00:02:51.040> okay<00:02:51.400> you<00:02:51.459> notice<00:02:51.850> it<00:02:52.060> but<00:02:52.269> not<00:02:52.450> that

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
well okay you notice it but not that

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.490 
well okay you notice it but not that
much<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.440> looks<00:02:53.650> pretty<00:02:54.310> good<00:02:54.489> anyway<00:02:54.760> and

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
much and it looks pretty good anyway and

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.080 
much and it looks pretty good anyway and
the<00:02:56.500> best<00:02:56.709> thing<00:02:56.950> for<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.190> cloning<00:02:57.550> effect<00:02:57.880> is

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
the best thing for a cloning effect is

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.990 
the best thing for a cloning effect is
to<00:02:58.420> just<00:02:58.660> make<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:59.080> so<00:02:59.489> so<00:03:00.489> that<00:03:00.700> there<00:03:00.850> aren't

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
to just make it so so that there aren't

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.180 
to just make it so so that there aren't
any<00:03:01.209> problems<00:03:01.450> like<00:03:01.870> this<00:03:02.080> see<00:03:02.350> this<00:03:02.500> couch<00:03:02.800> is

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
any problems like this see this couch is

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.020 
any problems like this see this couch is
a<00:03:03.700> cushion<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.480> when<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:04.989> sit<00:03:05.230> on<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.380> cushion

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
a cushion and when you sit on a cushion

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.979 
a cushion and when you sit on a cushion
you<00:03:07.030> push<00:03:07.540> it<00:03:07.720> down<00:03:07.750> I<00:03:08.350> guess<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:09.489> could<00:03:09.640> say

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
you push it down I guess you could say

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.890 
you push it down I guess you could say
and<00:03:11.280> when<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.400> do<00:03:12.519> that<00:03:12.580> it<00:03:13.030> makes<00:03:13.660> an

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
and when you do that it makes an

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.550 
and when you do that it makes an
indention

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
indention

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.190 
indention
like<00:03:14.920> here<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.610> then<00:03:16.480> you<00:03:16.720> can<00:03:16.900> see<00:03:17.049> the

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
like here and then you can see the

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.080 
like here and then you can see the
difference<00:03:17.590> I<00:03:17.830> don't<00:03:18.519> know<00:03:18.610> why<00:03:18.790> I'm<00:03:18.880> talking

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
difference I don't know why I'm talking

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.449 
difference I don't know why I'm talking
about<00:03:19.299> this<00:03:19.630> this<00:03:19.810> is<00:03:19.989> kind<00:03:20.290> of<00:03:20.350> creepy<00:03:20.590> anyway

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
about this this is kind of creepy anyway

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.250 
about this this is kind of creepy anyway
that's<00:03:21.880> how<00:03:22.030> you<00:03:22.150> do<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.390> cloning<00:03:22.810> effect<00:03:23.110> in

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
that's how you do a cloning effect in

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.350 
that's how you do a cloning effect in
Sony<00:03:23.500> Vegas<00:03:23.739> also<00:03:24.280> by<00:03:24.549> the<00:03:24.610> way<00:03:24.760> for<00:03:25.120> color

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
Sony Vegas also by the way for color

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.020 
Sony Vegas also by the way for color
correction<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:26.320> can<00:03:26.470> just<00:03:26.650> drag<00:03:26.920> a<00:03:27.250> color<00:03:27.549> you

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
correction you can just drag a color you

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.449 
correction you can just drag a color you
can<00:03:28.060> color<00:03:28.510> correct<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.110> clip<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:30.160> make<00:03:30.280> it

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
can color correct the clip to make it

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.979 
can color correct the clip to make it
match<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.670> other<00:03:31.120> one<00:03:31.330> if<00:03:31.450> they're<00:03:31.660> different

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
match the other one if they're different

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.830 
match the other one if they're different
in<00:03:32.290> some<00:03:32.590> other<00:03:32.799> way<00:03:33.010> so<00:03:33.330> but<00:03:34.330> that's<00:03:34.540> pretty

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
in some other way so but that's pretty

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.560 
in some other way so but that's pretty
much<00:03:34.959> it<00:03:35.110> you<00:03:35.320> can<00:03:35.620> do<00:03:35.739> this<00:03:35.860> for<00:03:36.250> anything<00:03:37.090> and

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
much it you can do this for anything and

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.990 
much it you can do this for anything and
it's<00:03:38.380> a<00:03:38.530> lot<00:03:38.680> easier<00:03:39.100> if<00:03:39.220> you<00:03:39.340> use<00:03:39.549> a<00:03:39.580> green

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
it's a lot easier if you use a green

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.690 
it's a lot easier if you use a green
screen<00:03:40.390> by<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.660> way<00:03:40.810> but

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
screen by the way but

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.360 
screen by the way but
I'm<00:03:42.450> rambling<00:03:43.110> on<00:03:43.230> too<00:03:43.440> long<00:03:43.620> here<00:03:43.860> okay
