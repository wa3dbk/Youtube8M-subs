00:00:01.808 --> 00:00:03.527
 The main one 

00:00:03.527 --> 00:00:05.814
 the underlying purpose of stroke treatment is 

00:00:05.814 --> 00:00:08.333
 to save as much brain tissue as possible. 

00:00:09.912 --> 00:00:12.548
 Because the idea is that by saving yourself as much as possible 

00:00:12.548 --> 00:00:15.925
 maybe more brain tissue will be lost only minimal 

00:00:15.925 --> 00:00:18.387
 body function, 

00:00:18.387 --> 00:00:22.892
 movement, vision, sensitivity, even taste. 

00:00:22.892 --> 00:00:25.993
 You may remember that at any ischemic stroke 

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:28.548
 has a core core of neurons right in place 

00:00:28.548 --> 00:00:30.140
 obstruction of the blood vessel, 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.007
 so there is brain tissue that usually 

00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:35.206
 will be irretrievably damaged for a few minutes 

00:00:35.206 --> 00:00:36.738
 after loss of blood supply. 

00:00:36.738 --> 00:00:40.847
 This is not good, but good news is that 

00:00:40.847 --> 00:00:43.042
 there is salvage of surrounding brain tissue 

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:45.747
 this nucleus, called penumba. 

00:00:45.747 --> 00:00:47.698
 This is an area where blood circulation 

00:00:47.698 --> 00:00:51.019
 has decreased due to the blockade here, 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.531
 but still receives oxygen 

00:00:53.531 --> 00:00:55.724
 peripherally from these blood vessels in the areas 

00:00:55.724 --> 00:00:58.707
 around, so the neurons in the half-moon do not die 

00:00:58.707 --> 00:01:01.668
 immediately and if the man gets fast enough 

00:01:01.668 --> 00:01:04.803
 treatment, then the neurons in the half-moon do not die 

00:01:04.803 --> 00:01:08.123
 in most cases, half-life is rescue. 

00:01:08.123 --> 00:01:11.467
 Therefore, when someone comes with a stroke, 

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:13.544
 the treating team often thinks 

00:01:15.123 --> 00:01:16.969
 to try, if possible, to save the kernel 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:18.849
 and definitely save that half-moon before 

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:20.429
 it's too late. 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:23.111
 What can be treatment 

00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:25.165
 after a stroke? 

00:01:25.165 --> 00:01:26.884
 This depends on the species 

00:01:26.884 --> 00:01:29.821
 of stroke, ischemic or haemorrhagic. 

00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:31.945
 An ischemic stroke is usually given 

00:01:31.945 --> 00:01:34.371
 aspirin to prevent the formation of new clots, 

00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:36.311
 and thrombolytics to try to break down 

00:01:36.311 --> 00:01:38.203
 existing clot. 

00:01:38.203 --> 00:01:40.224
 The haemorrhagic is mostly masked 

00:01:40.224 --> 00:01:42.325
 Symptoms and Potential Complications in 

00:01:42.325 --> 00:01:45.087
 the initial phases of the stroke. 

00:01:45.087 --> 00:01:47.422
 Sometimes with antihypertensive to reduce it 

00:01:47.422 --> 00:01:50.589
 blood pressure and, therefore, the rate of 

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:52.681
 bleeding in the brain, 

00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:54.781
 and sometimes with an anticonvulsant to prevent them 

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:57.882
 possible seizures, and sometimes with medications 

00:01:57.882 --> 00:01:59.901
 to reduce the swelling of the brain. 

00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:02.060
 There are several different possible medications for these 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.886
 two types of stroke, but what else can be done? 

00:02:04.886 --> 00:02:07.314
 I mean, we've all seen McDreamy, the neurosurgeon, 

00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:09.832
 how she rushes into the operating year with her hair 

00:02:09.832 --> 00:02:12.467
 and with your sweet-hearted "Awesome Day to Save Life," 

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:14.209
 what does he aim for? 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.346
 By the way, he is the neurosurgeon of 

00:02:16.346 --> 00:02:20.211
 the fascinating drama Gray's Anatomy. 

00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:22.405
 In an ischemic stroke, surgeons will usually not be 

00:02:22.405 --> 00:02:25.273
 called in surgery, unless the patient 

00:02:25.273 --> 00:02:27.932
 is not affected by thrombolytics. 

00:02:27.932 --> 00:02:29.928
 Usually he first tries with thrombolytics, 

00:02:29.928 --> 00:02:32.586
 if the patient is still in the several-hour window, 

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:34.525
 through which they work best. 

00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:36.569
 But if surgeons treat a patient 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.728
 with an ischemic stroke they can do 

00:02:38.728 --> 00:02:41.720
 several different but identical procedures 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.575
 with the ultimate goal of removing the clot, 

00:02:44.575 --> 00:02:46.444
 who causes a stroke. 

00:02:46.444 --> 00:02:48.337
 A small device you can use, 

00:02:48.337 --> 00:02:50.798
 is called "Merci Retriever" as it was 

00:02:50.798 --> 00:02:52.780
 the first device that has been 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.916
 approved for the removal of a clot after an ischemic stroke. 

00:02:55.916 --> 00:02:58.121
 Let's see what MERCI means, 

00:02:58.121 --> 00:02:59.619
 to understand how it works. 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:01.521
 MERCI is an acronym. 

00:03:01.521 --> 00:03:04.240
 Means Mechanical Embolus Removal in Cerebral Ischemia 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.791
 (mechanical removal of emboli in cerebral ischemia). 

00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:09.056
 How it works? 

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:11.332
 Let's look at the general idea, 

00:03:11.332 --> 00:03:13.271
 instead of dealing with everyone 

00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:15.941
 technical details. 

00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:17.741
 What is happening is that 

00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:19.911
 as part of this procedure, the surgeon will insert 

00:03:19.911 --> 00:03:22.981
 a small wire in an artery and push it 

00:03:22.981 --> 00:03:26.062
 up to the brain, it will take her through the arteries 

00:03:26.062 --> 00:03:28.107
 and it will bring her to the brain here. 

00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:31.448
 Then the wire is pushed right past the clot 

00:03:31.448 --> 00:03:33.041
 and, this blue thing here is actually 

00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:35.522
 is a small capsule, the wire is actually in 

00:03:35.522 --> 00:03:38.250
 the capsule and then when the capsule is 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.105
 pulled back, the wire starts to 

00:03:42.105 --> 00:03:44.148
 is winding. 

00:03:44.148 --> 00:03:47.108
 Then, while the wire is slowly pulled back, 

00:03:47.108 --> 00:03:49.105
 she will get caught 

00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:52.007
 tight for the clot. 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.269
 Then wire and clot 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.544
 the blood has now been removed 

00:03:58.544 --> 00:04:01.029
 can re-supply this area and try to save 

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:03.060
 brain tissue here. 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.692
 It's MERCI Retriever. 

00:04:06.544 --> 00:04:09.060
 Another way is ischemic strokes to be 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.056
 surgically treated, has a suction (suction). 

00:04:11.056 --> 00:04:12.241
 How does this work? 

00:04:12.241 --> 00:04:14.098
 Here again is the same principle of work. 

00:04:14.098 --> 00:04:17.019
 A tube enters her artery 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.072
 a small wire is pierced through the tube by positioning it 

00:04:20.072 --> 00:04:22.592
 just behind the clot. 

00:04:22.592 --> 00:04:24.762
 Then this kind of tube turns into a small vacuum, 

00:04:24.762 --> 00:04:27.339
 which begins to suck, and until 

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:30.601
 suction, the wire is moved several times 

00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:33.412
 backward through the clot to break it. 

00:04:33.412 --> 00:04:35.542
 All the small pieces that break and, 

00:04:35.542 --> 00:04:37.201
 possibly, the whole clot 

00:04:37.201 --> 00:04:39.326
 are sucked into this little vacuum. 

00:04:39.326 --> 00:04:41.521
 This is the suction method. 

00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:43.343
 There are several other minor variations 

00:04:43.343 --> 00:04:45.223
 of these two procedures to remove clots, 

00:04:45.223 --> 00:04:47.616
 some use small mesh tubes, 

00:04:47.616 --> 00:04:49.705
 called 'stents' and others with different 

00:04:49.705 --> 00:04:51.981
 mechanisms, but so far I will stop here. 

00:04:53.583 --> 00:04:55.195
 The two things we talked about now, 

00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:57.354
 are treatments for ischemic stroke, 

00:04:57.354 --> 00:04:59.617
 but if the surgeon heals hemorrhagic 

00:04:59.617 --> 00:05:01.592
 stroke in which one of the main goals is to be 

00:05:01.592 --> 00:05:03.890
 controls bleeding he can do 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.050
 other different procedures. 

00:05:07.257 --> 00:05:10.242
 There is one called "snapping the aneurysm". 

00:05:10.242 --> 00:05:12.622
 We know if 

00:05:12.622 --> 00:05:16.105
 aneurysm in the brain ruptures, 

00:05:16.105 --> 00:05:18.601
 then begins to pour blood in 

00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:21.247
 brain space. 

00:05:21.247 --> 00:05:23.488
 One way to do this is the surgeon 

00:05:23.488 --> 00:05:26.146
 to put a clip that looks like this 

00:05:26.146 --> 00:05:29.223
 something here, it's a metal clip that then 

00:05:29.223 --> 00:05:32.381
 is at the base of the aneurysm. 

00:05:32.381 --> 00:05:34.865
 Now this clip stops the blood from passing 

00:05:34.865 --> 00:05:37.222
 hence pouring, so now the blood can 

00:05:37.222 --> 00:05:39.939
 just keep on going. 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:42.096
 These clips are one way to treat 

00:05:42.096 --> 00:05:44.732
 haemorrhagic stroke. 

00:05:44.732 --> 00:05:46.891
 In another procedure, the neurosurgeon may, 

00:05:46.891 --> 00:05:49.375
 again, this is in hemorrhage, 

00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:52.197
 caused by a cracked aneurysm, 

00:05:52.197 --> 00:05:55.041
 to do "Coil Embolization". 

00:06:00.253 --> 00:06:02.274
 The surgeon will put a small tube in 

00:06:02.274 --> 00:06:05.073
 arterial system 

00:06:05.073 --> 00:06:07.695
 and will direct it to the cerebral 

00:06:07.695 --> 00:06:10.835
 arteries while it is right in 

00:06:10.835 --> 00:06:15.015
 aneurysm, just at the base of the aneurysm. 

00:06:15.015 --> 00:06:19.019
 Then this flexible wire is made 

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:21.921
 pierced through the tube and begins 

00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:25.137
 to wind up in the swollen part of 

00:06:25.137 --> 00:06:27.077
 the artery, in the aneurysm. 

00:06:27.077 --> 00:06:29.943
 The wire is still being pushed 

00:06:29.943 --> 00:06:31.976
 in the aneurysm through the tube 

00:06:31.976 --> 00:06:34.738
 is winding and winding and winding. 

00:06:34.738 --> 00:06:37.478
 Eventually the blood will no longer be able to enter 

00:06:37.478 --> 00:06:40.079
 aneurysm, even if he wants. 

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:41.414
 Two things. 

00:06:41.414 --> 00:06:43.921
 First, the blood can already begin to clot. 

00:06:43.921 --> 00:06:46.104
 It can begin to cling to this material 

00:06:46.104 --> 00:06:48.437
 in the aneurysm and prevent anything 

00:06:48.437 --> 00:06:51.293
 is bleeding. 

00:06:51.293 --> 00:06:54.335
 Two, the blood in this artery no longer exists 

00:06:54.335 --> 00:06:56.517
 the ability to enter this 

00:06:56.517 --> 00:06:58.920
 aneurysm and cause problems, 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.173
 because of this cluttered coil. 

00:07:01.173 --> 00:07:03.913
 Now the blood just goes on 

00:07:03.913 --> 00:07:06.141
 runs its way. 

00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:06.640
 So I raise two thumbs. 

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.200
 These are some of the surgical interventions 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.940
 for the treatment of ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke.
