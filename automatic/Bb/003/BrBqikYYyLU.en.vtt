through I think he couldn't help himself
he<00:02:35.680> just<00:02:35.770> a<00:02:36.150> feel<00:02:37.150> but<00:02:37.540> real<00:02:37.900> hard<00:02:38.110> time<00:02:38.320> for

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
he just a feel but real hard time for

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.620 
he just a feel but real hard time for
that<00:02:38.680> I<00:02:38.920> think<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:39.520> said<00:02:39.730> in<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:39.910> last<00:02:40.090> DVD<00:02:40.300> that

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
that I think I said in the last DVD that

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.390 
that I think I said in the last DVD that
I<00:02:40.690> can't<00:02:40.990> act<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.320> save<00:02:41.470> my<00:02:41.620> life<00:02:41.770> and<00:02:42.010> I<00:02:42.100> think

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
I can't act to save my life and I think

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.370 
I can't act to save my life and I think
I've<00:02:42.610> shown<00:02:42.640> yet<00:02:43.240> again<00:02:43.570> in<00:02:43.900> my<00:02:44.050> Gollum
