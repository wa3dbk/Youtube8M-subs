00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
side here really in to undo the EGR

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.980 
side here really in to undo the EGR
little<00:01:19.590> tune<00:01:19.740> here<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.330> this<00:01:21.330> bracket<00:01:21.810> that

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
little tune here and this bracket that

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.840 
little tune here and this bracket that
held<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.259> intake<00:01:22.530> manifold<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:22.979> place<00:01:23.159> and

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
held the intake manifold in place and

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.330 
held the intake manifold in place and
then<00:01:24.150> all<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:24.479> do<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.439> think<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.189> got

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
then all we do is we I think I got

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.590 
then all we do is we I think I got
everything<00:01:26.400> else<00:01:26.580> entered<00:01:26.909> these<00:01:27.000> bolts<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.420> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
everything else entered these bolts to a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.109 
everything else entered these bolts to a
couple<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.170> vacuums<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.710> couple<00:01:28.740> vacuums<00:01:29.520> here

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
couple of vacuums a couple vacuums here

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.929 
couple of vacuums a couple vacuums here
that's<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.540> maybe<00:01:31.439> one<00:01:31.650> here<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> big<00:01:32.100> guy<00:01:32.250> and

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
that's it maybe one here the big guy and

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:33.890 
that's it maybe one here the big guy and
then<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.210> just<00:01:33.329> flip<00:01:33.479> her<00:01:33.600> out<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.810> way

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
then we just flip her out of the way

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.140 
then we just flip her out of the way
like<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.829> short<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.520> battery<00:01:35.790> pop

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
like that and short to the battery pop

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.310 
like that and short to the battery pop
positive<00:01:36.540> that's<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.780> really<00:01:36.990> good<00:01:37.079> thing<00:01:37.200> to

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
positive that's a really good thing to

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.249 
positive that's a really good thing to
do<00:01:37.409> they<00:01:37.939> and<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.210> sparks<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.750> go<00:01:39.900> especially

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
do they and the sparks to go especially

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.899 
do they and the sparks to go especially
with<00:01:40.530> all<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.799> gas<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.490> now<00:01:41.610> we<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.790> get<00:01:41.850> to

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
with all this gas so now we can get to

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.870 
with all this gas so now we can get to
our<00:01:42.000> valve<00:01:42.270> cover<00:01:42.450> gaskets<00:01:42.899> here<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.140> here

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
our valve cover gaskets here and here

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.370 
our valve cover gaskets here and here
like<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:46.549> that's<00:01:47.549> all<00:01:48.380> hollandaise

really<00:01:54.030> good<00:01:54.210> job<00:01:54.270> cleaning<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.780> kick<00:01:55.700> that

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
really good job cleaning it kick that

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.730 
really good job cleaning it kick that
brake<00:01:56.909> clean<00:01:57.090> away<00:01:57.210> all<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.509> other<00:01:57.719> junk<00:01:57.899> so

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
brake clean away all the other junk so

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.499 
brake clean away all the other junk so
we<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.159> probably<00:01:59.399> flip<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.030> back<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.360> but

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
we can probably flip that back on but

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.399 
we can probably flip that back on but
we're<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.750> take<00:02:00.869> care<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.200> valve

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
we're going to take care of this valve

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.310 
we're going to take care of this valve
cover<00:02:01.590> all<00:02:01.740> we<00:02:01.829> got<00:02:01.950> everything

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
cover all we got everything

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.350 
cover all we got everything
the<00:02:02.380> way<00:02:02.470> and<00:02:03.460> also<00:02:03.610> take<00:02:03.850> time<00:02:04.000> to<00:02:04.120> clean<00:02:04.270> the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
the way and also take time to clean the

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.990 
the way and also take time to clean the
throttle<00:02:04.720> body<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:06.040> one's<00:02:06.220> pretty<00:02:06.340> clean<00:02:06.610> it

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
throttle body this one's pretty clean it

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.469 
throttle body this one's pretty clean it
was<00:02:07.150> actually<00:02:07.360> off<00:02:07.479> not<00:02:07.780> so<00:02:07.900> long<00:02:08.050> ago<00:02:08.460> but

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
was actually off not so long ago but

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.640 
was actually off not so long ago but
always<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.600> good<00:02:10.780> idea<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:11.080> clean<00:02:11.290> these<00:02:11.440> as

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
always a good idea to clean these as

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.100 
always a good idea to clean these as
well<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:13.120> would<00:02:13.240> give<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.480> more<00:02:13.600> harsh<00:02:13.870> power

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
well it would give you more harsh power

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.340 
well it would give you more harsh power
let's<00:02:14.980> see<00:02:15.160> this<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.400> clean<00:02:15.580> side<00:02:16.110> anyway

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
let's see this the clean side anyway

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.930 
let's see this the clean side anyway
so<00:02:18.070> we're<00:02:18.160> going<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.310> take<00:02:18.490> that<00:02:18.640> other<00:02:18.700> valve

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
so we're going to take that other valve

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.750 
so we're going to take that other valve
cover<00:02:19.120> off<00:02:19.180> now<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:20.190> put<00:02:21.190> all<00:02:21.310> these<00:02:21.370> bits<00:02:21.580> and

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
cover off now and put all these bits and

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.370 
cover off now and put all these bits and
pieces<00:02:21.880> back<00:02:22.150> on<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.570> couple<00:02:22.990> things<00:02:23.140> left<00:02:23.290> to

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
pieces back on a couple things left to

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
pull back together here but although

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.370 
pull back together here but although
