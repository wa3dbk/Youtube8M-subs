00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.580
 a combo of actions that allowed him 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.780
 to the hospital to have a little better 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.290

 help for the baby to continue receiving 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.340
 milk when they can not can not 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.890
 breastfeed because they are premature because 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.100
 they have some pathology that they do not 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.230
