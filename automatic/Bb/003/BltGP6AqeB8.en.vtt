00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:26.920 
into the trees I think I'll use some of

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.970 
into the trees I think I'll use some of
the<00:06:27.010> darker<00:06:27.580> this<00:06:28.150> one<00:06:28.390> here<00:06:28.690> kind<00:06:29.020> of<00:06:29.140> dark<00:06:29.830> in

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:53.810 
some kind of like Browns that kind of

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.629 
some kind of like Browns that kind of
all<00:07:53.960> start<00:07:54.229> looking<00:07:54.560> the<00:07:54.770> same<00:07:54.979> I<00:07:55.280> thought

00:07:55.629 --> 00:07:55.639 
all start looking the same I thought

00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:58.029 
all start looking the same I thought
maybe<00:07:55.699> if<00:07:56.599> I<00:07:56.750> used<00:07:56.960> it<00:07:57.139> more<00:07:57.349> I<00:07:57.409> would<00:07:57.590> like<00:07:57.860> it

00:07:58.029 --> 00:07:58.039 
maybe if I used it more I would like it

00:07:58.039 --> 00:07:59.320 
maybe if I used it more I would like it
more<00:07:58.099> but<00:07:58.370> that<00:07:58.400> hasn't<00:07:58.760> happened<00:07:58.940> yet

00:07:59.320 --> 00:07:59.330 
more but that hasn't happened yet

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.600 
more but that hasn't happened yet
overall<00:08:00.169> I<00:08:00.470> would<00:08:00.560> have<00:08:00.860> to<00:08:01.010> say<00:08:01.039> that<00:08:01.460> this

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:01.610 
overall I would have to say that this

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.880 
overall I would have to say that this
has<00:08:01.849> been
