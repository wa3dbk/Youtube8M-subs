00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.480
 Hey guys 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.590
 back to the hot head but a video 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.450
 for you 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.060
 I was a little away there to 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.090
 solve some particular problems 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.350
 but I'm back all week now 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.680
 new videos 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:30.210
 Let's go back to what was once 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.940
 today I came to speak again our fox friend 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.340
 scania plus an application here that 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.700
 People are going to use this car today. 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.950
 to detect failures in the operation 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.129
 electronics 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:50.070
 we are here on board a fox 2012 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:53.989
 when there are people here from him to 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.270
 Injection light here is still on 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:01.649
 means that you have a problem on the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.860
 of electronic injection, sir, without 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.650
 scanner gets hard is not impossible 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.650
 but it is difficult for us to locate the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.380
 because it has to be component 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.920
 per component using a scanner that 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.009
 they get right in the fault we test 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.700
 a component the whip or something 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.580
 related to the problem so here goes 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:30.200
 connect here I climbed and we go here 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.220
 check what is the fault that is 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.220
 stored in memory 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:40.229
 before turning on the skank the car is 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:44.939
 and the light is on. 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.700
 I'll show you there on the discharge there 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:54.230
 Typical motorbike symptom 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:58.270
 so you go to download 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.270
 you only get very good audio 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.650
 the location of the cable 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.599
 here below under the steering wheel 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.670
 next to the fuse box 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:28.890
 we are already here with our scania on 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:32.250
 the one in having a diagnosis here let's 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.840
 wait there he will communicate with the 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.290
 car central 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.290
 we see the errors stored 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:58.120
 more just a little longer'm tenure here 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:02.200
 also of the electric scheme here of fox 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.200
 while he communicate 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:21.850
 I have to go back here and I made a mistake. 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:37.530
 I could not find its place the key does not 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:37.530
 has three codes found 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:54.310
 within canons storage here 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:04:00.820
 yes here where 33 bodies found 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:16.290
 p 04 20 here is a catalyst system and 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:26.200
 efficiency of the catalyst system 12 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:32.100
 ammunition and 032 an ignition system 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:38.560
 it was also something about the 5 803 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:42.790
 ac3 follows are 21 something relative 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.280
 to the ignition system with the car in 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:49.110
 operation 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.110
 we go here and see the data 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.790
 there arise cattle 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:04.890
 we will see the parameters here that he me 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.410
 gives full data list data view 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.820
 I can also customize the data 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:13.260
 that I want to see 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:23.460
 There are some that do not interest me, let's go. 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:23.970
 here is tc 81 ° water temperature setting 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:30.720
 low back 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:32.730
 I hear the mapping rpm speed sensor 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:40.490
 stationary car 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:48.140
 the emission is atp temperature is if 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:48.140
 I want to see here shade probe bench with 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:58.260
 analyzing the pre-catalyst probe have to 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:02.670
 range from 0 1 to 1 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:09.120
 of lambuja né thousand volts already can see 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:11.340
 sing 002 003 meaning it's locked 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.540
 in poor 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:17.789
 I'm going to hurry here to see if 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:25.629
 go up 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:30.520
 I think it went up but it did not arrive or 

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:35.020
 the ideal value of 450 thousand volts is 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.860
 a mixing responding but is locked 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.430
 poor 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:44.789
 Let me come back here mec 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.789
 we will see here after catalyst 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.800
 only the second 

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:06.460
 varying continuously repeating the same 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:09.159
 thing that probe one is also formed 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:13.319
 for her then it 's no use checking 

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:17.650
 that data from its two takes on is 

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:19.900
 wrong reading and the injection is 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:23.169
 sending time wrong direction time 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:25.539
 so then we will return here is more 

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:30.280
 out of curiosity for those who do not know 

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:33.069
 scania here the most important are 

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:35.620
 this beauty 

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:40.419
 I have a table with me, anyone 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:41.580
 to give of table to leave I send by and 

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:43.659
 mail 

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:48.879
 people wanted to show a bad time here 

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:51.159
 You 're the fox scanner and what's good. 

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:54.069
 simple but that's pretty bough then 

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:56.590
 Now I have another north already has a 

00:07:54.069 --> 00:07:59.379
 way to where you're from 

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:01.449
 The diagnosis is already a lot, so I 

00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:06.789
 I'm going straight into the focus are the definition is 

00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:08.770
 there sail sail coil dali planet o 

00:08:06.789 --> 00:08:11.409
 river and forum catalyst system 

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:15.479
 beauty person liked and cut share 

00:08:11.409 --> 00:08:15.479
 one more video worth
