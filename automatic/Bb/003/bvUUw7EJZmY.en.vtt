00:00:04.825 --> 00:00:07.918
 There are many versions on the Internet, about the existence 

00:00:08.118 --> 00:00:11.211
 of an asteroid that will impact with the earth in 2015 

00:00:11.288 --> 00:00:14.267
 Information that is supposedly kept secret by the 

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:18.589
 Governments that have knowledge of the proximity of the object, with a collision course. 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:25.506
 Therefore, a series of contingency plans was put in place, in order to reduce the effects that the impact might cause. 

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:32.483
 The information of the existence of the asteroid is restricted to the public, with the purpose of avoiding the global economic collapse and a chaos in the society. 

00:00:32.583 --> 00:00:40.378
 According to recent publications, of supposed information provided by official sources, they confirm the existence of the celestial body and provide data about it. 

00:00:40.478 --> 00:00:47.371
 It would be a comet with an approximate size of 2.5 miles (4 km) with a speed of 20 km / sec. 

00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:53.179
 And it would be accompanied by other smaller bodies. 

00:00:53.279 --> 00:01:00.366
 According to calculations of its trajectory, the impact with the planet is expected, in the month of September 2015, between days 14 - 28. 

00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:07.222
 The location of the impact would be in the North Atlantic region, near the east coast of the United States. 

00:01:07.322 --> 00:01:15.343
 The impact of an asteroid or comet with this diameter will release about 40,000 megatons of energy, equivalent to more than two million atomic bombs like Hiroshima. 

00:01:15.443 --> 00:01:21.434
 The impact, would produce winds of more than 200 km / h and a warming of the point of impact in about 50,000 ° C. 

00:01:21.534 --> 00:01:28.201
 It would form a 2 km high tsunami, this huge wave would violently erode the coasts and flood the continental areas. 

00:01:28.301 --> 00:01:35.756
 The impact will cover the Earth's atmosphere with dust in a few days, causing what is called a nuclear winter, with a phenomenon of darkness between 3 and 6 months. 

00:01:35.856 --> 00:01:46.438
 Evidence supporting the theory of the possible collision in progress 

00:01:46.538 --> 00:01:51.210
 ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS FRENCH LAURENT FABIUS 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:58.203
 Declaration made on May 13, 2014 May 13, 2014 + 500 days = (24 - 25) September 2015 

00:01:58.303 --> 00:02:07.573
 The date marked by Fabius coincides with the one scheduled for the collision 

00:02:07.673 --> 00:02:12.032
 Mysterious closures of Walmart Stores 

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:18.525
 Walmart said closures were temporary because of plumbing problems in stores in California, Texas, Oklahoma and Florida 

00:02:18.625 --> 00:02:24.371
 The suspect of these closures is the time they indicate to last 6 months from April to September (month of possible impact) 

00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:29.202
 These closed stores would be part of a network of underground tunnels that run throughout the country 

00:02:29.302 --> 00:02:34.071
 Connected with "Deep underground bases" that will serve as conduits for national defense 

00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:39.810
 for the rapid movement of troops, supplies and weapons across the country between strategic topographic locations. 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.771
 "JADE HELM OPERATION" 

00:02:43.871 --> 00:02:52.794
 From July 15 to September 15, 2015, Green Berets of the Army, US Navy Seals, US Marines of Special Operations and of the United States Air Force Special Operations Command 

00:02:52.894 --> 00:03:01.481
 will participate in "Jade Helm 15", 8 weeks of night exercises in 7 states in the southwestern part of the United States 

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:08.756
 The area chosen to carry out these operations is outside the area of ​​direct influence of the possible impact 

00:03:08.856 --> 00:03:13.084
 The federal reserve of the United States foresees a natural disaster 

00:03:13.184 --> 00:03:20.956
 The Federal Reserve of the United States, fears that a natural disaster or other eventuality could close its operations in the market, reason why they are transferring their operations to the satellite office in Chicago 

00:03:21.056 --> 00:03:28.862
 Deployment of 700 miles (1127 km) to the west with personnel prepared in case of disaster. 

00:03:28.962 --> 00:03:32.947
 MOVEMENT OF MILITARY UNITS 

00:03:33.047 --> 00:03:39.748
 Mobilization of troops, to different points of the planet, occupying strategic positions.
