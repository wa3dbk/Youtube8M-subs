lash line and creamy so there's no

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.220 
lash line and creamy so there's no
tugging<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.010> it's<00:02:47.580> much<00:02:47.910> easier<00:02:48.120> at<00:02:48.720> least<00:02:48.959> me

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
tugging and it's much easier at least me

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.940 
tugging and it's much easier at least me
to<00:02:49.500> create<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.770> nice<00:02:50.040> wing

just gonna gonna duck up my brows
normally<00:02:57.220> they're<00:02:57.489> fine<00:02:57.730> for<00:02:57.760> every<00:02:58.120> day<00:02:58.269> but

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
normally they're fine for every day but

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.839 
normally they're fine for every day but
they<00:02:59.110> need<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.290> be<00:02:59.530> a<00:02:59.560> little<00:03:00.040> bit<00:03:00.160> more<00:03:00.340> darker

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
they need to be a little bit more darker

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.759 
they need to be a little bit more darker
for<00:03:01.150> actual<00:03:01.569> looks<00:03:04.230> I'm<00:03:05.230> applying<00:03:05.620> some

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
for actual looks I'm applying some

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.890 
for actual looks I'm applying some
mascara<00:03:06.250> because<00:03:06.610> my<00:03:07.269> look<00:03:07.420> just<00:03:07.660> doesn't

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
mascara because my look just doesn't

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.570 
mascara because my look just doesn't
feel<00:03:08.019> complete<00:03:08.200> without<00:03:08.739> it<00:03:08.890> but<00:03:09.340> in

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
feel complete without it but in

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.460 
feel complete without it but in
retrospect<00:03:10.120> I<00:03:10.450> recommend<00:03:10.930> using<00:03:11.080> false
