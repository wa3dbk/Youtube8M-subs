weapon the jet gun now actually you have
to<00:00:10.500> build<00:00:10.710> this<00:00:10.860> thing<00:00:10.920> it<00:00:11.219> doesn't<00:00:11.490> just<00:00:11.639> come

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
to build this thing it doesn't just come

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.339 
to build this thing it doesn't just come
out<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.120> mystery<00:00:12.420> box<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.900> it's<00:00:13.019> not<00:00:13.200> the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
out of the mystery box and it's not the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.200 
out of the mystery box and it's not the
easiest<00:00:13.380> thing<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.070> do<00:00:14.370> you're<00:00:14.790> gonna<00:00:14.849> have<00:00:15.089> to

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
easiest thing to do you're gonna have to

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.849 
easiest thing to do you're gonna have to
find<00:00:15.420> four<00:00:15.690> parts<00:00:15.990> throughout<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.379> transit

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
find four parts throughout the transit

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.410 
find four parts throughout the transit
green<00:00:17.100> run<00:00:17.310> map<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.760> then<00:00:18.060> build<00:00:18.270> them

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
green run map and then build them

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.179 
green run map and then build them
together<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.410> first<00:00:19.680> part<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.160> can

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
together so the first part that you can

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.950 
together so the first part that you can
find<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.910> very<00:00:21.150> first<00:00:21.480> tunnel<00:00:21.840> that

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
find is in the very first tunnel that

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.390 
find is in the very first tunnel that
the<00:00:22.109> bus<00:00:22.289> takes<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.710> through<00:00:22.980> once<00:00:23.220> you

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
the bus takes you through once you

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.490 
the bus takes you through once you
notice<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.880> little<00:00:24.029> walkway<00:00:24.359> that's<00:00:25.170> kind<00:00:25.439> of

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
notice a little walkway that's kind of

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.720 
notice a little walkway that's kind of
lit<00:00:25.650> up<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.039> tunnel<00:00:26.310> with<00:00:26.519> like<00:00:26.699> a

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
lit up on the tunnel with like a

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.060 
lit up on the tunnel with like a
railings<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.689> stuff<00:00:27.930> just<00:00:28.470> jump<00:00:28.740> out<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
railings and stuff just jump out of the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.470 
railings and stuff just jump out of the
bus<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.640> want<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.880> look<00:00:30.000> for<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.240> piece
