00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.319
 very good everyone welcome to this video 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.389
 of informative nature and is that already 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.250
 you know that a few days ago I went up a 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.500
 video to download the course 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.880
 voice without having to wait for the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.060
 blissful beta key that only a few 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.460
 privileged because they could enjoy but 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.130
 As you also know, I mentioned that this 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.769
 was now forbidden or that was 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.830
 illegal to use it on the servers of 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.390
 Latin America but a day ago the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.550
 recording of this video like here it puts 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.710
 ok you are seeing it because riots have 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.790
 mentioned in something generic for all 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.890
 the servers and specifically in the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.170
 server of europe no and is that this 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.870
 program course voice will be 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.020
 totally forbidden or what is it 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.000
 it is illegal to use it currently in 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.680
 every server that is to say is no longer 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.440
 only in Latin America but also 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.719
 is prohibited in Europe and in 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.219
 North America thing to see I'm going to 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.020
 explain now it seems fair because if 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.430
 it is not pressed in Latin America because it 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.780
 can are Europeans a little study not 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.969
 because what is the difference? 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.170
 but I'm not really going to mention if 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.159
 I think it's good to have them removed if it's 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.720
 good that they leave it because it is not this 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.009
 video for it is not not a video of 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.150
 opinion but it is simply a video 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.730
 informative to tell you what 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.080
 you be careful because from 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.720
 now they are going to leave the days of margin 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.610
 so that the company does not take a ban 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.890
 here immediately but you know that 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.320
 within very few will this look and if you 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.500
 fit with this program how many already 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.330
 said that it is illegal because you can have 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.430
 800 go they certain 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.040
 in the account not certain quibbles with 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.420
 the account will basically leave you a link 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.340
 down that is always this 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.690
 this news basically the position of 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.360
 riad in application of third parties and 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.890
 really in course voice that is as the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.840
 application that lately has given more 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.260
 to talk where they excuse a little and 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.380
 explain why it is not interested 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.690
 have this application basically a 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.120
 great summary is that they say that 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.000
 conversations with strange people 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.680
 can increase the level of toxicity 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.380
 although really good is that you do not see 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.460
 no, but I said that given my 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.200
 opinion but really good I think 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.540
 a little absurd this because if not 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.310
 increases already it's just like a skype 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.320
 this can you already talk or can you 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.030
 leave the conversation you get in 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.500
 the skate you see that you are failing what 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.870
 it then closes the conversation and 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.220
 that they give for ass guiris but if not then 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.320
 the woman is good vibes and is better for 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.880
 the team anyway the change 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.260
 will always attend either by voice 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.450
 chat or whatever it is so what 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.459
 it seems a little excuse but good that 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.990
 do what you want and then another reason 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.000
 that already good we could enter more in 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.160
 debate is the theme this one part 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.240
 so it has a timer counter as 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.740
 here you see 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.840
 the body has a little bit of advantage 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.610
 so that the person who has it 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.200
 respect to the one that does not have since it has 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.140
 an automatic jungle contract does not 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.970
 has to have the respawn time of 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.280
 the videos of the videos of the 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.050
 bugs or anything and good gives you a little 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.030
 of advantage thing that a player more or 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.440
 less should that time but it's true that 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.970
 not everyone knows it and simply 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.950
 because in this tool because 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.590
 you have an I knew an extra knowledge 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.690
 that perhaps your rival does not have this way 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.160
 Nothing here I leave the link for you 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.390
 you read it in case you're interested in having the 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.460
 application has made us a brief summary 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.430
 I have informed you that it is illegal to use it 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.250
 on all the servers so gentlemen 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.390
 We will see if they make any improvement or any 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.130
 update of this program because 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.270
 they have also mentioned rieti in fact 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.500
 that I put that if drying a little the 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.060
 program that could be viable 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.060
 there are also rumors that riad is 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.500
 preparing something of their own to chat 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.510
 of voice and some little thing like that to a 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.950
 tool like that we'll see but both these 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.590
 it's the rumors so there's nothing 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.390
 confirmed so it 's all a greeting to us 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.390
 we see in the next video see you later
