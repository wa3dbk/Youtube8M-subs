00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.350 

let's<00:00:00.719> do<00:00:00.930> a<00:00:00.960> math<00:00:01.260> problem<00:00:01.920> what<00:00:02.580> is<00:00:02.850> 30

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
let's do a math problem what is 30

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.480 
let's do a math problem what is 30
divided<00:00:04.200> by<00:00:04.650> 2<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:05.339> 1/2<00:00:05.609> in<00:00:07.130> school<00:00:08.130> we<00:00:08.340> would

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
divided by 2 and 1/2 in school we would

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.310 
divided by 2 and 1/2 in school we would
do<00:00:08.639> this<00:00:08.790> problem<00:00:09.150> by<00:00:09.300> long<00:00:09.630> division<00:00:09.990> we

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
do this problem by long division we

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.209 
do this problem by long division we
would<00:00:10.500> set<00:00:10.710> up<00:00:10.830> 30<00:00:11.219> as<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:12.090> dividend<00:00:13.219> the

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
would set up 30 as the dividend the

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.250 
would set up 30 as the dividend the
number<00:00:14.250> 2<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:14.880> 1/2<00:00:15.059> which<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.660> our<00:00:15.870> divisor

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
number 2 and 1/2 which is our divisor

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.080 
number 2 and 1/2 which is our divisor
becomes<00:00:16.890> 2<00:00:17.190> point<00:00:17.490> 5<00:00:19.100> now<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.160> perform<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
becomes 2 point 5 now to perform the

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.939 
becomes 2 point 5 now to perform the
long<00:00:21.390> division<00:00:21.660> we<00:00:22.109> need<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.289> move<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
long division we need to move the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.150 
long division we need to move the
decimal<00:00:23.369> point<00:00:23.550> over<00:00:23.990> so<00:00:24.990> 2<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.380> 1/2<00:00:25.439> becomes

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
decimal point over so 2 and 1/2 becomes

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.040 
decimal point over so 2 and 1/2 becomes
25<00:00:28.609> since<00:00:29.609> we<00:00:29.789> move<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.179> decimal<00:00:30.300> point<00:00:30.810> to

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
25 since we move the decimal point to

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.990 
25 since we move the decimal point to
the<00:00:31.080> right<00:00:31.369> we're<00:00:32.369> going<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.910> adjust

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
the right we're going to have to adjust

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.049 
the right we're going to have to adjust
it<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.390> 30<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.739> we<00:00:34.950> move<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.219> decimal<00:00:35.430> point

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
it on 30 so we move the decimal point

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.470 
it on 30 so we move the decimal point
over<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.660> left<00:00:36.930> or<00:00:37.940> do<00:00:38.940> we<00:00:39.090> move<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
over to the left or do we move the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.260 
over to the left or do we move the
decimal<00:00:39.809> point<00:00:39.989> over<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.649> right<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.270> when

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
decimal point over to the right and when

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.729 
decimal point over to the right and when
we<00:00:42.390> move<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.719> over<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.110> right<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.530> have<00:00:43.620> an

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
we move it over to the right we have an

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.060 
we move it over to the right we have an
empty<00:00:43.980> spot<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.879> we<00:00:45.000> add<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> 0<00:00:45.829> all<00:00:46.829> right

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
empty spot so do we add a 0 all right

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.069 
empty spot so do we add a 0 all right
this<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.430> getting<00:00:47.550> confusing<00:00:48.180> but<00:00:49.020> don't

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
this is getting confusing but don't

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.709 
this is getting confusing but don't
worry<00:00:49.320> about<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.940> this<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.000> pressure<00:00:51.360> Locker

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
worry about it this is pressure Locker

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.720 
worry about it this is pressure Locker

in this video I'm going to teach you an
easy<00:00:54.000> way<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.300> divide<00:00:54.750> numbers<00:00:55.020> that's<00:00:56.010> known

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
easy way to divide numbers that's known

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.920 
easy way to divide numbers that's known
as<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> ancient<00:00:57.149> Egyptian<00:00:57.809> method<00:00:59.930> let's

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
as the ancient Egyptian method let's

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.599 
as the ancient Egyptian method let's
return<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> our<00:01:01.440> problem<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.100> forget

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
return to our problem and forget

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.179 
return to our problem and forget
everything<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.239> you've<00:01:03.449> learned<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.960> school

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
everything that you've learned in school

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.710 
everything that you've learned in school
I'm<00:01:05.189> going<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.640> teach<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.030> how<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.240> ancient

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
I'm going to teach you how the ancient

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.700 
I'm going to teach you how the ancient
Egyptians<00:01:07.290> did<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.680> around<00:01:08.490> 1650<00:01:09.390> BC<00:01:09.810> which

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
Egyptians did this around 1650 BC which

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.929 
Egyptians did this around 1650 BC which
was<00:01:10.890> over<00:01:11.189> 3,600<00:01:12.119> years<00:01:12.990> ago<00:01:13.310> this<00:01:14.310> problem<00:01:14.790> is

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
was over 3,600 years ago this problem is

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.679 
was over 3,600 years ago this problem is
documented<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.900> papyrus<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:18.330> method

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
documented on a papyrus and the method

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.770 
documented on a papyrus and the method
they<00:01:18.840> use<00:01:19.220> as<00:01:20.220> they<00:01:20.520> count<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.939> up<00:01:21.060> multiples

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
they use as they count it up multiples

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.310 
they use as they count it up multiples
of<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.320> divisor<00:01:22.619> two<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.159> half<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:25.170> they

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
of the divisor two and a half so they

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.950 
of the divisor two and a half so they
started<00:01:25.710> out<00:01:25.770> by<00:01:25.979> saying<00:01:26.009> one<00:01:26.580> part<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.150> two

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
started out by saying one part is two

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.350 
started out by saying one part is two
and<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.350> half<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.890> we're<00:01:29.729> going<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.939> count<00:01:30.180> up

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
and a half and we're going to count up

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.179 
and a half and we're going to count up
parts<00:01:30.720> until<00:01:31.049> we<00:01:31.200> get<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.380> 30<00:01:33.500> so<00:01:34.500> two<00:01:34.560> parts<00:01:34.920> of

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
parts until we get to 30 so two parts of

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.039 
parts until we get to 30 so two parts of
two<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> half<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:36.090> double<00:01:36.509> two<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.900> half

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
two and a half we double two and a half

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.929 
two and a half we double two and a half
to<00:01:37.259> get<00:01:37.409> five<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:40.159> then<00:01:41.159> we<00:01:41.310> can<00:01:41.460> also<00:01:41.640> take

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
to get five and then we can also take

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.139 
to get five and then we can also take
ten<00:01:42.360> parts<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.960> two<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.290> half<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:44.460> get<00:01:44.579> 25

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
ten parts of two and a half to get 25

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.469 
ten parts of two and a half to get 25
and<00:01:46.250> now<00:01:47.250> we've<00:01:47.640> pretty<00:01:47.880> much<00:01:47.970> solved<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and now we've pretty much solved the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.109 
and now we've pretty much solved the
problem<00:01:49.520> we<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.729> add<00:01:50.909> up<00:01:50.939> five<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.259> 25<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:54.000> get

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
problem we can add up five and 25 to get

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.170 
problem we can add up five and 25 to get
30<00:01:54.619> so<00:01:55.619> we're<00:01:55.799> adding<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.490> 30<00:01:56.790> which<00:01:57.149> is

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
30 so we're adding up to 30 which is

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.209 
30 so we're adding up to 30 which is
because<00:01:57.930> we're<00:01:58.110> doing<00:01:58.200> 30<00:01:58.590> divided<00:01:59.070> by<00:01:59.100> two

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
because we're doing 30 divided by two

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.450 
because we're doing 30 divided by two
and<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.520> half<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.170> now<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.229> get<00:02:01.560> our<00:02:01.799> answer<00:02:02.219> our

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
and a half and now to get our answer our

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.260 
and a half and now to get our answer our
quotient<00:02:02.899> we<00:02:03.899> just<00:02:04.170> add<00:02:04.350> up<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.680> parts<00:02:05.149> so<00:02:06.149> we

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
quotient we just add up the parts so we

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.180 
quotient we just add up the parts so we
add<00:02:06.390> up<00:02:06.420> two<00:02:06.719> parts<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.229> ten<00:02:07.409> parts<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:07.950> we

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
add up two parts and ten parts and we

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.999 
add up two parts and ten parts and we
get<00:02:08.369> 12<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.000> that's<00:02:09.840> our<00:02:10.020> answer<00:02:10.050> 30<00:02:10.590> divided

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
get 12 and that's our answer 30 divided

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.110 
get 12 and that's our answer 30 divided
by<00:02:11.039> two-and-a-half<00:02:11.489> is<00:02:11.940> 12

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
by two-and-a-half is 12

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.910 
by two-and-a-half is 12
so<00:02:15.120> it's<00:02:15.269> a<00:02:15.329> pretty<00:02:15.540> cool<00:02:15.780> method<00:02:16.049> and<00:02:16.439> you<00:02:16.739> can

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
so it's a pretty cool method and you can

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.000 
so it's a pretty cool method and you can
use<00:02:17.069> it<00:02:17.220> anytime<00:02:17.519> instead<00:02:18.299> of<00:02:18.390> long<00:02:18.629> division

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
use it anytime instead of long division

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.759 
use it anytime instead of long division
so<00:02:20.010> let's<00:02:20.280> try<00:02:20.489> another<00:02:20.730> problem<00:02:21.500> let's<00:02:22.500> do

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
so let's try another problem let's do

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.929 
so let's try another problem let's do
one<00:02:23.459> hundred<00:02:23.939> divided<00:02:24.510> by<00:02:24.689> seven<00:02:25.670> we're<00:02:26.670> going

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
one hundred divided by seven we're going

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.059 
one hundred divided by seven we're going
to<00:02:27.060> count<00:02:27.299> up<00:02:27.510> multiples<00:02:28.079> of<00:02:28.200> seven<00:02:28.650> until<00:02:29.010> we

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
to count up multiples of seven until we

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.309 
to count up multiples of seven until we
get<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.430> hundred<00:02:29.849> so<00:02:30.000> we<00:02:30.599> start<00:02:30.989> out<00:02:31.109> that

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
get to a hundred so we start out that

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.729 
get to a hundred so we start out that
one<00:02:31.560> part<00:02:31.829> is<00:02:32.040> equal<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.430> seven<00:02:33.500> we<00:02:34.500> can

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
one part is equal to seven we can

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.819 
one part is equal to seven we can
clearly<00:02:35.040> jump<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:36.390> ten<00:02:36.629> parts<00:02:36.870> which<00:02:37.470> will<00:02:37.680> be

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
clearly jump to ten parts which will be

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.130 
clearly jump to ten parts which will be
seventy

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
seventy

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.220 
seventy
we're<00:02:40.140> still<00:02:40.439> short<00:02:40.739> by<00:02:41.010> about<00:02:41.220> thirty<00:02:41.959> so<00:02:42.959> we

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
we're still short by about thirty so we

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.770 
we're still short by about thirty so we
can<00:02:43.409> add<00:02:43.620> four<00:02:44.310> parts<00:02:44.670> of<00:02:44.849> seven<00:02:45.239> which<00:02:45.720> is<00:02:45.750> 28

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
can add four parts of seven which is 28

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.710 
can add four parts of seven which is 28
we're<00:02:48.780> short<00:02:49.109> by<00:02:49.230> two<00:02:49.290> parts<00:02:49.859> or<00:02:50.129> two<00:02:51.060> until<00:02:51.629> we

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
we're short by two parts or two until we

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.199 
we're short by two parts or two until we
get<00:02:51.810> 200<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:52.349> 2/7<00:02:53.159> parts<00:02:53.519> will<00:02:53.730> be<00:02:53.760> equal<00:02:54.180> to

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
get 200 so 2/7 parts will be equal to

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.649 
get 200 so 2/7 parts will be equal to
two<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:56.280> now<00:02:56.400> we've<00:02:56.609> added<00:02:56.790> up<00:02:57.090> multiples

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
two so now we've added up multiples

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.910 
two so now we've added up multiples
until<00:02:58.019> we<00:02:58.139> get<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.349> 100<00:02:58.970> so<00:02:59.970> we<00:03:00.090> have<00:03:00.239> 70<00:03:00.920> plus

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
until we get to 100 so we have 70 plus

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.449 
until we get to 100 so we have 70 plus
28<00:03:02.730> plus<00:03:03.510> two<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.139> that<00:03:04.769> gets<00:03:04.980> us<00:03:05.099> to<00:03:05.159> our

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
28 plus two and that gets us to our

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.250 
28 plus two and that gets us to our
hundred<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:08.370> get<00:03:08.549> our<00:03:08.760> quotient<00:03:09.329> we<00:03:09.840> add<00:03:10.019> up

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
hundred to get our quotient we add up

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.770 
hundred to get our quotient we add up
the<00:03:10.500> number<00:03:10.530> of<00:03:10.980> parts<00:03:11.310> we<00:03:12.090> have<00:03:12.120> ten<00:03:12.450> parts

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
the number of parts we have ten parts

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.080 
the number of parts we have ten parts
for<00:03:13.049> parts<00:03:13.409> and<00:03:13.530> two<00:03:13.769> seventh<00:03:14.159> parts<00:03:14.489> which

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
for parts and two seventh parts which

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.520 
for parts and two seventh parts which
gets<00:03:15.329> us<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.540> our<00:03:15.750> answer<00:03:16.079> of<00:03:16.230> 14<00:03:16.799> and<00:03:16.980> 2/7<00:03:17.669> and

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
gets us to our answer of 14 and 2/7 and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.839 
gets us to our answer of 14 and 2/7 and
there<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.650> go<00:03:19.799> this<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.099> an<00:03:20.310> easy<00:03:20.549> way<00:03:20.819> to

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.300 
there you go this is an easy way to
divide<00:03:21.359> numbers<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:22.079> you<00:03:22.530> don't<00:03:22.829> have<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.190> use

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
divide numbers and you don't have to use

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.009 
divide numbers and you don't have to use
a<00:03:23.340> long<00:03:23.579> division<00:03:24.650> if<00:03:26.510> you<00:03:27.510> were<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.840> ask

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
a long division if you were to ask

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.809 
a long division if you were to ask
people<00:03:28.319> about<00:03:28.590> this<00:03:28.889> in<00:03:29.099> school<00:03:29.220> or<00:03:29.549> try<00:03:29.760> and
