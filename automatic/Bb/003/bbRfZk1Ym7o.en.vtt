00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.869
 let's prepare a buttercream or bitumen 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.890
 to decorate cakes or cupcakes 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.249
 and for this we will need the following ingredients 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:28.029
 350 grams of unsalted butter at room temperature 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.429
 300 grams of icing sugar 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.420
 two tablespoons of milk 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.140
 and essence or extract to taste 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.110
 it is very important that the butter be without salt 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.460
 if butter has salt the buttercream will be softer 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.500
 and you should never change it for vegetable margarine because vegetable margarine 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.610
 leaves the buttercream less firm and with a completely different flavor 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.510
 also the butter must be at room temperature, the ideal is 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.280
 Take it out of the fridge the night before preparing the buttercream 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.560
 icing sugar is also known elsewhere as icing sugar 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.040
 impalpable sugar, 3x sugar, powdered sugar or flower sugar 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.440
 the icing sugar should always be sifted before preparing the recipe and never 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.360
 must replace with white sugar because the buttercream will remain 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.950
 completely sandy 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.850
 and after saying that we go with the process 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.700
 the buttercream should always be done with the help of a blender 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.780
 electric 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.120
 and you can use any type of rods like the balloon or mix 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.320
 except the kneading rods 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.000
 you should mix the sugar and butter very well 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.360
 at the beginning slow and then at full speed 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.340
 and it is good to cover the blender the principle to avoid getting dirty 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.920
 all 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.250
 It is important to mix very well so that you do not feel the butter flavor 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.390
 and you have to remember to stop the blender and clean the walls during the process 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.570
 if the buttercream is cut it is usually because the butter is very cold 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.210
 or something has cooled it 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.260
 the torch helps soften it 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.630
 or we can also put the mixture in the microwave or bain-marie for 10 seconds 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.129
 and review 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.979
 and if the buttercream has remained too liquid 

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:14.859
 it's because the butter has softened too much 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:19.479
 this may be because the same mixer warms the mixture or makes a lot of heat 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:24.239
 where you live, it is best to refrigerate them for ten minutes and repeat this process 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.919
 until it acquires the desired consistency 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:31.959
 When the buttercream or bitumen is light colored milk should be added 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.009
 If it is very hot this step can be omitted 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.439
 the essence you want to use can be of any type 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:42.569
 and it is added to the end of the shake just like the food coloring 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.409
 To preserve the buttercream it must be stored in an airtight container and leave 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:48.809
 room temperature 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:53.009
 away from heat sources but not in the fridge so it does not harden 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:58.199
 The buttercream lasts about 4 to 5 days depending on the temperature at which it is 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:02.699
 if it is very hot it can be affected and its expiration will be lower 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:06.429
 and this would be the result of the consistency of buttercream or bitumen 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:07.669
 that we have prepared
