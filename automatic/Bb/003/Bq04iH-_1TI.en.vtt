and<00:01:13.720> that<00:01:14.720> actually<00:01:15.350> powered<00:01:15.710> my<00:01:15.890> humongous

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
and that actually powered my humongous

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:24.010 
and that actually powered my humongous
seven<00:01:18.280> pound<00:01:19.280> wing<00:01:19.730> and<00:01:21.850> did<00:01:22.850> very<00:01:22.880> well<00:01:23.150> all

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
seven pound wing and did very well all

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.160 
seven pound wing and did very well all
my<00:01:24.260> hardware<00:01:25.720> boots<00:01:28.120> yeah<00:01:29.120> that's<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.600> that's

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
my hardware boots yeah that's the that's

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.790 
my hardware boots yeah that's the that's
the<00:01:30.380> idea<00:01:31.480> so<00:01:33.340> set<00:01:34.340> up<00:01:34.460> like<00:01:34.640> that<00:01:35.680> with<00:01:36.680> the

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
the idea so set up like that with the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.890 
the idea so set up like that with the
motor<00:01:37.010> mount<00:01:37.250> but<00:01:38.060> I'd<00:01:38.270> like<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.480> shorten

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
motor mount but I'd like to shorten

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.350 
motor mount but I'd like to shorten
these<00:01:38.960> and<00:01:39.200> get<00:01:39.290> it<00:01:39.410> a<00:01:39.560> little<00:01:39.710> bit<00:01:39.920> closer

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
these and get it a little bit closer

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.290 
these and get it a little bit closer
back<00:01:41.360> here<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.470> maybe<00:01:43.100> GPS<00:01:43.670> over<00:01:43.940> there<00:01:44.090> but

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
back here and maybe GPS over there but

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.130 
back here and maybe GPS over there but
I'm<00:01:45.260> figured<00:01:45.560> out<00:01:45.650> yet<00:01:47.410> let's<00:01:48.410> see<00:01:49.690> so<00:01:50.690> I've

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
I'm figured out yet let's see so I've

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.230 
I'm figured out yet let's see so I've
set<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:51.620> up<00:01:51.800> like<00:01:51.830> four<00:01:52.340> 10-inch<00:01:52.610> prop<00:01:53.000> I<00:01:53.150> know

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
set it up like four 10-inch prop I know

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.910 
set it up like four 10-inch prop I know
this<00:01:53.390> is<00:01:53.480> going<00:01:53.570> to<00:01:53.660> be<00:01:53.720> a<00:01:53.750> light<00:01:53.990> plane<00:01:54.230> and

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
this is going to be a light plane and

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.410 
this is going to be a light plane and
the<00:01:55.250> batteries<00:01:55.610> are<00:01:55.730> really<00:01:55.940> light<00:01:56.150> they

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
the batteries are really light they

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.180 
the batteries are really light they
don't<00:01:56.600> weigh<00:01:56.690> not<00:01:56.930> pretty<00:01:57.500> much<00:01:57.650> anything<00:01:57.950> it

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
don't weigh not pretty much anything it

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.890 
don't weigh not pretty much anything it
will<00:01:58.250> feel<00:01:58.430> like<00:01:58.460> a<00:02:01.420> then<00:02:02.420> we'll<00:02:02.510> flip<00:02:02.600> out<00:02:02.810> at

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
will feel like a then we'll flip out at

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.950 
will feel like a then we'll flip out at
all<00:02:03.280> i'm<00:02:04.280> going<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.580> put<00:02:04.730> another<00:02:04.760> spa<00:02:05.390> across

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
all i'm going to put another spa across

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.170 
all i'm going to put another spa across
in<00:02:06.350> inside<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.460> bay<00:02:07.810> underneath<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:09.050> and

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
in inside the bay underneath it and

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.580 
in inside the bay underneath it and
that'll<00:02:11.180> cut<00:02:11.720> it<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:11.930> size<00:02:12.019> and<00:02:12.379> that'll

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
that'll cut it to the size and that'll

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.860 
that'll cut it to the size and that'll
be<00:02:12.680> on<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:12.860> underneath<00:02:13.459> side<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.910> it<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.390> then

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
be on the underneath side of it and then

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.009 
be on the underneath side of it and then
I'll<00:02:14.959> lay<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.140> may<00:02:15.590> be<00:02:15.650> cut<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:16.160> and<00:02:16.250> then<00:02:16.370> put

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
I'll lay it may be cut it and then put

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.780 
I'll lay it may be cut it and then put
22<00:02:18.040> spars<00:02:19.040> underneath<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:20.000> then<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:21.200> might<00:02:21.920> cut

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
22 spars underneath and then I might cut

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.760 
22 spars underneath and then I might cut
this<00:02:23.060> for<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.450> bumper<00:02:23.960> for<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:25.610> bottom

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
this for a bumper for the bottom

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.550 
this for a bumper for the bottom
maybe<00:02:27.430> shape<00:02:27.820> it<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.180> then<00:02:28.480> glue<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.320> to<00:02:29.530> the

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
maybe shape it and then glue it to the

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.210 
maybe shape it and then glue it to the
bottom<00:02:30.300> maybe<00:02:31.300> something<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:32.130> kind<00:02:33.130> of

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
bottom maybe something to kind of

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:42.290 
bottom maybe something to kind of
cushion<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.120> blow<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:35.970> 20<00:02:38.880> might<00:02:39.880> work<00:02:40.680> Oh

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
cushion the blow and 20 might work Oh

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.840 
cushion the blow and 20 might work Oh
yvonnes<00:02:43.300> will<00:02:43.570> be<00:02:43.660> done<00:02:44.430> pretty<00:02:45.430> smoothly<00:02:46.650> so

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
yvonnes will be done pretty smoothly so

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.010 
yvonnes will be done pretty smoothly so
what's<00:02:48.850> selling<00:02:50.610> some<00:02:51.610> old<00:02:51.760> planes<00:02:52.090> so<00:02:52.690> i<00:02:52.720> can

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
what's selling some old planes so i can

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.420 
what's selling some old planes so i can
i<00:02:53.610> can<00:02:54.630> keep<00:02:55.630> buying<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.080> wings<00:02:56.320> i'm<00:02:57.190> like

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
i can keep buying the wings i'm like

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.990 
i can keep buying the wings i'm like
more<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.730> lot<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.650> they<00:02:59.650> fly<00:02:59.920> really<00:03:00.250> good<00:03:00.460> or

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
more a lot and they fly really good or

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.460 
more a lot and they fly really good or
cheaper<00:03:01.890> compared<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:03.600> my<00:03:04.600> other<00:03:04.630> my<00:03:05.320> other

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
cheaper compared to my other my other

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.050 
cheaper compared to my other my other
planes<00:03:05.740> less<00:03:06.490> less<00:03:06.910> gear<00:03:07.680> so<00:03:08.680> I'm<00:03:09.610> liking<00:03:10.000> a

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
planes less less gear so I'm liking a
