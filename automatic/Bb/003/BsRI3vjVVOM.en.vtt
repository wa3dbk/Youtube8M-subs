00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
but how would that translate to becoming

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.640 
but how would that translate to becoming

or<00:01:59.020> anything<00:01:59.229> like<00:01:59.530> that<00:01:59.590> actually

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
or anything like that actually

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.120 
or anything like that actually
considering<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.390> game<00:02:01.720> type<00:02:02.110> it<00:02:02.260> is<00:02:02.409> I<00:02:02.650> walked

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
considering the game type it is I walked

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.950 
considering the game type it is I walked
away<00:02:03.250> very<00:02:03.610> impressed<00:02:03.760> with<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.390> graphics<00:02:04.810> as

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
away very impressed with the graphics as

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.930 
away very impressed with the graphics as
a<00:02:05.020> whole<00:02:05.229> very<00:02:05.860> interesting<00:02:06.400> and<00:02:06.520> fun

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
a whole very interesting and fun

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.339 
a whole very interesting and fun
although<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.510> plants<00:02:07.900> were<00:02:07.990> actually

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
although the plants were actually

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.469 
although the plants were actually
scarier<00:02:08.950> as<00:02:09.190> far<00:02:09.459> as<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.729> art<00:02:09.879> direction<00:02:10.330> than

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
scarier as far as the art direction than

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.690 
scarier as far as the art direction than
the<00:02:10.509> zombies<00:02:10.989> in<00:02:11.140> my<00:02:11.290> opinion<00:02:11.769> but<00:02:12.400> still

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
the zombies in my opinion but still

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.369 
the zombies in my opinion but still
nothing<00:02:13.209> that's<00:02:13.540> gonna<00:02:13.629> hold<00:02:13.900> anybody<00:02:14.319> back

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
nothing that's gonna hold anybody back

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.460 
nothing that's gonna hold anybody back
or<00:02:14.799> take<00:02:14.950> anybody<00:02:15.280> off<00:02:15.569> now<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:16.629> gameplay<00:02:16.989> is

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
or take anybody off now the gameplay is

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.860 
or take anybody off now the gameplay is
a<00:02:17.680> breath<00:02:18.040> of<00:02:18.189> fresh<00:02:18.430> air<00:02:18.670> I'd<00:02:19.420> say<00:02:19.659> it<00:02:19.750> was<00:02:19.840> a

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
a breath of fresh air I'd say it was a

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.140 
a breath of fresh air I'd say it was a
mix<00:02:20.170> between<00:02:20.519> battlefield<00:02:21.519> and<00:02:21.730> Gears<00:02:21.939> of<00:02:22.030> War

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
mix between battlefield and Gears of War

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.539 
mix between battlefield and Gears of War
the<00:02:22.959> reason<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.319> say<00:02:23.500> Gears<00:02:23.769> of<00:02:23.830> War<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.250> because

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
the reason I say Gears of War is because

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.339 
the reason I say Gears of War is because
it's<00:02:24.700> third-person<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.540> because<00:02:26.049> one<00:02:26.200> of<00:02:26.230> the

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
it's third-person and because one of the

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.199 
it's third-person and because one of the
game<00:02:26.590> modes<00:02:26.860> which<00:02:27.099> is<00:02:27.220> called<00:02:27.430> garden<00:02:27.819> ops<00:02:28.000> is

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
game modes which is called garden ops is

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.620 
game modes which is called garden ops is
exactly<00:02:28.810> like<00:02:29.020> horde<00:02:29.319> mode<00:02:29.380> on<00:02:29.950> Gears<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.370> War

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
exactly like horde mode on Gears of War

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.390 
exactly like horde mode on Gears of War
basically<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.620> three<00:02:33.069> other<00:02:33.220> players

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
and you fight 10 waves of enemies that

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.070 
and you fight 10 waves of enemies that
come<00:02:36.740> in<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.240> you<00:02:38.240> set<00:02:38.510> up<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.750> different
