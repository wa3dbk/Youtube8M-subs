00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
and these are really good as basis for

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.520

other<00:00:41.040> eyeshadows<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:42.320> wouldn't<00:00:43.320> necessarily

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
other eyeshadows I wouldn't necessarily

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.430

wear<00:00:44.219> them<00:00:44.520> without<00:00:44.820> anything<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.899> because

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
wear them without anything on because

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.260 
wear them without anything on because
they<00:00:46.800> crease<00:00:47.280> even<00:00:48.270> with<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.570> base<00:00:48.809> under<00:00:49.590> it

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
they crease even with the base under it

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.340 
they crease even with the base under it
because<00:00:51.270> I've<00:00:51.390> tried<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.690> as<00:00:51.870> well<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.199> that

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
because I've tried that as well and that

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.100 
because I've tried that as well and that
didn't<00:00:52.649> work<00:00:52.710> well<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.309> me<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.840> you<00:00:54.840> should

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
really know should do a light light lei

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.630 
really know should do a light light lei
Ling<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.629> because<00:01:01.020> they<00:01:01.920> can't<00:01:02.219> crease<00:01:02.460> if

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
Ling of it because they can't crease if

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.609

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
and then I got in my first glossybox

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.440 
and then I got in my first glossybox
when<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.070> came<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.610> Sweden<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.060> first<00:02:06.270> one<00:02:06.420> I

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
when it came to Sweden the first one I

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.260 
when it came to Sweden the first one I
had<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.020> got<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.099> ico<00:02:08.700> London<00:02:09.390> fat<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.560> stick

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
had I got the ico London fat I I stick

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.500 
had I got the ico London fat I I stick
and<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:13.230> think<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.220> color<00:02:14.520> was<00:02:14.880> satin<00:02:15.300> taupe

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
and I think the color was satin taupe

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.510 
and I think the color was satin taupe
but<00:02:15.750> she<00:02:15.990> actually<00:02:16.290> doesn't<00:02:16.680> say<00:02:17.070> on<00:02:17.310> the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
but she actually doesn't say on the

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
but she actually doesn't say on the
packaging<00:02:18.000> what<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.780> color<00:02:18.990> is<00:02:20.030> but<00:02:21.030> i<00:02:21.060> think

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
packaging what the color is but i think

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.270 
packaging what the color is but i think
it<00:02:21.690> was<00:02:21.780> satin<00:02:22.170> taupe<00:02:22.350> i<00:02:22.560> think<00:02:22.770> that's<00:02:23.100> what

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
it was satin taupe i think that's what

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.940 
it was satin taupe i think that's what
it<00:02:23.430> said<00:02:23.670> on<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.970> other<00:02:24.330> on<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.410> box<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.860> it

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
it said on the other on the box that it

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.430 
it said on the other on the box that it
came<00:02:26.070> in<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.490> it<00:02:27.240> looks<00:02:27.510> like<00:02:27.630> this<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.410> a

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
came in and it looks like this is a

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.340 
came in and it looks like this is a
compared<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.520> this<00:02:29.670> one<00:02:29.730> it's<00:02:30.090> very<00:02:31.610> very<00:02:32.610> very

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350
