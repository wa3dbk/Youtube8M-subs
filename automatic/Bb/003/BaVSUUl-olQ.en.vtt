00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.300 
it the light bulb went off over my head
that<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.600> should<00:01:28.140> develop<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.710> into<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> product

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
that I should develop it into a product

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.190 
that I should develop it into a product
and<00:01:29.840> so<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.869> spent<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.590> year<00:01:31.729> prototyping<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.909> and

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
and so I spent a year prototyping it and

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.710 
and so I spent a year prototyping it and
working<00:01:34.200> with<00:01:34.350> an<00:01:34.470> engineer<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:36.270> perfect

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
working with an engineer to to perfect

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
joint you can see this circular shaft

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.749 
joint you can see this circular shaft
through<00:01:54.600> here<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.040> turn<00:01:56.369> has<00:01:56.700> a

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.160 

it<00:02:02.560> pedals<00:02:03.070> much<00:02:03.340> like<00:02:03.670> a<00:02:03.880> regular<00:02:04.210> one-person

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
it pedals much like a regular one-person

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.490 
it pedals much like a regular one-person
bike<00:02:05.350> see<00:02:05.799> everyone<00:02:06.159> has<00:02:06.369> a<00:02:06.670> set<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.450> cranks<00:02:08.349> or

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
bike see everyone has a set of cranks or

bike see everyone has a set of cranks or
pedals<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.250> so<00:02:10.209> everyone's<00:02:10.810> pedaling

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
pedals and so everyone's pedaling

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.050 
pedals and so everyone's pedaling
contributes<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.190> forward<00:02:12.520> motion<00:02:12.940> and

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
contributes to the forward motion and

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.449 
contributes to the forward motion and
