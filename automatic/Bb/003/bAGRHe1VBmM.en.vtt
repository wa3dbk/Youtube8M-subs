00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 I am a dad and I can not imagine a day without 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.390
 see or without knowing where my daughters are 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.800
 hours 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.570
 what happened to you and in what 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.340
 circumstances your partner leaves you when 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:17.660
 one day disappears with your daughter 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:20.270
 and I went into a nightmare that makes 12 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.939
 not in addition to almost 18 years not 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.640
 I leave now 12 years ago I can not see 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.400
 my daughter after what ended up running 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.020
 is that the boy is spoken so badly of the 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.480
 father not cohabiting of all 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.420
 monster families and grows up believing 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.309
 everything that is said to him the children believe 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.710
 that the motive of the mother because the 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.930
 moved away from the delivery of a girl this 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.879
 is the point I would like to touch this is not 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.680
 a particular problem because within 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.530
 the particular can have everything from 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.300
 perversion foolishness ignorance foolishness 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.399
 but what can not be is that the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.440
 judicial system is endorsing all this 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.540
 what is reported in the documentary does not 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.910
 are the people are not mothers is the 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.460
 judicial system that was installed in the 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.719
 country in the whole west actually from the 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.180
 hand of what they mentioned a 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.850
 ideology an armed ideology and 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.320
 structure of the tdt in a motive when 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.300
 it happens that they particular I'm not going to 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.310
 enter the grounds from mother 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.530
 of my girl formally what is the grace 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.550
 I could tell you that she suffered the same 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.110
 What are you doing to my daughter today? 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.440
 and I could tell you he's repeating 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.720
 but for that there should be judges who 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.610
 dictate that people who are with some 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.560
 psychological problem are doing 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.560
 damage to third hour what I do not understand 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.540
 is that a mother makes it impossible for her 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.130
 daughter of sharing time with her father 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.060
 will be separated because ultimately 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.060
 the evil is of the minor 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.920
 write the number of cases that there are 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.250
 they do not care they are blinded because they do not 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.440
 they have a couple with their parents 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.500
 couple breaks up what's left for 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.180
 distribute is money and children already 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.590
 sometimes it becomes the territory that 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.510
 is settled in the differences that 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.280
 separatist or the pains or 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.290
 sufferings that meant the rupture 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.910
 of the couple 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.830
 we always see it permanently what 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.020
 we see what you see in your program we see it 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.880
 always of the things that do some 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.100
 mothers of the things that do some 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.660
 parents of those who stop doing in the 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.070
 maintenance but I think it's super 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.260
 interesting the theme of the movie 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.240
 because in some way, as I said 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.980
 Maria Julia this has always been at 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.840
 side of women women we have 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.970
 all rights regarding children 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.710
 and it's as if men did not have them 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.710
 and that right is shared 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:36.570
 as the mother needs to pass the movie 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.010
 cool conscience says there are images 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.900
 of guys because the guys and it's a 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.240
 documentary has to see images look 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.790
 justice unfortunately the judge in 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.380
 particular the one that prohibits the film does not 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.060
 we have an opportunity to see it for each 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.460
 time we went to the cause as it is called 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.590
 they allowed blanch guillermo blanch 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.110
 judge 18 never allowed us to see the 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.060
 cause therefore I would not know how to say which 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:04.890
 are the basics of the judge for 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:06.960
 ban the movie us 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.480
 there are many people today who can talk about 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.099
 a bit the Argentinian who feels like 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.379
 and these last winds are like us 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.040
 dedicate to them be that stops to close 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.040
 Today's program
