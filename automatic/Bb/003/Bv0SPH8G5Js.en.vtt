00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
about 6.25 percent alcohol what we've

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.140 
about 6.25 percent alcohol what we've
got<00:00:33.050> in<00:00:33.380> this<00:00:33.500> beer<00:00:33.770> is<00:00:33.800> a<00:00:33.920> really<00:00:34.640> hop<00:00:34.850> forward

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
got in this beer is a really hop forward

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.360 
got in this beer is a really hop forward
beer<00:00:35.450> and<00:00:35.720> bite<00:00:35.960> by<00:00:36.350> most<00:00:36.650> of<00:00:36.829> our<00:00:36.920> lost<00:00:37.130> abbey

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
beer and bite by most of our lost abbey

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.430 
beer and bite by most of our lost abbey
beers<00:00:37.700> we<00:00:38.480> don't<00:00:38.600> have<00:00:38.840> this<00:00:39.020> much<00:00:39.079> hot

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
beers we don't have this much hot

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.410 
beers we don't have this much hot
presence<00:00:39.920> so<00:00:40.160> again<00:00:40.820> this<00:00:40.970> is<00:00:41.090> a<00:00:41.150> fairly

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
presence so again this is a fairly

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.300 
presence so again this is a fairly
straightforward<00:00:42.110> beer<00:00:42.320> but<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:42.920> hops<00:00:43.100> are

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
straightforward beer but the hops are

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.290 
straightforward beer but the hops are
front<00:00:43.550> and<00:00:43.580> center<00:00:43.670> and<00:00:43.940> that's<00:00:44.030> what's

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
front and center and that's what's

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.000 
front and center and that's what's
really<00:00:44.540> important<00:00:44.870> in<00:00:44.930> this<00:00:45.050> beer<00:00:45.350> we're<00:00:45.890> also

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
really important in this beer we're also

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.110 
really important in this beer we're also
going<00:00:46.190> to<00:00:46.250> talk<00:00:46.370> a<00:00:46.430> little<00:00:46.580> bit<00:00:46.760> about<00:00:46.910> the

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
going to talk a little bit about the

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.090 
going to talk a little bit about the
yeast<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.660> yeast<00:00:47.690> and<00:00:48.080> this<00:00:48.230> is<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.890> same

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
yeast the yeast and this is the same

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.130 
yeast the yeast and this is the same
house<00:00:49.340> that<00:00:49.640> we<00:00:49.910> use<00:00:50.090> for<00:00:50.120> our<00:00:50.330> lost<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:50.930> found

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
house that we use for our lost and found

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.110 
house that we use for our lost and found
as<00:00:51.350> well<00:00:51.830> as<00:00:51.860> our<00:00:52.130> judgement<00:00:52.640> day<00:00:52.760> and<00:00:52.940> in<00:00:53.000> that

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
as well as our judgement day and in that

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.280 
as well as our judgement day and in that
regard<00:00:53.330> we<00:00:53.630> get<00:00:53.780> a<00:00:53.810> little<00:00:54.020> bit<00:00:54.140> of<00:00:54.170> a

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
regard we get a little bit of a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.930 
regard we get a little bit of a
character<00:00:54.530> that<00:00:54.980> goes<00:00:55.430> through<00:00:55.760> those

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
character that goes through those

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.430 
character that goes through those
strings<00:00:56.300> of<00:00:56.450> beer<00:00:56.630> again<00:00:56.750> six<00:00:57.230> year-round

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
strings of beer again six year-round

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.380 
strings of beer again six year-round
beers<00:00:57.890> three<00:00:58.520> of<00:00:58.610> which<00:00:58.730> share<00:00:59.030> the<00:00:59.180> same

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
beers three of which share the same

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.090 
beers three of which share the same
house<00:00:59.630> yeast<00:00:59.960> so<00:01:00.500> you<00:01:00.560> should<00:01:00.770> have<00:01:00.800> a<00:01:00.950> little

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
house yeast so you should have a little

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.980 
house yeast so you should have a little
bit<00:01:01.250> of<00:01:01.280> a<00:01:01.370> perspective<00:01:01.880> that's<00:01:02.060> resonates

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
bit of a perspective that's resonates

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.719 
bit of a perspective that's resonates
and<00:01:03.140> it's<00:01:03.290> sort<00:01:03.500> of<00:01:03.590> similar<00:01:03.770> although<00:01:04.220> in

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
and it's sort of similar although in

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.429 
and it's sort of similar although in
this<00:01:04.879> beer<00:01:05.119> we<00:01:05.299> try<00:01:05.540> to<00:01:05.600> tone<00:01:05.869> down<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.259> East

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
this beer we try to tone down the East

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.050 
this beer we try to tone down the East
component<00:01:06.950> just<00:01:07.400> a<00:01:07.490> little<00:01:07.610> bit<00:01:07.790> to<00:01:07.939> allow

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
component just a little bit to allow

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.300 
component just a little bit to allow
those<00:01:08.240> hops<00:01:08.509> to<00:01:08.720> shine<00:01:08.930> through<00:01:09.259> again<00:01:10.009> it's<00:01:10.220> a

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
those hops to shine through again it's a

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.010 
those hops to shine through again it's a
blonde<00:01:10.580> beer<00:01:10.909> so<00:01:11.180> we<00:01:11.299> don't<00:01:11.450> have<00:01:11.600> a<00:01:11.659> ton<00:01:11.990> of

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
blonde beer so we don't have a ton of

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.440 
blonde beer so we don't have a ton of
caramel<00:01:12.500> malt<00:01:12.710> or<00:01:12.920> color<00:01:13.850> malts<00:01:14.210> we're<00:01:14.329> going

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
caramel malt or color malts we're going

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.870 
caramel malt or color malts we're going
to<00:01:14.509> get<00:01:14.630> this<00:01:14.780> very<00:01:15.229> very<00:01:15.499> blonde<00:01:15.920> yellow

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
to get this very very blonde yellow

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.639 
to get this very very blonde yellow
straw<00:01:17.390> colored<00:01:17.810> beer<00:01:18.109> it's<00:01:18.320> going<00:01:18.439> to<00:01:18.499> have<00:01:18.619> a

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
straw colored beer it's going to have a

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.550 
straw colored beer it's going to have a
dense<00:01:19.039> head<00:01:19.399> on<00:01:19.549> it<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:19.850> a<00:01:20.079> part<00:01:21.079> of<00:01:21.170> that<00:01:21.320> head

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
dense head on it and a part of that head

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.469 
dense head on it and a part of that head
comes<00:01:21.890> from<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.219> dry<00:01:22.399> hopping<00:01:22.640> process<00:01:22.789> which

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
comes from the dry hopping process which

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.319 
comes from the dry hopping process which
allows<00:01:23.749> us<00:01:24.049> to<00:01:24.619> really<00:01:24.859> really<00:01:25.299> emphasize<00:01:26.299> the

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
allows us to really really emphasize the

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.749 
allows us to really really emphasize the
hop<00:01:26.960> character<00:01:27.259> in<00:01:27.469> the<00:01:27.560> beer<00:01:27.799> it<00:01:27.950> is<00:01:28.579> the<00:01:28.729> only

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
hop character in the beer it is the only

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.370 
hop character in the beer it is the only
lost<00:01:29.329> a<00:01:29.509> be<00:01:29.569> a<00:01:29.689> year-round<00:01:29.869> beer<00:01:30.170> that<00:01:30.289> we

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
lost a be a year-round beer that we

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.569 
lost a be a year-round beer that we
produced<00:01:30.649> that<00:01:30.799> does<00:01:30.950> go<00:01:31.130> through<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.429> dry

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
produced that does go through the dry

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.819 
produced that does go through the dry
hopping<00:01:31.789> process<00:01:31.969> of<00:01:32.749> hops<00:01:33.049> being<00:01:33.409> added<00:01:33.710> to

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
hopping process of hops being added to

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.359 
hopping process of hops being added to
the<00:01:33.920> conditioning<00:01:34.399> tank<00:01:34.670> on<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.509> nose<00:01:36.219> we<00:01:37.219> get

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
the conditioning tank on the nose we get

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.219 
the conditioning tank on the nose we get
a<00:01:37.399> real<00:01:37.639> spicy<00:01:38.149> texture<00:01:38.539> that<00:01:38.659> comes<00:01:38.929> from<00:01:39.079> the

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
a real spicy texture that comes from the

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.660 
a real spicy texture that comes from the
tetteh<00:01:39.409> Nang<00:01:39.590> hops<00:01:39.829> that<00:01:40.009> we<00:01:40.159> use<00:01:40.310> in<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.520> dry

tetteh Nang hops that we use in the dry
hopping<00:01:40.880> process<00:01:41.030> there's<00:01:41.960> a<00:01:41.990> little<00:01:42.109> bit<00:01:42.289> of

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
hopping process there's a little bit of

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:43.629 
hopping process there's a little bit of
the<00:01:42.469> yeast<00:01:42.679> that<00:01:42.770> comes<00:01:43.039> into<00:01:43.249> play<00:01:43.429> although

00:01:43.629 --> 00:01:43.639 
the yeast that comes into play although

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:45.580 
the yeast that comes into play although
again<00:01:43.969> we<00:01:44.119> we've<00:01:44.420> kind<00:01:44.960> of<00:01:44.990> restrained<00:01:45.409> that

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
again we we've kind of restrained that

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.440 
again we we've kind of restrained that
and<00:01:45.770> tempered<00:01:46.369> it<00:01:46.460> a<00:01:46.490> little<00:01:46.639> bit<00:01:46.850> on<00:01:47.030> the

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
and tempered it a little bit on the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.139 
and tempered it a little bit on the
flavor<00:01:47.719> level<00:01:48.139> this<00:01:48.289> beer<00:01:48.530> has<00:01:48.560> a<00:01:48.770> ton<00:01:49.310> of<00:01:49.340> hot

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
flavor level this beer has a ton of hot

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.120 
flavor level this beer has a ton of hot
bite<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.689> it<00:01:50.719> and<00:01:50.990> very<00:01:51.469> little<00:01:51.619> residual

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
bite to it and very little residual

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.620 
bite to it and very little residual
sugars<00:01:52.520> so<00:01:52.670> what<00:01:52.850> we've<00:01:52.969> got<00:01:52.999> is<00:01:53.179> a<00:01:53.359> very

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
sugars so what we've got is a very

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.319 
sugars so what we've got is a very
smashingly<00:01:54.590> drinkable<00:01:55.100> pale<00:01:55.340> ale<00:01:55.549> style<00:01:55.909> beer

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
smashingly drinkable pale ale style beer

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.660 
smashingly drinkable pale ale style beer
with<00:01:57.049> not<00:01:57.259> a<00:01:57.289> lot<00:01:57.499> of<00:01:57.649> residual<00:01:58.039> sugar<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.520> so

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
with not a lot of residual sugar and so

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.160 
with not a lot of residual sugar and so
this<00:01:59.149> is<00:01:59.329> just<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.600> very<00:01:59.630> effervescent

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
this is just a very effervescent

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.469 
this is just a very effervescent
bone-dry<00:02:00.920> beer<00:02:03.789> with<00:02:04.789> hops<00:02:05.029> doing<00:02:05.359> the

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
bone-dry beer with hops doing the

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.510 
bone-dry beer with hops doing the
majority<00:02:05.600> of<00:02:05.929> the<00:02:06.049> flavoring<00:02:06.499> devotion<00:02:07.340> being

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
majority of the flavoring devotion being

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.370 
majority of the flavoring devotion being
such<00:02:07.789> a<00:02:07.819> hop<00:02:08.030> forward<00:02:08.270> beer<00:02:08.509> really<00:02:08.869> does<00:02:09.170> have

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
such a hop forward beer really does have

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.110 
such a hop forward beer really does have
a<00:02:09.429> contrasting<00:02:10.429> flavor<00:02:10.640> there's<00:02:10.850> not<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:10.970> lot

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
a contrasting flavor there's not a lot

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.510 
a contrasting flavor there's not a lot
of<00:02:11.209> things<00:02:11.330> in<00:02:11.600> hops<00:02:12.380> that<00:02:12.620> Mary<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:13.010> food<00:02:13.220> so

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
of things in hops that Mary to food so

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.490 
of things in hops that Mary to food so
devotion<00:02:14.209> as<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.360> food<00:02:14.630> pairing<00:02:14.930> beer<00:02:15.080> goes<00:02:15.290> is

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
devotion as a food pairing beer goes is

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.259 
devotion as a food pairing beer goes is
really<00:02:15.740> about<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.040> contrasting<00:02:16.520> flavor<00:02:16.790> if

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
really about the contrasting flavor if

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.220 
really about the contrasting flavor if
you<00:02:17.360> choose<00:02:17.569> to<00:02:17.689> leave<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:17.930> out<00:02:18.019> of<00:02:18.140> the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
you choose to leave it out of the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.990 
you choose to leave it out of the
pairings<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:19.040> be<00:02:19.189> it<00:02:19.280> enjoy<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.760> bureau<00:02:19.939> on
