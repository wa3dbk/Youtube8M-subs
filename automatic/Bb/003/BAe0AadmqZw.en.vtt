00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.400
 I'm actually embarrassed 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.100
 how simple the New Approach is, 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.100
 but it is not, it is letting go 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.300
 safety at the whole event 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.700
 that's what's hard 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.200
 that's what's hard 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.600
 because we want to feel safe 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.500
 and that is stronger than I can put into words 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.100
 and the only thing I can say 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.700
 is that if you do these things every morning 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.300
 put it in order, 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.100
 perfectly in order, 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.400
 that will take you around half an hour 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.500
 that's all 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.400
 and then you play as you always play. 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.000
 Many people come to me from abroad 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.000
 and I cannot change their lives 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.800
 with a series of 6 or 12 lessons. 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.000
 I can show them how to get started with themselves 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.300
 how to proceed yourself 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.700
 and that helps 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.400
 so that they can teach themselves further 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.700
 instead of trying to change. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.200
 The tendency is ... 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.900
 OK, here's the violin 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.300
 to turn it over 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.000
 to play, and turn this in, 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.900
 and twist it over it 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.900
 If you do that, 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.200
 I can't even get a hold of it. 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.100
 If you have a giving hand, 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.600
 and gives ... plays as ... 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.400
 just open, 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.700
 make it soft, soft 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.500
 No, we are not going to play the violin ... 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.900
 Do you see that? 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.800
 These are intervals 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 If you do this, you have no intervals. 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.200
 The result is that you lose the meaning of the intervals 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.900
 you look at the music and you see notes 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.200
 and that's why you don't hear the music, 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.000
 therefore you cannot get to the composer. 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.000
 You have to invent with your fingers 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.000
 what the composer says, 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200
 because we are not free, 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.200
 because we want to do it with the stick. 

00:01:38.235 --> 00:01:39.500
 Can I have your hand? 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.300
 See, this is the tendency, yes 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.800
 and what you want to do is open it, 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.000
 Look, if you do this, I can't get a hold of it, 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.400
 if we do that, 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 just open, 

00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:56.500
 forget playing the violin ok 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.700
 and make it soft, soft 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.900
 (she blows on the hand) 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.702
 soften it 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.100
 In general, 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.700
 can you imagine that 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.300
 a very small creature 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.099
 in the middle of your hand 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.500
 and you have to keep it warm. 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.000
 Children love it, 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.200
 Keep it warm, 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.500
 not with the fingers, with the hand, 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.900
 manual 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.400
 and keep it soft here 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.400
 OK 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Yes, that's the tendency 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.800
 and then my fingers can't, 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.000
 open it up 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.800
 Thank you 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.800
 That's how it is 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.600
 You could play in three positions at the same time 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.900
 OK 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.700
 make it soft and love it, okay? 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.100
 Thank you 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.700
 Do you want to try it? 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.000
 That's difficult, 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.700
 and this is easy. 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.700
 and ... nice and soft here 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.800
 Yes, 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.900
 yes, and the violin weighs nothing 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.700
 and we just go .... swing those intervals 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.200
 as you see, that's it. 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.000
 And you only have three intervals 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.500
 Do you know what an interval is? 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.500
 Yes 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.200
 Did you learn that? 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.000
 It is the space between two notes 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.800
 and you only have ... 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.000
 you should know this 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.900
 that you only have three intervals in your hand 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.700
 only three intervals in your whole hand. 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.500
 And make it so .. 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.500
 If you look at the music 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.200
 do you see a lot of fingers, 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.800
 new fingers, new notes you've never seen before 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.800
 but actually it's only three intervals in your hand. 

00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:43.300
 So you go nuts 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.000
 instead of on top 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.300
 and you connect them together. 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.900
 What are the three intervals, please? 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.700
 What are the three intervals, please? 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 You know, that's what I call them, 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.600
 What are the notes in C major? 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.000
 on the g string? 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.900
 What are the names? 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.500
 GABCD 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.400
 Thank you. 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.300
 What you say, GABCD 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.500
 forget the G, because that is a loose string 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.200
 but the rest .... can you say ABCD? 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.100
 ABCD 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.800
 And you can now throw out your hand 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.000
 in the form of ABCD? 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.100
 That's right. 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.600
 So, that is a whole distance, a half distance and a whole distance, three intervals 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.000
 make soft, soft 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.300
 if so 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.800
 If I say now, G ... 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.400
 A major, sixth position, g string 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.100
 ... the thumb doesn't work 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.100
 stuck 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.700
 in any case you are now aware of it .... 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.800
 Are you following me? 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.700
 This is how you teach a beginner 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.100
 to have musical knowledge in hand 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.700
 and not only the first finger is the a, 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.800
 the second finger is the ... 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.000
 first, second and you don't even say the names of the notes 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.700
 first, second, third, fourth finger 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.500
 and that has nothing to do with music, rhythm .. 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.700
 or with the meaning of the space between the notes, 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.200
 the important meaning, musical meaning, 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.500
 because the music happens between the notes. 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.000
 Clearly? Yes 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.100
 In space, in swinging intervals 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.400
 and if the fingers can't do that, 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.300
 then it gets in your way 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.700
 and it is that simple.
