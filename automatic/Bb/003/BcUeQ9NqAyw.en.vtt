play<00:00:47.340> this<00:00:47.640> piano<00:00:47.850> because<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.629> key<00:00:48.809> noises

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
play this piano because the key noises

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.850 
play this piano because the key noises
are<00:00:49.350> really<00:00:49.640> loud<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.059> annoying<00:00:51.770> with<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
default settings so disable the keys by

we're going to do is to remove the pedal
noise<00:01:02.520> as<00:01:02.760> well<00:01:02.969> because<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.510> pedal<00:01:03.780> noise<00:01:03.899> is

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110

we're<00:02:06.869> going<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.320> now<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.160> change

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
we're going to do now is to change

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.800 
we're going to do now is to change
the<00:02:11.020> way<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.620> keys<00:02:12.120> feel<00:02:13.120> when<00:02:13.330> you<00:02:13.450> play<00:02:13.660> them

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
the way the keys feel when you play them

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.470 
the way the keys feel when you play them
so<00:02:14.190> with<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.310> standard<00:02:15.700> setting<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.180> doesn't

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
so with the standard setting it doesn't

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.810 
so with the standard setting it doesn't
feel<00:02:16.600> like<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:17.350> real<00:02:17.950> piano<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:18.460> we're<00:02:18.610> going<00:02:18.730> to

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
feel like a real piano so we're going to

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.030 
feel like a real piano so we're going to
change<00:02:19.210> them<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:19.630> make<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.930> feel<00:02:20.140> much<00:02:20.830> more

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
change them and make it feel much more

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.430 
change them and make it feel much more
like<00:02:21.100> a<00:02:21.310> real<00:02:21.550> piano<00:02:21.820> so<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.720> first<00:02:22.960> thing<00:02:23.260> I'm

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
like a real piano so the first thing I'm

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.160 
like a real piano so the first thing I'm
going<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.710> do<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.700> to<00:02:25.270> change<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.990> volume

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
going to do is to change the volume

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.710 
going to do is to change the volume
modulation<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.130> under<00:02:27.850> control<00:02:28.240> I'm<00:02:28.540> going

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
modulation and under control I'm going

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.520 
modulation and under control I'm going
to<00:02:28.900> set<00:02:29.140> select<00:02:29.980> velocity<00:02:30.520> oh<00:02:31.230> just<00:02:32.230> before<00:02:32.500> I

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
to set select velocity oh just before I

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.260 
to set select velocity oh just before I
do<00:02:32.590> that<00:02:32.710> one<00:02:33.220> important<00:02:33.700> thing<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.850> have<00:02:34.090> to

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
do that one important thing you have to

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.780 
do that one important thing you have to
change<00:02:34.900> this<00:02:35.230> again<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.740> all<00:02:35.920> regions<00:02:36.550> and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
change this again to all regions and

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.570 
change this again to all regions and
then<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:37.630> have<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.930> click<00:02:38.560> here<00:02:38.980> down<00:02:39.220> here<00:02:39.250> on

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
then you have to click here down here on

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.750 
then you have to click here down here on
one<00:02:39.930> just<00:02:40.930> one<00:02:41.110> of<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.320> keys<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.610> select<00:02:42.610> one

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
one just one of the keys to select one

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.440 
one just one of the keys to select one
of<00:02:42.790> them<00:02:45.360> now<00:02:46.360> that<00:02:46.750> we<00:02:47.050> have<00:02:47.260> selected<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:48.880> key

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
of them now that we have selected a key

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.270 
of them now that we have selected a key
down<00:02:49.630> here<00:02:49.690> we're<00:02:50.050> going<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.260> change<00:02:50.680> the

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
down here we're going to change the

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.300 
down here we're going to change the
controller<00:02:52.350> velocity<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:53.650> we're<00:02:53.980> going<00:02:54.190> to

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
controller velocity and we're going to

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.030 
controller velocity and we're going to
change<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.850> velocity<00:02:54.970> curve<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:56.290> linear<00:02:56.740> and

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
change the velocity curve to linear and

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.810 
change the velocity curve to linear and
then<00:02:57.880> we're<00:02:58.060> going<00:02:58.270> to<00:02:59.520> change<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:00.670> velocity

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
then we're going to change the velocity

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.400 
then we're going to change the velocity
range<00:03:01.770> to<00:03:02.770> high<00:03:03.209> doing<00:03:04.209> these<00:03:04.390> three<00:03:05.110> things

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
range to high doing these three things

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.010 
range to high doing these three things
makes<00:03:05.830> the<00:03:06.130> keys<00:03:06.370> much<00:03:06.760> more<00:03:07.180> responsive<00:03:07.900> and

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
makes the keys much more responsive and

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.530 
makes the keys much more responsive and
seem<00:03:08.680> much<00:03:08.860> more<00:03:09.130> like<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.520> real<00:03:10.650> piano<00:03:12.540> one

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
seem much more like a real piano one

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.470 
seem much more like a real piano one
thing<00:03:13.870> we<00:03:14.050> also<00:03:14.260> have<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.650> change<00:03:14.950> is<00:03:15.480> the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
thing we also have to change is the

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.979 
thing we also have to change is the
filter<00:03:16.959> so<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.350> click<00:03:17.800> down<00:03:18.040> here<00:03:18.070> on<00:03:18.989> filter

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
filter so you click down here on filter

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.940 
filter so you click down here on filter
and<00:03:20.310> then<00:03:21.310> as<00:03:21.580> you<00:03:22.330> can<00:03:22.450> see<00:03:22.510> we<00:03:22.870> have<00:03:23.050> a<00:03:23.380> type

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
and then as you can see we have a type

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.699 
and then as you can see we have a type
of<00:03:24.400> filter<00:03:25.330> called<00:03:25.480> low-pass<00:03:25.870> here<00:03:26.170> when<00:03:26.620> you

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
of filter called low-pass here when you

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.520 
of filter called low-pass here when you
play<00:03:26.890> in<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:28.030> low<00:03:28.209> velocity<00:03:28.780> range<00:03:29.019> this

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
play in the low velocity range this

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.740 
play in the low velocity range this
low-pass<00:03:30.040> filter<00:03:30.459> is<00:03:30.489> used<00:03:30.820> but<00:03:31.480> when<00:03:31.630> you

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
low-pass filter is used but when you

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.199 
low-pass filter is used but when you
play<00:03:31.930> in<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.080> middle<00:03:32.380> range<00:03:32.670> no<00:03:33.670> filter<00:03:34.090> is

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
play in the middle range no filter is

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.180 
play in the middle range no filter is
used<00:03:34.420> this<00:03:35.110> we're<00:03:35.290> going<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.590> change<00:03:35.920> the

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
used this we're going to change the

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.670 
used this we're going to change the
low-pass<00:03:36.519> so<00:03:36.940> now<00:03:37.180> that<00:03:37.420> you<00:03:37.540> play<00:03:37.750> soft<00:03:38.380> and

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
low-pass so now that you play soft and

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.680 
low-pass so now that you play soft and
you<00:03:38.769> play<00:03:39.010> harder<00:03:41.130> we<00:03:42.130> use<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.670> same<00:03:42.940> filter

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
you play harder we use the same filter

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.670 
you play harder we use the same filter
so<00:03:43.930> the<00:03:44.260> notes<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:46.690> tones<00:03:46.989> actually

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
so the notes and the tones actually

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.410 
so the notes and the tones actually
sound<00:03:48.390> more<00:03:49.390> alike<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:51.280> my<00:03:51.489> ears<00:03:52.090> much

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
sound more alike and to my ears much

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.670 
sound more alike and to my ears much
better<00:03:53.459> so<00:03:54.459> just<00:03:54.820> change<00:03:55.570> this<00:03:55.810> to<00:03:55.870> low-pass

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
better so just change this to low-pass

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.590 
better so just change this to low-pass
and<00:03:56.739> you<00:03:57.010> will<00:03:57.130> have<00:03:57.250> a<00:03:57.280> better<00:03:57.519> ki<00:03:58.450> sound<00:04:00.600> now

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
and you will have a better ki sound now

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.199 
and you will have a better ki sound now
we're<00:04:01.840> going<00:04:01.989> to<00:04:02.230> make<00:04:02.830> a<00:04:02.860> little<00:04:03.100> change<00:04:03.820> up

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
we're going to make a little change up

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.320 
we're going to make a little change up
here<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:04.690> giga<00:04:05.620> pulse<00:04:05.920> will<00:04:06.519> also<00:04:06.760> click<00:04:06.940> Giga

way to the left the reason you want to

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.890 
way to the left the reason you want to
do<00:04:18.130> this<00:04:18.310> is<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:18.760> make<00:04:18.789> the<00:04:19.090> piano<00:04:19.330> seem<00:04:19.599> closer

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
do this is to make the piano seem closer

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.090 
do this is to make the piano seem closer
to<00:04:20.140> you

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
to you

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.870 
to you
and<00:04:21.610> also<00:04:22.270> it<00:04:22.540> removes<00:04:22.930> a<00:04:23.620> little<00:04:24.580> bit<00:04:24.730> of

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
and also it removes a little bit of

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.760 
and also it removes a little bit of
pedal<00:04:25.240> noise<00:04:25.420> that<00:04:25.930> is<00:04:26.050> still<00:04:26.320> there<00:04:26.560> even

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
pedal noise that is still there even

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.680 
pedal noise that is still there even
though<00:04:27.160> we<00:04:27.310> have<00:04:27.490> turned<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:27.970> volume<00:04:28.120> all<00:04:28.510> the

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
though we have turned the volume all the

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.340 
though we have turned the volume all the
way<00:04:28.780> down<00:04:28.990> I<00:04:29.200> don't<00:04:29.740> know<00:04:29.800> why<00:04:29.980> this<00:04:30.250> sound

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
way down I don't know why this sound

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.380 
way down I don't know why this sound
still<00:04:32.350> comes<00:04:32.680> but<00:04:33.010> anyway<00:04:33.730> when<00:04:34.000> you<00:04:34.090> turn<00:04:34.300> the

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
still comes but anyway when you turn the

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.600 
still comes but anyway when you turn the
wet/dry<00:04:34.780> mix<00:04:35.020> down<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.920> piano<00:04:36.190> sounds<00:04:36.430> better

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
wet/dry mix down the piano sounds better

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.190 
wet/dry mix down the piano sounds better
and<00:04:36.880> these<00:04:38.040> sounds<00:04:39.040> pedal<00:04:39.760> noises<00:04:40.200> disappears

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
and these sounds pedal noises disappears

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.360 
and these sounds pedal noises disappears
disappears<00:04:42.100> over<00:04:42.700> well<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:44.380> last<00:04:44.560> thing

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
disappears over well the last thing

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.660 
disappears over well the last thing
we're<00:04:45.610> going<00:04:45.790> to<00:04:45.880> do<00:04:46.210> is<00:04:46.540> to<00:04:47.140> add<00:04:47.380> some<00:04:47.670> click

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
we're going to do is to add some click

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.790 
we're going to do is to add some click
on<00:04:48.790> FX<00:04:49.270> and<00:04:49.480> then<00:04:49.930> we're<00:04:50.110> going<00:04:50.320> to<00:04:50.380> add<00:04:50.590> some

and<00:04:59.380> I<00:04:59.530> also<00:04:59.710> like<00:05:00.010> to<00:05:00.190> turn<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:00.670> decay<00:05:01.630> down<00:05:02.410> a

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
and I also like to turn the decay down a

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.690 
and I also like to turn the decay down a
little<00:05:02.740> bit<00:05:03.090> also<00:05:04.090> I<00:05:04.510> like<00:05:04.720> to<00:05:05.310> change<00:05:06.310> this

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
little bit also I like to change this

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.390 
little bit also I like to change this

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
not dry and turn it up a little bit

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.940 
not dry and turn it up a little bit
again<00:05:10.390> to<00:05:10.660> make<00:05:11.100> the<00:05:12.100> piano<00:05:13.440> seem<00:05:14.440> closer<00:05:14.710> to

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
again to make the piano seem closer to

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.780 
again to make the piano seem closer to
you<00:05:15.990> before<00:05:16.990> you<00:05:17.080> play<00:05:17.950> you<00:05:18.010> just<00:05:18.160> have<00:05:18.520> to

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 
you before you play you just have to

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.660 
you before you play you just have to
turn<00:05:19.720> the<00:05:19.930> overall<00:05:20.350> volume<00:05:20.860> down<00:05:21.220> so<00:05:21.610> you

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
turn the overall volume down so you

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.150 
turn the overall volume down so you
click<00:05:21.850> on<00:05:21.970> MIDI<00:05:22.180> mixer<00:05:22.480> and<00:05:22.690> turn<00:05:23.650> the<00:05:23.800> overall

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
click on MIDI mixer and turn the overall

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.220 
click on MIDI mixer and turn the overall
ball<00:05:24.340> your<00:05:24.520> volume<00:05:25.150> down<00:05:25.360> because<00:05:25.600> we<00:05:25.960> change

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
ball your volume down because we change

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.840 
ball your volume down because we change
the<00:05:26.410> velocity<00:05:26.530> range<00:05:27.130> so<00:05:27.340> when<00:05:27.460> you<00:05:27.550> play<00:05:27.730> the

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
the velocity range so when you play the

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.970 
the velocity range so when you play the
keys<00:05:28.090> they're<00:05:28.360> going<00:05:28.540> to<00:05:28.660> be<00:05:28.780> really<00:05:28.990> loud<00:05:29.380> if

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
keys they're going to be really loud if

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.620 
keys they're going to be really loud if
you<00:05:30.190> don't<00:05:30.370> change<00:05:30.610> this<00:05:30.910> so<00:05:31.210> turn<00:05:31.480> the<00:05:31.600> volume

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
you don't change this so turn the volume

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.730 
you don't change this so turn the volume
down<00:05:31.900> to<00:05:32.260> a<00:05:32.290> fitting<00:05:33.220> level<00:05:33.610> and<00:05:34.270> that's

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
down to a fitting level and that's

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.620 
down to a fitting level and that's
basically<00:05:35.740> it<00:05:37.560> so<00:05:38.560> now<00:05:39.490> you<00:05:39.550> have<00:05:39.790> a<00:05:39.820> really

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
basically it so now you have a really

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.520 
basically it so now you have a really
nice<00:05:41.340> sounding<00:05:42.340> grand<00:05:43.270> piano<00:05:43.570> and<00:05:43.780> for

and take care I'm just going to play

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.140 
and take care I'm just going to play
around<00:05:50.230> a<00:05:50.560> little<00:05:50.800> bit<00:05:50.980> so<00:05:51.160> you<00:05:51.250> can<00:05:51.310> hear<00:05:51.970> what

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150

this plug-in actually sounds like when

this plug-in actually sounds like when
