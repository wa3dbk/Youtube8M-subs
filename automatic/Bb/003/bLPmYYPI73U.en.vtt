00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.499 
put some signs on these pistons and
you'll<00:01:21.240> see<00:01:21.450> why<00:01:21.630> in<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.780> moment<00:01:22.369> is<00:01:23.369> as<00:01:23.939> well<00:01:24.330> as

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
you'll see why in a moment is as well as

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.219 
you'll see why in a moment is as well as
you<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:24.990> tell<00:01:26.270> sand<00:01:27.270> or<00:01:27.479> gravel<00:01:27.720> will<00:01:28.049> not

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
you can tell sand or gravel will not

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.249 
you can tell sand or gravel will not
stay<00:01:28.710> on<00:01:29.329> Finn<00:01:30.329> app<00:01:30.479> well<00:01:30.659> they<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.990> there's<00:01:31.200> a

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
stay on Finn app well they can there's a

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.870 
stay on Finn app well they can there's a
glitch<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.650> do<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.369> will<00:01:32.549> be<00:01:32.579> saw

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
glitch to do that but that will be saw

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.679 
glitch to do that but that will be saw
it<00:01:33.030> eventually<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:34.700> we're<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:35.880> gonna<00:01:36.030> place

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
it eventually and we're just gonna place

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.480 
it eventually and we're just gonna place
a<00:01:36.720> layer<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.200> gravel<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:37.680> here<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.009> easier<00:01:38.369> to

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
a layer of gravel on here it's easier to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.460 
a layer of gravel on here it's easier to
see<00:01:38.700> than<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.270> Sun<00:01:39.479> dye<00:01:39.630> used<00:01:39.810> for<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.350> it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
see than the Sun dye used for this is it

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.740 
see than the Sun dye used for this is it
still<00:01:40.710> going<00:01:41.180> yeah<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.329> going<00:01:42.570> for<00:01:42.689> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
build this in survival easily I used to

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.859 
build this in survival easily I used to
do<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.070> all<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.310> time<00:01:50.340> I've<00:01:50.970> got<00:01:51.360> silk<00:01:51.600> touch

I'm going to tell you how it works now
which<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.430> pretty<00:02:24.910> fun<00:02:25.300> is<00:02:27.030> these<00:02:28.030> pistons

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
which is pretty fun is these pistons

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.200 
which is pretty fun is these pistons
pull<00:02:28.840> back<00:02:29.190> when<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.430> turn<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.700> lava<00:02:30.970> off

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
pull back when you turn the lava off

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.230 
pull back when you turn the lava off
which<00:02:31.990> will<00:02:32.140> be<00:02:32.260> pulling<00:02:32.530> lava<00:02:32.740> and<00:02:33.090> when<00:02:34.090> they

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
which will be pulling lava and when they

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.450 
which will be pulling lava and when they
pull<00:02:34.480> back<00:02:34.720> all<00:02:35.020> these<00:02:35.680> signs<00:02:35.980> are<00:02:36.190> dropped

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
pull back all these signs are dropped

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.310 
pull back all these signs are dropped
which<00:02:36.940> stops<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.450> gravel<00:02:37.840> from<00:02:37.960> being<00:02:38.200> held

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
which stops the gravel from being held

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.200 
which stops the gravel from being held
up<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.770> then<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.070> gravel<00:02:39.340> falls<00:02:39.640> onto<00:02:40.090> these

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
up and then the gravel falls onto these

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.830 
up and then the gravel falls onto these
cobwebs<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.380> cobwebs<00:02:42.240> not<00:02:43.240> only<00:02:43.570> slow

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
cobwebs and the cobwebs not only slow

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.450 
cobwebs and the cobwebs not only slow
down<00:02:44.020> players<00:02:44.380> when<00:02:44.680> they<00:02:44.710> fall<00:02:44.980> for<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:45.310> like

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
down players when they fall for it like

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.910 
down players when they fall for it like
so<00:02:45.760> but<00:02:46.360> they<00:02:46.450> can<00:02:46.600> also<00:02:46.720> slow<00:02:47.260> down<00:02:47.290> blocks

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
so but they can also slow down blocks

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.210 
so but they can also slow down blocks
that<00:02:48.220> fall<00:02:48.490> like<00:02:48.850> gravel<00:02:49.360> and<00:02:49.450> sand<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:50.220> also

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
that fall like gravel and sand and also

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.640 
that fall like gravel and sand and also
tea<00:02:51.400> but<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:52.180> would<00:02:52.450> not<00:02:52.660> recommend<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.410> build

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
tea but I would not recommend you build

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.620 
tea but I would not recommend you build
