00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.510
 what it does is sit next to a 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.970
 lawyer and see what it is that makes your day 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.410
 to day what is it that has to be 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.270
 face each day that is a 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.710
 unique opportunity to see how we 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.420
 the real world works that is never 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.940
 enough to see as lawyers 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.280
 working day to day having new 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.170
 customers to the minute and have to give 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.940
 papers at the last minute because we are going to 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.870
 see how the dispatch works 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.360
 relationship with partners with schedules 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.620
 when they go to trial other kinds of things 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.180
 are the doubts that we have the most when 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.000
 this motion of law will be the lawyer 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.680
 as a very serious person who puts well 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.120
 like a lot of respect but then you get to 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.790
 the departments and you see that they help 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.989
 much among all that are very human what 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.909
 What is better for me this week is the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.670
 fellowship that within cuatrecasas 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:08.100
 the good roll inside that there is no say 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.970
 as that hierarchy imposed between what 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.939
 better the relationship between a partner and a 9 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.640
 and an associate I did not imagine how it was 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.260
 be a lawyer 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.610
 and see how the lawyers worked is 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.940
 that I did not imagine a thing like you 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.100
 he says before studying him read study and 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.390
 another thing is how practical it is in 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.190
 reality what is important right now 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.190
 being a second year without the proposal the 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.930
 true the possibility of exercising as 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.890
 lawyer in four house and play in a 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.890
 great office in general 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.460
 the main idea was mainly that 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.410
 they could compare the work dynamics 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.390
 our every day how do you 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.859
 distribute the work a little what kind 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.689
 of 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:53.159
 inconveniences or the unforeseen can be 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.689
 find also in the day to day I 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.569
 I think they have come one step further 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.579
 tried to get involved in even outside of 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.549
 general form or roughly in 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.409
 understand what we were doing the 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.110
 tasks that we carried out and the 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.450
 work processes within the office 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.970
 of view that were eager to 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.590
 they were very determined to exercise 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.170
 law they knew to be the 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.170
 I saw them as his very active 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.620
 for the students it is a very 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.660
 good academically and it's also a 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.360
 attractive and funny experience 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.340
 interesting that they also do 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.630
 beginning the first part of their 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.140
 studies that is very good because they 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.050
 serves for the second cycle of the program 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.160
 that they know better what life is like in 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.240
 an office that sees us acting outside of 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.760
 what is the scope strictly 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.860
 academic and have a 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.420
 more contact with real life and in the 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.400
 real service and at the same time to 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.610
 we allow ourselves to be very close to the 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.720
 spectacular experience talent e 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.560
 unbeatable surprisingly enriching 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.690
 unforgettable to me it seems a 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.300
 very valuable experience is a 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.700
 unique opportunity has also seemed to me 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.960
 a very practical experience and for 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.390
 last very real 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:19.410
 Of course interesting 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.640
 very innovative and in a way also 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.640
 Indicative for a future
