00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.560
 all and welcome to this first 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.650
 episode of calm chaos in which I will speak 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.980
 of rat man hundred 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.950
 I have always pressed rat man 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.290
 but I abandoned him at number 80 later 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.750
 having read almost all of them 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.000
 numbers from the first to those in which 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.580
 It well known in the series may be of interest 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.800
 to the New York superheroes that I was not 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.470
 liked and therefore a decided in fact 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.900
 troncarelli for the last ones lately 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.229
 times just beginning of the sad le 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.400
 ears to try to recover 

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:46.530
 start to start over 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.850
 this series that really had at the time 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.070
 much 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.690
 when I found out he approached the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.879
 number 100 said oh well let's start with the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.900
 center I bought I bought the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.970
 sincerely also with the expectation 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:03.000
 quite high because the number 100.1 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.309
 important in the rat iconography 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.770
 man and sum according to what has been 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.619
 declared by the gardeners already from the den 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.470
 a long time ago and a book that is mine 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.650
 opinion believe it has perhaps the best 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:21.270
 book of rat man that I have ever read 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:23.520
 because because it is released it is explained by 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.530
 all that was man lingering 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.240
 on the author is not a book on 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.600
 character of rhythm but on the character 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.660
 of leo ortolani we can say so though 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.000
 character is not very much is right 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.650
 let's say that on the person of the gardeners 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.650
 because here it shows itself in all his 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.180
 humanity all its insecurities yes 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.520
 lays bare with its readers like 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.040
 it had never been done before 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.430
 many times there is in the other rat books 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.520
 man 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.970
 there was the ortolani character who entered 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.560
 in the story here is the person gardeners 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.240
 it is certain it is a humorous comic must do 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.210
 laugh and when needed 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.470
 it makes you laugh but this is certainly not the first 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.659
 feature I would indicate as 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.420
 reason for the purchase of the register that belongs to me 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.700
 opinion is really recommended 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.220
 because the little pearl a friend has it 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.790
 that explores the relationship between the gardeners 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:19.739
 his creature bertolani and rat man ma 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:22.379
 also expanding the concept of the exams 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.569
 in the relationship between it 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.180
 writer 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:30.159
 and the author's story is precisely his 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.900
 creature a strange relationship relationship 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:35.239
 beautiful but in some ways terrible 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.359
 present difficult verses but of course 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.879
 also interesting in exciting 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:42.739
 let's say this number 100 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.909
 clearly the number 100 does not end 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.290
 rat man but will continue I already have it already 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:50.120
 provided to put it in the box in the 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.260
 comics 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.900
 and as if it were a pause to reflect 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.159
 at mid-way, catch your breath ea 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.909
 reflect on the road you are already on 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:04.909
 done halfway maybe looking at the 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:06.500
 in short and being satisfied with the 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.560
 goal is reached there 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.180
 but then watching immediately after the workpiece in 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.319
 road that we still need to do to 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.659
 get to the summit 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.010
 we really say a nice number I do it 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.480
 I highly recommend it to everyone because if 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.230
 one is this is really a small one 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.379
 pearl 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.269
 these are these things they give 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.269
 dignity precisely to the Italian comic strip 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:29.750
 according to me I recently just read 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.939
 a story of gipi beautiful and this 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.319
 rasman folks in short are both 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.000
 two things that do well otherwise 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.329
 Italian performance needs these 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.489
 what's this 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:39.769
 so this first day of calm chaos 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.609
 end here let me know what 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:47.259
 think of rasman hundred and purse 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.259
 next video hello everyone
