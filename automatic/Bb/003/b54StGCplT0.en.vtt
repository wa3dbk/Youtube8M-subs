00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
upgrade and as you can see when we open

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.459 
upgrade and as you can see when we open
it<00:01:24.369> up<00:01:24.490> it<00:01:24.700> has<00:01:24.999> the<00:01:25.149> double<00:01:25.509> walled<00:01:25.719> GV<00:01:26.170> design

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
with the gasket so that means it's

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.480 
with the gasket so that means it's
waterproof<00:01:28.270> weatherproof<00:01:28.959> dust<00:01:29.829> proof<00:01:30.069> so

you really have two points of connection

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.830 
you really have two points of connection
here<00:03:00.550> so<00:03:00.700> it's<00:03:01.090> going<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.239> snap<00:03:01.480> in<00:03:01.660> on<00:03:01.750> the

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
here so it's going to snap in on the

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.020 
here so it's going to snap in on the
back<00:03:01.989> two<00:03:02.260> points<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.950> mono<00:03:03.190> key<00:03:03.459> system<00:03:03.850> has

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
back two points the mono key system has

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.340 
back two points the mono key system has
three<00:03:04.060> so<00:03:04.510> that's<00:03:04.630> another<00:03:04.930> key<00:03:05.200> difference

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
three so that's another key difference

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.110 
three so that's another key difference
so<00:03:05.920> here's<00:03:06.160> your<00:03:06.280> plate<00:03:06.519> here's<00:03:06.970> your

going to have the locking mechanism
there<00:03:48.160> and<00:03:48.340> then<00:03:48.610> I'll<00:03:48.700> show<00:03:48.880> you<00:03:48.940> if<00:03:49.120> this<00:03:49.209> was

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
there and then I'll show you if this was

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.030 
there and then I'll show you if this was
on<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.600> bike<00:03:49.780> right<00:03:49.989> now<00:03:50.019> this<00:03:50.560> is<00:03:50.680> how<00:03:50.799> easy

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
on the bike right now this is how easy

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.069 
on the bike right now this is how easy
it<00:03:51.160> is<00:03:51.250> to<00:03:51.489> take<00:03:51.640> on<00:03:51.850> and<00:03:52.000> off<00:03:52.090> so<00:03:52.810> it's<00:03:52.930> two

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
it is to take on and off so it's two

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:54.930 
it is to take on and off so it's two
points<00:03:53.350> of<00:03:53.440> connection<00:03:53.680> I'd<00:03:54.280> slide<00:03:54.640> it<00:03:54.790> in<00:03:54.850> the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
points of connection I'd slide it in the

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.060 
points of connection I'd slide it in the
back<00:03:55.120> I'd<00:03:55.810> snap<00:03:56.140> down<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:56.680> there<00:03:56.829> you<00:03:56.890> go<00:03:56.980> if

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
back I'd snap down and there you go if

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.440 
back I'd snap down and there you go if
that<00:03:57.190> was<00:03:57.310> connected<00:03:57.640> to<00:03:57.700> my<00:03:57.790> bike<00:03:57.970> it's<00:03:58.239> as

that was connected to my bike it's as

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.240 
that was connected to my bike it's as
simple<00:03:58.570> as<00:03:58.810> that<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.230> then<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.680> uninstall<00:04:00.010> it

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
simple as that and then to uninstall it

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.710 
simple as that and then to uninstall it
I<00:04:00.459> make<00:04:00.700> sure<00:04:00.850> this<00:04:00.970> guy<00:04:01.120> was<00:04:01.299> in<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.450> open

I make sure this guy was in the open
position<00:04:01.859> snap<00:04:02.859> it<00:04:03.040> up<00:04:03.269> pull<00:04:04.269> it<00:04:04.299> off<00:04:04.480> and<00:04:04.750> I'd

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
position snap it up pull it off and I'd

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.300
