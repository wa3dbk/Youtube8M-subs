00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
think about before building a deck like

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.940 
think about before building a deck like
this<00:00:06.839> one<00:00:07.440> on<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:08.640> ground<00:00:08.970> or<00:00:09.680> near<00:00:10.680> the

of<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.660> deck<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.560> seen<00:00:28.860> the<00:00:29.160> one<00:00:29.610> side<00:00:29.910> now<00:00:30.180> we

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
of the deck you seen the one side now we

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.930 
of the deck you seen the one side now we
are<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.780> opposite<00:00:31.500> side<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.790> would

are on the opposite side and I would

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.880 
are on the opposite side and I would
like<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.270> point<00:00:33.480> out<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.200> looks<00:00:34.560> like

this deck was built on top of a concrete
sidewalk<00:00:38.239> look<00:00:39.239> like<00:00:39.420> they<00:00:39.570> might<00:00:39.750> have<00:00:39.810> had

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
sidewalk look like they might have had

some plants maybe on the other side even
a<00:00:42.600> drain<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.290> look<00:00:43.440> at<00:00:43.530> where<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.890> leaves

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
a drain if you look at where the leaves

a drain if you look at where the leaves
are<00:00:44.430> accumulating<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.540> the<00:00:45.690> right<00:00:46.610> corner<00:00:47.610> of

that<00:00:49.620> kind<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.860> good<00:00:50.040> looks<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.579> might

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
that kind of good looks like that might

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.200 
that kind of good looks like that might
be<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.970> drain<00:00:51.420> there<00:00:51.960> drawing<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.670> leaves

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
be a drain there drawing the the leaves

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.910 
be a drain there drawing the the leaves
in<00:00:54.540> but<00:00:54.750> again<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.200> could<00:00:55.350> could<00:00:55.800> be

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
in but again that could could be

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.190 
in but again that could could be
something<00:00:56.340> else<00:00:56.550> but<00:00:56.790> the<00:00:56.910> main<00:00:57.120> point<00:00:57.450> I'd

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
something else but the main point I'd

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.319 
something else but the main point I'd
like<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.070> see<00:00:59.280> here<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.790> we<00:01:00.120> do<00:01:00.300> have

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
like you to see here is that we do have

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.130 
like you to see here is that we do have
a<00:01:00.600> wood<00:01:01.260> deck<00:01:01.590> built<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.370> top<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:03.140> partially

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
a wood deck built on top of partially

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.669 
a wood deck built on top of partially
the<00:01:04.920> soil<00:01:05.429> or<00:01:05.789> the<00:01:05.850> ground<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.929> of<00:01:07.350> course<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:07.679 
the soil or the ground and of course the

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:11.239 
the soil or the ground and of course the
other<00:01:07.799> section<00:01:08.310> built<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.270> top<00:01:09.509> of<00:01:10.249> concrete

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:11.249 
other section built on top of concrete

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:14.359 
other section built on top of concrete
and<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.780> looks<00:01:12.959> like<00:01:13.109> we<00:01:13.259> have<00:01:13.439> about<00:01:13.619> between

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
and it looks like we have about between

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.830 
and it looks like we have about between
four<00:01:15.329> and<00:01:15.359> six<00:01:15.779> inches<00:01:16.289> of<00:01:16.469> ventilation<00:01:17.310> here

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
four and six inches of ventilation here

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.599 
four and six inches of ventilation here
the<00:01:18.840> black<00:01:19.020> arrow<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.409> pointing<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.340> spot

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:20.609 
the black arrow is pointing to the spot

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:21.769 
the black arrow is pointing to the spot
where<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:20.969> looks<00:01:21.209> like<00:01:21.270> we're<00:01:21.509> getting<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:21.779 
where it looks like we're getting the

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:24.230 
where it looks like we're getting the
most<00:01:22.189> ventilation<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.429> would<00:01:23.700> be<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
most ventilation and would be the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.099 
most ventilation and would be the
largest<00:01:24.749> area<00:01:25.409> or<00:01:25.649> access<00:01:26.279> area<00:01:26.819> to<00:01:27.539> the<00:01:27.779> deck

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.109 
largest area or access area to the deck

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:30.949 
largest area or access area to the deck
which<00:01:29.069> would<00:01:29.279> also<00:01:29.459> provide<00:01:29.939> us<00:01:29.999> with<00:01:30.209> an<00:01:30.479> area

00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:30.959 
which would also provide us with an area

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:35.120 
which would also provide us with an area
that<00:01:32.389> let's<00:01:33.389> face<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.659> if<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.259> wind<00:01:34.590> blew

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
that let's face it if the wind blew

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.809 
that let's face it if the wind blew
towards<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.359> deck<00:01:36.599> from<00:01:36.959> this<00:01:37.380> side<00:01:37.679> we<00:01:38.520> could

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
towards the deck from this side we could

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:41.599 
towards the deck from this side we could
have<00:01:39.029> piles<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.810> leaves<00:01:40.020> under<00:01:40.529> here<00:01:40.889> wouldn't

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:41.609 
have piles of leaves under here wouldn't

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:42.949 
have piles of leaves under here wouldn't
be<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.759> bad<00:01:41.999> idea<00:01:42.029> if<00:01:42.539> you're<00:01:42.659> going<00:01:42.749> to<00:01:42.840> do

be a bad idea if you're going to do
something<00:01:43.380> like<00:01:43.529> that<00:01:43.590> like<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.090> screen

the<00:02:08.369> amount<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.850> debris<00:02:09.060> that's<00:02:09.479> going<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.810> go

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
the amount of debris that's going to go

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.440 
the amount of debris that's going to go
into<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.410> area<00:02:10.820> now<00:02:11.820> what<00:02:12.090> about<00:02:12.180> the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
into this area now what about the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.790 
into this area now what about the
ventilation<00:02:13.020> in<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.350> front

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
ventilation in the front

ventilation in the front
here<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.460> looks<00:02:14.730> like<00:02:14.840> we've<00:02:15.840> got<00:02:15.870> about<00:02:16.200> an

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
here it looks like we've got about an

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.980 
here it looks like we've got about an
inch<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.740> two<00:02:17.070> inches<00:02:17.670> which<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.690> good<00:02:18.960> thing

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
inch to two inches which is a good thing

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
dirt that's a good thing a bad thing is

enough shade to keep the area underneath
here<00:03:13.710> moist<00:03:14.130> if<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:15.000> live<00:03:15.240> in<00:03:15.600> that<00:03:15.840> kind<00:03:16.740> of

here moist if you live in that kind of
an<00:03:16.980> area<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:17.930> that<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.230> going<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.709> be<00:03:19.830> a<00:03:19.860> big

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
an area so that is going to be a big

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.850 
an area so that is going to be a big
thing<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.700> big<00:03:21.420> problem<00:03:21.930> so<00:03:22.290> we've<00:03:22.530> got<00:03:22.709> the

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
thing a big problem so we've got the

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.979 
thing a big problem so we've got the
ventilation<00:03:23.550> we've<00:03:24.209> got<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.510> debris<00:03:24.810> that's

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
ventilation we've got the debris that's

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.470 
ventilation we've got the debris that's
coming<00:03:25.410> out<00:03:25.590> underneath<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.300> or<00:03:27.300> the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
coming out underneath the or the

coming out underneath the or the
possible<00:03:28.020> debris<00:03:28.410> this<00:03:28.739> going<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.160> get

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
possible debris this going to get

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.460 
possible debris this going to get
trapped<00:03:30.090> underneath<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.720> deck<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.290> of

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
trapped underneath the deck and of

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.160 
trapped underneath the deck and of
course<00:03:32.510> another<00:03:33.510> problem<00:03:33.930> we<00:03:34.020> haven't

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
course another problem we haven't

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.770 
course another problem we haven't
mentioned<00:03:34.500> yet<00:03:34.920> is<00:03:34.950> removing<00:03:35.820> this<00:03:36.060> debris<00:03:36.450> if

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
mentioned yet is removing this debris if

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.479 
mentioned yet is removing this debris if
you<00:03:37.020> build<00:03:37.230> a<00:03:37.350> deck<00:03:37.560> on<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:37.920> ground<00:03:38.190> then

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
you build a deck on the ground then

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.340 
you build a deck on the ground then
you're<00:03:38.670> probably<00:03:39.030> not<00:03:39.450> going<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.870> be<00:03:40.080> able<00:03:40.230> to

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
you're probably not going to be able to

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.820 
you're probably not going to be able to
remove<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.770> debris<00:03:41.160> or<00:03:42.000> remove<00:03:42.720> enough<00:03:43.230> of<00:03:43.470> it

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
remove the debris or remove enough of it

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.510 
remove the debris or remove enough of it
over<00:03:44.340> time<00:03:44.670> causing<00:03:45.480> further<00:03:45.930> damage<00:03:46.250> dry<00:03:47.250> rot

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
over time causing further damage dry rot

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.690 
over time causing further damage dry rot
and<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:48.180> on<00:03:48.420> next<00:03:49.380> up<00:03:49.650> on<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.950> list<00:03:50.160> we<00:03:50.520> will

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
and so on next up on the list we will

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.570 
and so on next up on the list we will
take<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:50.970> look<00:03:51.209> at<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.660> step<00:03:52.050> here<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:52.800> if<00:03:53.370> you

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
take a look at the step here and if you

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.930 
take a look at the step here and if you
notice<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.930> step<00:03:55.260> is<00:03:55.500> next<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.980> a<00:03:56.010> concrete

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
notice the step is next to a concrete

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.090 
notice the step is next to a concrete
curb<00:03:57.270> or<00:03:57.600> it's<00:03:57.750> in<00:03:57.870> between<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:58.230> concrete<00:03:58.860> curb

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
curb or it's in between a concrete curb

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.449 
curb or it's in between a concrete curb
and<00:03:59.370> it<00:03:59.430> looks<00:03:59.640> like<00:03:59.820> a<00:03:59.850> black<00:04:00.330> plastic

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
and it looks like a black plastic

I've<00:04:34.169> got<00:04:34.409> a<00:04:34.440> good<00:04:34.680> idea<00:04:35.039> I'm<00:04:35.129> going<00:04:35.430> to<00:04:35.550> put<00:04:35.879> a

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
I've got a good idea I'm going to put a

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.210 
I've got a good idea I'm going to put a
I'm<00:04:37.080> going<00:04:37.229> to<00:04:37.319> put<00:04:37.500> this<00:04:37.590> up<00:04:37.800> against<00:04:38.190> the

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
I'm going to put this up against the

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.430 
I'm going to put this up against the

against another board or some plastic

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.700 
against another board or some plastic
and<00:04:42.419> you're<00:04:42.599> thinking<00:04:43.050> that<00:04:43.169> you're<00:04:43.349> going<00:04:43.530> to

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
and you're thinking that you're going to

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.619 
and you're thinking that you're going to
be<00:04:43.830> protecting<00:04:44.550> something<00:04:44.879> but<00:04:45.270> if<00:04:45.360> you<00:04:45.449> don't

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629 
be protecting something but if you don't

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:48.589 
be protecting something but if you don't
seal<00:04:46.020> that<00:04:46.289> area<00:04:46.800> off<00:04:47.150> then<00:04:48.150> you're<00:04:48.389> not

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
seal that area off then you're not

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:49.969 
seal that area off then you're not
you're<00:04:48.900> going<00:04:48.990> to<00:04:49.080> be<00:04:49.199> defeating<00:04:49.620> the<00:04:49.740> purpose

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
you're going to be defeating the purpose

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.309 
you're going to be defeating the purpose
and<00:04:50.759> a<00:04:50.940> lot<00:04:51.060> of<00:04:51.090> times<00:04:51.389> if<00:04:51.569> you<00:04:51.599> put<00:04:51.840> wood<00:04:52.080> up

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
and a lot of times if you put wood up

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:55.730 
and a lot of times if you put wood up
against<00:04:52.710> concrete<00:04:52.949> like<00:04:53.550> we<00:04:53.729> have<00:04:54.060> here<00:04:54.740> on

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
against concrete like we have here on

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.730 
against concrete like we have here on
the<00:04:56.069> right<00:04:56.280> side<00:04:56.550> of<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.180> step<00:04:57.479> the<00:04:57.780> concrete

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
the right side of the step the concrete

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.830 
the right side of the step the concrete
can<00:04:59.009> remain<00:04:59.520> moist<00:04:59.789> for<00:05:00.180> long<00:05:00.330> periods<00:05:00.750> of

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
can remain moist for long periods of

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.559 
can remain moist for long periods of
time<00:05:00.900> pulling<00:05:01.800> moisture<00:05:02.639> out<00:05:02.849> of<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.210> ground

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
time pulling moisture out of the ground

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:08.689 
time pulling moisture out of the ground
and<00:05:04.280> that<00:05:05.280> would<00:05:05.580> be<00:05:05.759> enough<00:05:06.120> to<00:05:06.650> rot<00:05:07.650> out<00:05:08.069> the

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
and that would be enough to rot out the

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.420 
and that would be enough to rot out the
side<00:05:09.120> of<00:05:09.449> the<00:05:09.780> step<00:05:10.050> eventually<00:05:10.770> because

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
side of the step eventually because

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.649 
side of the step eventually because
you're<00:05:11.550> going<00:05:11.669> to<00:05:11.759> have<00:05:11.909> a<00:05:11.940> nice<00:05:12.300> steady

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:12.659 
you're going to have a nice steady

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.920 
you're going to have a nice steady
supply<00:05:13.110> of<00:05:13.229> moisture<00:05:14.039> I<00:05:14.580> mean<00:05:15.330> and<00:05:15.629> of<00:05:15.719> course

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
supply of moisture I mean and of course

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.850 
supply of moisture I mean and of course
that<00:05:16.199> is<00:05:16.530> realistically<00:05:17.340> what<00:05:17.669> rots<00:05:18.030> wood

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
that is realistically what rots wood

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.719 
that is realistically what rots wood
it's<00:05:19.860> just<00:05:20.099> part<00:05:20.310> of<00:05:20.370> its<00:05:20.520> natural

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
it's just part of its natural

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.629 
it's just part of its natural
decomposition<00:05:21.440> out<00:05:22.440> in<00:05:22.590> the<00:05:22.680> forest<00:05:22.919> let's

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
decomposition out in the forest let's

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.390 
decomposition out in the forest let's
face<00:05:23.879> it<00:05:23.909> that's<00:05:24.210> just<00:05:24.449> the<00:05:24.569> way<00:05:24.719> way<00:05:25.289> it<00:05:25.440> kind

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
face it that's just the way way it kind

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.290 
face it that's just the way way it kind

of goes back into its original mass I
guess<00:05:30.979> okay<00:05:31.979> just<00:05:32.279> to<00:05:32.400> recap<00:05:32.819> everything<00:05:33.240> here
