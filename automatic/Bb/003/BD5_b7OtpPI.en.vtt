if you read the neural tour guide and

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.640 
if you read the neural tour guide and
manga<00:00:14.940> it's<00:00:15.240> kind<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.540> been<00:00:15.630> hinted<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
manga it's kind of been hinted that the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.500 
manga it's kind of been hinted that the
main<00:00:16.920> villain<00:00:17.369> or<00:00:17.460> whatever<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.970> even

main villain or whatever is even

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.540 
main villain or whatever is even
stronger<00:00:18.750> than<00:00:18.960> Kagura<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:20.039> know<00:00:20.160> more

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
stronger than Kagura and you know more

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.609 
stronger than Kagura and you know more
dastardly<00:00:20.850> than<00:00:21.449> Kagura<00:00:21.930> ever<00:00:22.109> was<00:00:22.380> and

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
dastardly than Kagura ever was and

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.140 
dastardly than Kagura ever was and
honestly<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.310> wouldn't<00:00:23.490> be<00:00:23.580> surprised<00:00:23.939> if

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
honestly I wouldn't be surprised if

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.210 
honestly I wouldn't be surprised if
again<00:00:24.689> it's<00:00:24.900> related<00:00:25.320> somehow<00:00:25.500> Takagi<00:00:25.920> and

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
again it's related somehow Takagi and

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.470 
again it's related somehow Takagi and
I'm<00:00:26.279> guessing<00:00:26.640> from<00:00:26.939> what<00:00:27.119> I'm<00:00:27.210> seeing

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
I'm guessing from what I'm seeing

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.779 
I'm guessing from what I'm seeing
everything<00:00:27.689> it's<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.619> potential<00:00:29.160> possibility

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
everything it's a potential possibility

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.820 
everything it's a potential possibility
that<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.720> could<00:00:30.900> be<00:00:30.929> cocky<00:00:31.260> as<00:00:31.500> husband

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
that it could be cocky as husband

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.680 
that it could be cocky as husband
because<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.520> looked<00:00:32.759> as<00:00:32.910> though<00:00:32.940> Katya<00:00:33.510> was

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
because it looked as though Katya was

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.120 
because it looked as though Katya was
getting<00:00:33.899> ready<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.110> war<00:00:34.410> back<00:00:34.680> then<00:00:34.920> and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
getting ready for war back then and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.560 
getting ready for war back then and
maybe<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.550> reason<00:00:35.790> why<00:00:35.880> she<00:00:36.090> looked<00:00:36.300> like<00:00:36.420> she

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
maybe the reason why she looked like she

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.000 
maybe the reason why she looked like she
was<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:36.809> fucked<00:00:37.079> up<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.350> was<00:00:37.469> taking<00:00:37.770> all<00:00:37.890> this

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
was so fucked up and was taking all this

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.350 
was so fucked up and was taking all this
chakra<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.370> everything<00:00:38.670> was<00:00:39.000> maybe<00:00:39.180> to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
chakra and everything was maybe to

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.970 
chakra and everything was maybe to
defeat<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.750> person<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.320> what<00:00:40.590> better<00:00:40.800> than

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
defeat this person and what better than

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.319 
defeat this person and what better than
her<00:00:41.129> husband<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.579> mean<00:00:41.700> it's<00:00:41.850> even<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.120> she

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
her husband I mean it's even a she

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.420 
her husband I mean it's even a she
unless<00:00:42.840> she's<00:00:43.050> asexual<00:00:43.559> she<00:00:44.040> had<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.280> have

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
unless she's asexual she had to have

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.670 
unless she's asexual she had to have
somebody<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.329> make<00:00:45.510> them<00:00:45.690> kids<00:00:45.989> Hager<00:00:46.350> Tomo

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
somebody to make them kids Hager Tomo

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.160 
somebody to make them kids Hager Tomo
and<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.160> other<00:00:47.309> dude<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.789> maybe<00:00:48.750> that's<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
and the other dude like maybe that's the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.420 
and the other dude like maybe that's the
person<00:00:49.469> maybe<00:00:49.559> she<00:00:49.800> had<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.010> go<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.219> war<00:00:50.399> with

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
person maybe she had to go to war with

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.610 
person maybe she had to go to war with
her<00:00:50.700> husband<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.840> dude<00:00:52.079> returns<00:00:52.469> I

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
her husband and this dude returns I

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.750 
her husband and this dude returns I
don't<00:00:52.770> know<00:00:52.829> how<00:00:52.980> he<00:00:53.039> returned<00:00:53.460> or<00:00:53.550> whatever

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
don't know how he returned or whatever

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.939 
don't know how he returned or whatever
and<00:00:53.940> honestly<00:00:54.510> having<00:00:54.870> Renny<00:00:55.379> gone<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.770> each

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
and honestly having Renny gone on each

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:56.450 
and honestly having Renny gone on each
hand

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
hand

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.560 
hand
I<00:00:56.489> guess<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.730> kind<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.879> works<00:00:57.090> well<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.480> way

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
I guess it kind of works well in a way

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.479 
I guess it kind of works well in a way
seeing<00:00:57.840> as<00:00:57.930> how<00:00:58.079> we've<00:00:58.350> seen<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.980> shin<00:00:59.250> dudes

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
seeing as how we've seen the shin dudes

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.830 
seeing as how we've seen the shin dudes
having<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.969> know<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> shining<00:01:00.539> down<00:01:00.690> all

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
having you know the shining down all

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.180 
having you know the shining down all
over<00:01:01.050> them<00:01:01.199> does<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.620> probably<00:01:01.859> having

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
over them does do probably having

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.979 
over them does do probably having
running<00:01:02.399> on<00:01:02.609> everywhere<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.300> up<00:01:03.420> his<00:01:03.539> ass<00:01:03.719> one

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
running on everywhere one up his ass one

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.630 
running on everywhere one up his ass one
in<00:01:04.110> his<00:01:04.229> balls<00:01:04.470> something<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.100> lines<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.489> that

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
in his balls something on lines of that

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.490 
in his balls something on lines of that
but<00:01:05.880> either<00:01:06.299> way<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:07.020> kind<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.260> making<00:01:07.380> me

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
but either way it's kind of making me

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.560 
but either way it's kind of making me
wonder<00:01:07.710> as<00:01:07.920> well<00:01:08.130> if<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:09.000> Bo<00:01:09.210> total
