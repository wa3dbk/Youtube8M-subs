welcome<00:00:01.860> back<00:00:02.060> see<00:00:03.060> how<00:00:03.090> I<00:00:03.240> just<00:00:03.360> solved<00:00:03.929> one

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
welcome back see how I just solved one

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.190 
welcome back see how I just solved one
whole<00:00:04.440> side<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:04.980> this<00:00:05.100> is<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.430> thickest<00:00:05.700> side

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200 
whole side and this is the thickest side

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.080 
whole side and this is the thickest side
just<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.379> little<00:00:07.410> brief<00:00:07.980> summary<00:00:08.490> I<00:00:08.700> usually

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
just a little brief summary I usually

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.350 
just a little brief summary I usually
make<00:00:09.420> this<00:00:09.599> little<00:00:09.990> tiny<00:00:10.410> easy<00:00:10.769> cross<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.610> I

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
make this little tiny easy cross and I

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.259 
make this little tiny easy cross and I
bring<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.990> whole<00:00:13.290> piece<00:00:13.889> over<00:00:14.400> it's<00:00:15.000> like<00:00:15.150> the

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
bring the whole piece over it's like the

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.990 
bring the whole piece over it's like the
middle<00:00:15.540> layer<00:00:15.719> or<00:00:15.929> something<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.379> go<00:00:17.369> through

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
middle layer or something and go through

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.370 
middle layer or something and go through
the<00:00:18.480> full<00:00:18.750> side<00:00:19.740> till<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.490> get<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.670> piece<00:00:20.970> and

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
the full side till I get a piece and

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.970 
the full side till I get a piece and
there<00:00:22.380> yeah<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.160> so<00:00:24.150> yeah<00:00:24.590> now<00:00:25.590> i'm<00:00:25.769> going<00:00:25.890> to

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
there yeah and so yeah now i'm going to

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.330 
there yeah and so yeah now i'm going to
show<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.160> one<00:00:26.699> app<00:00:26.910> easy<00:00:27.240> easy<00:00:27.869> algorithm<00:00:28.769> it

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
show you one app easy easy algorithm it

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.980 
show you one app easy easy algorithm it
only<00:00:29.640> took<00:00:29.820> me<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.119> less<00:00:30.420> than<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.630> minute

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
only took me in like less than a minute

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.709 
only took me in like less than a minute
just<00:00:31.380> memorize<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.399> tower<00:00:32.669> room<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.510> see

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
just memorize this tower room you see

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.110 
just memorize this tower room you see
how<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.500> piece<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.160> on<00:00:35.550> line<00:00:35.730> with<00:00:35.910> this

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
how this piece is on line with this

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.500 
how this piece is on line with this
piece<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:37.370> like<00:00:38.370> number<00:00:38.610> i<00:00:38.670> don't<00:00:39.000> think<00:00:39.390> of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
piece and like number i don't think of

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.090 
piece and like number i don't think of
that<00:00:39.629> piece<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.879> second<00:00:42.200> this<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> very<00:00:43.680> rare

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
that piece a second this is a very rare

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.450 
that piece a second this is a very rare
occasion<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.610> just<00:00:45.120> happened<00:00:46.039> so<00:00:47.039> don't

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
occasion that just happened so don't

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.069 
occasion that just happened so don't
worry<00:00:48.059> what<00:00:48.360> i'm<00:00:48.450> doing<00:00:48.690> right<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:49.020> very

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
worry what i'm doing right this very

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.770 
worry what i'm doing right this very
second<00:00:50.270> it<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.809> never<00:00:52.140> happened<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.649> me<00:00:52.710> before

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
second it is never happened to me before

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.920 
second it is never happened to me before
actually<00:00:54.780> okay<00:00:55.969> see<00:00:56.969> how<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.329> piece<00:00:57.660> is

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
actually okay see how this piece is

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.049 
actually okay see how this piece is
thick<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.100> know<00:00:59.340> if<00:00:59.520> i<00:00:59.640> could<00:00:59.699> be<00:00:59.879> on<00:00:59.969> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
thick and you know if i could be on the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.830 
thick and you know if i could be on the
very<00:01:00.600> thin<00:01:01.140> thin<00:01:01.649> layer<00:01:02.030> see<00:01:03.030> how<00:01:03.329> thick<00:01:03.809> that

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
very thin thin layer see how thick that

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.010 
very thin thin layer see how thick that
is<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:05.100> know<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.519> goes<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.390> side<00:01:06.689> or

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
is and you know it goes to this side or

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.920 
is and you know it goes to this side or
this<00:01:07.260> side<00:01:07.970> you<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.360> do<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.540> algorithm

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
this side you have to do this algorithm

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.590 
this side you have to do this algorithm
to<00:01:10.710> put<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.250> right<00:01:11.580> side<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.420> that's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
to put it to this right side and that's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.289 
to put it to this right side and that's
where<00:01:12.930> i<00:01:12.960> believe<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.500> going<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.740> go<00:01:14.119> you<00:01:15.119> do

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
where i believe it's going to go you do

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:25.670 
where i believe it's going to go you do
top<00:01:16.280> left<00:01:18.080> right<00:01:19.080> up<00:01:20.689> top<00:01:21.890> right<00:01:23.600> right<00:01:24.680> down

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
top left right up top right right down

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.310 
top left right up top right right down
and<00:01:26.090> then<00:01:27.090> top<00:01:28.130> right<00:01:30.320> front<00:01:31.520> clock<00:01:32.520> counter

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
and then top right front clock counter

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.600 
and then top right front clock counter
clockwise<00:01:35.090> top<00:01:36.140> back<00:01:37.140> where<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.470> was<00:01:37.610> so

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
clockwise top back where it was so

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.510 
clockwise top back where it was so
that's<00:01:38.790> left<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.829> back<00:01:40.829> all<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.280> way<00:01:41.340> down

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
that's left and back all the way down

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.240 
that's left and back all the way down
and<00:01:41.729> then<00:01:42.079> see<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.259> piece<00:01:43.500> went<00:01:43.740> right<00:01:43.979> there

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
and then see that piece went right there

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.030 
and then see that piece went right there
and<00:01:44.460> effect<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:46.670> and<00:01:47.960> now<00:01:48.960> see<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.740> piece

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
and effect and and now see this piece

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.710 
and effect and and now see this piece
right<00:01:50.340> here<00:01:50.520> um<00:01:51.439> right<00:01:52.439> here<00:01:53.299> will<00:01:54.299> have<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.600> go

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
right here um right here will have to go

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.160 
right here um right here will have to go
to<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.710> side<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.810> let's<00:01:57.810> do<00:01:58.049> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
to this this side so let's do the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.889 
to this this side so let's do the
algorithm<00:01:58.619> for<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.920> left<00:01:59.130> side<00:01:59.340> so<00:02:00.119> we<00:02:00.360> top

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
algorithm for the left side so we top

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.750 
algorithm for the left side so we top
right<00:02:01.740> instead<00:02:02.810> left<00:02:03.810> up<00:02:04.939> top<00:02:05.939> left

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
right instead left up top left

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.080 
right instead left up top left
top<00:02:08.600> right<00:02:09.260> left<00:02:10.100> I<00:02:10.250> mean<00:02:10.460> sorry<00:02:10.880> left<00:02:11.440> down

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
top right left I mean sorry left down

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:23.710 
top right left I mean sorry left down
top<00:02:14.090> left<00:02:16.960> fraud<00:02:18.310> block-wise<00:02:21.490> top<00:02:22.490> right<00:02:23.450> and

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
top left fraud block-wise top right and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.200 
top left fraud block-wise top right and
then<00:02:24.460> front<00:02:25.540> counter<00:02:26.540> clockwise<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:28.210> then

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
then front counter clockwise and then

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.380 
then front counter clockwise and then
there<00:02:29.810> it<00:02:29.930> is<00:02:30.050> it<00:02:30.470> fit<00:02:30.890> right<00:02:31.160> there<00:02:31.520> you<00:02:32.120> can't

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
there it is it fit right there you can't

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.760 
there it is it fit right there you can't
see<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.490> and<00:02:34.490> now<00:02:35.390> let's<00:02:35.990> do<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.440> one<00:02:36.680> more

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
see it so and now let's do it one more

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.610 
see it so and now let's do it one more
time<00:02:36.920> just<00:02:37.730> for<00:02:37.960> you<00:02:38.960> to<00:02:39.170> remember<00:02:41.350> this<00:02:42.350> piece

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
time just for you to remember this piece

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.250 
time just for you to remember this piece
will<00:02:42.770> go<00:02:42.920> over<00:02:43.100> here<00:02:43.520> so<00:02:44.410> I'm<00:02:45.700> left<00:02:46.700> up<00:02:47.260> top

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
will go over here so I'm left up top

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:56.320 
will go over here so I'm left up top
left<00:02:50.470> left<00:02:51.470> down<00:02:52.480> top<00:02:53.480> ooh<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:55.000> this<00:02:56.000> is<00:02:56.180> how

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
left left down top ooh and this is how

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.120 
left left down top ooh and this is how
if<00:02:56.600> you<00:02:56.750> if<00:02:57.020> it<00:02:57.140> doesn't<00:02:57.380> look<00:02:57.530> like<00:02:57.860> it

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
if you if it doesn't look like it

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.000 
if you if it doesn't look like it
connects<00:02:58.640> like<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:59.170> then<00:03:00.170> that<00:03:00.590> means<00:03:00.770> you

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
connects like that then that means you

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.250 
connects like that then that means you
didn't<00:03:01.280> get<00:03:01.910> the<00:03:01.940> piece<00:03:02.360> correct<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.020> just

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
didn't get the piece correct so you just

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.790 
didn't get the piece correct so you just
repeat<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.010> algun<00:03:04.580> so<00:03:05.480> goes<00:03:06.020> back<00:03:06.350> it's

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
repeat the algun so goes back it's

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:16.960 
repeat the algun so goes back it's
normal<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:09.940> then<00:03:14.500> area<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:16.280> this<00:03:16.430> doesn't<00:03:16.730> go

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
normal and then area so this doesn't go

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.620 
normal and then area so this doesn't go
there<00:03:17.209> I<00:03:17.570> just<00:03:17.900> tested<00:03:18.230> it<00:03:18.500> now<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:19.360> now<00:03:20.360> let's

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
there I just tested it now and now let's

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.690 
there I just tested it now and now let's
try<00:03:20.989> getting<00:03:21.290> this<00:03:21.620> piece<00:03:21.920> to<00:03:22.190> go<00:03:22.280> there<00:03:22.489> oh

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
try getting this piece to go there oh

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.300 
try getting this piece to go there oh
I'm<00:03:23.510> stupid<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.530> it's<00:03:24.739> top<00:03:25.010> left<00:03:25.660> right<00:03:26.660> up<00:03:27.310> top

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
I'm stupid so it's top left right up top

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.340 
I'm stupid so it's top left right up top
left<00:03:28.880> right<00:03:29.890> right<00:03:30.890> down<00:03:31.630> top<00:03:32.630> right<00:03:33.580> front

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
left right right down top right front

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.570 
left right right down top right front
clockwise<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:37.269> right<00:03:38.950> top<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.400> left

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
clockwise and right top to the left

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.210 
clockwise and right top to the left
there<00:03:41.570> you<00:03:41.690> go<00:03:41.870> and<00:03:42.080> then<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.860> should<00:03:43.190> have

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
there you go and then you should have

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.970 
there you go and then you should have
almost<00:03:44.030> all<00:03:44.330> the<00:03:44.480> front<00:03:44.720> layer<00:03:44.930> do<00:03:45.769> you<00:03:45.830> see

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
almost all the front layer do you see

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.340 
almost all the front layer do you see
one<00:03:46.370> big<00:03:46.760> giant<00:03:47.150> piece<00:03:47.630> that's<00:03:47.900> pop<00:03:48.080> it<00:03:48.260> out

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
one big giant piece that's pop it out

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.290 
one big giant piece that's pop it out
and<00:03:48.620> you<00:03:48.769> know<00:03:49.010> that<00:03:49.280> those<00:03:49.640> there<00:03:49.910> just<00:03:50.150> has

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
and you know that those there just has

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.750 
and you know that those there just has
to<00:03:50.330> be<00:03:50.480> turned<00:03:50.840> you<00:03:51.739> just<00:03:51.950> do<00:03:52.070> the<00:03:52.220> algorithm

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
to be turned you just do the algorithm

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.940 
to be turned you just do the algorithm
with<00:03:52.880> a<00:03:52.910> piece<00:03:53.239> that<00:03:53.269> just<00:03:53.660> would<00:03:54.530> probably

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
with a piece that just would probably

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.540 
with a piece that just would probably
might<00:03:55.489> just<00:03:55.910> go<00:03:56.480> in<00:03:56.630> there<00:03:56.780> or<00:03:56.930> something<00:03:56.959> and

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
might just go in there or something and

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.580 
might just go in there or something and
so<00:03:58.550> just<00:03:58.700> do<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:58.970> algorithm<00:03:59.480> and<00:03:59.720> don't<00:04:00.170> worry

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
so just do the algorithm and don't worry

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.490 
so just do the algorithm and don't worry
this<00:04:00.980> is<00:04:01.190> all<00:04:01.400> just<00:04:01.640> memory<00:04:02.000> for<00:04:02.690> this<00:04:02.870> part<00:04:03.170> if

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
this is all just memory for this part if

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.830 
this is all just memory for this part if
you<00:04:03.560> that<00:04:04.070> happens

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.450 

and<00:04:08.980> see<00:04:09.980> how<00:04:10.100> I<00:04:10.130> did<00:04:10.250> that<00:04:12.130> so<00:04:13.130> let's<00:04:13.310> get

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
and see how I did that so let's get

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.880 
and see how I did that so let's get
peace<00:04:13.850> all<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.390> way<00:04:14.480> turned<00:04:14.750> around<00:04:14.870> and<00:04:15.320> now

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
peace all the way turned around and now

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.440 
peace all the way turned around and now
you<00:04:15.950> know<00:04:16.220> that<00:04:16.250> piece<00:04:16.550> goes<00:04:16.730> there<00:04:16.970> so<00:04:17.300> we'll

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
you know that piece goes there so we'll

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.660 
you know that piece goes there so we'll
just<00:04:17.480> repeat<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:17.959> algorithm<00:04:18.470> I<00:04:18.650> won't<00:04:19.459> say

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
just repeat the algorithm I won't say

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:20.890 
just repeat the algorithm I won't say
because<00:04:19.970> you<00:04:20.120> should<00:04:20.300> probably<00:04:20.450> ready<00:04:20.750> know

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
because you should probably ready know

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:29.440 
because you should probably ready know
it<00:04:21.020> now<00:04:24.790> and<00:04:26.290> now<00:04:27.290> that's<00:04:27.850> second<00:04:28.850> part<00:04:29.210> of

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
it now and now that's second part of

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.470 
it now and now that's second part of
this<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:29.870> now<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:31.130> last<00:04:31.400> part<00:04:31.550> of<00:04:31.850> this<00:04:32.000> video

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
this and now the last part of this video

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.650 
this and now the last part of this video
will<00:04:32.780> be<00:04:32.930> on<00:04:33.140> the<00:04:33.230> top<00:04:33.800> layer<00:04:34.100> so<00:04:34.910> see<00:04:35.270> you<00:04:35.450> in

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
will be on the top layer so see you in

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.380 
will be on the top layer so see you in
the<00:04:35.900> third<00:04:36.080> part
