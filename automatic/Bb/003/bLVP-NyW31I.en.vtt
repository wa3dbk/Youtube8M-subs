 Y 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.400
 and 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.510
 i 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.410
 or the one that there is I am torrevieja specialist 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:52.559
 of gibson product in spain and I'm 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.809
 m치laga 8 with my friend nico 치lvarez only 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.359
 is a big one of the Spanish scene has 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.219
 touched with light house with burning touches 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.750
 with the border with garages already with for 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.449
 local and have aggravated in the last disc 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.250
 all that sound spectacular and not 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.250
 we have here with a very cool acoustics 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.830
 true yes yes yes great great great great great 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.939
 guitar if we read enter the store and what 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.380
 first he has done only when he has 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.119
 entered is has seen the diet guitar 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.840
 could approve it and that's why we have 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.850
 decided to do the demo is one is a 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.909
 acoustics and it's a model that we focus 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.170
 an American singer-songwriter very 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.090
 known because he 's a very smart guy 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.440
 very content but it always sounds very 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.159
 well and sing very well what he talks about 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.460
 to do also 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:37.869
 and that's how much in the acoustic output 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.659
 of the rural is very old very old and 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.340
 when we want 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.170
 force with gibson to make the model 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.880
 signature was clear that he wanted a 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.359
 for a very small guitar for 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.609
 get that classic 30-40 year old sound 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:52.979
 we just heard from you what you 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:55.350
 it seems unique I would come from the guitar 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.299
 my favorite guitar is the type pair 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.000
 what to touch on all the type of 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.219
 music that you play when you want 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.380
 somehow to touch as if it were 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.349
 a piano does not keep all the bells 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.660
 of the guitar not strumming alone and not 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.370
 can play with a serious line for a 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.489
 side one of treble and keep a level 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.709
 of homogeneous volume and keep all the 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:20.599
 ringing and that aggravates everything with a box 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.599
 very little and the truth 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.800
 it sounds like it has a lot of volume if 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.120
 you look at the union of the mast group 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.380
 is throwing 12 all the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.390
 guitars the little ones are usually made 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.730
 a contrast 12 because when you put a 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.250
 little bit more the most technical of the body 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.540
 you get much more volume then 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.950
 curiously, the little guitar 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.020
 12 fret usually have much more volume 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.910
 that the big guitar and at the same time have 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.760
 much more definition is a very thing 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.590
 curious that little people know and 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.569
 you've seen it projecting phenomenally 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.310
 sounds perfect defines all the notes 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.020
 individually a separation of notes 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.480
 very cool very brutal also a great 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.290
 homogeneous volume and volume throughout 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.580
 definition margin much timbre very well 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.300
 let's press a little more and the 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.959
 we follow 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.959
 charlotte example 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.150
 you 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.959
 i 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.830
 I've seen how it sounds sounds brutal 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.210
 because it's one so brutal apart from how 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.440
 I say for the same reason on the 12th fret that 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.450
 is very significant of this kind of 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.850
 guitars we have also used for the 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:47.110
 red fir top also called a 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.700
 arriondas adirondack the re after is not 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.410
 the fir all the quality acoustics 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.760
 they are always fir and the red habit 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.110
 let's say it's the most top and most 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.420
 high of all the wood to use in 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.250
 acoustics gives a brutal projection gives 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.720
 a definition is exaggerated some 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.220
 very nice harmonics 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.480
 then lateral and funds is mahogany 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.550
 same as the more it is also mahogany 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.260
 what passions of palo rosa we hope what 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.000
 more particular this guitar as I say 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.560
 is the red fir that is the top of the range 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.050
 in materials for super sound level 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.130
 no and then although you see that it does not have 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.740
 no kind of hole here in the part 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.850
 from above takes a previous one and I start a 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.030
 electric piece pickup under the 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.620
 bridge that is the lr bucks element that 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.630
 also my favorite is the one that most 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.520
 like everyone does not doubt that much 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.500
 because he has and forgives he has a 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.910
 particularity this prize not the pieces 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.590
 as you know a little aggressive maybe to 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.230
 sometimes they have too high the the 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.940
 means too much attacks too much and the 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.620
 serious is too cropped but this 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.760
 very special prize because the cable that 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.440
 has the piece pill 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.480
 it also picks up sound and is a kind 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.770
 of mic in quotes that catches the 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.630
 air from the guitar inside that like 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.520
 he said nico is an amplified nonsense 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.890
 an untapped guitar the good thing about 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.880
 the acoustics that is the air and the great 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.800
 of this but that for me is that 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.710
 pick up in addition to catch the whole range 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.200
 half drop perfectly has the serious 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.940
 and the air of normally get lost 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.620
 electrified acoustics exactly and what 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.000
 we use in almost the entire gibson range 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.250
 because we want the best 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.140
 sound more natural does not kill much 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.720
 sound of the pill or the sound 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.860
 acoustic because of the material it carries and that 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.510
 you have to make the jack hole 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.730
 nothing else then takes here a 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.560
 volume potentiometer that will not be seen 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.210
 in the video that does not affect at all 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.660
 you can touch and put your finger without killing 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.660
 the ropes 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.220
 Well, as you can see, it's a super guitar 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.990
 level the inlay that he's wearing here is 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.090
 also super nice the binding that 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.240
 carries in the DNA the dice that is made 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.190
 hand one to one the little squares meet 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.350
 I say it is a super level guitar very 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.180
 particular is a model that very little 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.960
 People know the model that it backs mod 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.870
 We took out about three years ago in Gibson 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.830
 very very very good to me I love mind 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.470
 so my favorite of all 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.690
 just this the l1 are my mis 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.340
 favorites and nothing has been the one 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.950
 I hope you liked thank you very much
