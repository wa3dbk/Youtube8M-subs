went to buy bottled water at the
supermarket<00:00:55.570> people<00:00:56.500> were<00:00:56.590> buying<00:00:56.800> ice<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:57.970> I

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
supermarket people were buying ice and I

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.930 
supermarket people were buying ice and I
figured<00:00:58.960> out<00:00:59.050> that<00:00:59.110> they<00:00:59.710> were<00:00:59.770> planning<00:01:00.340> to

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
figured out that they were planning to

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.940 
figured out that they were planning to
take<00:01:01.150> the<00:01:01.329> ice<00:01:01.480> home<00:01:01.810> and<00:01:02.050> melt<00:01:02.260> it<00:01:02.410> down<00:01:02.440> and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
take the ice home and melt it down and

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.679 
take the ice home and melt it down and
they<00:01:03.070> were<00:01:03.130> they<00:01:03.520> were<00:01:03.550> getting<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.089> ice<00:01:04.239> just

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
they were they were getting the ice just

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.679 
they were they were getting the ice just
because<00:01:05.110> there<00:01:05.379> wasn't<00:01:05.560> any<00:01:06.030> water<00:01:07.030> available

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689

the microwave before making coffee

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.090 
the microwave before making coffee
didn't<00:01:15.280> quite<00:01:15.460> do<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.640> job<00:01:16.770> when<00:01:17.770> you<00:01:17.860> put

it<00:01:19.750> will<00:01:19.900> foam<00:01:20.170> up<00:01:20.380> but<00:01:21.310> it<00:01:21.729> still<00:01:22.150> made<00:01:22.360> coffee

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
it will foam up but it still made coffee

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.060 
it will foam up but it still made coffee
that<00:01:23.500> tasted<00:01:23.890> fine<00:01:24.100> and<00:01:24.430> I<00:01:24.520> drank<00:01:25.120> it<00:01:25.270> up

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
that tasted fine and I drank it up
