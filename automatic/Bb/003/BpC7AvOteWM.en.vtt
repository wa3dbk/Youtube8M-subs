00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello here it is from swatch drivers 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.060
 and today I want you a new one 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.059
 show video 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.110
 this is about dismantling the 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.630
 afford windows 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.080
 this is useful for example 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:20.490
 to clean the afford or even to 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.380
 Polish or paint tool needs 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.880
 her just a cross-slit here 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.880
 screwdriver of size 2 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.160
 so now you are also making about which 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.890
 acts once in front of the driver 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.780
 and in the fund and additionally the 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.780
 c-pillar's cover there 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.940
 So we come first to open father 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.920
 where the circle is the screw out 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.910
 and if you get the front of it 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.150
 do not raise the bar slightly too much 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.730
 it is latched at the rear on the mirror resp 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.960
 shake the mirror housing a bit and 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.590
 pull back and then he gets 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.590
 they're already out 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.420
 Often the problem is that I meanwhile 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.940
 clearing the rubber lip has to make that 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.090
 of course you can do it optimally 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.490
 clean 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.420
 after you have done that or too 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.830
 The bar will be polished again 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.920
 mounted and you have to under 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.070
 the mirror housing the bar 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.300
 insert and then slowly down 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.180
 press on the emergency again 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.330
 make sure that the bar flush with 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:41.650
 the door knew so fast now 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.380
 the screw is back in and thus is 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.710
 the bar at the front on the driver's side 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.409
 already finished 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.030
 we come to the back here 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.020
 is it something different we must first 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:58.440
 remove the wide pillar or strip and 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.509
 then only the narrow door we'll do 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.420
 also have three screws behind 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:07.069
 like one and that are the ones here 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.479
 two screws for the wide bar 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.330
 and at the front of the door is again 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.410
 In addition, a screw for the narrow 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.420
 window bar 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.610
 that's the way we can afford them 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.620
 Slimming the back becomes easy 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.420
 withdrawn 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.680
 whoever is mine here loses 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:30.160
 and then the lower narrow bar 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.770
 just move up after we have 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.750
 it's all about done 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.800
 as well as mine 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.440
 put the narrow strip on it 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:49.380
 adjust front to see if they fit 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:54.850
 is and then the ready bar 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:58.050
 Pressing it once and then complained 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.050
 was it already? 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.750
 Do not forget the three screws 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:09.090
 Turn it all back on 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:11.400
 is and then everything is ready me 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.530
 Thank you very much for your thanks 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.240
 watch and hope you have fun 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.240
