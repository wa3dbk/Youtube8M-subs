00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.950
 Have a nice decision today 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.410
 a swept 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.250
 I was incredibly filtered yesterday 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.780
 my last exam written and me 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.700
 but in the evening was a bit longer 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.760
 Now I'm not together now 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.930
 show that I bought and then 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.750
 Let's just start with 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.850
 that's what you share that's that, so to speak 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.769
 you never go needed before and then 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.349
 if you have your own apartment needs 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.820
 you suddenly sofas here yes it is like that 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.489
 a thing for a room or kitchen roll 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.969
 and somehow you need it somehow 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.510
 yes this part then what you too 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.760
 this is definitely a shoe 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.860
 attract 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.329
 mega and spectacular to be 49 or something 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.250
 has cost him in there 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.710
 different colors but it does not matter 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.129
 appointments fun 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:59.120
 and I have more of these good parts here 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.590
 or less so on the way 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.210
 our wise are also relatively bald and 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.580
 I thought so a few pictures 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.270
 and so they are pretty and then 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.350
 Of course you need a few 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.270
 Picture Frame 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.380
 I have no concrete ones yet 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.610
 plan where and that comes in there but 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.950
 In any case, this can not hurt 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.830
 which ones to own 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:24.540
 and what about care, of course not 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.560
 is missing this is here 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.229
 I already have a few of those 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.880
 increased rose in any case 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.350
 and I already have wisdom of it 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.240
 I have them now in my worst 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.820
 I do not know if I already had it 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.560
 when I turned off my brush 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.630
 and something because I believe it for a long time 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.450
 has already been so island in it and 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.570
 weaknesses 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.009
 and think they are very good 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.920
 just said yes 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.960
 also michael stifter or no idea 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.750
 Everything in it together but I am too 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.340
 beautiful as tea lights and therefore have 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.590
 I bought it from Reis 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.810
 I think the smoke is the one they have 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.049
 I also like flowerpots 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.659
 really nice but I have to first 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.429
 look where with something and yes but the 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.709
 Definitely eat a roof of the roof 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.780
 then customary for've taken 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.720
 I still have something for the kitchen here 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.610
 Taken away you realize that it is stupid 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.849
 just runs like that on the table 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.720
 lays and sees all this a lot 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.760
 beautiful 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.590
 In retrospect , I would like to have too 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.420
 such sets for us for we have so 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:36.040
 a living room table quite normal this 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.690
 white ikea table with four at table with 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.720
 four legs 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.569
 So this whole table 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.230
 Why set space and so I came in 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.720
 next time 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.790
 and then I bought myself still tilt 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:55.209
 these two are just that 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:00.069
 normal layer pink and find that here 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:01.269
 I'm so beautiful if I have nothing 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.519
 There are already delicious but now 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.500
 I just did not buy that around 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.720
 so in love with this pillow is like that 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.420
 beautiful 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.880
 yes I'm not that kind of 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.500
 I could totally agree 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.880
 second and third time i have come 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.889
 just so many pillows 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.510
 I do not know I think you can 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:24.310
 never enough so I have to here 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.829
 but if you go to bed 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.470
 and beats everyone outside the bed 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:33.400
 but they end up pouring in an ever so 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.079
 beautiful both myself from yes and then I 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.010
 I bought another thing because of me 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:40.950
 I am very happy and then it is not 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.450
 yes that is one of them that's just such a 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.829
 seat cushions and now you can 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:53.250
 Maybe I already guessed what 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:55.610
 bought and that this trophy yes 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.730
 I bought it 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.659
 I ask him again I am 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:05.549
 unbelievably beautiful is a bit 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:11.040
 yes, so had country style moderately accurate 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:13.200
 then the back has cost 30 euros what 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.180
 I spend a lot of money for a rocker 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.729
 I think I have unfortunately 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.560
 I did not have a dressing table earlier 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.000
 not always mine before me 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.979
 desk make-up but the stands 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.510
 now at the living room table smear me in 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.500
 bedroom with her for a make-up 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.820
 is and there I have this 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.919
 make-up mirror cabinet with mine 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.960
 jewelry collection knows which ones 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.639
 I confine myself and therefore reflect 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.289
 I cut myself and that 's it 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.699
 does not always have to arise and 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.780
 then also time building so a 

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.850
 I 'm a little lower 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.320
 I brought this hawker and then I can 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.300
 my ever before ask questions and not to 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.080
 it is not optimal to taste it now 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.840
 are more beautiful make-up areas such as 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.539
 however, I manage well 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:59.849
 and on the other hand are also great bands 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:02.639
 clothes stock and necessary for the 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:04.289
 fc said I think everything that the 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.210
 actually forgetful to the sweet little one 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.250
 So it does not matter much 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.180
 to me now can have on demand 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:15.139
 is where you stand with the black 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.139
 make up you actually 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:29.370
 yes in the nursery or in the bathroom 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:30.870
 or if you have already won 1 and 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.139
 in the bedroom or in the kitchen or 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:37.289
 in which room do you like me? 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:40.710
 I never believe in the bathroom 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.210
 So therefore makeup but already clear from 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.069
 and never but if they are not 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.919
 get it done right today 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:50.490
 To make pretty would have to be different 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:53.849
 I did not really think so 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.499
 Bathroom yes and that was it 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:56.659
 already I wish you one more 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:59.580
 very nice day 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:01.229
 the school holidays have the wishes of me 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.649
 Of course, also very nice holidays 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:06.870
 embarrassed but sharon exams before 

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:09.270
 You have your own exams for yourself 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:12.620
 Of course quite a lot of success and then 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.620
 are you not seeing
