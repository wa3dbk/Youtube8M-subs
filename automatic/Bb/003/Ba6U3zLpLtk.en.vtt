note that the ball is rotating around
CGT<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:42.300> if<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.600> CG<00:03:42.960> is<00:03:43.080> marked<00:03:43.440> correctly<00:03:43.620> the

CGT so if the CG is marked correctly the

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.930 
CGT so if the CG is marked correctly the
bottom<00:03:44.880> two<00:03:45.060> displays<00:03:45.480> will<00:03:45.750> read<00:03:45.990> near<00:03:46.320> zero

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
bottom two displays will read near zero

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.330 
bottom two displays will read near zero
if<00:03:47.940> not<00:03:48.350> you<00:03:49.350> can<00:03:49.500> adjust<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.980> CG

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
if not you can adjust the CG

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.640 
if not you can adjust the CG
appropriately<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.150> find<00:03:51.420> a<00:03:51.570> more<00:03:51.750> accurate<00:03:51.960> CG

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
appropriately to find a more accurate CG

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.580 
appropriately to find a more accurate CG
in<00:03:52.860> this<00:03:53.610> demonstration<00:03:54.180> we<00:03:54.450> found<00:03:54.690> about<00:03:55.050> one

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
in this demonstration we found about one

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.590 
in this demonstration we found about one
third<00:03:55.860> of<00:03:55.980> an<00:03:56.100> ounce<00:03:56.220> too<00:03:56.640> much<00:03:56.850> weight<00:03:57.180> to<00:03:57.480> the

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
third of an ounce too much weight to the

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.040 
third of an ounce too much weight to the
right<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:58.740> we<00:03:59.340> rotate<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.850> ball<00:04:00.030> about<00:04:00.300> 1/4<00:04:00.900> of

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
right so we rotate the ball about 1/4 of

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.890 
right so we rotate the ball about 1/4 of
an<00:04:01.170> inch<00:04:01.260> to<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.560> left<00:04:01.830> and<00:04:02.160> recheck<00:04:02.940> this

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
an inch to the left and recheck this

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.900 
an inch to the left and recheck this
time<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.590> scale<00:04:04.860> reads<00:04:05.160> only<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.610> few

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
time the scale reads only a few

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.970 
time the scale reads only a few
hundredths<00:04:06.300> of<00:04:06.450> an<00:04:06.600> ounce<00:04:06.750> off<00:04:07.080> in<00:04:07.320> both<00:04:07.500> axes

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
hundredths of an ounce off in both axes

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.150 
hundredths of an ounce off in both axes
so<00:04:08.760> we<00:04:08.940> mark<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.360> new<00:04:09.570> more<00:04:10.230> accurate<00:04:10.710> CG

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
so we mark the new more accurate CG

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.220 
so we mark the new more accurate CG
using<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.090> quarter<00:04:12.390> scale<00:04:12.630> to<00:04:12.870> help<00:04:13.080> us

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
using the quarter scale to help us

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.560 
using the quarter scale to help us
precisely<00:04:13.680> locate<00:04:14.280> it

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.260 

finally<00:04:20.530> we<00:04:20.920> now<00:04:21.100> demonstrate<00:04:21.730> how<00:04:21.910> to<00:04:21.940> find

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
finally we now demonstrate how to find

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.540 
finally we now demonstrate how to find
the<00:04:22.420> total<00:04:22.630> finger<00:04:23.470> and<00:04:23.680> side<00:04:23.920> weights<00:04:24.250> of<00:04:24.460> a

ball that has already been drilled this

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.760 
ball that has already been drilled this

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
to verify compliance with sport

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.540 
to verify compliance with sport
regulations<00:04:37.200> first<00:04:38.200> you<00:04:38.740> need<00:04:38.950> to<00:04:39.100> find<00:04:39.340> and

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
regulations first you need to find and

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.150 
regulations first you need to find and
mark<00:04:39.760> the<00:04:39.970> center<00:04:40.330> of<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:40.570> grip<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:41.650> fastest

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
mark the center of the grip the fastest

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.100 
mark the center of the grip the fastest
and<00:04:42.310> most<00:04:42.340> accurate<00:04:42.700> way<00:04:43.150> to<00:04:43.180> do<00:04:43.450> this<00:04:43.600> is<00:04:43.840> with

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
and most accurate way to do this is with

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.560 
and most accurate way to do this is with
the<00:04:44.260> precision<00:04:44.560> grip<00:04:44.830> gage<00:04:45.240> however<00:04:46.240> for<00:04:46.510> the

the precision grip gage however for the
purpose<00:04:46.840> of<00:04:46.960> this<00:04:47.080> demonstration<00:04:47.380> we<00:04:48.340> will

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
purpose of this demonstration we will

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.410 
purpose of this demonstration we will
find<00:04:48.700> the<00:04:48.820> center<00:04:49.090> of<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.240> grip

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
find the center of the grip

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.620 
find the center of the grip
approximately<00:04:50.170> using<00:04:50.500> a<00:04:50.620> quarter<00:04:50.890> scale<00:04:51.630> to

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
approximately using a quarter scale to

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.690 
approximately using a quarter scale to
find<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:53.020> grip<00:04:53.230> Center<00:04:53.620> we<00:04:54.010> first<00:04:54.280> mark<00:04:54.640> the

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
find the grip Center we first mark the

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.790 
find the grip Center we first mark the
centerline<00:04:55.360> of<00:04:55.390> the<00:04:55.540> grip<00:04:55.780> drawing<00:04:56.440> a<00:04:56.620> line

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
centerline of the grip drawing a line

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.860

then<00:04:59.740> using<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.730> quarter<00:05:01.030> scale<00:05:01.240> graduations

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
then using the quarter scale graduations

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.920 
then using the quarter scale graduations
we<00:05:02.710> mark<00:05:02.980> the<00:05:03.130> grip<00:05:03.340> center<00:05:03.730> which<00:05:04.570> is<00:05:04.750> the
