00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.370
 the plant is a vital component of the 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.510
 life on planet earth provides us 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.759
 oxygen fresh food and much more today 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.259
 we will learn the fundamental parts of 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.259
 the plant and its function 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.540
 the roots constitute the organ of the 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.640
 higher plants are almost always 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.369
 underground and they play several 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.590
 functions among them absorb and 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.140
 drive dissolved mineral waters 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.329
 accumulate nutrients and provide support 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.250
 to the plant the root is much 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.320
 edible plantation and have 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.420
 considerable amounts of substances 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.250
 nutritious among those of importance 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.840
 agricultural stand out in flame the 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.330
 carrot and yucca 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.490
 and the stem corresponds to the aerial part 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.310
 and central plant that holds the 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.980
 branches or stems secondary to the leaves and 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.140
 sometimes to the flowers and fruits the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.120
 The luck also to plant as 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.340
 means of transport as it transports 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.699
 water and nutrients from the root through 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.170
 of the whole plant and vice versa the leaves 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.360
 they are the main organs 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.210
 photosynthetic of almost all plants 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.640
 photosynthesis is the process that creates 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.560
 the food for the plants the leaves 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.420
 they capture sunlight and use it to 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.119
 convert carbon dioxide 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.640
 food for plants oxygen is 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.530
 created by this process this makes 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.710
 the plants are vital for our 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.240
 environment the flower is the structure 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.460
 responsible for reproduction in the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.680
 plants there are a variety of flowers 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.660
 taking into account sizes shapes and 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.030
 colors but are generally carriers 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.990
 of the same reproductive purpose and it 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.820
 they go for it from the same elements 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.009
 the fruit is the final part of 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.570
 growth of a plant is the part 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.939
 more important because in addition to 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.369
 nourish us contains the seed the 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.229
 Seeds are collected seeded without 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.119
 authority in an appropriate manner so that 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.850
 new plants are born from them 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.070
 the seeds are undoubtedly the basis 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.960
 of all life since from them comes the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.200
 food of a large part of the animals and 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.820
 also of the human being after having 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.369
 studied the parts of the plant 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.929
 We can recognize that the plant is a 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.299
 vital component of life in the 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.730
 planet earth since it provides us with oxygen 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.730
 fresh food and much more
