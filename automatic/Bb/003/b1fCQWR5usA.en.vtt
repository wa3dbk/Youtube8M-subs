just<00:03:37.000> a<00:03:37.150> little<00:03:37.540> bit<00:03:37.810> once<00:03:38.260> he<00:03:38.440> gets<00:03:38.620> locked

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
just a little bit once he gets locked

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.699 
just a little bit once he gets locked
out<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.160> his<00:03:39.280> house<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:40.360> episode<00:03:40.780> does<00:03:41.290> lose

its<00:03:42.160> steam<00:03:42.640> as<00:03:42.910> it<00:03:43.090> was<00:03:43.180> going<00:03:43.450> along<00:03:43.600> it<00:03:44.140> was

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
its steam as it was going along it was

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.870 
its steam as it was going along it was
still<00:03:44.500> enjoyable<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:45.070> watch<00:03:45.250> him<00:03:45.700> in<00:03:45.730> the

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
still enjoyable to watch him in the

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.699 
still enjoyable to watch him in the
bunny<00:03:46.180> suit<00:03:46.540> was<00:03:46.810> really<00:03:47.080> funny<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:47.530> how<00:03:47.650> he

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
bunny suit was really funny and how he

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.040 
bunny suit was really funny and how he
was<00:03:47.920> about<00:03:48.160> to<00:03:48.280> break<00:03:48.459> into<00:03:48.820> his<00:03:48.910> house<00:03:49.209> but

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
was about to break into his house but

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.960 
was about to break into his house but
another<00:03:50.260> flaw<00:03:50.590> I<00:03:50.620> did<00:03:50.890> have<00:03:51.130> was<00:03:51.430> how<00:03:51.610> it<00:03:51.820> was

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
another flaw I did have was how it was

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.180 
another flaw I did have was how it was
kind<00:03:52.209> of<00:03:52.270> stupid<00:03:52.450> how<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:52.870> cops<00:03:53.320> arrest<00:03:53.800> him

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
kind of stupid how the cops arrest him

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.050 
kind of stupid how the cops arrest him
just<00:03:54.510> for<00:03:55.510> not<00:03:56.050> inviting<00:03:56.530> them<00:03:57.100> and<00:03:57.580> I<00:03:57.760> mean<00:03:57.910> it

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
just for not inviting them and I mean it

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.790 
just for not inviting them and I mean it
was<00:03:58.180> kind<00:03:58.420> of<00:03:58.450> funny<00:03:58.720> I<00:03:58.840> won't<00:03:59.020> deny<00:03:59.320> it<00:03:59.350> kind

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
was kind of funny I won't deny it kind

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.100 
was kind of funny I won't deny it kind
of<00:03:59.860> made<00:03:59.980> me<00:04:00.010> laugh<00:04:00.340> but<00:04:00.670> it<00:04:01.030> also<00:04:01.180> did<00:04:01.630> bug<00:04:01.930> me
