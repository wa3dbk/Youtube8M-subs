got<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.159> question<00:01:08.400> again<00:01:09.150> when<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.110> had<00:01:10.409> this

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
got this question again when I had this

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.310 
got this question again when I had this
hair<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:12.590> yeah<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.040> fixed<00:01:14.549> my<00:01:14.610> roots

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
hair so yeah so I fixed my roots

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.950 
hair so yeah so I fixed my roots
yesterday<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.710> because<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:18.090> thought

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
yesterday and because of that I thought

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.240 
yesterday and because of that I thought
I<00:01:19.229> should<00:01:19.259> record<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.610> did<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:22.250> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
I should record it so I did and the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.910 
I should record it so I did and the
camera<00:01:24.000> died<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:26.119> I<00:01:27.119> only<00:01:27.540> got<00:01:27.810> half<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:30.920> but

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
camera died so I only got half of it but

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.539 
camera died so I only got half of it but
I'm<00:01:32.220> thinking<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.820> that's<00:01:33.810> okay<00:01:34.619> because<00:01:34.920> I

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
I'm thinking that that's okay because I

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.969 
I'm thinking that that's okay because I
did<00:01:36.450> one<00:01:37.110> half<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:38.880> scalp<00:01:39.210> or<00:01:39.479> head<00:01:40.850> and

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
did one half of the scalp or head and

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.319 
did one half of the scalp or head and
that<00:01:43.979> explains<00:01:44.549> how<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.600> because<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:47.329> do

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
that explains how I do it because I do

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.120 
that explains how I do it because I do
the<00:01:48.630> X<00:01:48.869> X<00:01:49.140> X<00:01:49.439> exact<00:01:50.340> same<00:01:50.850> thing<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:52.049> this<00:01:52.619> side
