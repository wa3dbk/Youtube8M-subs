pretty monumental for this group

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.089 
pretty monumental for this group
considering<00:00:10.349> some<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.650> challenges<00:00:10.830> that

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
considering some of the challenges that

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.339 
considering some of the challenges that
we<00:00:11.370> had<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:12.240> what<00:00:12.389> their<00:00:12.509> be<00:00:12.599> injuries<00:00:13.049> are

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
we had and what their be injuries are

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.039 
we had and what their be injuries are
off<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.650> court<00:00:13.860> situations<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:15.360> then<00:00:15.809> mesh

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
off the court situations and then mesh

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.870 
off the court situations and then mesh
and<00:00:16.230> old<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.619> new<00:00:16.740> as<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.310> thought<00:00:17.580> it<00:00:17.730> would<00:00:17.760> be

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
and old and new as I thought it would be

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.370 
and old and new as I thought it would be
easier<00:00:18.240> transition<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:19.080> that's<00:00:19.199> probably

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
easier transition and that's probably

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.790 
easier transition and that's probably
where<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.680> failed<00:00:20.010> early<00:00:20.400> on<00:00:20.810> and<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:22.410> think<00:00:22.619> also

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
where I failed early on and I think also

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.410 
where I failed early on and I think also
defensively<00:00:23.519> trying<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.970> get<00:00:24.090> him<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.240> come

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
defensively trying to get him to come

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.240 
defensively trying to get him to come
together<00:00:24.539> defensively<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.470> be<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> really

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
together defensively and be a really

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.009 
together defensively and be a really
good<00:00:26.369> defensive<00:00:26.880> team<00:00:27.060> we<00:00:27.210> had<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.480> parts<00:00:27.869> and

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430
