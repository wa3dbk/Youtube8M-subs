00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.370
 liquid that remained and we whisk it in

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:18.610
 cream that we first got and here 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.490
 here our rolle soft but from 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.100
 a very strong taste for those who do not have 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.820
 these strong flavors can also avoid 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.390
 create the cream with the lemon and then 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.820
 having something much more delicate is
