faucet

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:28.620 

let<00:01:12.160> that<00:01:12.340> run<00:01:12.670> for<00:01:12.700> a<00:01:13.000> minute

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.140 

we<00:01:29.080> took<00:01:29.320> two<00:01:29.560> baths<00:01:29.920> last<00:01:30.400> night

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.030 

and<00:01:34.600> we<00:01:34.750> did<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.140> dishes<00:01:36.930> temperature<00:01:37.930> is<00:01:38.140> 129

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
and we did the dishes temperature is 129

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:49.990 
and we did the dishes temperature is 129
degrees<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:40.150> Counting<00:01:40.600> that's<00:01:40.810> Fahrenheit

these two units here I'm running them
for<00:01:53.240> trials<00:01:53.990> through<00:01:54.230> the<00:01:54.350> winter<00:01:54.970> this<00:01:55.970> one<00:01:56.240> I

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
for trials through the winter this one I

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.860 
for trials through the winter this one I
have<00:01:56.570> filled<00:01:56.930> up<00:01:57.110> with<00:01:57.260> IV<00:01:57.680> antifreeze<00:01:58.430> and

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
have filled up with IV antifreeze and

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.430 
have filled up with IV antifreeze and
this<00:01:59.870> one<00:02:00.110> is<00:02:00.260> laying<00:02:00.560> dry<00:02:01.010> I<00:02:02.260> haven't<00:02:03.260> tested

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
this one is laying dry I haven't tested

this one is laying dry I haven't tested
this<00:02:04.330> in<00:02:05.330> a<00:02:05.540> week<00:02:05.979> they<00:02:06.979> said<00:02:07.250> we've<00:02:07.490> had<00:02:07.700> three

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
this in a week they said we've had three

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.880 
this in a week they said we've had three
days<00:02:08.979> going<00:02:09.979> on<00:02:10.190> four<00:02:10.520> days<00:02:10.820> of<00:02:11.150> heavy<00:02:11.750> snow

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.270 

this<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:17.180> called<00:02:17.540> an<00:02:17.720> auxiliary<00:02:18.280> expansion

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
this is called an auxiliary expansion

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
here and goes back into the tank so you

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:36.500 
here and goes back into the tank so you
don't<00:02:25.100> lose<00:02:25.310> any<00:02:25.550> water

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.000 

give<00:02:36.959> that<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.290> minute<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:38.040> get<00:02:38.220> up<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.580> temp

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
give that a minute to get up the temp

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.660 
give that a minute to get up the temp
I'll<00:02:41.010> take<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.340> spa<00:02:42.200> in<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.739> meantime<00:02:43.950> I'll

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
I'll take a spa in the meantime I'll

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.660 
I'll take a spa in the meantime I'll
clean<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.480> foods

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.190

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
this tank is laid stagnant it's a it was

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.309 
this tank is laid stagnant it's a it was
in<00:03:02.819> a<00:03:02.849> hundred<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.300> ten<00:03:03.629> before<00:03:04.140> the

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
in a hundred and ten before the

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.280 
in a hundred and ten before the
snowstorm<00:03:06.410> so<00:03:07.410> you<00:03:07.470> do<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:07.980> computations<00:03:09.290> I'm

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
snowstorm so you do the computations I'm

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.509 
snowstorm so you do the computations I'm
now<00:03:10.560> going<00:03:10.769> to<00:03:10.860> go<00:03:10.950> down<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.580> get<00:03:11.849> two<00:03:12.599> tubes

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
now going to go down and get two tubes

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.059 
now going to go down and get two tubes
out<00:03:14.519> of<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.880> garage<00:03:15.260> one<00:03:16.260> I<00:03:16.290> will<00:03:16.620> build<00:03:16.890> with

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
out of the garage one I will build with

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.750 
out of the garage one I will build with
snow<00:03:17.720> that's<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.989> water<00:03:19.290> tube<00:03:19.709> unit<00:03:20.250> much<00:03:20.459> like

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
snow that's a water tube unit much like

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.220 
snow that's a water tube unit much like
these<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:22.380> other<00:03:22.410> tube<00:03:22.860> is<00:03:23.099> a<00:03:23.130> heat<00:03:23.400> pipe<00:03:23.670> unit

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
these the other tube is a heat pipe unit

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.610 
these the other tube is a heat pipe unit
that<00:03:25.230> this<00:03:25.530> uses<00:03:26.099> and<00:03:26.750> will<00:03:27.750> fill<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.200> water

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
that this uses and will fill the water

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.440 
that this uses and will fill the water
tube<00:03:28.950> with<00:03:29.220> snow<00:03:29.519> we're<00:03:29.730> going<00:03:29.849> to<00:03:29.910> let<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.180> sit

out hopefully we'll get some Sun when
the<00:03:33.930> Sun<00:03:34.080> comes<00:03:34.560> up<00:03:34.769> we'll<00:03:35.040> time<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.670> video

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
the Sun comes up we'll time it video

to show you oh I get these real clean

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.580 
to show you oh I get these real clean
real<00:03:56.610> fast<00:03:56.970> if<00:03:57.180> I<00:03:57.269> walked<00:03:57.540> over<00:03:57.840> how<00:03:58.079> resilient

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
real fast if I walked over how resilient

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.539 
real fast if I walked over how resilient
they<00:03:59.010> are<00:03:59.989> and<00:04:00.989> I'll<00:04:01.170> Hawk<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.650> water<00:04:01.920> gonna

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
they are and I'll Hawk the water gonna

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:09.440 
they are and I'll Hawk the water gonna
do<00:04:02.670> all<00:04:02.819> I<00:04:03.030> can<00:04:03.090> though<00:04:03.480> my<00:04:03.660> thumb<00:04:03.900> Boyle's<00:04:04.530> law

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:20.509 

I<00:04:10.670> thought<00:04:11.670> it'd<00:04:11.819> be<00:04:11.849> a<00:04:11.970> little<00:04:12.090> action<00:04:12.660> pack
