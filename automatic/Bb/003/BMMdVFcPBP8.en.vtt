00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710

these<00:01:20.430> ones<00:01:20.580> right<00:01:20.759> here<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:22.130> american

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
these ones right here and american

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.740 
these ones right here and american
lashes<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.820> merkin<00:01:24.780> lashes<00:01:25.229> are<00:01:26.299> made<00:01:27.299> from

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
lashes so merkin lashes are made from

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.230 
lashes so merkin lashes are made from
human<00:01:28.320> hair<00:01:28.650> while<00:01:28.920> these<00:01:29.250> are<00:01:29.520> synthetic<00:01:29.700> and

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
human hair while these are synthetic and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.109 
human hair while these are synthetic and
this<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.140> can<00:01:31.259> see<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:32.700> has<00:01:32.909> really

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
this you can see this one has really

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.640 
this you can see this one has really
thick<00:01:33.540> bagged<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.759> the<00:01:36.290> American<00:01:37.290> lashes

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
thick bagged and the American lashes

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.340 
thick bagged and the American lashes
have<00:01:37.890> really<00:01:38.340> thin<00:01:38.640> bands<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.509> guess<00:01:40.110> it's

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
have really thin bands so I guess it's

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.389 
have really thin bands so I guess it's
it's<00:01:41.150> it's<00:01:42.150> thick<00:01:42.479> because<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.899> know<00:01:43.220> just<00:01:44.220> to

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
it's it's thick because you know just to

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.240 
it's it's thick because you know just to
grab<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:46.020> can<00:01:46.320> grab<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:47.090> more<00:01:48.090> skin<00:01:48.659> I

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
grab on so it can grab on more skin I

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.330 
grab on so it can grab on more skin I
