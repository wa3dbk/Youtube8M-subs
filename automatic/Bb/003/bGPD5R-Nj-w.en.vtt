byproduct of the pulping process there's

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.840 
byproduct of the pulping process there's
a<00:02:34.380> very<00:02:34.560> important<00:02:35.010> part<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.490> pulping

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
a very important part of the pulping

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.460 
a very important part of the pulping
process<00:02:36.240> because<00:02:36.570> you<00:02:36.660> recover<00:02:37.020> spent

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
process because you recover spent

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.040 
process because you recover spent
chemicals<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.760> can<00:02:38.940> reuse<00:02:39.150> them<00:02:39.600> black

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
liquor burns like fuel oil and you get

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.030 
liquor burns like fuel oil and you get
energy<00:02:42.180> from<00:02:42.630> that<00:02:42.810> it's<00:02:43.200> basically<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.680> source

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
energy from that it's basically a source

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.729 
energy from that it's basically a source
or<00:02:44.370> energy<00:02:44.850> in<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.510> operations<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.440> it's<00:02:46.620> all

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
or energy in the operations and it's all

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.070 
or energy in the operations and it's all
renewable<00:02:47.250> energy<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:48.209> not<00:02:48.390> only<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.780> great

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
renewable energy so not only is it great

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.870 
renewable energy so not only is it great
for<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.380> environment<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.520> helps

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
for the environment and that it helps

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.760 
for the environment and that it helps
reduce<00:02:51.060> our<00:02:51.360> carbon<00:02:51.540> footprint<00:02:52.140> it's<00:02:52.560> also

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
reduce our carbon footprint it's also

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.140 
reduce our carbon footprint it's also
great<00:02:53.070> economically<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.880> we're<00:02:54.000> taking

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
great economically that we're taking

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.840 
great economically that we're taking
waste<00:02:54.540> materials<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.739> spent<00:02:56.130> organics<00:02:56.670> from

from the pulping process and using those
to<00:02:58.739> create<00:02:58.860> energy<00:02:59.370> there<00:02:59.730> is<00:02:59.760> always<00:03:00.510> a

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
to create energy there is always a

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.890 
to create energy there is always a

so I know type of things that people say

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.749 
so I know type of things that people say
about<00:04:28.509> paper<00:04:29.319> companies<00:04:29.919> being<00:04:30.129> polluters

about paper companies being polluters

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.670 
about paper companies being polluters
it's<00:04:31.449> just<00:04:31.690> such<00:04:31.840> a<00:04:31.870> lack<00:04:32.229> of<00:04:32.259> understanding

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
it's just such a lack of understanding

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.520 
it's just such a lack of understanding
of<00:04:33.490> what<00:04:33.550> paper<00:04:34.240> mills<00:04:34.539> really<00:04:34.900> do<00:04:35.080> out<00:04:35.289> there

more improvements in the amount of fresh

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:59.189 
more improvements in the amount of fresh
water<00:04:56.349> that<00:04:56.889> we<00:04:57.069> use<00:04:57.310> the<00:04:58.030> amount<00:04:58.270> of<00:04:58.479> oil<00:04:58.750> that

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
water that we use the amount of oil that

water that we use the amount of oil that
we<00:04:59.409> burn<00:04:59.740> the<00:05:00.009> amount<00:05:00.280> of<00:05:00.400> electrical<00:05:01.180> power

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
we burn the amount of electrical power

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.439 
we burn the amount of electrical power
that<00:05:01.750> we<00:05:01.900> use<00:05:02.340> people<00:05:03.340> really<00:05:04.000> care<00:05:04.210> people

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
that we use people really care people

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.659 
that we use people really care people
care<00:05:04.750> in<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:04.960> community<00:05:05.080> our<00:05:05.650> employees<00:05:06.340> care

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
care in the community our employees care

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.969 
care in the community our employees care
and<00:05:06.940> so<00:05:07.360> of<00:05:07.720> course<00:05:07.780> we<00:05:08.169> need<00:05:08.560> to<00:05:08.590> care<00:05:08.949> about

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
and so of course we need to care about

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.010 
and so of course we need to care about
sustainability<00:05:09.909> for<00:05:10.090> our<00:05:10.150> communities<00:05:10.780> for

sustainability for our communities for

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.260 
sustainability for our communities for
employees<00:05:11.560> to<00:05:11.889> ensure<00:05:12.190> that<00:05:12.220> not<00:05:12.880> only<00:05:13.000> are

employees to ensure that not only are
sustainable<00:05:13.840> now<00:05:14.020> but<00:05:14.289> we're<00:05:14.440> going<00:05:14.530> to<00:05:14.620> be

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
sustainable now but we're going to be

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.970 
sustainable now but we're going to be
more<00:05:14.889> sustainable<00:05:15.490> in<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:15.610> future
