a<00:02:23.110> completely<00:02:23.590> different<00:02:24.360> methods<00:02:25.360> well

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
a completely different methods well

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.500 
a completely different methods well
initially<00:02:27.160> like<00:02:27.520> a<00:02:27.550> lot<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:27.760> people<00:02:27.970> we<00:02:28.270> made

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
initially like a lot of people we made

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.810 
initially like a lot of people we made
an<00:02:28.630> awful<00:02:28.930> lot<00:02:28.990> of<00:02:29.110> mistakes<00:02:29.520> because<00:02:30.520> I<00:02:30.700> think

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
an awful lot of mistakes because I think

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.000 
an awful lot of mistakes because I think
the<00:02:31.060> tendency<00:02:31.240> you<00:02:31.960> just<00:02:32.200> think<00:02:32.350> we've<00:02:32.800> got

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
the tendency you just think we've got

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.650 
the tendency you just think we've got
this<00:02:33.130> amazing<00:02:33.250> thing<00:02:33.760> here<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.180> we're<00:02:34.570> just

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
this amazing thing here and we're just

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.480 
this amazing thing here and we're just
going<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.900> do<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.290> digital<00:02:35.710> version<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:36.130> it<00:02:36.280> but

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
going to do a digital version of it but

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.310 
going to do a digital version of it but
of<00:02:36.580> course<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.880> doesn't<00:02:37.030> work<00:02:37.240> like<00:02:37.270> that<00:02:37.480> so

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
of course it doesn't work like that so

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.150 
of course it doesn't work like that so
he<00:02:38.410> made<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.590> lot<00:02:38.770> of<00:02:38.800> mistakes<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.690> but<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:41.160> mean

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
he made a lot of mistakes and but I mean

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.150 
he made a lot of mistakes and but I mean
initially<00:02:42.910> I<00:02:42.940> thought<00:02:43.450> that<00:02:43.930> we<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.830> was<00:02:44.950> going

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
initially I thought that we it was going

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.590 
initially I thought that we it was going
to<00:02:45.220> be<00:02:45.310> really<00:02:45.550> difficult<00:02:45.730> for<00:02:46.000> us<00:02:46.180> because<00:02:46.210> i

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
to be really difficult for us because i

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.240 
to be really difficult for us because i
thought<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.960> we're<00:02:47.170> late<00:02:47.610> be<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:50.250> wasn't

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
thought a we're late be I wasn't

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.410 
thought a we're late be I wasn't
convinced<00:02:51.550> that<00:02:51.760> we<00:02:51.880> could<00:02:52.060> do<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.180> good<00:02:52.360> job

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
convinced that we could do a good job

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.900 
convinced that we could do a good job
and<00:02:52.840> see<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:53.710> thought<00:02:53.950> it<00:02:54.130> would<00:02:54.220> kill<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.700> team

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
and see I thought it would kill the team

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.970 
and see I thought it would kill the team
and<00:02:55.480> actually<00:02:55.870> you<00:02:56.020> just<00:02:56.050> have<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.650> try<00:02:56.860> and

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
and actually you just have to try and

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.120 
and actually you just have to try and
protect<00:02:57.280> your<00:02:57.460> brand<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.410> make<00:02:59.410> material
