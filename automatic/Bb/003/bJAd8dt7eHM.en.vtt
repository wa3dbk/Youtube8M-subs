00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.350
 hello very good to all youtube people 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.180
 here we are one more day in the worst channel 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.879
 history until today don 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.840
 you take gamer and let's talk about ping 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.480
 3 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.869
 you all know that spinning is a game in 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.119
 the one that is characterized because you 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.980
 you control your character and that character 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.080
 is the one that controls some creatures very 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.430
 funny and very pretty that are like 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.050
 little plants and what you have to do and 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.760
 go fulfilling missions and fulfilling 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.870
 targets moving objects destroying 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.969
 things a series of crazy things because you can 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.129
 become crazy and truth 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.350
 which is a very very very much awaited game 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.470
 all over the world I do not know if you'll know 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.600
 but ping 3 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.800
 and it will be a launch game 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.180
 nintendo wii 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.250
 but he was delayed very late 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.900
 I honestly did not intend to 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.630
 buy less simply because of the fact 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.630
 that I had never been interested in before 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.460
 by pikmin but I've started looking for 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.580
 going around was one of the games 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.800
 best- selling of the new is a game 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.300
 long awaited for many years 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.110
 3 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.850
 They have again make the mistake of not 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.470
 they have online mode 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.420
 I do not know if later with a dlc or 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.180
 something can only implant be able to 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.410
 may not know if they are going to do it 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.590
 very well that at least there was an online 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.530
 in cooperative that is another one that I think 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.170
 and well what's funny about this game 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.930
 Well, what I said to you 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.690
 you have doubts about whether to buy it or not tomorrow 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.210
 here in this channel I have already decided 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.800
 that if you are going to have the unboxing from 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.670
 tomorrow you will have a video the day 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.400
 from pikmin 3 I believe sincerely for the 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.680
 videos that you were watching that keeps the 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.330
 freshness of the game that will take advantage 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.110
 very good features on youtube 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.030
 It's going to be very, very, very good game 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.800
 fun loving power that yes you can 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.330
 it seems like an absurd game the best but 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:11.480
 as funny game does not have any 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.340
 I waste what I tell you tomorrow 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.000
 I'm going to buy it 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.550
 I'm going to make a boxing start recording 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.630
 and 1 day 2 of three because you will not know 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.580
 but the mission is so to speak the 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.060
 history is divided into days 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.670
 then keep recording chapter day 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.590
 whenever possible and another thing that 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.330
 I wanted to tell you who we talk to 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.520
 ping 3 is 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.770
 I do not know if you know but what you have 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.240
 bollullos you want to buy you know that 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.590
 most wii games do not always 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.120
 they come in physical format and format 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.850
 digital if you buy the physical format 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.650
 you will not have the discount that 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.520
 nintendo is offering in for the 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.610
 next game that is the wonderful 101 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:00.900
 and if you buy the digital format 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.920
 yes you will have it but of course 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.319
 what are you going to have for 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.239
 You know you have a 30% discount for the 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.239
 physical format also of the second game 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.610
 what do you think about it, I really do not 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.890
 I've seen nothing about warner 101 say 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.780
 that is going to be very good game too but 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.760
 I prefer to have my physical format 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.860
 I have always liked to have the boxes of 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.350
 the games that I like and have 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.150
 passionate in my room in the 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.950
 bookshelf or already with that fashion passion 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.910
 inside a drawer but it has always 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.000
 liked having the boxes 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.920
 then I despite the 30% discount 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.070
 in the wonderful team everything I'm not going to 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.880
 buy me the physical format of both 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.459

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.630
 have to buy the way you are going 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.570
 Something else you want to know about 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.000

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.620

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.840

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.580
