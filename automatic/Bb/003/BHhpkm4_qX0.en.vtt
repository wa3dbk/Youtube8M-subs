so paneling one thing has been and two
things<00:02:46.020> have<00:02:46.560> been<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:48.210> you<00:02:48.300> would<00:02:48.420> say

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
things have been so you would say

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.040 
things have been so you would say
paneling<00:02:49.230> has<00:02:49.800> been<00:02:50.310> painted<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.910> match<00:02:51.050> note

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
paneling has been painted to match note

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.870 
paneling has been painted to match note
that<00:02:52.230> all<00:02:52.440> your<00:02:52.800> other<00:02:52.950> answer<00:02:53.310> choices<00:02:53.520> are

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
that all your other answer choices are

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.770 
that all your other answer choices are
plural<00:02:54.720> so<00:02:55.380> if<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.650> have<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:56.580> know<00:02:56.610> she<00:02:57.480> would

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
plural so if you have you know she would

say<00:02:57.870> two<00:02:57.930> things<00:02:58.200> have<00:02:58.890> been<00:02:59.280> two<00:03:00.090> things<00:03:00.330> were

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
say two things have been two things were

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.680 
say two things have been two things were
painted<00:03:01.620> two<00:03:01.860> things<00:03:02.040> are<00:03:02.340> painted<00:03:02.760> but<00:03:03.540> the

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
painted two things are painted but the

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.440 
painted two things are painted but the
no<00:03:03.900> change<00:03:04.260> keeps<00:03:04.740> it<00:03:04.980> on<00:03:05.130> singular<00:03:06.090> as<00:03:06.240> it

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
no change keeps it on singular as it

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.720 
no change keeps it on singular as it
should<00:03:06.630> be<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:07.080> paneling<00:03:07.620> has<00:03:08.040> been<00:03:08.430> painted

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
should be the paneling has been painted

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.910 
should be the paneling has been painted
to<00:03:09.060> match<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.570> therefore<00:03:10.380> it's<00:03:10.500> answer

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
to match and therefore it's answer

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.380 
to match and therefore it's answer
choice<00:03:11.220> f<00:03:12.890> by<00:03:13.890> 2<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.340> can't<00:03:14.670> do<00:03:14.880> this<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.150> you<00:03:15.240> two

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
choice f by 2 I can't do this is you two

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.710 
choice f by 2 I can't do this is you two
laughing<00:03:15.660> back<00:03:15.990> there<00:03:18.290> so<00:03:19.290> if<00:03:19.350> we<00:03:19.410> had<00:03:20.720> no

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
laughing back there so if we had no

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.360 
laughing back there so if we had no
that's<00:03:21.960> not<00:03:22.080> right<00:03:22.290> three<00:03:22.710> cool<00:03:23.130> player

we could consider like you've got a

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:50.120 
we could consider like you've got a
chain<00:03:43.680> hanging<00:03:44.370> from<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:45.000> UM<00:03:46.610> to<00:03:47.610> fix
