00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 well we are in minecraft 1.7 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.379
 point 10 let's see a mod a mod that 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.099
 add guns I'm seeing them here 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.440
 they are very cool and we are going to see it 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.570
 let's start with the gun this 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.460
 here that is done with an iron block 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.849
 one gunpowder diamond and three iron 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.769
 and the only bad thing is that having them in the 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:29.630
 hand is that I'm pointing to the cat 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.950
 but it's pretty cool from 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.220
 ammunition used arrows 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.180
 as you see 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.180
 we can keep it pressed 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.670
 and is that he launched the neighborhood we are going to 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.750
 try everything with creepers for example to 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.500
 see how you see is a little weird because you 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.500
 I'm shooting 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.970
 but it gives the impression that in fact if 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.270
 you see the arrow disappears when 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.790
 disappears 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.110
 shortly I think that here for example 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.300
 does not reach the ground then it 's like 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.449
 short distance 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.159
 which is not bad 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.920
 but it would be more fun if you can stop 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:14.350
 from far here I give you a little bit either 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.049
 it's almost melee that's not bad 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:22.149
 because it does the fire damage is also 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:24.450
 a bit weird we all have five blocks 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.250
 of iron one obsidian and that of 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.520
 star-system in using ammunition arrows - 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.409
 the queen that we will see later uses all 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.840
 ammo arrows and this one evidently 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.560
 explodes but here you can see well the 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.560
 arrow that goes far 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.409
 untapped 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.780
 but at least it goes far that's the bad thing 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.479
 of the gun for example the root 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.899
 I think we'll also see it and what 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.899
 cool is that 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.619
 the fact that it explodes is very cool 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.210
 more than sometimes as if you do not come well 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.210
 now they give 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.629
 pretty big robert 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.950
 is what I like the most to me is with the 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.780
 gun room and a fridge blocks 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.420
 iron so five lots of iron with 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.430
 this form 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:27.110
 and it is so good as we 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.540
 the hand looks a little weird but good 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.250
 minimum that we are the much we are going to 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.180
 put more script worth something like that 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.180
 example and we keep pressed 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.790
 it's a bit weird indeed if you 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.960
 we keep pressing the arrows like that 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.210
 they go a little 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:47.150
 it's a bit strange it's pretty good it 's 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.130
 super weird dude it 's like he throws them 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.260
 so many that he sends them a little each one 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.040
 On the one hand, it's pretty realistic 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.019
 yes 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.230
 then this to sweep many more 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.360
 because as you can see it kills in one blow 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.659
 if many ways come to you if you want the 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.659
 same 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.330
 if you want to sweep if you get many 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.700
 Bugs is pretty cool because you do 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.320
 well a couple of times and like you eliminate 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.930
 a lot that if you need a lot 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.230
 arrow is needed is a barbarity 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.970
 but good 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.280
 but it 's pretty cool and then the 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.870
 last root that this is done by 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.269
 example are weapons and I do not like it but 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.659
 good is done with an iron block 4 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:29.130
 of reston two blocks of emeralds the 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:31.650
 mini gun and the gun 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.710
 and I say I do not like it because the 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.660
 evolution is this that is pretty cool 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.510
 but it does not seem a bit strange to me 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.530
 you see is like melee too and 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.640
 I'm not cool that it's the melee 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.790
 God 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.250
 It's a little weird because 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.990
 and it seems that we send him super far away 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:56.770
 arrow 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.770
 it does not really surprise me 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.390
 as I say a little weird so I say that 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.690
 I did not like the one I like is the 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.030
 minimum and the low 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.830
 but it's like I have more 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.450
 range than the gun 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.720
 in fact it does more damage you kill it from a 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.510
 hit also the clickers 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.010
 that's pretty good but I'm not 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.019
 like the minivan first because 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.019
 although you do not always go now enemy 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.689
 but well you will not give it directly 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.269
 to the friend with this 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:35.560
 often fails as it is like the 

00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:37.770
 it sends straight but it goes 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.720
 you see 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.050
 in fact there in the background you can see that the 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.780
 arrows go each one for one 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.390
 which is not bad but there is not 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.010
 it convinces me 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.330
 like you also have to be close 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.730
 of the enemy as if it were the gun 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.199
 but there are times that not then not what 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:58.179
 I understand it seems that I send it straight 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:00.659
 and it has almost no rank but if a 

00:04:58.179 --> 00:05:00.659
 bit up 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.000
 maybe it 's for some function in 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.920
 special that I do not tell us now 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.320
 it can be but in something else like that of 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.360
 the mini gun is that sometimes I tell myself 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.290
 times because it does not always happen there is not something 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.290
 of sand for good 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.620
 yes yes there is some sand men and 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.729
 earth this block same yes sometimes 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.729
 can dig 3 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.249
 it's a bit weird because it works only at 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.139
 times 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:30.549
 but that can end the coming by 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:31.910
 example is quite white the stone is not 

00:05:30.549 --> 00:05:35.050
 he 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.050
 let's remove all this 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:41.969
 it does not seem that the stone can finish it 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.650
 but as there are many times that it fails it is 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:45.650
 a weird bit to say that you are stone 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.479
 as well 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.479
 good when you want that if 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:57.189
 the best of Milan for the wind but 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:59.740
 well this is the engine is a curious mod 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:01.030
 7 this weapons mostly I 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.150
 I stay with the minimum before which we send 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.800
 he hears it zombie where more he dies he can not 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.259
 leave ni av 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.050
 it's pretty cool what you say 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:14.080
 I like the low carambola 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:17.319
 that's why they explode but the queen and 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.990
 the gun is not launching as he wants 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:22.720
 it's a bit weird but you have the and 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.400
 the description is for 1.7 point 10 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.669
 if it is made up, etc. as 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.669
 forever 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:39.569
 we killed
