00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:15.900
 greet friends want to show you 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:21.450
 knife on the continuation of his first knife and 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:25.010
 u called bullet hold with my left hand because 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.010
 that we shoot the right to the phone 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.379
 design 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:38.789
 Frontal retractable made as pilot 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:43.260
 sample in principle of course unfinished 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:48.120
 but I was in a hurry I donâ€™t know why 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:52.350
 in a hurry well, in general, all the flaws can be seen 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:01:00.899
 if you can visit him longer I 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:07.530
 have done something one day doing what week 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:09.480
 You can zababahat great well, in general, then 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.790
 there is a cut now he is not cut but 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:22.460
 works like a clock mechanic debugged 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:22.460
 perfect mean 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.380
 I see in this design is very large 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:33.700
 the perspective that is here did not cling quotas 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.680
 pocket can ring on the little finger let's say 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.540
 in several positions here is this groove 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.480
 and make that leg move like that 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.290
 snapped so there 610 how much will allow 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.290
 shorter metal 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.040
 pushed something out there 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.830
 cut so far so far 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.920
 anything else there is another thing this on 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.050
 full respectively here but again 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.630
 this groove can be left-right right handed 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:04.450
 Komucha conveniently there is this prospects 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:09.200
 development of this titanium steel for now 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.740
 Titanium afraid to do well, while it is necessary 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.750
 a thermist and of course they don't give a shit 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:20.090
 cut spring no matter blade 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:23.260
 remake the world not long I want to say 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.200
 around the country here let's say with frontal 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.370
 so classic that is he very 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:33.190
 reliable that is it can 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.810
 there is almost no backlash you can stick 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.570
 I tried the junction hour a little so here 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:46.310
 notebook table robust design here 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:48.830
 retainer if soiled what 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.530
 principle of course this is his main and 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.660
 the only hope minus one can 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.640
 quick purge clean there will be 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.970
 here the court there in no case 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:07.760
 he understands very easily me something 1 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:09.980
 I will now disassemble the court show side 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.590
 loads, respectively, all these on hold 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.209
 10 sides 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:24.500
 I'll sort it out but the shock was all the time 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:35.370
 in the frame climbs too easy an hour ago 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:39.569
 a little bit wrong started yes yes that's all 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:54.660
 the whole soup design is seen boomey there 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:04:00.470
 spring button everything is visible yes you are all that 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.470
 there is but more diameter sits down 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:07.130
 all possible and all spun wind 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:22.380
 without editing doing everything spun 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.840
 screw can be tightened here by 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:35.270
 eat stick any clip a needle and 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:35.270
 tighten no problem docsis visible 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.720
 obviously but still pouring more hands 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:56.690
 better help of claims of problems is not worse 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:56.690
 the resulting dishes are visible; the backlash is visible. 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.600
 plus of course there is a nose 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.530
 design since we care a lot 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.490
 This site is more reliable than for anybody. 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.490
 other front end 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.849
 as cute as a lighter 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.729
 method still supports 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.020
 win 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:06:17.169
 sharpened hell braid 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:19.590
 and here everything will be seen well here in 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:19.590
 general, that's all
