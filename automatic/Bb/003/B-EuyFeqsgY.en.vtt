class<00:00:25.050> out<00:00:25.410> what<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:25.949> would<00:00:26.130> use<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.460> your<00:00:26.550> lsat

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
class out what I would use on your lsat

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.509 
class out what I would use on your lsat
is<00:00:27.210> quick<00:00:27.599> draw<00:00:27.779> with<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.109> stock<00:00:28.410> i'm<00:00:29.340> also

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
is quick draw with the stock i'm also

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.919 
is quick draw with the stock i'm also
using<00:00:29.640> lightweight<00:00:30.090> hard<00:00:30.510> line<00:00:30.689> with

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
using lightweight hard line with

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.569 
using lightweight hard line with
toughness<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.800> don't<00:00:31.949> need<00:00:32.040> scavenger

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
toughness you don't need scavenger

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.790 
toughness you don't need scavenger
there's<00:00:32.790> plenty<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.239> bullets<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.809> dexterity

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
there's plenty of bullets and dexterity

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.940 
there's plenty of bullets and dexterity
so<00:00:35.510> why<00:00:36.510> do<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.350> think<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.710> class<00:00:37.890> is

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
so why do I think this class is

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.549 
so why do I think this class is
overpowered<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.700> lsat<00:00:39.120> these<00:00:39.450> LMGs<00:00:40.050> yes

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
overpowered this lsat these LMGs yes

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:41.990 
overpowered this lsat these LMGs yes
they're<00:00:40.800> fucking<00:00:41.129> broken<00:00:41.370> especially<00:00:41.850> if<00:00:41.910> you

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
they're fucking broken especially if you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.959 
they're fucking broken especially if you
use<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.300> lightweight<00:00:43.070> with<00:00:44.070> stock<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.730> quick

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
use in lightweight with stock and quick

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.360 
use in lightweight with stock and quick
trawl<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.239> shit<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.200> fucks<00:00:46.890> them<00:00:47.070> up<00:00:47.160> man

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
trying hard classes where I run on like

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.119 
trying hard classes where I run on like
rate<00:00:51.510> or<00:00:51.719> something<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.980> is

helps with the flinch makes it got even
more<00:01:22.170> broken<00:01:22.619> than<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.900> and<00:01:24.900> also<00:01:25.470> use<00:01:25.740> make

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
more broken than it is and also use make

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.649 
more broken than it is and also use make
sure<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.220> use<00:01:26.250> stock<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.939> quick<00:01:27.180> draw<00:01:27.390> quick

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
sure to use stock and quick draw quick

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.539 
sure to use stock and quick draw quick
draws<00:01:27.840> for<00:01:28.080> when<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.380> get<00:01:28.500> up<00:01:28.619> close<00:01:28.650> because

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
draws for when you get up close because

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.039 
draws for when you get up close because
I<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.939> rush<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.720> when<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.869> go

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
I like to rush with it so when I go

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.469 
I like to rush with it so when I go
around<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.350> corner<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.799> like<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.369> 80s<00:01:33.150> quicker

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
around a corner I like the 80s quicker

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.890 
around a corner I like the 80s quicker
and<00:01:34.380> then<00:01:34.560> stock<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.340> for<00:01:35.729> your<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.659> just

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
and then stock is just for your to just

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.260 
and then stock is just for your to just
make<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.110> harder<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.740> hit<00:01:38.090> so<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.119> hope

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
make it harder for you to hit so I hope
