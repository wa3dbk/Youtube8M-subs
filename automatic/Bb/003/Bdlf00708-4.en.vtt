 Hello friends with you in the crush 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.730

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.030
 in the first mechanical aircraft in the package 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.290
 consolation minecraft mechanism enough 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.960
 huge 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.760
 very terrible but I could fit into it 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:24.029
 only automatic door opening 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.890

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.570
 I wanted to fit more of course to fit 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:36.030
 here automatic for the very same I 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.950
 there is okay but not the point here 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.829

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.850
 it’s just big 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.410

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.060
 promises everything we want by plane that is 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.310
 set it on fire and so on so but 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.580
 go into our plane we need to get out 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.470
 get and climb our elevator here 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.479
 we have an author's lift that us 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.420
 raises a little bit of course we wait 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.610
 that in dark secrets and patient can 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.200
 immediately fly up in creativity but I will 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.170
 do as I do most 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.810
 I like it so well I don't know how much 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.540
 we will start so need light by the way 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.810
 put here here and here and its here from there 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.500
 I put a lamp in here everything goes tube 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.320
 but what was a little lighter so well ka I 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.720
 probably from the cockpit so take 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:54.720
 sand here he throws two blocks from here 1 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.840
 2 3 here are three blocks we throw to close 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.520
 pit and to open our door we pass 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.799
 here here here we have a small 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.970
 room here we have the type of stewardess 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.160
 sit constantly 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.500
 here 100 per 100 years, that is, see 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.550
 here we throw blocks that we don’t 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.580
 need go out and throw right here i'm not 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.400
 just do not wait whether built 1 2 throw 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.410
 became two blocks i'm here she washed off 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.820
 water well, I can't see how it is washed off because 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.890
 that and turned off all the effects that where so 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.700
 strongly lagged 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:30.580
 so could not get out of that door oh everything 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.770
 so then someone else we have a photo to 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.790
 management of the aircraft again throw three 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.880
 block 1 2 3 that's all i weighs with us already 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.150
 These are the pit see if 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.490
 Kinema here we are two or three of the block 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.030
 I will open these doors and we will be able to see 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:52.780
 what is in us rds guest 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.560
 But with this 3, the control will open 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.780
 the plane is so sturdy for everything let's go first 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.890
 23 so the doors opened and we can all 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.090
 come here we are so small 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.640
 the room is here to settle down exactly the same 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:11.890
 then we throw you here so here three 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:14.290
 block and go in the same room pilots 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.070

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.360

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.760
 so cool and we each have 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.860
 TV well for which shows one 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.500
 program so 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.460
 here we have nothing else we pass 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:50.000
 farther here also throw here three 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.440
 block to close i on well from 1 block 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.990
 actually everything breaks down to close 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.070
 Jamaicans give three here with us too 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:00.290

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:08.600
 we have one more room then 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.940
 we have it already the second eye from us 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.890
 a little easier 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:19.010
 a small ceiling such a TV we 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:21.760
