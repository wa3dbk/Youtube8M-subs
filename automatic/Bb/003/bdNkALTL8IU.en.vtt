00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 the Romans made three mistakes 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.540
 they gave up on understanding foreigners 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.880
 those who called barbarians raised 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.710
 walls that they called lines and 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.259
 they paid foreign bosses for 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.049
 avoid massive migrations us 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.670
 we can not repeat those three mistakes 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.840
 we can not give up to understand 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.000
 to those who live outside the union 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.400
 European Union we can not raise a 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.500
 new Roman lines in the Mediterranean 'and 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.720
 we can not pay the bosses of 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.609
 foreigners to prevent them 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.080
 come to our shores want to come 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.790
 for the war they want to come for the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.500
 hungry want to come by fundamentalism 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.989
 they want to come for the persecution 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.360
 religious or political persecution 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.760
 we have to improve our capacity 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.829
 to save people at sea and from 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.950
 then we have to know that when a 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.230
 The country refuses to receive immigrants in its 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.690
 territory what is multiplying is 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.539
 the rejection of immigrants from the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.480
 countries that have and people in 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.199
 illegal status in their own territory 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.480
 I will say it clearly we have forgotten 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.100
 too fast that until 30 years ago 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.830
 the immigrants 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.450
 we as we traveled and how we 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.090
 they received here in the european parliament 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.820
 the popular party speaks of solidarity 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.070
 of asylum cooperation but in Spain ' 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.229
 practice everything else returns 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.110
 in hot beatings on the fence rejection 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.130
 of refugees and shots in Ceuta and also 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.039
 is doing an election campaign 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.740
 absolutely xenophobic and racist with 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:30.210
 slogans like cleaning badalona or the raval 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.970
 it can not become a ghetto 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.860
 Islamic disgusting and also the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.899
 minister margallÃ³ has joined these 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.909
 speeches of the extreme right that 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.250
 it seems that they have many followers in the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.890
 popular party and is trying 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.560
 rescue the motto of the immigrants we 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.170
 they remove the work when rejecting the 1500 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.179
 refugees that would correspond to us according to 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.250
 the plan of the european commission and 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:56.490
 putting as an excuse the high rates of 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.649
 unemployment that has to be very 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.179
 clear that the speeches of the party 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.280
 popular in the European Parliament the 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.690
 Solidarity speeches are simply 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.929
 a facelift before his partners 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.929
