00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
things about this one is that each song

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.460 
things about this one is that each song
might<00:04:11.519> have<00:04:11.640> been<00:04:11.900> recorded<00:04:12.900> in<00:04:13.050> like<00:04:13.230> three

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
might have been recorded in like three

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.800 
might have been recorded in like three
different<00:04:13.590> places<00:04:14.010> so<00:04:15.000> that's<00:04:15.060> quite<00:04:15.600> good

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
different places so that's quite good

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.530 
different places so that's quite good
yeah<00:04:16.640> everyone's<00:04:17.640> at<00:04:17.760> that<00:04:17.910> point<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:18.330> know<00:04:18.419> you

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
yeah everyone's at that point I know you

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.729 
yeah everyone's at that point I know you
can't<00:04:18.810> see<00:04:18.959> this<00:04:19.109> because<00:04:19.230> it's<00:04:19.410> on<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.590> radio

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
can't see this because it's on the radio

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.470 
can't see this because it's on the radio
but<00:04:19.980> all<00:04:20.190> three<00:04:20.549> microphones<00:04:20.850> were<00:04:21.180> then<00:04:21.299> on
