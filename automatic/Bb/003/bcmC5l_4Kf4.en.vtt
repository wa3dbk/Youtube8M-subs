preventable natural disaster and that's
an<00:00:07.649> asteroid<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.550> I've<00:00:08.940> said<00:00:09.210> this<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.540> people

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
an asteroid and I've said this to people

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
an asteroid and I've said this to people
they<00:00:10.280> Amen<00:00:11.280> if<00:00:11.910> we<00:00:12.179> got<00:00:12.360> hit<00:00:12.570> with<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.780> 50<00:00:13.349> meter

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
you have to pass the asteroid test in

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.500 
you have to pass the asteroid test in
other<00:00:45.390> words<00:00:45.629> if<00:00:46.370> you<00:00:47.370> don't<00:00:47.670> happen<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.480> have

other words if you don't happen to have

other words if you don't happen to have
a<00:00:50.030> global<00:00:51.030> conflict<00:00:51.829> that<00:00:52.829> results<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.550> two

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
a global conflict that results in two

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.810 
a global conflict that results in two
superpowers<00:00:55.219> deciding<00:00:56.219> sort<00:00:56.579> not

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
superpowers deciding sort not

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.580 
superpowers deciding sort not
arbitrarily<00:00:57.420> but<00:00:57.719> like<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.109> next<00:00:58.440> thing

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
arbitrarily but like the next thing

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.689 
arbitrarily but like the next thing
they're<00:00:58.739> going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.250> going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.489> go<00:00:59.640> to

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
they're going to do is going to go to

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.970 
they're going to do is going to go to
their<00:01:00.120> room<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.680> moon

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
their room so you have to have a moon

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.090 
their room so you have to have a moon
the<00:01:02.280> right<00:01:02.460> size<00:01:02.760> two<00:01:03.300> superpowers<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:04.320> cold

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
the right size two superpowers a cold

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.010 
the right size two superpowers a cold
war<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.150> then<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.510> end<00:01:06.720> up<00:01:06.840> with<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
war and that then you end up with a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.560 
war and that then you end up with a
space<00:01:07.380> program<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.850> allows<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
space program and that allows you to

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.380 
space program and that allows you to
deflect<00:01:10.229> an<00:01:10.500> asteroid<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.390> other

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
deflect an asteroid you other

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.109 
deflect an asteroid you other
civilizations<00:01:13.170> have<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.500> have<00:01:13.650> those<00:01:14.119> those

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
civilizations have to have those those

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.810 
civilizations have to have those those
things<00:01:15.390> happen<00:01:16.189> otherwise<00:01:17.189> we'll<00:01:17.430> never<00:01:17.580> hear

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
things happen otherwise we'll never hear

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.149 
things happen otherwise we'll never hear
from<00:01:17.880> they'll<00:01:18.420> get<00:01:18.630> hit<00:01:19.049> control-alt-delete

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
and they'll we we won't get a signal so

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.560 
and they'll we we won't get a signal so
is<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:24.270> not<00:01:24.439> that<00:01:25.439> crazy<00:01:25.830> an<00:01:26.189> idea<00:01:26.570> that
