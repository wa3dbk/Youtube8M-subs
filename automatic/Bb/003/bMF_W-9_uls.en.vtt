00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.469
 I am 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.920
 ah 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.810
 yes, good 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.670
 but here they are told one more day to 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.710
 we hope you are all well and 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.259
 welcome to a video more today we are going to 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.750
 do as a brief tutorial on how 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.050
 overclocking overclock for 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.050
 portable 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:39.590
 this is a hp pavilion dv6 of 2011 15 a 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:43.850
 230 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:48.700
 8 gb ram graphic card 2 gb hd 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.780
 attends to the reference of the balance and 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.870
 etc 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.820
 apart from this because as I do many 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.399
 evenings at the same time as capture of 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.769
 images while I play games very very 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:05.330
 pros and that consumes a lot of graphics like 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:07.580
 personal keys 2 or course 10 the hit 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.880
 with future soldier hates 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.350
 Well I consume a lot of graphic cashier 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.619
 many successes 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.440
 the team set then I came out 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.090
 I thought that all the nuclei were already 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.119
 connected and it turns out that not then 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.009
 let's have a brief overclock from 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.140
 the down from the beginning of the laptop 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.409
 and in another video later we'll make 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.270
 how to overclock the real blog 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.820
 that is, if you, for example, have 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.689
 megahertz in the processor we do not 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.399
 you have a double core at 2.30 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.060
 gigahertz as the overclock what 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:51.280
 does is increase the speed d 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:53.439
 the pink days at 230 will rise to 3.0 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.409
 that 's the real overclock now what 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:59.409
 gives us this tutorial is why 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.710
 for security in the houses of the 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:06.820
 computers the default laptop you 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.410
 comes with me by default hpm tells me 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.209
 keep it activated for security 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.769
 but nothing happens since the 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.769
 computer fellow that thank you very much 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.180
 let's see it we arrived and commenting 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.870
 also from the beginning experience 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.970
 from there you can also see how 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:34.460
 connect the 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:37.310
 the country core searched for 6 5 7 and 7 10 8 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.690
 nuclei are four physical and four 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:44.720
 virtual 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:48.280
 is already starting this is everyone's 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.280
 others 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.780
 and that's it 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:02.470
 here we see the farewell factors comes 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.510
 now I said it have activated I do not know 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.580
 that this is worth the keys mode 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.739
 here is by default to me comes this 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.209
 general hp in the pavilion today the menu 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.430
 main diagnostic security 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.069
 system configuration is worth 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.110
 virtualization technology help 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.599
 amplifies hardware technology 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.069
 vt activates a processor function 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.260
 to run several virtual machines 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.540
 simultaneously in such a way that the 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.280
 specialized software applications 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.709
 they can be executed completely isolated 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.810
 If this is what I tell you 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.580
 ht recommend this function be 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.160
 disabled unless they are used 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.459
 specialized applications like me 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.920
 commented about uploading for example if 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.230
 we have a little bit of a calculator 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:49.489
 image we are using music 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:53.420
 at night when on the internet having 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:55.220
 many processes activated with everything just 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.319
 nuclei will cost us a lot of images 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.819
 no megahertz or logic that the 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.250
 thinker in very low 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.180
 so I advise you to activate it for 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.870
 avoid people who 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.870
 but 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:17.180
 this only works with or 5 and 3 and 7 I already 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.180
 I do not dedicate myself to this 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:28.910
 to be honest and then we have 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:31.260
 we have the game mode that occupies has already 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.820
 demonstrated this brief tutorial in a 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:38.300
 next video we will see how to do today 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:41.289
 loving move it from laptops from 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:45.080
 through the dual-core cylinders of 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:47.319
 normal and 2 and 7 hydro of what 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.090
 is pulling out now works for all 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:53.289
 classics I hope you're all right 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.289
 strong greeting until next time
