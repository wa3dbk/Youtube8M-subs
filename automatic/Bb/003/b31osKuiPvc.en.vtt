plug it right in then connect your

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.330 
plug it right in then connect your
computer<00:01:33.110> and<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.259> should<00:01:34.409> show<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.770> see<00:01:34.979> right

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
computer and it should show up see right

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.010 
computer and it should show up see right
in<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.490> top<00:01:35.700> corner<00:01:35.970> says<00:01:36.150> David<00:01:36.450> iPad<00:01:36.840> right

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
in the top corner says David iPad right

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.149 
in the top corner says David iPad right
there<00:01:37.170> it'll<00:01:37.350> probably<00:01:37.560> say<00:01:37.740> your<00:01:37.920> name<00:01:38.130> and

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
there it'll probably say your name and

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.100 
there it'll probably say your name and
whatever<00:01:38.610> device<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.930> want<00:01:40.079> to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
whatever device you have but you want to

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.100 
whatever device you have but you want to
just<00:01:40.380> click<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.100> it'll<00:01:41.850> show<00:01:41.909> up<00:01:42.210> and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
just click on that it'll show up and

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.240 
just click on that it'll show up and
there<00:01:43.350> should<00:01:43.500> be<00:01:43.530> nothing<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:44.009> here<00:01:44.189> if

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
there should be nothing in here if

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.170 
there should be nothing in here if
you've<00:01:44.369> never<00:01:44.460> done<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.729> before

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
you've never done this before

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.760 
you've never done this before
there<00:01:45.750> should<00:01:45.899> be<00:01:45.930> nothing<00:01:46.110> at<00:01:46.350> all<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.619> there

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
there should be nothing at all in there

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.499 
there should be nothing at all in there
right<00:01:47.369> now<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.670> five<00:01:47.850> point<00:01:48.119> one<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:48.420> you

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
right now I have five point one as you

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.530 
right now I have five point one as you
can<00:01:48.540> see<00:01:48.630> down<00:01:48.840> here<00:01:48.899> install<00:01:49.350> firmware<00:01:49.590> 5.1

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
can see down here install firmware 5.1

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.719 
can see down here install firmware 5.1
iPad<00:01:51.540> three<00:01:51.899> Wi-Fi<00:01:52.890> okay<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.549> see<00:01:53.670> all

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
iPad three Wi-Fi okay you can see all

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.950 
iPad three Wi-Fi okay you can see all
your<00:01:53.880> device<00:01:54.060> information<00:01:54.329> I'll<00:01:54.750> probably

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
your device information I'll probably

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.120 
your device information I'll probably
block<00:01:55.290> this<00:01:55.439> out<00:01:55.590> for<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.829> guys<00:01:55.920> though

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
block this out for you guys though

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.069 
block this out for you guys though
because<00:01:56.310> it's<00:01:56.520> got<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.540> serial<00:01:57.810> number<00:01:58.020> and

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
because it's got the serial number and

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.510 
because it's got the serial number and
everything<00:01:58.380> but<00:01:58.500> either<00:01:58.649> way<00:01:58.799> all<00:01:59.040> they<00:01:59.280> do<00:01:59.430> is

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
everything but either way all they do is

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.760 
everything but either way all they do is
come<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.670> here<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.360> click<00:02:00.479> on<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.659> Save<00:02:00.899> sh-sh

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
come up here and click on the Save sh-sh

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.530 
come up here and click on the Save sh-sh
button<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.549> click<00:02:02.670> on<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.240> then<00:02:03.450> they

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
button just click on that and then they

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.940 
button just click on that and then they
go<00:02:03.659> through<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> thing<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.619> right<00:02:04.799> down

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
go through the thing and right down

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.359 
go through the thing and right down
there<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.159> see<00:02:05.310> iPad<00:02:05.850> 3<00:02:06.119> y<00:02:06.630> 5.1<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:08.069> now<00:02:08.190> what

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
there you see iPad 3 y 5.1 so now what

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.520 
there you see iPad 3 y 5.1 so now what
that<00:02:08.399> does<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.060> saves<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.629> sh-sh<00:02:10.259> files

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
that does is it saves the sh-sh files

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.470 
that does is it saves the sh-sh files
which<00:02:10.739> is<00:02:10.770> pretty<00:02:11.069> much<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.400> signature<00:02:12.030> that

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
which is pretty much the signature that

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.910 
which is pretty much the signature that
Apple<00:02:12.870> writes<00:02:13.110> on<00:02:13.290> all<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.560> firm

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
Apple writes on all the firm

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.699 
Apple writes on all the firm
so<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.050> could<00:02:16.200> downgrade<00:02:16.380> to

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
so that so that you could downgrade to

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.110 
so that so that you could downgrade to
because<00:02:16.980> once<00:02:17.160> Apple<00:02:17.459> comes<00:02:17.610> out<00:02:17.730> with<00:02:17.819> a<00:02:17.849> new

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
because once Apple comes out with a new

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.880 
because once Apple comes out with a new
firmware<00:02:18.450> they<00:02:19.020> stop<00:02:19.349> writing<00:02:19.709> the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
firmware they stop writing the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.680 
firmware they stop writing the
signatures<00:02:20.340> for<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:20.790> for<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.270> old<00:02:21.420> firmware

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
signatures for that for the old firmware

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.949 
signatures for that for the old firmware
so<00:02:22.290> say<00:02:22.470> 5.1<00:02:23.160> firmware<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:24.239> becomes<00:02:24.720> jail

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
so say 5.1 firmware it becomes jail

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.630 
so say 5.1 firmware it becomes jail
breakable<00:02:25.410> re<00:02:25.590> say<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.099> I<00:02:26.160> bet<00:02:26.370> three<00:02:26.520> can

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
breakable re say that I bet three can

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.280 
breakable re say that I bet three can
become<00:02:26.849> jailbroken<00:02:27.330> on<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.569> but<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:27.989> Apple

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
become jailbroken on it but that Apple

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.530 
become jailbroken on it but that Apple
comes<00:02:28.470> out<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.680> comes<00:02:28.830> up<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.099> 5.2<00:02:30.000> firm<00:02:30.360> or

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
comes out and comes up to 5.2 firm or

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.330 
comes out and comes up to 5.2 firm or
whatever<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.350> I<00:02:31.410> accidentally<00:02:31.890> update<00:02:32.220> to

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
whatever and I accidentally update to

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.580 
whatever and I accidentally update to
that<00:02:32.489> now<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.060> can't<00:02:33.540> jailbreak<00:02:34.050> because<00:02:34.440> it's

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
that now I can't jailbreak because it's

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.680 
that now I can't jailbreak because it's
a<00:02:34.650> 5.2<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.640> only<00:02:35.819> way<00:02:35.910> I<00:02:35.940> can<00:02:36.090> jailbreak<00:02:36.450> is<00:02:36.569> on

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
a 5.2 the only way I can jailbreak is on

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.140 
a 5.2 the only way I can jailbreak is on
5.1<00:02:37.380> so<00:02:37.980> then<00:02:38.100> I<00:02:38.160> take<00:02:38.310> my<00:02:38.370> device<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:38.940> want

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
5.1 so then I take my device and I want

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.449 
5.1 so then I take my device and I want
to<00:02:39.209> downgrade<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.050> 5.1<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.310> can

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
to downgrade it to 5.1 so that I can

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.220 
to downgrade it to 5.1 so that I can
read<00:02:41.640> jailbreak<00:02:42.060> my<00:02:42.180> device<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.930> only<00:02:43.080> way<00:02:43.170> to

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
read jailbreak my device the only way to

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.750 
read jailbreak my device the only way to
do<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.830> do<00:02:43.920> what<00:02:44.069> I<00:02:44.099> just<00:02:44.160> did<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.640> to

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
do that is to do what I just did is to

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.210 
do that is to do what I just did is to
save<00:02:45.000> sh-sh<00:02:45.690> files<00:02:45.959> because<00:02:46.530> otherwise<00:02:46.800> Apple

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
save sh-sh files because otherwise Apple

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.390 
save sh-sh files because otherwise Apple
stops<00:02:47.459> writing<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:47.880> signatures<00:02:48.330> for<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.660> 5.1

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
stops writing the signatures for the 5.1

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.740 
stops writing the signatures for the 5.1
firm<00:02:50.400> work<00:02:50.580> so<00:02:50.730> then<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:50.970> can't<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:51.720> just

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
firm work so then you can't it just

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.570 
firm work so then you can't it just
won't<00:02:52.080> let<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.350> down<00:02:52.890> grade<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.430> because

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
won't let you down grade to it because

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.070 
won't let you down grade to it because
it<00:02:53.700> doesn't<00:02:53.850> think<00:02:54.060> it's<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.269> real<00:02:54.450> firm<00:02:54.690> work<00:02:54.870> I

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
it doesn't think it's a real firm work I

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.570 
it doesn't think it's a real firm work I
hope<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.620> makes<00:02:55.739> sense<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.100> said<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.400> pretty
