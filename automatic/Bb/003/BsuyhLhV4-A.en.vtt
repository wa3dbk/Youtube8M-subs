00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
photographic memory you're not going to

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.100 
photographic memory you're not going to
be<00:00:46.129> able<00:00:46.250> to<00:00:46.369> picture<00:00:46.850> every<00:00:47.269> rock<00:00:47.510> step<00:00:47.839> and

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
be able to picture every rock step and

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:58.569 
be able to picture every rock step and
every<00:00:48.409> boulder<00:00:48.860> on<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.339> track

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.700 

that's<00:00:59.270> it<00:00:59.480> now<00:00:59.780> you've<00:00:59.899> come<00:01:00.079> up<00:01:00.140> to<00:01:00.379> that<00:01:00.500> big

ledge now you might just need to give it

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.570 
ledge now you might just need to give it
a<00:01:03.020> bit<00:01:03.290> of<00:01:03.320> acceleration<00:01:04.129> a<00:01:04.190> little<00:01:04.400> bit<00:01:04.489> of

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
a bit of acceleration a little bit of

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.240 
a bit of acceleration a little bit of
left<00:01:04.729> hand<00:01:05.000> down<00:01:05.300> that's<00:01:06.260> it<00:01:06.470> I'm<00:01:06.590> not<00:01:06.740> -<00:01:06.950> not

up and over yep now give it a go very

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.120 
up and over yep now give it a go very
well<00:01:16.869> it's<00:01:17.869> just<00:01:17.960> a<00:01:18.229> little<00:01:18.350> bit<00:01:18.560> stuck<00:01:18.800> there

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
well it's just a little bit stuck there

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.270 
well it's just a little bit stuck there
this<00:01:19.460> time<00:01:19.700> possibly<00:01:20.390> yeah<00:01:20.990> just<00:01:21.200> go<00:01:21.920> another

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
this time possibly yeah just go another

this time possibly yeah just go another
foot<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:22.820> the<00:01:22.940> left<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:23.509> might<00:01:23.690> get<00:01:23.869> some

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
foot to the left and you might get some

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:37.990 
foot to the left and you might get some
dry<00:01:24.259> ground<00:01:24.619> there<00:01:36.550> well<00:01:37.550> there<00:01:37.670> you<00:01:37.789> have<00:01:37.820> it

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
dry ground there well there you have it

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.940 
dry ground there well there you have it
a<00:01:38.210> little<00:01:38.360> bit<00:01:38.539> of<00:01:38.630> guarding<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.320> you<00:01:39.500> can<00:01:39.710> get

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
a little bit of guarding and you can get

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.130 
a little bit of guarding and you can get
over<00:01:40.160> just<00:01:40.520> about<00:01:40.670> any<00:01:41.179> obstacle<00:01:41.990> but

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
over just about any obstacle but

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.560 
over just about any obstacle but
obviously<00:01:42.530> you<00:01:42.679> can't<00:01:42.979> guide<00:01:43.420> unless<00:01:44.420> you've

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
obviously you can't guide unless you've

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.590 
obviously you can't guide unless you've
got<00:01:44.660> one<00:01:44.810> of<00:01:44.899> these<00:01:45.020> it's<00:01:45.560> called<00:01:45.860> a<00:01:46.100> UHF<00:01:46.850> CB

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
got one of these it's called a UHF CB

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.779 
got one of these it's called a UHF CB
radio<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:48.259> it's<00:01:48.470> basically<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.340> standard

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
radio and it's basically the standard

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.200 
radio and it's basically the standard
that's<00:01:49.880> been<00:01:50.149> adopted<00:01:50.960> by<00:01:51.200> for<00:01:51.560> drivers

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
that's been adopted by for drivers

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.450 
that's been adopted by for drivers
australia-wide<00:01:53.210> now<00:01:53.929> these<00:01:54.350> items<00:01:54.649> are<00:01:55.039> good

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
australia-wide now these items are good

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.460 
australia-wide now these items are good
for<00:01:55.880> what<00:01:56.060> we<00:01:56.179> call<00:01:56.450> line<00:01:56.929> of<00:01:57.170> sight

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
for what we call line of sight

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.320 
for what we call line of sight
communication<00:01:57.580> so<00:01:58.580> if<00:01:58.700> you're<00:01:58.850> on<00:01:58.940> a<00:01:59.000> really

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
communication so if you're on a really

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.080 
communication so if you're on a really
flat<00:01:59.659> plane<00:02:00.080> these<00:02:00.619> will<00:02:00.860> go<00:02:01.009> for<00:02:01.369> up<00:02:01.610> to<00:02:01.850> five

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
flat plane these will go for up to five

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.139 
flat plane these will go for up to five
kilometres<00:02:02.750> however<00:02:03.470> in<00:02:03.770> hilly<00:02:04.130> country<00:02:04.670> if

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
kilometres however in hilly country if

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.820 
kilometres however in hilly country if
you<00:02:05.330> can't<00:02:05.599> see<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.929> person<00:02:06.110> over<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.619> next

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
you can't see the person over the next

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.400 
you can't see the person over the next
rise<00:02:07.069> then<00:02:07.700> you<00:02:08.149> also<00:02:08.390> can't<00:02:09.050> communicate

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
rise then you also can't communicate

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.210 
rise then you also can't communicate
with<00:02:09.890> them

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
with them

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.640 
with them
so<00:02:10.489> they<00:02:10.910> really<00:02:11.360> aren't<00:02:11.569> good<00:02:11.930> for<00:02:12.470> that

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
so they really aren't good for that

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.040 
so they really aren't good for that
emergency<00:02:13.010> sort<00:02:13.640> of<00:02:13.730> situation<00:02:14.360> you<00:02:14.480> still<00:02:14.540> do

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
emergency sort of situation you still do

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.070 
emergency sort of situation you still do
