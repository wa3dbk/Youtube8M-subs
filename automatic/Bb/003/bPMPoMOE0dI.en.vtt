00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.339
 you have to actually in front of everyone 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:14.130
 goddamn movie remake has to do 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:16.680
 not together because the film factory 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.350
 now there is remake to robocop and im 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.330
 By 2028, robots are already everywhere in the world 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.760
 use either for military operation 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.310
 or as policeman security and stuff 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.349
 only in america is this prohibited 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.970
 and that should be from the point of view of the company 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.599
 which makes all the parts on everyone 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.850
 change case 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.480
 and then the policeman alex murphy like that 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.250
 seriously crashed that only robots 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.110
 poor and so help it can then 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.820
 you decide to really him 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.180
 as a prototype of science too 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.100
 half robot half human being 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.960
 robocop and that too is good at first 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.000
 you also want to try that 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.710
 robots are used everywhere but 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.010
 not only the woman doubt now 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.329
 that alex murphy really still one 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.739
 has little human in it like that 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.739
 whole looks like they are the trailer 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.510
 Say the tech is alex mafia 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.800
 arrested we stand at the beginning of one 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.800
 technological revolution 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.660
 we have to give someone to the citizens 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.790
 they could accept 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.030
 a shopping baby so slowly 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.030
 smaller 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.580
 we unite human and machine 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.070
 80 percent of his body 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.990
 fourth degree burns 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.090
 if he survives that he will be saved by the 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.979
 thaya to be paralyzed down and im 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.670
 Wheelchair sitting tell you you can 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.890
 save him what does that mean? 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.890
 what my life is then before him 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.220
 what is this suit that is not a 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.220
 Suit that's what you have 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.740
 make him more aggressive best 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.740
 say in black 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.650
 if the machine fights send that 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.569
 system signals and alex brain so that 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.860
 he believes he has the control but he 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.940
 she does not have it's just the illusion 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.860
 of the enemy 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.700
 I have identified 13 targets 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:28.019
 all are looking for murder that is 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.019
 the future of crime fighting 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.190
 you have to talk to your son 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.520
 somehow yes is the programming of the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.710
 system 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.480
 the factor man always be present 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.380
 compassion fear always be instincts 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.380
 engages in the system a 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.530
 dead or alive you're going with what com 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.390
 I like science fiction movie you once 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.270
 mag is when a dystopia is pure utopia 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.740
 the future will be shown to us 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.450
 Today we should remember what we now 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.740
 in here and now maybe one 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.690
 bit wrong and in this 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.250
 case just gets both the 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.530
 media landscape of just this 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.090
 act manipulative you get are 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.040
 but also the politics and the 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.410
 Science gets you all fat away 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.240
 I as a basic message will always first 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.460
 Well, I'm also someone who likes 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.650
 something criticized and looks closer 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.300
 for example now at film as now 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.610
 Here I think that's good 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.570
 me and that he always creates the movie 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.350
 once again to set such a pulse 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.240
 at the same time is also the camera work 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.250
 and how it is not being filmed right now 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.310
 Bad also the entry succeeds completely 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.960
 All in all, the movie is complete 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.360
 from the drawing board and I think that's a pity 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.240
 because especially with this topic robocop 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.550
 can access it anywhere on any 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.440
 Security camera on every cell phone that 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.820
 you just do not do social media stuff 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.790
 with rey takes or that one is one 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.790
 few things more out of where he thinks 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.290
 it accesses this criticism of essay 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.390
 or sting all this watch 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.220
 just to bring a lot more clarity that makes 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.110
 the movie is not at all he always stays 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.060
 only on the plane year robots are yes 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.830
 no people and that's me for two 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.200
 hours of film that wants to be critical 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.190
 simply far too little the biggest problem 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.130
 but it is not that it is not 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.410
 has been refreshed in 2014 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.540
 but that the actor is already ahead 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.730
 he even has the accident so unbelievable 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.560
 emotionless and robotic like that 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.870
 Run that's me shit is that 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.490
 the accident had it so unsympathetic me 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.320
 simply have no attachment to 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.210
 figure and you do not notice any 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.620
 fall height has not previously 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.930
 facial expression and afterwards too 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.250
 thicker sg always robots and the genie 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.230
 was not there just such a couple? 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.330
 screenwriter knicks did why 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.950
 I'm a bit looser before 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.350
 a little funny that you at the tool 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.090
 raced there now really very different because on 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.490
 any case detention for the script 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.280
 Department as well as some 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.780
 cgi effects are not good if i look 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.870
 These indicate angucke in which he 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.190
 is used then he is at some 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.560
 ask really so bad as to 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.210
 the edges video racer inter-sequence 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.600
 from the computer game from the 90s 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.310
 years 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.770
 especially if you now but also the 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.680
 old films look then I know how 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.110
 Can that look like it should look like that? 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.060
 Metal suit works best and 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.550
 look that is deficient but also 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.770
 the figure drawing so all are 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.660
 totally striking it always just happens 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.340
 and back black and white as if 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.540
 i want to buy a car i want that 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.490
 man that is somehow flexible 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.740
 Go anywhere and not just anyway 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.630
 the track just on the rails 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.300
 was back and forth and at best 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.210
 too late that he is timing 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.770
 is also sow shit in the film the 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.660
 She takes it seriously so at all 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.280
 No humor in there anyway 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.360
 It is the most important science fiction film 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.850
 since blade runner 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.980
 there is a charming something 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.200
 Inside the movie soulless is also 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.240
 you realize I really can not find the movie 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.340
 well since like these one or the other 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.350
 critical aspect still be well meant 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.330
 that's about it and I have it 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.830
 more bored than that I am fine 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.440
 entertained felt that is for 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.060
 a film unfortunately right next to pack 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.890
 My personal rating is today 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.230
 I'm especially critical of being honest 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.610
 but i just want to see more and 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.340
 if i see there will be potential 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.230
 give away because there is everywhere 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.730
 moments that can be really great 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.830
 you do not do it but you are bored 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.900
 rather than me in the cinema chair 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.160
 to tie then I am disappointed and 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.340
 there is of me in this case 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.750
 also only three out of ten points and from 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.720
 I want you to know from which 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.640
 remake quarters the last time right 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.200
 blatantly disappointed write this please

 seen 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.320
