00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
weird and it's actually up higher than

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.610 
weird and it's actually up higher than
it<00:03:57.239> used<00:03:57.389> to<00:03:57.510> be<00:03:57.569> I<00:03:57.659> used<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.079> always<00:03:58.229> hit<00:03:58.500> my

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
it used to be I used to always hit my

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.219 
it used to be I used to always hit my
head<00:03:58.799> on<00:03:58.859> it<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.340> was<00:03:59.400> really<00:03:59.699> annoying

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:00.229 
head on it and it was really annoying

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:05.930 
head on it and it was really annoying
but<00:04:01.229> we<00:04:02.129> found<00:04:02.280> out<00:04:02.519> that<00:04:02.549> it<00:04:02.760> does<00:04:02.909> this<00:04:04.940> yeah

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
but we found out that it does this yeah

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.750 
but we found out that it does this yeah
you<00:04:06.000> can<00:04:06.299> like<00:04:06.479> pull<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:06.989> down<00:04:07.229> and<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:07.949> then

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
you can like pull it down and and then

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.089 
you can like pull it down and and then
you<00:04:09.199> pull<00:04:10.199> it<00:04:10.379> somehow<00:04:10.709> it<00:04:11.010> goes<00:04:11.849> back<00:04:12.510> up<00:04:13.099> it's

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
you pull it somehow it goes back up it's

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.509 
you pull it somehow it goes back up it's
I<00:04:14.519> don't<00:04:15.150> know<00:04:15.239> it's<00:04:15.419> very<00:04:15.629> odd<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:15.840> me<00:04:16.079> I<00:04:16.519> think

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
I don't know it's very odd to me I think

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.770 
I don't know it's very odd to me I think
it's<00:04:17.639> broken<00:04:17.880> because<00:04:18.239> it<00:04:18.389> doesn't<00:04:18.630> work<00:04:18.750> very

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
it's broken because it doesn't work very

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.949 
it's broken because it doesn't work very
well

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
well

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.379 
well
we<00:04:21.470> found<00:04:21.799> that<00:04:22.009> out<00:04:22.160> an<00:04:22.370> accent<00:04:22.910> like<00:04:23.000> hot

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
we found that out an accent like hot

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.590 
we found that out an accent like hot
that<00:04:23.600> he<00:04:23.750> had<00:04:23.840> broken<00:04:24.110> it<00:04:24.440> but<00:04:24.880> no<00:04:25.880> it<00:04:26.180> just<00:04:26.449> uh

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
that he had broken it but no it just uh

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.350 
that he had broken it but no it just uh
it<00:04:27.460> actually<00:04:28.460> can<00:04:28.940> move<00:04:29.180> I<00:04:31.060> don't<00:04:32.060> know<00:04:32.120> I

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
it actually can move I don't know I

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.830 
it actually can move I don't know I
think<00:04:32.509> that's<00:04:32.840> kind<00:04:33.050> of<00:04:33.080> weird<00:04:34.120> that<00:04:35.120> up<00:04:35.419> there

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
think that's kind of weird that up there

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.370 
think that's kind of weird that up there
is<00:04:36.110> our<00:04:36.380> heater<00:04:37.630> here's<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:38.720> little<00:04:38.930> remote

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
is our heater here's the little remote

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.700 
is our heater here's the little remote
controller<00:04:39.889> work<00:04:40.130> it<00:04:40.990> says<00:04:41.990> it's<00:04:42.169> 19<00:04:42.680> degrees

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
controller work it says it's 19 degrees

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.189 
controller work it says it's 19 degrees
in<00:04:43.250> here<00:04:43.460> Celsius<00:04:44.500> which<00:04:45.500> is<00:04:46.009> like<00:04:47.000> 66<00:04:47.960> degrees

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
in here Celsius which is like 66 degrees

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:51.309 
in here Celsius which is like 66 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:04:49.270> which<00:04:50.270> I<00:04:50.449> had<00:04:50.599> to<00:04:50.630> look<00:04:50.870> up<00:04:51.080> to

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:51.319 
Fahrenheit which I had to look up to

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:52.960 
Fahrenheit which I had to look up to
convert<00:04:51.680> because<00:04:52.099> I<00:04:52.130> haven't<00:04:52.520> figured<00:04:52.940> that

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
convert because I haven't figured that

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:59.050 
convert because I haven't figured that
out<00:04:53.090> yet<00:04:53.680> that's<00:04:54.680> pretty<00:04:55.009> much<00:04:55.370> it<00:04:57.099> but<00:04:58.099> it's

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
out yet that's pretty much it but it's

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.350 
out yet that's pretty much it but it's
pretty<00:04:59.240> good-sized<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:01.610> cemetery<00:05:02.120> that<00:05:02.300> I

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
pretty good-sized the cemetery that I

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.890
