 van hp from the pavilion cd v 36 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.560
 st 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.869
 this is watching it is provided with 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.369
 the public processor 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.369
 oni 3 processor is a new line of processors from intel 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.280
 which ensures that the moment when it is needed, takes it to the next level 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.400
 a kind of euro exchange rate at the moment that you have a program that always has something more 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.070
 needs can gear up easily yet he may continue to hope 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.600
 i3 processor self-supporting energy-efficient processor 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.710
 what those present have advantages with the battery 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.430
 For the sick in Africa we have become too dangerous 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.399
 I think it has a full day with that, the BBC has reported 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.190
 homes built the problems expected not yet posted 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.270
 to show up 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.350
 he has a video an extensive of 12 mb with that lies the games and 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.830
 photo editing may also be 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.830
 the problem is built in as standard 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.770
 dividend working in the event of a standstill 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.020
 that is, the operator unfortunately has the company of people with the correct date 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.590
 and the remainder 7 6 7 8 10 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.240
 a 6 cell battery the key means a user of about two and a half 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.420
 at three o'clock 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.740
 that ensures the finish in any case 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.890
 brought out enough 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.960
 Axes the box battery pack that is also the first laptop to come across very nicely 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.479
 designed hp laptop 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.469
 a beautiful design nicely finished with lighting on top 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.930
 vistas in the package a poster 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.780
 but if you end up with it says how the laptop should connect where the battery is 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.530
 must 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.190
 and things like that 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.260
 the sitting somewhat more extensive more or less manual with it is not real 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.060
 for example, there are very important information about the laptop with me 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.240
 what you have to do is actually installed to the top 

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:14.599
 the floodplains 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.680
 to see from a distance after protesters arrive at a 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.909
 these are also for charging the battery 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.399
 and finally 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.119
 I have but I have removed the battery 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.979
 It is very important when the autopsy Apple has a certain lifespan 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:33.719
 if you need your retain on the other hand 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.949
 If there is a laptop up close apart from viewers and some things that happen right away 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.089
 stand out 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:43.589
 design what I like it immediately falls on it is nicely finished with beautiful 

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:46.359
 drawings at the bottom under the keyboard 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.789
 why it is provided with a very, very good 

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:53.169
 keyboard means that it types nice and close 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:55.429
 there are letter displays built-in 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:57.159
 you will also see the berkum 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.649
 with the brunt of 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:00.829
 it is also built into the screen 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:05.569
 for the rest we have a fingerprint reader here that was at a time 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.049
 that you were not easy to use the guy who used fingerprints to get in 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.209
 to log 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.550
 if we look further 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.709
 then we have a number of connections on the side 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.269
 First of all in 44 years the FIFA port serves to make an external screen 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.019
 has to connect a television 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.969
 reporter in addition is the network port that is to connect the board 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:27.309
 in the network 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:29.759
 in addition, it is hdmi 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:32.519
 just like with the sweeping arms, the possibility is offered to connect to 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.199
 an external screen or a television is, of course, that digital image 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.169
 sit next to it 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.809
 I would call it a bad speedway port it's a port 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:46.919
 to connect an external drive to with an abvakabo brace but it is a hard one 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:50.519
 drive with uv b then this racing car could use it just to get close to 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.589
 to be able to connect a house 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:55.749
 furthermore there is still no solution for top 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:59.579
 two connections before that checked air, ie one from 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.039
 headphones and one for the microphone 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:04.769
 rbs thinks that it is on the side 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:05.839
 like a red cloth 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:08.839
 180 degree turn will now see on the other side 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.959
 two usb ports are extra 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.339
 a fire out 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:16.400
 and propose that the connection to provide an amount of power 

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:25.099
