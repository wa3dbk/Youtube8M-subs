00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.260
 today we are going to change the springs 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.689
 trunk car tires from the dci 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.930
 This will require a game of 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:21.289
 flat web storcks screwdrivers in 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.850
 star 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:29.210
 pliers pliers 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:32.899
 a box with the caps is that 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.960
 in a box for the screws and the 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.969
 springs 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.969
 let's start by opening the trunk 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.840
 To access the pier, we dismantled the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.340
 beacon for this model we will do it with a 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.390
 torque 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.390
 ricky from 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.160
 we locate the screws that are 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.160
 find on the side 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.670
 we keep them in a box 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.659
 we have already disassembled the lighthouse 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.659
 gently 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.980
 and so we see how we access the dock 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.460
 before disassembling and removing the springs 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:52.610
 let's secure the boot lid 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.680
 with a broom or a wooden stick like that 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.070
 we avoid that the door falls on the 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.070
 head 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.300
 ah 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.000
 nothing like that 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.100
 the boot lid is very heavy and 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.100
 only one pier is not enough to hold it 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.010
 now let's take out the springs and to 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.090
 we remove the clamps there 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.090
 on the bottom 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.180
 ah 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.329
 and on the top 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.329
 let go of the clamps 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.610
 we fit the dock 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.610
 above 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.100
 and below 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.950
 we remove the dock 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.010
 let's verify that they have the same 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.010
 anchorage 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.659
 up and down 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.450
 we are going to install it, you have to pay attention 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.290
 in the direction of the dock 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.950
 the thin part down and the tube 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.950
 upwards 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:26.620
 Now let's anchor the 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:29.650
 so he enters and hugs himself completely alone 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.170
 and we repeat the same operation above and 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.070
 especially remember to raise a little the 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.070
 boot door 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:45.000
 and we fit it once we verify 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.450
 installed the dock we put back 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.450
 the lighthouse 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.580
 ah 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.760
 do not 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.440
 we repeat the same operation for 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.440
 change the spring on the other side 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:34.850
 we repeat unscrewing we withdraw the 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.410
 lighthouse and we disengage once we have 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.390
 finished changing the springs 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.900
 we verify its operation for 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.900
 make sure 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.090
 we see that it holds up well we close it 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.580
 and we open it 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.200
 a very simple operation that we can 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.160
 do in 15 minutes to change the 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.160
 boot springs 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.690
 ah
