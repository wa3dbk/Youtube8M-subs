00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.720 

this<00:00:27.930> probably<00:00:28.199> gonna<00:00:28.289> take<00:00:28.470> longer<00:00:28.800> than<00:00:29.070> 10

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
around I don't know 10 minutes just

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.049 
around I don't know 10 minutes just
expect<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> part<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.450> do<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.600> guess

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
expect to have a part to do I guess

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.369

there's<00:00:42.059> no<00:00:42.180> way<00:00:42.390> that's<00:00:42.570> gonna<00:00:42.780> fit<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> 10

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379
