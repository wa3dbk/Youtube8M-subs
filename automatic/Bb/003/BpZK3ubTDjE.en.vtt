mixture now what we're gonna do is turn

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.140 
mixture now what we're gonna do is turn
off<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.379> heat<00:02:10.769> and<00:02:11.039> set<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:11.549> aside<00:02:11.609> and<00:02:11.910> let<00:02:12.120> it

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
off the heat and set it aside and let it

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.460 
off the heat and set it aside and let it
cool<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.480> little<00:02:12.599> bit<00:02:13.940> in<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.810> meantime<00:02:15.989> go

using my hands here but you can use an

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:28.740 
using my hands here but you can use an
egg<00:02:21.420> separator

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.660 

I'm<00:02:29.750> just<00:02:29.989> gonna<00:02:30.079> go<00:02:30.290> ahead<00:02:30.409> here<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.280> beat<00:02:31.519> up

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
I'm just gonna go ahead here and beat up

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.809 
I'm just gonna go ahead here and beat up
two<00:02:31.879> of<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.000> Oaks<00:02:32.269> and<00:02:33.400> add<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.579> to<00:02:34.610> the

two of the Oaks and add it to the
chocolate<00:02:35.239> mixture<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:35.569> what<00:02:35.780> this<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:36.079> gonna

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
chocolate mixture and what this is gonna

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.120 
chocolate mixture and what this is gonna
do<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.739> thicken<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.220> up<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.430> little<00:02:37.549> bit

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.290 

okay<00:02:44.130> once<00:02:44.490> you've<00:02:44.640> done<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:44.850> you're<00:02:45.180> gonna

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
okay once you've done that you're gonna

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.420 
okay once you've done that you're gonna
take<00:02:45.570> your<00:02:45.660> electric<00:02:46.110> mixer<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.770> beat<00:02:47.280> the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
take your electric mixer and beat the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.790 
take your electric mixer and beat the
egg<00:02:47.550> whites<00:02:47.790> over<00:02:47.940> high<00:02:48.270> speed<00:02:48.750> for<00:02:49.110> about<00:02:49.530> 10

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
egg whites over high speed for about 10

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.350 
egg whites over high speed for about 10
seconds<00:02:50.370> just<00:02:50.400> until<00:02:50.880> it's<00:02:51.150> foamy<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.510> bubbly

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
seconds just until it's foamy and bubbly

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.300 
seconds just until it's foamy and bubbly
then<00:02:54.360> add<00:02:54.570> in<00:02:54.600> 2<00:02:55.050> tablespoons<00:02:55.260> of<00:02:55.740> sugar<00:02:55.800> and

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
then add in 2 tablespoons of sugar and

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.800 
then add in 2 tablespoons of sugar and
continue<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.940> beat<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.210> for<00:02:57.360> another<00:02:57.540> minute

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
continue to beat it for another minute

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.620 
continue to beat it for another minute
or<00:02:58.020> so<00:02:58.460> you<00:02:59.460> could<00:02:59.610> also<00:02:59.730> use<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.030> wire<00:03:00.360> whisk

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
or so you could also use a wire whisk

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.570 
or so you could also use a wire whisk
and<00:03:00.870> achieve<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.290> same<00:03:01.320> results<00:03:01.980> it's<00:03:02.160> just<00:03:02.430> a

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
and achieve the same results it's just a

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.860 
and achieve the same results it's just a
little<00:03:02.820> more<00:03:02.940> labor-intensive<00:03:08.720> until<00:03:09.720> you

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
little more labor-intensive until you

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.610 
little more labor-intensive until you
get<00:03:10.080> nice<00:03:10.590> stiff<00:03:10.980> peaks<00:03:11.250> something<00:03:12.060> like<00:03:12.240> this

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
get nice stiff peaks something like this

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.810 
get nice stiff peaks something like this
so<00:03:13.620> when<00:03:13.740> you<00:03:13.830> pull<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.100> paddle<00:03:14.430> out<00:03:14.550> it

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
so when you pull the paddle out it

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.210 
so when you pull the paddle out it
maintains<00:03:15.330> its<00:03:15.540> shape<00:03:15.600> doesn't<00:03:16.290> collapse<00:03:16.770> and

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
maintains its shape doesn't collapse and

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.070 
maintains its shape doesn't collapse and
there's<00:03:17.520> no<00:03:17.820> liquidy<00:03:18.300> substance<00:03:18.540> in<00:03:18.990> the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
there's no liquidy substance in the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.490 
there's no liquidy substance in the
bottom<00:03:19.350> of<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.500> bowl<00:03:20.870> now<00:03:21.870> what<00:03:22.020> I'm<00:03:22.110> gonna<00:03:22.230> do

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
bottom of the bowl now what I'm gonna do

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.380 
bottom of the bowl now what I'm gonna do
is<00:03:22.800> take<00:03:23.040> 1/3<00:03:23.550> of<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.700> egg<00:03:23.850> whites<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.330> fold

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390

them<00:03:24.960> into<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.230> chocolate<00:03:25.500> mixture<00:03:32.870> then<00:03:33.870> I'm

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
them into the chocolate mixture then I'm

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.050 
them into the chocolate mixture then I'm
gonna<00:03:34.110> take<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.440> second<00:03:34.830> third<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.340> fold<00:03:35.880> it

gonna take the second third and fold it

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:45.809 
gonna take the second third and fold it
in<00:03:36.180> again

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.559

and of course the last third and do the

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.890 
and of course the last third and do the
same<00:03:49.930> thing<00:03:50.200> again<00:03:50.349> you<00:03:51.540> don't<00:03:52.540> want<00:03:52.780> to

on a baking tray and we're gonna fill it
just<00:04:10.790> to<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.150> first<00:04:11.360> ridge<00:04:11.630> of<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.840> ramekin

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
just to the first ridge of the ramekin

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.960 
just to the first ridge of the ramekin
you<00:04:12.380> go<00:04:12.530> a<00:04:12.560> little<00:04:12.860> bit<00:04:13.069> over<00:04:13.340> if<00:04:13.459> you<00:04:13.580> want<00:04:13.760> but

don't fill it all the way to the top

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.960 
don't fill it all the way to the top
otherwise<00:04:15.800> it's<00:04:16.010> gonna<00:04:16.160> spill<00:04:16.489> it's<00:04:16.700> gonna<00:04:16.850> be

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
otherwise it's gonna spill it's gonna be

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:25.870 
otherwise it's gonna spill it's gonna be
all<00:04:17.209> over<00:04:17.510> your<00:04:17.630> oven<00:04:24.550> then<00:04:25.550> we're<00:04:25.700> going<00:04:25.820> to

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
all over your oven then we're going to

all over your oven then we're going to
place<00:04:26.060> our<00:04:26.210> souffles<00:04:26.720> on<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.110> lowest<00:04:27.530> rack

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
place our souffles on the lowest rack

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.909 
place our souffles on the lowest rack
about<00:04:28.150> 375<00:04:29.150> degree<00:04:29.419> preheated<00:04:29.690> oven<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:30.440> bake
