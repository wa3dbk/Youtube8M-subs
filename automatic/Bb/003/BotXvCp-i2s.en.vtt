00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.490 
like that so yeah zoom quite impressed
with<00:02:17.420> this<00:02:17.510> month<00:02:17.810> it's<00:02:17.989> probably<00:02:18.230> one<00:02:18.349> of<00:02:18.379> the

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
with this month it's probably one of the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.610 
with this month it's probably one of the
better<00:02:18.680> ones<00:02:18.799> oom<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:20.120> think<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.569> soon<00:02:20.870> set

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
better ones oom and I think it soon set

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.740 
better ones oom and I think it soon set
somewhere<00:02:22.040> in<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.340> Far<00:02:22.610> East<00:02:22.849> I<00:02:23.180> do<00:02:23.599> buy

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
somewhere in the Far East I do buy

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.380 
somewhere in the Far East I do buy
something<00:02:24.319> like<00:02:24.349> that<00:02:24.709> this<00:02:24.860> map<00:02:25.159> him<00:02:26.090> and

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
something like that this map him and

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.480 
something like that this map him and
just<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.780> quick<00:02:26.930> know<00:02:27.170> there<00:02:27.530> is<00:02:27.620> some<00:02:27.890> water<00:02:28.190> on

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
just a quick know there is some water on

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.339 
just a quick know there is some water on
the<00:02:28.730> outside<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.450> map<00:02:29.569> and<00:02:29.810> if<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.230> do

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
the outside of the map and if you do

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.350 
the outside of the map and if you do
jump<00:02:30.680> in<00:02:30.830> there<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.130> does<00:02:31.310> kill<00:02:31.580> you

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
jump in there it does kill you

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.330 
jump in there it does kill you
I<00:02:32.420> did<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:33.020> actually<00:02:33.170> well<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.680> did<00:02:34.010> that<00:02:34.190> the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
I did that actually well I did that the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.400 
I did that actually well I did that the
beginning<00:02:34.700> in<00:02:34.760> this<00:02:34.850> game<00:02:35.090> but<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:36.020> got<00:02:36.200> about

three minutes in and then the host

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.450 
three minutes in and then the host
decided<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.630> leave<00:02:38.810> so<00:02:39.140> on<00:02:39.350> theater<00:02:40.250> Modi

think<00:03:11.510> is<00:03:11.780> pretty<00:03:12.020> good<00:03:12.260> six<00:03:12.590> me<00:03:12.739> first<00:03:12.950> go<00:03:13.130> on

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
think is pretty good six me first go on

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.150 
think is pretty good six me first go on
the<00:03:13.340> map<00:03:13.550> and<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:14.780> know<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.410> game<00:03:15.590> plays<00:03:15.890> not

investment of light 35-pound you're

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.420 
investment of light 35-pound you're
better<00:03:44.269> off<00:03:44.360> just<00:03:44.720> getting<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:45.140> maps<00:03:45.380> as<00:03:45.769> and

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
better off just getting the maps as and

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.860 
better off just getting the maps as and
when<00:03:46.549> they<00:03:46.670> come<00:03:46.850> out<00:03:46.970> I<00:03:47.120> know<00:03:47.180> it's<00:03:47.510> going<00:03:47.780> to

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
when they come out I know it's going to

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.979 
when they come out I know it's going to
cost<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:48.170> same<00:03:48.380> price<00:03:48.709> bought<00:03:49.750> just<00:03:50.750> get<00:03:50.900> them

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
cost the same price bought just get them

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.180 
cost the same price bought just get them
when<00:03:51.110> they<00:03:51.200> come<00:03:51.350> out<00:03:51.500> but<00:03:51.830> actually<00:03:51.950> I

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
when they come out but actually I

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.620 
when they come out but actually I
wouldn't<00:03:52.430> even<00:03:52.670> get<00:03:52.880> them<00:03:53.060> ups<00:03:53.239> because<00:03:53.480> these

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
wouldn't even get them ups because these

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.080 
wouldn't even get them ups because these
games<00:03:53.930> that<00:03:54.380> messed<00:03:54.830> up<00:03:55.100> anyway<00:03:55.280> like<00:03:55.820> I'm

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090
