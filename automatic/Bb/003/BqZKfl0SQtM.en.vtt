00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
easy and a lot of finger foods but I try

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.610 
easy and a lot of finger foods but I try
to<00:00:47.309> avoid<00:00:47.760> things<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.480> require<00:00:48.840> utensils

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
to avoid things that require utensils

that you can hand off to someone you can

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.429 
that you can hand off to someone you can
make<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.210> couple<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.720> them<00:01:06.900> give<00:01:07.049> them<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.320> the

make a couple of them give them to the
kids<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.070> then<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.580> know<00:01:08.700> you're<00:01:08.850> not

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
kids and then you know you're not

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.420 
kids and then you know you're not
reaching<00:01:09.150> across<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.049> tracking<00:01:10.799> sand<00:01:11.159> and

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
reaching across and tracking sand and

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.800 
reaching across and tracking sand and
getting<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> little<00:01:11.939> sandy<00:01:12.180> fingers<00:01:12.510> and

getting a little sandy fingers and

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.090 
getting a little sandy fingers and
things<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.500> tougher<00:01:13.710> where<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> better

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
things so it's tougher where a better

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.920 
things so it's tougher where a better
idea<00:01:14.490> then<00:01:14.700> let's<00:01:15.119> say<00:01:15.270> taking<00:01:15.570> like<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.720> brown

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
idea then let's say taking like a brown

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.289 
idea then let's say taking like a brown
paper<00:01:16.110> bag<00:01:16.290> I'm<00:01:17.100> either<00:01:17.430> one<00:01:17.759> whatever<00:01:18.150> is

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
paper bag I'm either one whatever is

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.850 
paper bag I'm either one whatever is
easiest<00:01:18.659> for<00:01:18.930> something<00:01:19.229> like<00:01:19.409> hummus<00:01:19.830> you

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
easiest for something like hummus you

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.370 
easiest for something like hummus you
can<00:01:20.189> do<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:21.270> sandwiches<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.080> can<00:01:22.200> wrap

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
can do that for sandwiches you can wrap

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.370 
can do that for sandwiches you can wrap
it<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.590> parchment<00:01:22.830> paper<00:01:23.310> or<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.869> know<00:01:24.990> throw

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380
