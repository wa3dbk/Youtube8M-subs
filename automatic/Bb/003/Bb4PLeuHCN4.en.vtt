not that long ago and I never use it
actually<00:00:28.800> but<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.820> like<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.000> big<00:00:30.289> variant

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
I like a big open and it looks but as an

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.940 
I like a big open and it looks but as an
iPhone<00:00:35.630> which<00:00:36.630> come<00:00:37.079> like<00:00:37.380> would<00:00:37.649> be<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> little

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
iPhone which come like would be a little

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.690 
iPhone which come like would be a little
bit<00:00:38.010> interesting

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
bit interesting

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.610 
bit interesting
I<00:00:38.730> don't<00:00:39.149> think<00:00:39.239> personally<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.079> Apple<00:00:40.440> will

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
I don't think personally that Apple will

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.770 
I don't think personally that Apple will
do<00:00:40.800> something<00:00:41.100> like<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.660> definitely

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
do something like this but it definitely

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.270 
do something like this but it definitely
would<00:00:43.290> be<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.469> little<00:00:43.649> bit<00:00:43.710> interesting<00:00:43.980> you

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
would be a little bit interesting you

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.940 
would be a little bit interesting you
can<00:00:44.460> see<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.700> here<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.090> comparison<00:00:45.950> against

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
can see it here in a comparison against

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.150 
can see it here in a comparison against
the<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> current<00:00:47.550> iPhone<00:00:48.000> 5s<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.890> kind<00:00:50.129> of

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the a current iPhone 5s you can kind of

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.510 
the a current iPhone 5s you can kind of
see<00:00:50.399> here<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.329> has<00:00:51.539> less<00:00:52.379> like<00:00:52.680> holes<00:00:53.070> in

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
see here that it has less like holes in

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.310 
see here that it has less like holes in
the<00:00:53.610> grille<00:00:53.850> there<00:00:54.149> down<00:00:54.840> at<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.050> bottom

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the grille there down at the bottom

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.110 
the grille there down at the bottom
would<00:00:55.980> be<00:00:56.100> pretty<00:00:56.340> cool<00:00:56.520> if<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.760> had<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.090> a

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
would be pretty cool if it had like a

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.180 
would be pretty cool if it had like a
stereo<00:00:57.539> speaker<00:00:57.600> sound<00:00:58.109> there<00:00:58.320> if<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.920> listen

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
stereo speaker sound there if you listen

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.549 
stereo speaker sound there if you listen
to<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.340> guy<00:00:59.489> from<00:00:59.670> 5<00:00:59.910> and<00:00:59.940> 5s<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.140> front<00:01:01.379> side

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
to a guy from 5 and 5s the on front side

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.049 
to a guy from 5 and 5s the on front side
you<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.829> see<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.190> only<00:01:02.280> comes<00:01:02.550> down<00:01:02.789> from

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
you can see that it only comes down from

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.539 
you can see that it only comes down from
one<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.390> those<00:01:03.510> sides<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.979> looks<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.400> little

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
one of those sides so it looks a little

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.899 
one of those sides so it looks a little
bit<00:01:05.729> random<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.770> then<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.549> also<00:01:08.670> see

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
bit random and then you can also see

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.690 
bit random and then you can also see
that<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.710> one<00:01:10.710> very<00:01:10.950> very<00:01:11.159> cool<00:01:11.310> thing<00:01:11.520> is

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
that the one very very cool thing is

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.179 
that the one very very cool thing is
that<00:01:11.790> headphones<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:13.140> way<00:01:13.439> more<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
that headphones is that way more to the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.910 
that headphones is that way more to the
left<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:15.119> time<00:01:15.330> around<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.500> problem

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
left this time around and the problem

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.490 
left this time around and the problem
will<00:01:17.070> be<00:01:17.100> kind<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.460> cool<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:18.110> like<00:01:19.110> how<00:01:19.439> the

compared<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.009> an<00:01:35.159> iPhone<00:01:35.520> 5<00:01:35.759> or<00:01:35.790> 5s<00:01:36.710> you<00:01:37.710> can

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
compared to an iPhone 5 or 5s you can

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.800 
compared to an iPhone 5 or 5s you can
still<00:01:38.070> see<00:01:38.369> also<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.820> has<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> fingerprint

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
still see also that has a fingerprint

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.870 
still see also that has a fingerprint
reader<00:01:39.960> they<00:01:40.829> were<00:01:41.009> pretty<00:01:41.310> cool<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.729> had

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
reader they were pretty cool if it had

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.319 
reader they were pretty cool if it had
like<00:01:42.090> iOS<00:01:42.420> 8<00:01:42.950> or<00:01:43.950> probably<00:01:44.520> one<00:01:44.700> out<00:01:44.790> but<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.210> was

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
like iOS 8 or probably one out but I was

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.440 
like iOS 8 or probably one out but I was
eight<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.840> then<00:01:47.090> be<00:01:48.090> able<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.329> use

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
eight and then be able to use

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.270 
eight and then be able to use
fingerprint<00:01:48.990> reader<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:49.590> more<00:01:49.770> stuff<00:01:50.009> maybe

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
fingerprint reader for more stuff maybe

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.289 
fingerprint reader for more stuff maybe
to<00:01:50.490> pay<00:01:50.759> Paul

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
to pay Paul

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.510
