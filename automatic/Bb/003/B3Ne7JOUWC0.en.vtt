Hi there, it’s Rafatu from PortalGitarowy.pl

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.840
Today, we’re doing test of a real monster delivering low-tuned growl - Ibanez RGIB6.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:27.940
Baritone guitar with 28” scale length, body made out of basswood, neck out of maple and bubinga.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.660
Rosewood fretboard with 24 jumbo frets.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:40.580
Pickups are EMG Active Humbuckers - 60 for the neck pickup and for the bridge 81.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:47.720
Operating controls is as easy as taking candy from a baby – it’s only master volume and 3-way pickup selector.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:55.080
Besides, Ibanez treats us with killswitch – about its usefulness you will find out during the test.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.280
For all fans of low-tuning, it’s an instrument perfect for researching new sounds.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:38.760
Its pickups are powerful enough to play truly rough parts in standard overdrive, we haven’t switched on high gain until solos.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.560
For the test we tuned the guitar quite uncommonly – string pitches were H, E, A, d, g and h.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:55.520
If you lower string g to f# you'll receive tuning manually similar to the standard one.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:03.780
Thanks to that you can play basic chords and play with chords lowered a fourth.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.700
Instrument makes great impression visually and delights with its bottom sound band.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.780
Only 4x12, a bit of gain and have fun. Thanks.
