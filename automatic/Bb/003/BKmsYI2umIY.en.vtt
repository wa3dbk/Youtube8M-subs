00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.420
 my name is baptist dirty his 20 years 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.110
 I am a mechanic airplane collection and 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.110
 pilots 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.900
 john a family who is in the hÃ©rault 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.509
 nautical since made in India there are 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.649
 my grandfather made his first flights 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.649
 in 1913 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:48.420
 well what do these good Baptist sleeve the 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.420
 morning wanted him hatch 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.670
 that's good 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.230
 hallett and now auto mechanic 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.030
 restorers is that maintenance the 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.040
 machine it is ensured that it remains the 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.080
 as long as possible in the most beautiful 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:10.509
 possible state keeping this page 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:13.119
 of history we are admirer of 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.360
 employment the age of painting the 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.130
 carpentry the first step to make 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.600
 of the canvas we make sure of the good state of 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.550
 the surface on which we will apply 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.200
 the canvas once it's the surface 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.830
 and prepare to pass glue on 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.740
 from that glue to dry one applies to 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.210
 do on the surface is the material this 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.860
 time and then we can there 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.860
 apply a paint of our choice 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.399
 my uncle george he has arrived 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.460
 a decade ago the mules 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.689
 we brought his knowledge about this type of 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.350
 machine which is therefore machines 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.060
 US 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.060
 it's a plane of the second war 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.649
 world it was a hunter the pilots 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.710
 who was driving at that time had it a 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.570
 plane that was in the position is almost 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.479
 so bind some form of friendship 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.119
 with with this plane if you want because 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.909
 that every morning if he came back on 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.679
 evening it was thanks to this machine that 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.540
 their strong luck so they will have it 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:14.849
 you really is a personality the 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.519
 little black crosses that are on the 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:20.790
 flank of the device so that's the 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.140
 number of device wins so at 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.049
 each victory added a small 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:31.950
 cross that corresponds to an enemy shot down 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:34.709
 olic plugged battery patriot 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.540
 now here are four pages and despite 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.540
 his card in the confines in the bowl is 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.280
 we turn the blades to see the engine 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.650
 if it is not blocked if there is no 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.680
 suspicious noise if it works 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.989
 to appear okay it's a medium that 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.000
 is still very very user-friendly 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.800
 purpose is to commune with others 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.810
 people so to get out the plane 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.670
 but always two or three for my 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.750
 time at the beginning I have to have a 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.190
 someone who gives me a hand 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.780
 because I can not meat is 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.500
 not equipped with a starter so it is necessary that 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.820
 I have a friend who throws me the lilies 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.310
 before each departure have gone around 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.920
 the plane to see if as a result of the 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:16.360
 last flight of the coins did not let go 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.100
 are not been deformed cd step 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.710
 essential to go on a flight 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.020
 you do not have to be rushed you have to be 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.500
 relaxed when we go steal the goal thierry 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.300
 human and it's a German plane 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.620
 training and German aerobatics 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:35.380
 which dates from 1930 36 37 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.330
 so it's a plane that's famous for 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.870
 his orders that are very very 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.870
 pleasant 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.020
 which is certain is that once we 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.600
 is in the plane that the engine turns on 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.110
 will fly you feel more tired or 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.980
 you do not feel pain in the back of an evil 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.210
 somewhere worries we think more 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.540
 that at the right moment 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.540
 we are going to pass 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.900
 all the wonderful part we communicate 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.480
 with the machine 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:33.139
 we feel that she has to take back 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.500
 speed she needs to have a 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.669
 little more than engine laps 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.330
 she wants to breathe fresh air 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:43.149
 we go up we start to flutter you 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.770
 try not to rush her 

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:47.770
 e.on pilot stroking the machine 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.200
 we have no margin of error because 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.320
 it's not like on old 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.760
 cars or actually this engine boils 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.800
 loose or something you stop 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.320
 on the side of the road then to the limit 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.210
 you call a tow truck there when we 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.650
 arises in chances and not that it's 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.490
 very serious but it's still 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.490
 a lot more boring 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.240
 there are mounted ruins because 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.500
 we have sensations anyway 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:25.760
 that they are strong enough but we 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.760
 not looking for fear at all 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.470
 the only purpose of el maali what is it 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.520
 sad to say but there is that agents 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:40.280
 who knows center of my life that i'm doing 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.699
 that I live on the airfield 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.080
 you get me up there are the deputies I'm 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:47.650
 layer overnight where there is 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.650
 again the winners 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.400
 Oh 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.980
 you 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.289
 you 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.289
 x
