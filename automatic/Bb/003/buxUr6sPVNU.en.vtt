00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.160
For the past eight years, the residents of San Francisco Xochicuautla

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.260
have been involved in a legal dispute over the construction of the Toluca-Naucalpan highway,

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.660
which, in one of its stretches, would pass through communal lands and small properties,

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.240
affecting acres of forest and homes.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.080
Immediately after hearing the announcement,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.000
the community of San Francisco Xochicuautla, an otomeí indigenous population,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.100
manifested against this construction project

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.340
because of the repercussions it would have particularly on their lands, territories, and homes.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.240
Undeniably, the highway passes directly over the town.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.540
The people who have resided in these lands for thousands of years are indigenous otomí,

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.520
and despite the fact that the constitution requires the government to consult about these types of projects

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.740
in the original communities, or indigenous towns,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.700
the residents say they were never consulted with.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.520
In was one afternoon that I saw the engineers, just as they are now,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.480
with no otomeí permission,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.100
I went up to them and asked them what they were doing out here,

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:32.460
which is when they told me they were working on the Toluca-Naucalpan highway project,

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.680
and that it was a private highway.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.120
They're going to take our lands.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.600
And, truthfully, those lands are fountains of work for the town.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:58.840
For example, here people collect mushrooms and salvage fallen wood for the sustenance of the town.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.460
Despite the fact that the community was granted protection

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.720
by the Unitary Tribunal of Agriculture in 2014 against the highway project,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.500
a few weeks ago,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.560
the Autobahn construction company, a subsidiary of Tella and Higa Group, resumed construction in the area.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.120
This will have an environmental impact of unimaginable magnitude.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:30.680
At least 13.5 linear kilometers would be destroyed of their natural forest, of virgin forest.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.980
This is an indigenous community, and as a result,

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.320
all previous consultation with the community must be complete before construction can begin.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:46.300
since it is indisputable that a project of this size would affect daily life in this town,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.300
which is home to at least 15,000 residents.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.520
The third strong argument is that of the human right to water.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:05.760
These forests collect in the form of groundwater at least 30% of the water that is distributed

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.260
not only in the region, but also in the cities of Mexico (D.F.), and of Toluca.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.080
What the state government has done, along with the Higa enterprise,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:23.560
has been to come in with significant amounts of money to try to bribe a good number of communal landowners

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.360
so that they will agree to turn in their lands.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.240
One assembly of communal landowners gave permission for the introduction of the highway.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.340
The problem is that the assembly of landowners doesn´t necessarily represent

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.760
the interests and feelings of the population.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.120
There are no more than 800 registered communal landowners,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.120
with a total population of approximately 15,000.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.980
This does hurt us because if we are taking care of the land,

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:59.460
when we fell a tree, we need to cultivate in order to create more vegetation.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:06.780
Believe me that the effect of (the project) would be deadly.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.440
Currently, for opposing themselves to the construction,

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.400
there are 22 legal cases open against residents of San Francisco Xochicuautla.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.100
The 22 partners that have detained from the side of opposition

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:29.080
have all had charges filed against them for the crime of opposition to a public project.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.820
Some of them are also being accused of aggression or injury against authorities.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.260
All 22 cases are open penal processes.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:45.980
The truth is that today, a sum can be paid to the authorities

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.940
so that at the moment when a decision is made,

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.540
the authorities can be influenced to apprehend or bring further witnesses against the defendants of the town.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.800
This, from our point of view, comes only with the intent to intimidate the rest of the community

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.820
so that they will not protest, so they will not get in the way.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.460
The otomí community of San Francisco Xochicuautla has continued the legal process to defend its land for the past eight years.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.120
Even so, a few weeks ago, Autobahn, a subsidiary of Higa Group, resumed its project with support from police forces of the State of Mexico.
