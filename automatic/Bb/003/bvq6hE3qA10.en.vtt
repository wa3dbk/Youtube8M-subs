which<00:01:19.549> I<00:01:19.670> think<00:01:19.880> was<00:01:19.999> just<00:01:20.270> incredibly

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
which I think was just incredibly

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.969 
which I think was just incredibly
brilliant<00:01:21.380> was<00:01:22.249> that<00:01:22.399> he<00:01:22.609> took<00:01:22.880> a<00:01:23.979> vinyl

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
brilliant was that he took a vinyl

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.069 
brilliant was that he took a vinyl
flooring<00:01:25.399> tile<00:01:25.880> that<00:01:26.209> was<00:01:26.329> marble<00:01:26.719> and

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
flooring tile that was marble and

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.230 
flooring tile that was marble and
actually<00:01:27.770> made<00:01:27.950> that'd<00:01:28.130> be<00:01:28.279> the<00:01:28.429> flooring<00:01:28.909> for

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
actually made that'd be the flooring for

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.519 
actually made that'd be the flooring for
the<00:01:29.889> Gothic<00:01:30.889> piece<00:01:31.099> of<00:01:31.279> scenery<00:01:31.569> it<00:01:32.569> just<00:01:32.779> that

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:33.529 
the Gothic piece of scenery it just that

often attach them to this building by
using<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.450> children's<00:02:30.750> glue<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.560> means<00:02:31.920> that

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
using the children's glue it means that

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.910 
using the children's glue it means that
I<00:02:32.760> don't<00:02:33.060> have<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.629> worry<00:02:33.870> about<00:02:33.989> permanently

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
I don't have to worry about permanently

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.350 
I don't have to worry about permanently
adhering<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:36.739> different<00:02:37.739> pieces<00:02:37.920> together

children's<00:02:39.360> glue<00:02:39.599> is<00:02:39.780> washable<00:02:40.500> if<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:41.040> were<00:02:41.250> to

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
children's glue is washable if I were to

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.880 
children's glue is washable if I were to
apply<00:02:41.610> any<00:02:41.879> pressure<00:02:42.269> whatsoever<00:02:42.739> really<00:02:43.739> to

this<00:02:44.040> piece<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.819> would<00:02:45.000> snap<00:02:45.209> right<00:02:45.450> off<00:02:45.629> and<00:02:45.780> I

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
this piece it would snap right off and I

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.479 
this piece it would snap right off and I
could<00:02:46.019> just<00:02:46.170> clean<00:02:46.349> the<00:02:46.470> glue<00:02:46.680> up<00:02:46.859> so<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.370> way

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
could just clean the glue up so that way

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.599 
could just clean the glue up so that way
you<00:02:47.549> can<00:02:47.849> it<00:02:48.180> makes<00:02:48.540> it<00:02:48.659> nice<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.470> carry<00:02:50.370> things

Imperial is has a very gothic base theme
I<00:03:04.769> thought<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.340> would<00:03:05.639> take<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.819> break<00:03:06.090> from

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
I thought I would take a break from

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.020 
I thought I would take a break from
building<00:03:06.690> neckline<00:03:07.230> terrain<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:08.030> do

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
building neckline terrain and do

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.330 
building neckline terrain and do
something<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.709> was<00:03:10.709> much<00:03:10.889> more<00:03:11.129> in<00:03:11.190> line

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
something that was much more in line

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.550 
something that was much more in line
with<00:03:11.579> the<00:03:11.700> Imperial<00:03:12.120> horses<00:03:12.450> we're<00:03:13.230> trying<00:03:13.440> to

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
with the Imperial horses we're trying to

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.140 
with the Imperial horses we're trying to
take<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.739> look<00:03:13.950> at<00:03:14.069> how<00:03:14.159> we<00:03:14.220> can<00:03:14.430> employ<00:03:14.790> these

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
take a look at how we can employ these

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.569 
take a look at how we can employ these
buildings<00:03:15.810> into<00:03:16.230> an<00:03:16.500> apocalypse<00:03:17.010> mission<00:03:17.459> in

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
buildings into an apocalypse mission in

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.199 
buildings into an apocalypse mission in
the<00:03:17.670> future<00:03:18.590> also<00:03:19.590> dales<00:03:20.489> kinda<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.030> back

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
the future also dales kinda in the back

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.240 
the future also dales kinda in the back
end<00:03:21.449> of<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:21.660> so<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.079> you<00:03:22.919> can<00:03:23.069> definitely

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
end of this so that you can definitely

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.550 
end of this so that you can definitely
have<00:03:23.579> guys<00:03:23.760> in<00:03:24.000> there<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.449> it'd<00:03:24.540> be<00:03:24.750> bunker

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
have guys in there and it'd be bunker

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.099 
have guys in there and it'd be bunker
esque<00:03:25.849> night<00:03:26.849> and<00:03:27.030> cover<00:03:27.209> saves<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.810> whatnot

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
esque night and cover saves and whatnot

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.490 
esque night and cover saves and whatnot
so<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.739> can<00:03:28.919> put<00:03:29.099> people<00:03:29.359> in<00:03:30.359> the<00:03:30.690> back<00:03:30.930> it's

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
so you can put people in the back it's

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.170 
so you can put people in the back it's
not<00:03:31.650> just<00:03:31.980> something<00:03:32.310> that's<00:03:32.459> on<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:32.849> table

the characters are actually able to

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.099 
the characters are actually able to
interact<00:03:35.940> with<00:03:36.209> this<00:03:36.449> right<00:03:36.629> here<00:03:36.840> I<00:03:36.870> can<00:03:37.079> put

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
interact with this right here I can put

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.189 
little guy in here you can have a couple
people<00:03:46.470> standing<00:03:46.859> out<00:03:47.010> here<00:03:47.040> on<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.489> terrace

people standing out here on the terrace
if<00:03:49.829> you<00:03:50.040> have<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.370> ladder<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.879> ladder<00:03:50.910> is

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
if you have the ladder the ladder is

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.539 
if you have the ladder the ladder is
basically<00:03:51.720> about<00:03:51.989> four<00:03:52.590> inches<00:03:52.889> long<00:03:53.129> so<00:03:53.459> you

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
basically about four inches long so you

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:54.920 
basically about four inches long so you
could<00:03:53.819> make<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.090> part<00:03:54.359> of<00:03:54.389> your<00:03:54.480> movement

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
could make that part of your movement

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.509 
could make that part of your movement
phase<00:03:55.169> or<00:03:55.560> you<00:03:55.650> could<00:03:55.829> roll<00:03:56.010> it<00:03:56.190> into<00:03:56.280> Sam

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
phase or you could roll it into Sam

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.369 
phase or you could roll it into Sam
going<00:03:56.699> up<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.060> ladder<00:03:57.239> or<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.629> know<00:03:57.750> it's<00:03:58.199> an

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
going up the ladder or you know it's an

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.080 
going up the ladder or you know it's an
elevator<00:03:58.769> whatever<00:03:59.220> it's<00:03:59.400> just<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.579> way<00:03:59.699> to<00:03:59.760> let

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
elevator whatever it's just a way to let

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.699 
elevator whatever it's just a way to let
people<00:04:00.209> know<00:04:00.359> that<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:01.109> can't<00:04:01.349> actually<00:04:01.500> get

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
people know that you can't actually get

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.939 
people know that you can't actually get
from<00:04:01.829> level<00:04:02.099> to<00:04:02.159> level<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.569> I<00:04:04.230> really

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:04.949 
from level to level and the I really

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:08.830 
from level to level and the I really
like<00:04:05.159> how<00:04:05.430> Dale's<00:04:06.299> built<00:04:06.599> these<00:04:07.220> terraces<00:04:08.220> for
