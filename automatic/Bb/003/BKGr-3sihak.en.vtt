00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.390 
strikes me this is a scale body so we
have<00:01:58.420> separated<00:01:59.080> body<00:01:59.230> panels<00:01:59.740> this<00:02:00.250> is<00:02:00.370> a

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
have separated body panels this is a

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.220 
have separated body panels this is a
body<00:02:00.610> panel<00:02:01.030> this<00:02:01.300> is<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.480> body<00:02:01.690> panel<00:02:01.900> you<00:02:02.140> got

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
body panel this is a body panel you got

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.560 
body panel this is a body panel you got
two<00:02:02.440> on<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.680> rear<00:02:02.920> so<00:02:03.640> as<00:02:03.760> you<00:02:03.940> damage<00:02:04.480> these

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
two on the rear so as you damage these

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.550 
two on the rear so as you damage these
and<00:02:04.750> break<00:02:04.900> them<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.110> can<00:02:05.230> place<00:02:05.440> them

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
and break them you can place them

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.740 
and break them you can place them
individually<00:02:06.130> on<00:02:06.280> top<00:02:06.970> of<00:02:07.150> that<00:02:07.270> all<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.540> body

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
individually on top of that all the body

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.820 
individually on top of that all the body
panels<00:02:08.020> sit<00:02:08.440> on<00:02:08.590> top<00:02:08.860> of<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.520> giant<00:02:10.149> roll<00:02:10.480> cage

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
panels sit on top of a giant roll cage

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.140 
panels sit on top of a giant roll cage
so<00:02:11.830> you<00:02:11.890> don't<00:02:12.130> have<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.370> worry<00:02:12.550> about<00:02:12.640> the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
so you don't have to worry about the

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.850 
so you don't have to worry about the
body<00:02:13.360> taken<00:02:13.780> most<00:02:13.960> of<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.140> hit<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.500> roll<00:02:14.680> cage

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
body taken most of the hit the roll cage

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.140 
body taken most of the hit the roll cage
will<00:02:15.130> help<00:02:15.900> absorb<00:02:16.900> all<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.680> impact<00:02:18.150> that

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
will help absorb all the impact that

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.180 
will help absorb all the impact that
this<00:02:19.450> 30-plus<00:02:20.170> pound<00:02:20.500> vehicle<00:02:20.950> is<00:02:21.010> going<00:02:21.130> to

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
this 30-plus pound vehicle is going to

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.440 
this 30-plus pound vehicle is going to
see<00:02:23.460> there's<00:02:24.460> probably<00:02:24.760> body<00:02:24.970> Clips<00:02:25.270> I'm

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
see there's probably body Clips I'm

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.710 
see there's probably body Clips I'm
missing<00:02:25.870> I<00:02:25.960> mean<00:02:26.080> this<00:02:26.170> thing<00:02:26.380> is<00:02:26.530> huge<00:02:27.720> this

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
missing I mean this thing is huge this

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.420 
missing I mean this thing is huge this
is<00:02:28.870> my<00:02:28.990> first<00:02:29.260> chance<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.680> see<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.070> so<00:02:30.220> bear

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
is my first chance to see it so bear

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.540 
is my first chance to see it so bear

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
I'm sure I'm missing multiple clips here

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.750 
I'm sure I'm missing multiple clips here
somewhere<00:02:37.770> well<00:02:38.770> after<00:02:39.100> searching<00:02:39.340> for<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.670> few

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
somewhere well after searching for a few

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.070 
somewhere well after searching for a few
minutes<00:02:40.090> I<00:02:40.180> finally<00:02:40.480> decided<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.810> look<00:02:40.900> at<00:02:41.020> the

is<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:49.560> chassis<00:02:50.560> I<00:02:50.709> mean<00:02:50.860> just<00:02:51.010> look<00:02:51.130> at<00:02:51.220> the

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
is a chassis I mean just look at the

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.710 
is a chassis I mean just look at the
size<00:02:51.520> of<00:02:51.610> this<00:02:51.730> body<00:02:51.940> sitting<00:02:52.390> on<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.540> ground

comes<00:02:53.050> up<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.230> my<00:02:53.350> waist<00:02:55.680> huge<00:02:57.239> here's<00:02:58.239> your

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
comes up to my waist huge here's your

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.830 
comes up to my waist huge here's your
chassis<00:02:58.780> shot<00:02:59.020> got<00:02:59.890> a<00:02:59.920> giant<00:03:00.280> 800<00:03:00.970> cc<00:03:01.330> gas<00:03:01.540> tank

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
chassis shot got a giant 800 cc gas tank

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.020 
chassis shot got a giant 800 cc gas tank
here<00:03:02.080> this<00:03:02.320> is<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.560> 26<00:03:03.040> CC<00:03:03.400> engine<00:03:03.760> this<00:03:03.850> is<00:03:04.000> a

here this is the 26 CC engine this is a

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.990 
here this is the 26 CC engine this is a
gas<00:03:04.300> so<00:03:04.510> you<00:03:04.600> got<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.750> spark<00:03:05.080> plug<00:03:05.110> on<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.560> top

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
gas so you got a spark plug on the top

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.130 
gas so you got a spark plug on the top
