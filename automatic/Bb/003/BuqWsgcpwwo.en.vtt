00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
which is down here this is the mighty

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.609 
which is down here this is the mighty
Mac<00:00:24.910> but<00:00:25.910> it's<00:00:26.360> not<00:00:26.540> so<00:00:26.720> mighty<00:00:26.900> at<00:00:27.170> the<00:00:27.290> moment

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
Mac but it's not so mighty at the moment

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.830 
Mac but it's not so mighty at the moment
because<00:00:27.920> it<00:00:28.070> only<00:00:28.189> has<00:00:28.279> one<00:00:28.759> gig<00:00:28.970> of<00:00:29.119> ram<00:00:29.210> even

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
because it only has one gig of ram even

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.420 
because it only has one gig of ram even
though<00:00:29.930> it<00:00:29.960> has<00:00:30.140> a<00:00:30.169> four<00:00:30.439> core<00:00:30.619> system<00:00:31.099> for

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
though it has a four core system for

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.620 
though it has a four core system for
core<00:00:31.579> processor<00:00:32.060> in<00:00:32.149> it<00:00:32.210> so<00:00:32.329> we're<00:00:32.450> going<00:00:32.540> to

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
core processor in it so we're going to

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.549 
core processor in it so we're going to
upgrade<00:00:33.079> this<00:00:33.230> to<00:00:33.340> four<00:00:34.570> maybe<00:00:35.570> maybe<00:00:36.290> even

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
upgrade this to four maybe maybe even

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.200 
upgrade this to four maybe maybe even
thought<00:00:36.860> yeah<00:00:37.040> possibly<00:00:37.309> five<00:00:37.790> because<00:00:38.090> it's

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
thought yeah possibly five because it's

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.819 
thought yeah possibly five because it's
already<00:00:38.390> gigging<00:00:38.840> this<00:00:39.020> and<00:00:39.200> this<00:00:39.260> for<00:00:39.590> in

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
already gigging this and this for in

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.880 
already gigging this and this for in
this<00:00:40.550> box<00:00:40.850> Sam<00:00:41.750> think<00:00:42.079> it<00:00:42.170> allowed<00:00:42.469> me<00:00:42.500> to<00:00:42.710> keep

dims in the second bank on the first
card<00:03:17.319> okay<00:03:18.319> it<00:03:18.560> should<00:03:18.590> be<00:03:18.860> ok<00:03:22.989> so<00:03:23.989> i<00:03:24.319> guess<00:03:24.379> you

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
card okay it should be ok so i guess you

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.770 
card okay it should be ok so i guess you
can<00:03:24.769> put<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:25.069> in<00:03:25.299> so<00:03:26.299> you<00:03:26.420> can<00:03:26.510> install

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
can put it in so you can install

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.130 
can put it in so you can install
additional<00:03:26.930> pairs<00:03:27.349> of<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.940> oak<00:03:29.060> Oh<00:03:29.180> tips<00:03:29.209> it

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
additional pairs of the oak Oh tips it

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.380 
additional pairs of the oak Oh tips it
should<00:03:30.379> all<00:03:30.530> go<00:03:30.680> on<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.010> first<00:03:31.489> car<00:03:32.030> so<00:03:32.269> we're

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
should all go on the first car so we're

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.910 
should all go on the first car so we're
going<00:03:32.480> to<00:03:32.569> see<00:03:32.780> all<00:03:33.319> right<00:03:33.470> it<00:03:33.860> does<00:03:35.920> there's

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
going to see all right it does there's

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:44.759 
going to see all right it does there's
one<00:03:37.220> of<00:03:37.340> the<00:03:37.400> sticks<00:03:38.650> open<00:03:39.650> this<00:03:39.769> thing<00:03:39.980> up

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.000 

here<00:03:45.769> we<00:03:45.920> go<00:03:46.040> looks<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.489> same<00:03:46.760> should<00:03:47.359> be<00:03:47.510> ok

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
here we go looks the same should be ok

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.979 
here we go looks the same should be ok
so<00:03:49.010> it<00:03:49.190> just<00:03:49.220> goes<00:03:49.519> in<00:03:49.790> looks<00:03:50.540> like<00:03:50.780> like

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
so it just goes in looks like like

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:59.470 
so it just goes in looks like like
normal<00:03:51.470> memory<00:03:51.650> let's<00:03:52.099> do<00:03:52.220> this<00:03:57.909> those<00:03:58.909> rings

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
normal memory let's do this those rings

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.539 
normal memory let's do this those rings
loads<00:03:59.720> hampton<00:04:00.319> seat<00:04:00.620> number<00:04:00.859> 2<00:04:00.890> is<00:04:01.220> nice<00:04:01.400> and

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
loads hampton seat number 2 is nice and

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.930 
loads hampton seat number 2 is nice and
easy

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.760 

and<00:04:07.090> like<00:04:07.720> normal<00:04:08.080> memory<00:04:08.200> it's<00:04:08.440> keyed

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
and like normal memory it's keyed

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.890 
and like normal memory it's keyed
slightly<00:04:09.700> off<00:04:09.820> center<00:04:09.850> so<00:04:10.360> you<00:04:10.420> can<00:04:10.540> only<00:04:10.660> put

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
slightly off center so you can only put

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.770 
slightly off center so you can only put
it<00:04:10.990> in<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.170> correct<00:04:11.380> way<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:15.310> should<00:04:15.640> if<00:04:15.970> so

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
it in the correct way and I should if so

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.509 
it in the correct way and I should if so
if<00:04:17.110> the<00:04:17.320> manual<00:04:17.650> is<00:04:17.680> correct<00:04:18.040> that<00:04:18.190> should<00:04:18.370> be

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
if the manual is correct that should be

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.200 
if the manual is correct that should be
it<00:04:18.580> so<00:04:18.820> this<00:04:18.970> is<00:04:19.200> five<00:04:20.200> gigs<00:04:20.500> of<00:04:20.650> RAM<00:04:20.769> though

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.210 
it so this is five gigs of RAM though

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.920 
it so this is five gigs of RAM though
yeah<00:04:22.210> 512<00:04:22.840> 512<00:04:23.140> and<00:04:23.650> r2<00:04:23.890> giving<00:04:24.250> a<00:04:24.310> two<00:04:24.460> gig

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
yeah 512 512 and r2 giving a two gig

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.720 
yeah 512 512 and r2 giving a two gig
okay<00:04:25.930> well<00:04:26.200> I've<00:04:26.560> never<00:04:26.860> heard<00:04:27.250> of<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:27.640> know

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
we've got an odd number of rim in this

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:40.350 
we've got an odd number of rim in this
Mac<00:04:32.440> now<00:04:33.150> yeah<00:04:35.310> okay<00:04:36.310> so<00:04:36.370> we<00:04:36.790> got<00:04:36.940> here<00:04:39.360> no

1600 x that's it five g's we're doing
good
