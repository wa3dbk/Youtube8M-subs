00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
of this uh weird kind of green snow on

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.590 
of this uh weird kind of green snow on
the<00:01:49.950> ground<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.250> that's<00:01:50.430> actually<00:01:50.610> waste<00:01:51.119> so

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the ground and that's actually waste so

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.929 
the ground and that's actually waste so
if<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.990> guys<00:01:52.140> know<00:01:52.860> anything<00:01:53.100> about<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:53.700> big

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
if you guys know anything about like big

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.460 
if you guys know anything about like big
nukes<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.600> fact<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.960> they<00:01:55.170> drop

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
nukes it's the fact that they drop

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.620 
nukes it's the fact that they drop
fallout<00:01:56.189> from<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.549> sky<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.060> guess<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.479> could

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
fallout from the sky and guess you could

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.179 
fallout from the sky and guess you could
kind<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.869> call<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.200> stuff<00:01:58.439> waste<00:01:58.770> or<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
kind of call this stuff waste or the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.770 
kind of call this stuff waste or the
fallout<00:01:59.549> which<00:01:59.729> is<00:01:59.850> kind<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.180> cool<00:02:00.329> fact<00:02:00.600> out

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
fallout which is kind of a cool fact out

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.770 
fallout which is kind of a cool fact out
think<00:02:01.619> many<00:02:01.979> other<00:02:02.189> TNT<00:02:02.939> mods<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.630> kind

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
think many other TNT mods have this kind

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.420 
think many other TNT mods have this kind
of<00:02:03.899> effect<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.290> that's<00:02:04.409> very<00:02:04.649> cool<00:02:04.890> now<00:02:05.250> make

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
of effect so that's very cool now make

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.679 
of effect so that's very cool now make
sure<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.610> don't<00:02:05.790> do<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.329> world<00:02:06.479> that

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
sure you don't do that in a world that

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.940 
sure you don't do that in a world that
you<00:02:06.810> value<00:02:06.990> because<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.500> stuff<00:02:07.710> would<00:02:07.829> be<00:02:07.860> a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
you value because this stuff would be a

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.730 
you value because this stuff would be a
pain<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.280> clean

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
pain to clean

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.920 
pain to clean
up<00:02:08.830> not<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.790> mention<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:10.270> all<00:02:10.480> the<00:02:10.690> blocks

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
up not to mention that all the blocks

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.240 
up not to mention that all the blocks
pretty<00:02:11.170> much<00:02:11.290> get<00:02:11.440> destroyed<00:02:11.740> around<00:02:12.070> that<00:02:12.220> a

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
pretty much get destroyed around that a

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.550 
pretty much get destroyed around that a
tnt<00:02:12.850> block<00:02:13.060> where<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:13.330> ignited<00:02:13.600> it<00:02:13.810> let's<00:02:14.410> go

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
tnt block where you ignited it let's go

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.660 
tnt block where you ignited it let's go
ahead<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:14.740> move<00:02:14.920> out<00:02:15.100> here<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:15.400> we<00:02:15.430> don't<00:02:15.550> get

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
ahead and move out here so we don't get

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.070 
ahead and move out here so we don't get
any<00:02:15.850> of<00:02:15.940> this<00:02:16.000> waste<00:02:16.330> in<00:02:16.510> our<00:02:16.600> way<00:02:16.750> cuz<00:02:16.960> that

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.200 
guys can find a cool way to use it in a
machinima<00:02:50.200> so<00:02:51.010> that's<00:02:51.430> that<00:02:51.580> ender<00:02:51.790> bomb<00:02:51.970> and

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
machinima so that's that ender bomb and

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.140 
night it's kind of less cost phul than
the<00:04:19.229> shelter<00:04:20.229> bomb<00:04:20.410> so<00:04:20.770> that's<00:04:21.100> very<00:04:21.190> cool<00:04:21.609> now

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
the shelter bomb so that's very cool now

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.060 
the shelter bomb so that's very cool now
next<00:04:22.449> one<00:04:22.630> is<00:04:22.660> very<00:04:23.169> awesome<00:04:23.410> if<00:04:23.650> you<00:04:23.770> guys<00:04:23.919> are

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.379 
next one is very awesome if you guys are
going<00:04:24.190> through<00:04:24.460> a<00:04:24.490> cave<00:04:24.790> and<00:04:24.940> you<00:04:25.030> want<00:04:25.210> to<00:04:25.270> get

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
going through a cave and you want to get

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.450 
going through a cave and you want to get
rid<00:04:25.540> of<00:04:25.570> lava<00:04:25.930> or<00:04:26.259> water<00:04:26.560> this<00:04:27.100> one<00:04:27.310> would<00:04:27.430> be

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
rid of lava or water this one would be

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.850 
rid of lava or water this one would be
great<00:04:27.759> to<00:04:27.880> use<00:04:28.030> it<00:04:28.210> is<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.479> vaporized<00:04:29.080> TNT<00:04:29.620> and

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
great to use it is the vaporized TNT and

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.310 
great to use it is the vaporized TNT and
this<00:04:30.669> one<00:04:30.820> pretty<00:04:31.000> much<00:04:31.210> does<00:04:31.479> nothing<00:04:31.870> except

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
this one pretty much does nothing except

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.560 
this one pretty much does nothing except
for<00:04:32.680> taking<00:04:33.039> away<00:04:33.190> water<00:04:33.699> or<00:04:33.940> lava<00:04:34.210> when<00:04:34.479> you

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
for taking away water or lava when you

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.300 
for taking away water or lava when you
guys<00:04:34.690> place<00:04:35.020> it<00:04:35.169> inside<00:04:35.320> so<00:04:36.009> let's<00:04:36.130> just<00:04:36.250> go

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
guys place it inside so let's just go

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.890 
guys place it inside so let's just go
ahead<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:36.610> uh<00:04:36.850> place<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:37.270> redstone<00:04:37.630> torch

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
ahead and uh place the redstone torch

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.840 
ahead and uh place the redstone torch
down<00:04:38.110> you<00:04:38.500> get<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:38.680> very<00:04:38.919> cool<00:04:39.250> smoke<00:04:39.550> effect

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
down you get a very cool smoke effect

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.370 
down you get a very cool smoke effect
here<00:04:40.060> I<00:04:40.210> really<00:04:40.660> like<00:04:40.840> that's<00:04:41.050> kind<00:04:41.199> of<00:04:41.289> like

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
here I really like that's kind of like

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.490 
here I really like that's kind of like
it's<00:04:41.560> sucking<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:41.979> water<00:04:42.190> in<00:04:42.460> and<00:04:43.350> once<00:04:44.350> it

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
it's sucking the water in and once it

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.260 
it's sucking the water in and once it
takes<00:04:44.650> off<00:04:44.889> for<00:04:45.009> a<00:04:45.100> couple<00:04:45.340> seconds<00:04:45.699> here<00:04:45.850> you

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
takes off for a couple seconds here you

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.999 
takes off for a couple seconds here you
guys<00:04:46.389> will<00:04:46.570> see<00:04:46.600> there's<00:04:46.840> a<00:04:46.900> radius<00:04:47.320> of<00:04:47.530> where

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
guys will see there's a radius of where

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:49.980 
guys will see there's a radius of where
this<00:04:48.190> bomb<00:04:48.490> will<00:04:48.669> work<00:04:48.880> at<00:04:49.060> it<00:04:49.240> I<00:04:49.389> think<00:04:49.900> it's

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
this bomb will work at it I think it's

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.100 
this bomb will work at it I think it's
about<00:04:50.139> maybe<00:04:50.740> 50<00:04:51.310> 20<00:04:52.030> blocks<00:04:52.210> somewhere<00:04:52.990> in

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
about maybe 50 20 blocks somewhere in

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.810 
about maybe 50 20 blocks somewhere in
that<00:04:53.169> area<00:04:53.289> and<00:04:53.770> they<00:04:54.250> will<00:04:54.370> pretty<00:04:54.520> much<00:04:54.610> just

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
that area and they will pretty much just

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.409 
that area and they will pretty much just
vaporize<00:04:55.300> any<00:04:55.479> water<00:04:56.039> lava<00:04:57.039> in<00:04:57.340> that<00:04:57.490> area<00:04:57.729> so

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
vaporize any water lava in that area so

00:04:58.419 --> 00:04:59.909 
vaporize any water lava in that area so
like<00:04:58.630> I<00:04:58.720> said<00:04:58.780> it's<00:04:59.020> very<00:04:59.199> useful<00:04:59.380> if<00:04:59.680> you<00:04:59.800> guys

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
like I said it's very useful if you guys

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.439 
like I said it's very useful if you guys
are<00:05:00.070> going<00:05:00.220> through<00:05:00.460> a<00:05:00.520> cave<00:05:00.789> system<00:05:01.180> and<00:05:01.360> you

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:01.449 
are going through a cave system and you

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.060 
are going through a cave system and you

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.310 
kind of want to you know get over that
lava<00:05:03.340> or<00:05:03.639> annoying<00:05:04.210> water<00:05:04.479> without<00:05:04.870> you<00:05:05.229> know

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
lava or annoying water without you know

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.110 
lava or annoying water without you know
having<00:05:05.500> to<00:05:05.680> paste<00:05:06.039> it<00:05:06.220> up<00:05:06.280> with<00:05:06.490> some<00:05:06.669> stone<00:05:06.910> or

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
having to paste it up with some stone or

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.570 
having to paste it up with some stone or
just<00:05:07.930> out<00:05:08.080> running<00:05:08.260> that<00:05:08.560> water<00:05:09.070> bucket<00:05:09.430> over

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
just out running that water bucket over

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.980 
just out running that water bucket over
the<00:05:09.820> law<00:05:09.970> because<00:05:10.270> that<00:05:10.389> might<00:05:10.539> be<00:05:10.690> kind<00:05:10.930> of

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
the law because that might be kind of

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.050 
the law because that might be kind of
annoying<00:05:11.229> and<00:05:11.620> can<00:05:12.130> maybe<00:05:12.280> lead<00:05:12.550> to<00:05:12.729> a<00:05:12.760> death

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
annoying and can maybe lead to a death

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.659 
annoying and can maybe lead to a death
so<00:05:13.599> that's<00:05:14.110> a<00:05:14.260> cool<00:05:14.500> CNT<00:05:15.039> now<00:05:15.280> let's<00:05:15.430> go<00:05:15.580> ahead

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
so that's a cool CNT now let's go ahead

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:17.129 
so that's a cool CNT now let's go ahead
and<00:05:15.760> move<00:05:15.940> on<00:05:16.090> to<00:05:16.240> our<00:05:16.300> next<00:05:16.360> one<00:05:16.810> this<00:05:17.080> is

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:37.699 
if you don't this may be just a tiny bit

laggy<00:06:38.030> this<00:06:38.330> one<00:06:38.539> alone<00:06:39.349> is<00:06:39.409> pretty<00:06:39.680> laggy<00:06:39.949> but

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:40.099 
laggy this one alone is pretty laggy but

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:42.459 
laggy this one alone is pretty laggy but
the<00:06:40.340> other<00:06:40.490> ones<00:06:40.669> are<00:06:40.789> pretty<00:06:40.939> good<00:06:41.199> lag<00:06:42.199> wise

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:42.469

the other ones are pretty good lag wise
you<00:06:42.680> don't<00:06:42.830> really<00:06:42.979> get<00:06:43.069> that<00:06:43.129> much<00:06:43.280> lag<00:06:43.639> which

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:43.789 
you don't really get that much lag which

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:45.730

damage<00:06:50.449> it<00:06:50.719> should<00:06:50.900> just<00:06:51.080> take<00:06:51.199> a<00:06:51.229> couple<00:06:51.409> more

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740 
damage it should just take a couple more

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.629 
damage it should just take a couple more
seconds<00:06:52.129> and<00:06:53.740> unfreeze<00:06:54.740> here<00:06:55.039> I<00:06:55.189> hope<00:06:55.520> my

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 
seconds and unfreeze here I hope my

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:56.890 
seconds and unfreeze here I hope my
minecraft<00:06:56.060> didn't<00:06:56.240> just<00:06:56.419> crash<00:06:56.629> that<00:06:56.810> would

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:56.900 
minecraft didn't just crash that would

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.600 
minecraft didn't just crash that would
be<00:06:57.020> horrible<00:06:57.139> but<00:06:57.740> I<00:06:57.800> here<00:06:58.009> we<00:06:58.099> go<00:06:58.219> we<00:06:58.340> get<00:06:58.460> some

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
be horrible but I here we go we get some

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.790 
be horrible but I here we go we get some
nice<00:06:58.789> kind<00:06:59.030> of<00:06:59.090> spark<00:06:59.360> effects<00:06:59.659> and<00:06:59.900> they're

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
nice kind of spark effects and they're

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.350 
nice kind of spark effects and they're
falling<00:07:00.979> down<00:07:01.250> to<00:07:01.370> the<00:07:01.430> ground<00:07:01.639> and<00:07:01.939> you<00:07:02.270> guys

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:02.360 
falling down to the ground and you guys

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.939 
falling down to the ground and you guys
can<00:07:02.569> see<00:07:02.599> here<00:07:02.870> does<00:07:03.080> a<00:07:03.110> massive<00:07:03.650> amount<00:07:03.889> of

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:03.949 
can see here does a massive amount of

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:05.770 
can see here does a massive amount of
damage<00:07:04.340> so<00:07:04.550> while<00:07:04.729> that<00:07:04.759> lag<00:07:05.150> eNOS<00:07:05.449> is<00:07:05.479> worth

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:05.780 
damage so while that lag eNOS is worth

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.360 
damage so while that lag eNOS is worth
the<00:07:05.960> while<00:07:06.110> as<00:07:06.379> you<00:07:06.860> get<00:07:07.009> this<00:07:07.129> awesome
