TT games and so what does your job

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.640 
TT games and so what does your job
involve<00:00:08.900> building<00:00:09.900> lego<00:00:10.050> models<00:00:10.469> and

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
involve building lego models and

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.129 
involve building lego models and
designed<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.639> design<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:11.940> them<00:00:12.210> so<00:00:12.900> but<00:00:13.049> it's

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
designed the design of them so but it's

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.350 
designed the design of them so but it's
a<00:00:13.170> physical<00:00:13.530> Lego<00:00:14.070> rather<00:00:14.700> than<00:00:14.880> something<00:00:15.089> a

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
a physical Lego rather than something a

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.660 
a physical Lego rather than something a
sore<00:00:15.750> on<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.929> computer<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.680> right<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.220> know

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
sore on a computer that right I know

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.429 
sore on a computer that right I know
it's<00:00:17.820> both<00:00:18.080> we<00:00:19.080> use<00:00:19.350> physical<00:00:19.920> Lego<00:00:20.310> first<00:00:21.439> to

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
it's both we use physical Lego first to

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.710 
it's both we use physical Lego first to
show<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:23.279> can<00:00:23.609> physically<00:00:24.090> be<00:00:24.240> built<00:00:24.449> to

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
show that it can physically be built to

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.529 
show that it can physically be built to
make<00:00:25.650> sure<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.189> it's<00:00:26.400> something<00:00:26.820> really<00:00:27.390> for

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
make sure it's it's something really for

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.380 
make sure it's it's something really for
the<00:00:27.599> fans<00:00:28.279> so<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.400> if<00:00:29.519> they<00:00:29.699> want<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> pause

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
the fans so that if they want to pause

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.030 
the fans so that if they want to pause
the<00:00:30.630> screen<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.230> be<00:00:31.560> able<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.769> try<00:00:31.920> and

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the screen and be able to try and

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.799 
the screen and be able to try and
replicate<00:00:32.189> any<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.239> models<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.690> they

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
replicate any of the models that they

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.870 
replicate any of the models that they
say<00:00:33.989> within<00:00:34.170> game<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.620> note<00:00:34.800> we're<00:00:35.640> trying

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
say within game that note we're trying

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.420 
say within game that note we're trying
to<00:00:35.940> make<00:00:36.059> sure<00:00:36.210> they<00:00:36.420> can<00:00:36.770> so<00:00:37.770> we'll<00:00:38.250> always

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
to make sure they can so we'll always

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.810 
to make sure they can so we'll always
try<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.760> build<00:00:38.969> them<00:00:39.239> first<00:00:39.480> after<00:00:40.230> bricks

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
try and build them first after bricks

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.400 
try and build them first after bricks
one<00:00:41.820> site<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.270> done<00:00:42.540> then<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:43.050> build<00:00:43.230> them

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
one site is done then we build them

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.889 
one site is done then we build them
digitally<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:44.370> game<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:45.629> you're<00:00:45.750> working

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
digitally in game so if you're working

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.900 
digitally in game so if you're working
on<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.110> particular<00:00:46.230> franchise<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.340> get<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
on a particular franchise you get the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.060 
on a particular franchise you get the
Lego<00:00:48.450> kits<00:00:48.750> from<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.170> franchise<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.920> that's

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
Lego kits from that franchise and that's

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.549 
Lego kits from that franchise and that's
just<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.340> starting<00:00:50.789> point<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.239> right<00:00:51.559> yeah

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
just a starting point is that right yeah

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.110 
just a starting point is that right yeah
it<00:00:52.739> will<00:00:52.829> be<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.039> same<00:00:53.219> with<00:00:53.399> every<00:00:53.730> every

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
it will be the same with every every

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.110 
it will be the same with every every
franchise<00:00:54.710> where<00:00:55.710> they<00:00:55.890> go<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.070> will<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:57.000> an

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
franchise where they go to will do an

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.439 
franchise where they go to will do an
official<00:00:57.510> theme<00:00:58.370> but<00:00:59.370> obviously<00:00:59.760> they<00:01:00.239> will

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
official theme but obviously they will

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.420 
official theme but obviously they will
there<00:01:00.750> will<00:01:00.840> only<00:01:00.930> be<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.440> many<00:01:01.469> vehicles<00:01:01.890> or

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
there will only be so many vehicles or

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.479 
there will only be so many vehicles or
models<00:01:03.059> within<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.510> theme<00:01:04.129> generally<00:01:05.129> for

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
models within that theme generally for

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.120 
models within that theme generally for
the<00:01:05.519> games<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:06.240> need<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> lot<00:01:06.780> more<00:01:07.130> than

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
the games we need a lot more than

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.690 
the games we need a lot more than
actually<00:01:08.700> what<00:01:08.880> Lego<00:01:09.210> make<00:01:10.189> so<00:01:11.189> that's<00:01:11.490> where

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
actually what Lego make so that's where

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.340 
actually what Lego make so that's where
we<00:01:11.850> come<00:01:12.030> into<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.420> where<00:01:12.570> we<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.020> design

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
we come into it where we have to design

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.060 
we come into it where we have to design
and<00:01:13.530> build<00:01:13.560> our<00:01:13.890> own<00:01:13.920> or<00:01:14.640> even<00:01:15.890> remodels<00:01:16.890> from

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
and build our own or even remodels from

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.590 
and build our own or even remodels from
the<00:01:17.189> official<00:01:17.430> leg<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.909> ones<00:01:18.060> because<00:01:18.479> they

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
the official leg and ones because they

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.570 
the official leg and ones because they
won't<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:19.020> certain<00:01:19.680> functionality<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.520> we

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
won't have certain functionality that we

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.920 
won't have certain functionality that we
were<00:01:21.420> desperate<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.869> get<00:01:22.049> into<00:01:22.350> game<00:01:23.119> so<00:01:24.119> why

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
were desperate to get into game so why

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.929 
were desperate to get into game so why
use<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.470> physical<00:01:25.590> kits<00:01:26.100> though<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.640> mean<00:01:26.880> you

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
use the physical kits though I mean you

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.060 
use the physical kits though I mean you
could<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.150> create<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.750> computer<00:01:28.070> is

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
could just create it on the computer is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.010 
could just create it on the computer is
it<00:01:29.280> just<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.759> kids<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.210> sort<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.689> make<00:01:30.750> it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
it just so that kids can sort of make it

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.840 
it just so that kids can sort of make it
themselves<00:01:31.140> or<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.400> look<00:01:32.670> at<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
themselves or is that you look at the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.490 
themselves or is that you look at the
sort<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.270> close<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.509> tie<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.170> physical

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
sort of close to tie with that physical

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.190 
sort of close to tie with that physical
product<00:01:35.240> yeah<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.810> prove<00:01:37.020> ourselves

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
product yeah it is to prove ourselves

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.719 
product yeah it is to prove ourselves
that<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> connections<00:01:38.189> work<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.610> mean

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
that the connections work I mean

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.710 
that the connections work I mean
sometimes<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:39.329> screen<00:01:40.310> where<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.759> may<00:01:42.540> look

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
sometimes on screen where it may look

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.600 
sometimes on screen where it may look
like<00:01:42.780> something<00:01:43.290> might<00:01:43.470> work<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.310> if

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
like something might work and so if

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.190 
like something might work and so if
you'd<00:01:44.820> using<00:01:45.329> your<00:01:45.450> hands<00:01:45.780> with<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.140> you

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
you'd using your hands with it and you

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.980 
you'd using your hands with it and you
can<00:01:46.740> physically<00:01:47.040> see<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.610> will<00:01:47.990> so

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
can physically see that it will so

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.389 
can physically see that it will so
there's<00:01:49.409> always<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> slight<00:01:49.950> bit<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.189> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
there's always a slight bit of the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.240 
there's always a slight bit of the
deviation<00:01:51.149> between<00:01:51.350> building<00:01:52.350> forreal<00:01:52.799> and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
deviation between building forreal and

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.160 
deviation between building forreal and
building<00:01:53.700> digitally<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.600> nice<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.810> do

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
building digitally so it's nice to do

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.590 
building digitally so it's nice to do
both<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.979> make<00:01:56.100> sure<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.329> get<00:01:57.479> in

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
both to make sure that that you get in

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.870 
both to make sure that that you get in
it<00:01:57.719> right<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.500> we<00:01:58.590> have<00:01:58.619> lots<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.579> go<00:01:59.700> at<00:01:59.790> home

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
it right so we have lots of a go at home

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.219 
it right so we have lots of a go at home
I<00:02:00.000> play<00:02:00.149> with<00:02:00.210> my<00:02:00.270> kids<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.869> big<00:02:01.020> bucket

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
I play with my kids we have a big bucket

I play with my kids we have a big bucket
of<00:02:01.380> Lego<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.770> seems<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.040> little<00:02:02.159> bit<00:02:02.280> more

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
of Lego it seems a little bit more

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.190 
of Lego it seems a little bit more
organized<00:02:02.790> here<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.719> these<00:02:03.869> these

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
organized here so you have these these

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.080 
organized here so you have these these
drawers<00:02:04.530> full<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.280> particular<00:02:05.700> pieces<00:02:05.880> is

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
drawers full of particular pieces is

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.419 
drawers full of particular pieces is
that<00:02:06.210> right<00:02:06.360> yeah<00:02:06.659> yeah<00:02:07.079> it's<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.860> really<00:02:08.190> to

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
that right yeah yeah it's just really to

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.960 
that right yeah yeah it's just really to
aid<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.729> speed<00:02:09.440> where<00:02:10.440> we<00:02:10.800> only<00:02:11.340> with<00:02:11.819> any

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
aid the speed where we only with any

builders<00:02:13.210> if<00:02:14.210> you<00:02:14.510> do<00:02:14.750> start<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.500> sort<00:02:15.830> your

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
builders if you do start to sort your

builders if you do start to sort your
pieces<00:02:16.490> people<00:02:17.120> either<00:02:17.270> either<00:02:17.540> sort<00:02:17.900> between

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050

color or those self sort between parts

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.230 
color or those self sort between parts
we<00:02:20.930> do<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:21.290> here<00:02:21.490> sorting<00:02:22.490> between<00:02:22.820> parts

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
we do it here sorting between parts

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.930 
we do it here sorting between parts
because<00:02:23.600> we<00:02:24.290> don't<00:02:24.500> actually<00:02:24.710> need<00:02:25.490> to<00:02:25.550> do<00:02:25.910> a

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
because we don't actually need to do a

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.590 
because we don't actually need to do a
full-color<00:02:26.720> build<00:02:27.100> physically<00:02:28.600> because

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
full-color build physically because

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.140 
full-color build physically because
we'll<00:02:29.870> do<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.170> full<00:02:30.350> color<00:02:30.590> digitally<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:31.880> as

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
we'll do the full color digitally so as

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.970 
we'll do the full color digitally so as
long<00:02:32.540> as<00:02:32.600> we<00:02:32.840> can<00:02:32.990> just<00:02:33.230> grab<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.590> parts<00:02:33.920> that

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
long as we can just grab the parts that

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.730 
long as we can just grab the parts that
we<00:02:34.160> know<00:02:34.310> we<00:02:34.460> need<00:02:34.610> as<00:02:34.940> quick<00:02:35.240> as<00:02:35.390> we<00:02:35.420> can<00:02:35.750> then

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
we know we need as quick as we can then

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.710 
we know we need as quick as we can then
we<00:02:36.980> can<00:02:37.130> get<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.400> model<00:02:37.640> built<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.090> then<00:02:38.300> go

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
we can get the model built and then go

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.200 
we can get the model built and then go
to<00:02:39.040> actually<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.160> color<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.670> we<00:02:40.850> want<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.090> do

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
to actually the color that we want to do

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.600 
to actually the color that we want to do
it<00:02:41.390> once<00:02:41.750> we're<00:02:41.960> there<00:02:41.990> and<00:02:42.170> it<00:02:42.260> is<00:02:42.380> earthly

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
it once we're there and it is earthly

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.480 
it once we're there and it is earthly
and<00:02:43.610> how<00:02:44.270> long<00:02:44.420> does<00:02:44.510> that<00:02:44.660> process<00:02:44.810> Tate<00:02:45.500> so

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
and how long does that process Tate so

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.030 
and how long does that process Tate so
you<00:02:46.550> create<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.360> model<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:48.560> days<00:02:48.710> and<00:02:48.890> days

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
you create a model is it days and days

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.260 
you create a model is it days and days
you<00:02:49.220> spend<00:02:49.460> we're<00:02:49.610> finding<00:02:49.850> that<00:02:49.910> was<00:02:50.150> it

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
you spend we're finding that was it

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.570 
you spend we're finding that was it
quite<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:50.450> quick<00:02:50.690> thing<00:02:50.960> uh<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:52.160> can<00:02:52.400> be

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
quite a quick thing uh it can be

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.120 
quite a quick thing uh it can be
anything<00:02:53.210> between<00:02:53.510> half<00:02:53.960> a<00:02:54.080> day<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.290> a<00:02:54.860> week

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
anything between half a day to a week

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.360 
anything between half a day to a week
for<00:02:55.730> an<00:02:55.820> out<00:02:56.120> for<00:02:56.330> each<00:02:56.390> size<00:02:56.660> model<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:58.160> then

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
for an out for each size model and then

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.610 
for an out for each size model and then
you<00:02:58.580> can<00:02:59.000> go<00:02:59.180> up<00:02:59.210> to<00:02:59.510> two<00:03:00.200> or<00:03:00.350> three<00:03:00.590> weeks

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
you can go up to two or three weeks

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.040 
you can go up to two or three weeks
really<00:03:01.310> really<00:03:01.670> large<00:03:01.850> models<00:03:02.300> oh<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.870> this

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
really really large models oh and this

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.560 
really really large models oh and this
this<00:03:03.440> generally<00:03:04.220> had<00:03:04.400> to<00:03:04.550> be<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:05.270> smallest

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
this generally had to be the smallest

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.460 
this generally had to be the smallest
car<00:03:06.020> with<00:03:06.440> in-game<00:03:07.660> taking<00:03:08.660> on<00:03:08.810> board<00:03:09.050> things

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
car with in-game taking on board things

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.880 
car with in-game taking on board things
like<00:03:09.680> Loki's<00:03:10.220> head<00:03:10.790> where<00:03:11.500> we<00:03:12.500> found<00:03:12.770> that

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
like Loki's head where we found that

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.920 
like Loki's head where we found that
we've<00:03:13.100> had<00:03:13.280> to<00:03:13.490> really<00:03:13.910> sort<00:03:14.180> of<00:03:14.300> try<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:14.810> keep

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
we've had to really sort of try and keep

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.750 
we've had to really sort of try and keep
the<00:03:15.080> roofs<00:03:15.320> quite<00:03:15.620> high<00:03:15.830> on<00:03:15.860> all<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.310> vehicles

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
the roofs quite high on all the vehicles

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.380 
the roofs quite high on all the vehicles
so<00:03:17.750> that's<00:03:17.900> been<00:03:18.050> the<00:03:18.170> result<00:03:18.370> yeah<00:03:19.370> of<00:03:19.670> the

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
so that's been the result yeah of the

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.800 
so that's been the result yeah of the
smallest<00:03:20.750> vehicle<00:03:21.170> and<00:03:21.590> that<00:03:21.770> was<00:03:22.810> probably

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
smallest vehicle and that was probably

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.690 
smallest vehicle and that was probably
about<00:03:24.230> two<00:03:24.500> days<00:03:24.710> I<00:03:24.770> think<00:03:25.160> too<00:03:25.250> much<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:25.400> get

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
about two days I think too much you get

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.090 
about two days I think too much you get
that<00:03:25.820> designed<00:03:26.240> and<00:03:26.620> digitally<00:03:27.620> built<00:03:27.890> and

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
that designed and digitally built and

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.760 
that designed and digitally built and
put<00:03:28.250> into<00:03:28.370> game<00:03:28.990> because<00:03:29.990> obviously<00:03:30.380> just

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
put into game because obviously just

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.650 
put into game because obviously just
trying<00:03:31.160> to<00:03:31.250> keep<00:03:31.400> it<00:03:31.580> so<00:03:31.820> short<00:03:32.120> at<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.450> back

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
trying to keep it so short at the back

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.810 
trying to keep it so short at the back
oh<00:03:33.070> so<00:03:34.070> you<00:03:34.130> would<00:03:34.370> go<00:03:34.400> through<00:03:34.670> different

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
oh so you would go through different

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.460 
oh so you would go through different
iterations<00:03:35.390> of<00:03:35.510> that<00:03:35.720> particular<00:03:35.960> they're

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
iterations of that particular they're

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.800 
iterations of that particular they're
cool<00:03:36.710> in<00:03:36.890> it<00:03:36.980> would<00:03:37.190> finally<00:03:37.940> this<00:03:38.510> is<00:03:38.690> the
