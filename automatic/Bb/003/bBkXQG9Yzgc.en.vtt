softbox<00:00:41.430> these<00:00:41.640> days<00:00:42.050> they<00:00:43.050> buy<00:00:43.440> them<00:00:43.649> for<00:00:44.129> a

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
softbox these days they buy them for a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.450 
softbox these days they buy them for a
speedlight<00:00:45.450> or<00:00:45.690> camera<00:00:46.050> flash<00:00:46.309> roughly<00:00:47.309> like

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
speedlight or camera flash roughly like

this<00:00:47.700> well<00:00:48.480> thing<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:49.110> softbox<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.219> not

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
this well thing is this softbox is not

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.090 
this well thing is this softbox is not
matching<00:00:50.820> mount<00:00:51.300> honest<00:00:51.989> be<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.920> mention

Mickey<00:01:28.680> Mouse<00:01:28.920> style<00:01:29.310> for<00:01:29.759> anyways<00:01:30.030> if<00:01:30.150> you

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
Mickey Mouse style for anyways if you

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
want to mount it on a speedlight you

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.800 
want to mount it on a speedlight you
have<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.950> buy<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.250> an<00:01:32.369> L<00:01:33.000> bracket<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.600> cost

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
have to buy in an L bracket that cost

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.690 
have to buy in an L bracket that cost
like<00:01:33.960> 30<00:01:34.200> bucks<00:01:34.290> or<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.340> doesn't<00:01:35.490> make<00:01:35.670> sense

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
like 30 bucks or it doesn't make sense

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.100 
like 30 bucks or it doesn't make sense
since<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.329> softbox<00:01:36.659> money<00:01:38.600> you<00:01:39.600> go<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:39.810> by

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
since the softbox money you go so by

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.170 
since the softbox money you go so by
what's<00:01:40.590> called<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.890> flex<00:01:41.250> mount<00:01:41.520> which

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
what's called a flex mount which

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.780 
what's called a flex mount which
basically<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.680> circle<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.460> mounts<00:01:44.670> on

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
basically it's a circle and mounts on

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.840 
basically it's a circle and mounts on
here<00:01:44.820> your<00:01:45.420> speed<00:01:45.689> light<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:47.490> lets<00:01:47.700> you

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
here your speed light and it lets you

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.080 
here your speed light and it lets you
use<00:01:48.530> drop<00:01:49.530> time<00:01:49.829> modifiers<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> speedlight

here's the mount on the back if you seen

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.960 
here's the mount on the back if you seen
it's<00:02:11.060> meant<00:02:11.810> for<00:02:11.900> a<00:02:12.050> strobe<00:02:12.410> not<00:02:12.680> a<00:02:12.970> speed

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
it's meant for a strobe not a speed

light<00:02:14.150> I<00:02:14.450> was<00:02:14.660> lucky<00:02:15.020> it<00:02:15.140> actually<00:02:15.440> scared<00:02:15.739> one

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
light I was lucky it actually scared one

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.630 
light I was lucky it actually scared one
of<00:02:16.040> my<00:02:16.130> old<00:02:16.870> flashes<00:02:17.870> but<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.739> not<00:02:19.040> fit<00:02:19.310> my

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
of my old flashes but it not fit my

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.220 
of my old flashes but it not fit my
young<00:02:19.880> new<00:02:20.090> or<00:02:20.330> modern<00:02:20.810> wanted<00:02:21.020> to<00:02:21.080> have<00:02:21.200> a

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
young new or modern wanted to have a

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.530 
young new or modern wanted to have a
smaller<00:02:21.650> head<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.610> if<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:22.790> have<00:02:22.910> any<00:02:23.209> flash

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
smaller head so if you have any flash

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.840 
smaller head so if you have any flash
like<00:02:23.930> me<00:02:24.260> from<00:02:24.500> 2000<00:02:25.280> and<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.459> were<00:02:25.580> putting

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
like me from 2000 and you were putting

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.240 
like me from 2000 and you were putting
one<00:02:26.030> fit<00:02:26.239> it<00:02:26.390> let's<00:02:27.110> have<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.319> huge<00:02:27.680> a<00:02:27.830> splash

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
one fit it let's have a huge a splash

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.540 
one fit it let's have a huge a splash
like<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:28.640> one<00:02:29.650> or<00:02:30.650> two<00:02:30.950> assemble<00:02:31.370> it's

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
like this one or two assemble it's

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.460 
like this one or two assemble it's
actually<00:02:32.000> really<00:02:32.300> difficult<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.290> comes

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
actually really difficult and it comes

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.840 
actually really difficult and it comes
with<00:02:33.530> no<00:02:33.709> instructions<00:02:34.250> basically<00:02:34.489> there's

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
with no instructions basically there's

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.270 
with no instructions basically there's
rods<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.989> mount<00:02:36.230> each<00:02:36.410> rod<00:02:36.739> in<00:02:36.980> one<00:02:37.100> of<00:02:37.190> the

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
rods you mount each rod in one of the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.870 
rods you mount each rod in one of the
holes<00:02:37.550> on<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.880> bracket<00:02:38.000> here<00:02:38.390> then<00:02:39.230> inside<00:02:39.950> it

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
holes on the bracket here then inside it

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.990 
holes on the bracket here then inside it
has<00:02:41.120> some<00:02:41.330> more<00:02:42.370> let<00:02:43.370> me<00:02:43.550> go<00:02:43.730> ahead<00:02:43.819> and

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
has some more let me go ahead and

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.250 
has some more let me go ahead and
quickly<00:02:44.569> disassembler<00:02:45.380> so<00:02:45.530> you'll<00:02:45.680> see<00:02:47.260> so

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
quickly disassembler so you'll see so

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.940 
quickly disassembler so you'll see so
but<00:02:48.470> we<00:02:48.650> have<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:49.130> hit<00:02:50.060> softeners<00:02:50.600> inside<00:02:50.989> the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
but we have to hit softeners inside the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.229 
but we have to hit softeners inside the
thing<00:02:52.160> is<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.430> one<00:02:52.550> inside<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.940> want<00:02:53.150> to

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
thing is the one inside you want to

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.440 
thing is the one inside you want to
diffuse<00:02:53.660> not<00:02:53.989> a<00:02:54.019> softener<00:02:54.709> so<00:02:55.120> that's<00:02:56.120> another

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
diffuse not a softener so that's another

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.140 
diffuse not a softener so that's another
downfall<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.620> also<00:02:57.860> there<00:02:58.100> is<00:02:58.220> nothing<00:02:58.970> to

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
downfall and also there is nothing to

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.930 
downfall and also there is nothing to
lock<00:02:59.300> it<00:02:59.420> in<00:02:59.510> place<00:02:59.630> just<00:02:59.750> these<00:03:00.110> hooks<00:03:00.530> and

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
lock it in place just these hooks and

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.430 
lock it in place just these hooks and
you<00:03:01.940> move<00:03:02.150> up<00:03:02.300> and<00:03:02.510> down<00:03:02.660> like<00:03:02.810> that<00:03:03.019> it<00:03:03.350> would

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
you move up and down like that it would

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.960 
you move up and down like that it would
have<00:03:03.530> been<00:03:03.620> better<00:03:03.769> this<00:03:03.950> place<00:03:04.010> locking<00:03:04.670> and

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
have been better this place locking and

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.449 
have been better this place locking and
there<00:03:05.720> you<00:03:05.840> see<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.140> mount<00:03:06.769> and<00:03:07.040> that's<00:03:07.340> how

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
there you see the mount and that's how

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.830 
there you see the mount and that's how
you<00:03:07.519> assembly<00:03:07.970> you<00:03:08.120> put<00:03:08.329> a<00:03:08.360> ride<00:03:08.600> on<00:03:08.720> one<00:03:08.780> of

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
you assembly you put a ride on one of

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.199 
you assembly you put a ride on one of
those<00:03:09.049> holes<00:03:09.370> through<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.730> little<00:03:11.030> elastic

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
those holes through the little elastic

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.990 
those holes through the little elastic
Hooper<00:03:11.750> here<00:03:12.019> and<00:03:12.320> then<00:03:12.560> on<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.700> other<00:03:13.730> one

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
Hooper here and then on the other one

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.080 
Hooper here and then on the other one
over<00:03:14.120> here<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.220> reflectors<00:03:19.610> inside<00:03:19.970> is

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
over here and the reflectors inside is

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.870 
over here and the reflectors inside is
pretty<00:03:20.390> nice<00:03:20.769> but<00:03:21.769> being<00:03:22.250> is<00:03:22.370> I<00:03:22.489> really<00:03:22.730> wish

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
pretty nice but being is I really wish

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.539 
pretty nice but being is I really wish
this<00:03:23.090> was<00:03:23.299> act<00:03:23.540> so<00:03:23.810> kind<00:03:24.799> of<00:03:24.829> like<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:25.190> wanna<00:03:25.430> a

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
this was act so kind of like you wanna a

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.640 
this was act so kind of like you wanna a
diffuser<00:03:26.090> or<00:03:26.120> reflect<00:03:26.600> right<00:03:26.690> here<00:03:26.900> so<00:03:27.500> the

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
diffuser or reflect right here so the

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.020 
diffuser or reflect right here so the
light<00:03:27.890> will<00:03:28.040> bounce<00:03:28.220> off<00:03:28.459> of<00:03:28.609> this<00:03:28.670> and<00:03:28.880> bounce

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
light will bounce off of this and bounce

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.849 
light will bounce off of this and bounce
all<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.269> way<00:03:29.359> around<00:03:29.690> but<00:03:30.380> this<00:03:30.530> is<00:03:30.590> doing

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
all the way around but this is doing

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.860 
all the way around but this is doing
only<00:03:30.980> like<00:03:31.190> I<00:03:31.400> think<00:03:31.609> like<00:03:31.730> only<00:03:31.940> one<00:03:32.060> quarter

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
only like I think like only one quarter

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.210 
only like I think like only one quarter
the<00:03:32.900> lights<00:03:33.170> actually<00:03:33.350> being<00:03:33.680> diffused<00:03:33.950> back

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
the lights actually being diffused back

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.520 
the lights actually being diffused back
in<00:03:34.430> like<00:03:34.609> the<00:03:34.790> 34<00:03:35.329> is<00:03:35.390> going<00:03:35.630> through<00:03:35.840> but<00:03:36.470> it

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
in like the 34 is going through but it

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.840 
in like the 34 is going through but it
doesn't<00:03:36.859> soften<00:03:37.070> and<00:03:37.310> then<00:03:37.370> get<00:03:37.640> something

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
doesn't soften and then get something

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.170 
doesn't soften and then get something
again<00:03:38.150> so<00:03:38.380> so<00:03:39.380> performance<00:03:39.890> wise<00:03:40.100> is<00:03:40.430> I

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
again so so performance wise is I

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.449 
again so so performance wise is I
haven't<00:03:41.510> tried<00:03:41.690> it<00:03:41.840> actually<00:03:42.109> but<00:03:42.290> it<00:03:42.950> should

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
haven't tried it actually but it should

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.009 
haven't tried it actually but it should
work<00:03:43.489> this<00:03:43.910> is<00:03:44.030> just<00:03:44.180> my<00:03:44.299> first<00:03:44.510> look<00:03:44.810> I'll

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
work this is just my first look I'll

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.860 
work this is just my first look I'll
have<00:03:45.230> another<00:03:45.560> video<00:03:46.040> after<00:03:46.700> a<00:03:47.000> week<00:03:47.359> and<00:03:47.720> I'll

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
have another video after a week and I'll

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.979 
have another video after a week and I'll
post<00:03:48.170> some<00:03:48.500> samples<00:03:49.209> but<00:03:50.209> if<00:03:50.329> you<00:03:50.420> have<00:03:50.600> speed

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
post some samples but if you have speed
