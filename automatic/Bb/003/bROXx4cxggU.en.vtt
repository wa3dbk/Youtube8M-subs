00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 oh well friends hello to you i 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.549
 Seryoga Adams but we are playing today 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.470
 garry's mod to extreme soccer mode 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.240
 although it is more like rugby but 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.190
 for some reason it's called football well in 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.960
 general let's look at this 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.670
 wonderful mode is not it by the way is very 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.160
 like quite interesting everything is done 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.439
 we here each other knocking the ball in 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.699
 general and should accordingly in the neighboring 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.019
 his gates throw so much chance for me 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.480
 wait this is our gate 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.609
 i have i scored the first goal i just 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.560
 I did not understand what gate to score but 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.190
 I already started to drag the team that's cool 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.870
 cool so okay so great by the way mode 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.600
 really cool see there will already be 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.059
 then give all sorts of cool guns there 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.280
 any garbage that's all cool as well 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.320
 Something my nickname is directly shown in the SC 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.360
 the center of the screen is somehow awkward so well 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.160
 okay now let's have the main thing so that 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.110
 someone first reached 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.239
 so it will surely be like that for what 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.520
 which is already overclocked in advance well when 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.980
 give no no no fuck you fuck you 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.579
 we run we run we run we run we run we run 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.520
 run 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.580
 well i should should should should 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.299
 run damn oh god people fly people 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.240
 fly 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:14.900
 damn damn damn I have to win well 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:18.119
 same need but already but from ess ess 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.939
 2 I made excellent in the second goal 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.710
 just clearly how many of us play here and 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.590
 the blue team is something a few people are playing 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.670
 somehow strange now just is not everything 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.549
 connected so well ka ka main well 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.030
 Now the main thing now is to have time to take 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.950
 the ball in time to take the ball Serge thatcher 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.150
 By the way, they already recognized me 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.490
 harris mod servers 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.729
 and not the first time it's pretty 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.189
 cool to me so thank you 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.979
 that you watch my videos and I hope that 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.930
 you will now like and like like 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.869
 necessarily like so well and we continue 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.290
 play this strictly speaking mode 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.320
 soccer mode 1 where 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.030
 rugby on a football card so 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.890
 the atmosphere is heating up because blue 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.200
 already in my opinion there is no chance they are already 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.350
 think we all lost 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.160
 no vodka you lost friends all 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.410
 just starting out like this dude 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.600
 we eat time to calculate the time for 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.650
 some restrictive seconds are given 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:28.300
 so come on sunflower seeds i have to take the ball well 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:32.110
 so who have you won again 474 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.150
 better than 40 cool we are right today dragging 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.630
 drag in the dry almost well yes in the dry 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.350
 and dragging so and that new round 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.650
 round so fifth round already 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:48.070
 try these guys are cool Come as a 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.070
 so they count the time to take on 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.410
 And then that whistle should be and yes 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.270
 this whistle must be seen through it 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.490
 navigate so well, that the ball 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:04.120
 flies straight into the goal and the fifth goal 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.970
 fifth goal in a dry pancake at all like that 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.610
 as something very simple reason that it is necessary to 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.880
 probably as a pancake I do not even know 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.010
 no fight there is not so easy kapets 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.019
 I need something heavier I think now 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.660
 blue can take herself in the hands here they are 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:25.989
 already took a weapon so maybe 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.580
 we have every chance so the ball is already needed 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.920
 ball 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.950
 damn kapets kapets who took the ball 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.550
 our ours took the ball so they took away 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.360
 ball 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:40.930
 I kicked out the sessions run and run to eat 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.120
 I removed from blue so I took the red hell 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.190
 I hit my UN for some reason and on my own 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.230
 then no action means someone hit so 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.850
 okay okay okay damn 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.250
 ball ball ball 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.250
 goal again goal and 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:02.420
 goal but everything here is like mine thinks that 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:04.249
 won 60 left one more point so 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.620
 we need probably we now we see 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:08.329
 four by four plays principle so 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.549
 some weapons will give us started 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.469
 or not well ka we have no weapon 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:19.190

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.729
 Chorus, let's take a shot 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.340

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.880
 this cannot be so easy to win 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:52.520
 think so 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.020

 I have a ball, I have to, I have to win 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:32.099
 so the main thing is that no one is with me now 

00:05:30.119 --> 00:05:33.839
 nobody hit me from behind 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.679

 I know what kind of cards but now we find out 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:31.559
 probably some awesome map 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:34.559
 so now everyone has voted for her 

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:35.339
 then it will definitely be yes and no no no no 

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:38.819

 beat 12 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.660
