trembling on it that's all tremolo means

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.440 
trembling on it that's all tremolo means
okay<00:01:11.940> it's<00:01:12.149> kind<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.360> imitation<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:14.450> a

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
okay it's kind of imitation of and a

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.029 
okay it's kind of imitation of and a
similar<00:01:15.869> thing<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.289> a<00:01:16.320> lot<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.619> stringed

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
similar thing that a lot of stringed

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.830 
similar thing that a lot of stringed
instruments<00:01:17.759> can<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:20.240> okay<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.420> dead<00:01:21.659> easy

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
instruments can do okay it's dead easy

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.359 
instruments can do okay it's dead easy
and<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:24.690> best<00:01:24.960> way<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.170> do<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.710> really<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.159> to

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
and the best way to do it really is to

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.899 
and the best way to do it really is to
try<00:01:26.789> it<00:01:27.289> it's<00:01:28.289> a<00:01:28.440> little<00:01:28.740> bit<00:01:28.860> tiring<00:01:29.250> at<00:01:29.640> first

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
try it it's a little bit tiring at first

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.120 
try it it's a little bit tiring at first
because<00:01:30.690> you<00:01:30.780> do<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> lot<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.229> quick<00:01:31.470> movements

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
because you do a lot of quick movements

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.180 
because you do a lot of quick movements
okay<00:01:32.819> what<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.929> do<00:01:34.229> though<00:01:34.619> rather<00:01:34.920> than

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
okay what you can do though rather than

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.010 
okay what you can do though rather than
having<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.819> Trembley<00:01:36.330> trait<00:01:36.600> which<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.899> may

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
having to Trembley trait which you may

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.520 
having to Trembley trait which you may
be<00:01:37.200> quite<00:01:37.440> sort<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:38.000> difficult<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.090> do<00:01:39.319> you<00:01:40.319> can

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
be quite sort of difficult to do you can

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.809 
be quite sort of difficult to do you can
achieve<00:01:41.450> virtually<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.539> same<00:01:42.600> effect<00:01:43.140> by

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
achieve virtually the same effect by

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.219 
achieve virtually the same effect by
splitting<00:01:44.819> the<00:01:44.970> cord<00:01:45.209> in<00:01:45.330> half<00:01:45.479> with<00:01:45.750> one<00:01:45.959> note

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
splitting the cord in half with one note

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.130 
splitting the cord in half with one note
or<00:01:46.350> maybe<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.799> none<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.190> bottom<00:01:48.140> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
or maybe to none to the bottom the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.289 
or maybe to none to the bottom the
others<00:01:49.350> at<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.560> top<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.220> rocking<00:01:50.759> very<00:01:51.060> very

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
others at the top and rocking very very

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.350 
others at the top and rocking very very
quickly<00:01:51.539> between<00:01:51.720> them

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.360 

okay<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:57.840> looking<00:01:58.410> at<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.620> more<00:01:58.710> simple<00:01:59.130> chord

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
okay so looking at the more simple chord

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:06.500 
okay so looking at the more simple chord
right<00:02:00.210> of<00:02:00.390> C<00:02:04.070> okay<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.700> best<00:02:05.850> way<00:02:05.970> to<00:02:06.000> it's

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
right of C okay and the best way to it's

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.270 
right of C okay and the best way to it's
a<00:02:06.600> little<00:02:06.870> bit<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.080> buying<00:02:07.470> split<00:02:07.920> riff<00:02:08.100> like

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
a little bit like buying split riff like

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.070 
a little bit like buying split riff like
that<00:02:08.430> just<00:02:08.640> imagine<00:02:09.180> the<00:02:09.270> kind<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.570> axis<00:02:09.960> down

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
that just imagine the kind of axis down

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.870 
that just imagine the kind of axis down
the<00:02:10.229> middle<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.500> your<00:02:10.560> hand<00:02:10.740> and<00:02:11.280> just<00:02:11.340> rock

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
the middle of your hand and just rock

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.690 
the middle of your hand and just rock
between<00:02:12.270> them<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:13.110> movement<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:13.710> far<00:02:14.520> more

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
between them the movement is far more

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.540 
between them the movement is far more
and<00:02:14.820> your<00:02:14.940> fingers<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.600> then<00:02:15.720> your<00:02:15.870> wrists

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
and your fingers and then your wrists

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.800 
and your fingers and then your wrists
okay<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.850> takes<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.210> little<00:02:18.450> bit<00:02:18.690> of

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
okay and it takes a little bit of

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.690 
okay and it takes a little bit of
practice<00:02:18.960> it's<00:02:19.350> my<00:02:19.500> tiring<00:02:19.860> at<00:02:20.100> first<00:02:20.310> but

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
practice it's my tiring at first but

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.850 
practice it's my tiring at first but
it's<00:02:20.850> not<00:02:21.090> too<00:02:21.360> bad<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.960> works<00:02:22.200> best<00:02:22.500> with<00:02:22.680> some

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
it's not too bad it works best with some

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.360 
it's not too bad it works best with some
really<00:02:23.070> bluesy<00:02:23.550> cause<00:02:23.760> like<00:02:23.970> at<00:02:24.090> night

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.340 

okay<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.430> other<00:02:30.520> thing<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.820> was<00:02:30.880> doing<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.210> was

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
okay the other thing I was doing I was

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.330 
okay the other thing I was doing I was
arpeggiating<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.500> means<00:02:32.740> taking<00:02:33.250> the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
arpeggiating that means taking the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.420 
arpeggiating that means taking the
columns<00:02:34.080> splitting<00:02:35.080> them<00:02:35.200> up<00:02:35.320> running<00:02:36.160> up<00:02:36.280> and

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
columns splitting them up running up and

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.930 
columns splitting them up running up and
down<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.730> piano<00:02:36.970> really<00:02:37.270> quick<00:02:37.890> okay<00:02:38.940> if

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
down the piano really quick okay if

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.520 
down the piano really quick okay if
you've<00:02:40.150> had<00:02:40.300> classical<00:02:40.780> piano<00:02:41.170> lessons

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
you've had classical piano lessons

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.620 
you've had classical piano lessons
you'll<00:02:41.680> probably<00:02:41.980> played<00:02:42.340> arpeggios<00:02:43.000> as<00:02:43.390> part

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
you'll probably played arpeggios as part

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.440 
you'll probably played arpeggios as part
of<00:02:43.660> your<00:02:43.780> scales<00:02:44.050> and<00:02:44.260> stuff<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.910> if<00:02:45.910> so<00:02:46.240> you

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
of your scales and stuff and if so you

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.630 
of your scales and stuff and if so you
should<00:02:46.810> find<00:02:46.960> this<00:02:47.140> straightforward<00:02:47.800> if

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
should find this straightforward if

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.060 
should find this straightforward if
you're<00:02:48.880> going<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.060> do<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.560> or<00:02:50.560> techniques

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
you're going to do that or techniques

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.070 
you're going to do that or techniques
like<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.760> you're<00:02:52.390> going<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.570> find<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.900> quite

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
like it you're going to find it quite

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.780 
like it you're going to find it quite
hard<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.440> be<00:02:53.620> really<00:02:54.130> smooth<00:02:54.460> and<00:02:54.610> legato

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
hard to be really smooth and legato

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.880 
hard to be really smooth and legato
if<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:58.150> go<00:02:58.330> slowly<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.930> trick<00:02:59.170> is<00:02:59.350> to<00:02:59.380> take<00:02:59.680> it

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
if you go slowly the trick is to take it

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.460 
if you go slowly the trick is to take it
fast<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:01.090> use<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:01.450> pedals<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:02.080> stick<00:03:02.380> it

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
fast and to use the pedals to stick it

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.740 
fast and to use the pedals to stick it
to<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.620> pedal<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.280> sustain<00:03:04.180> pedal<00:03:04.209> to<00:03:04.570> stick

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
to the pedal the sustain pedal to stick

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.310 
to the pedal the sustain pedal to stick
it<00:03:04.870> together<00:03:06.420> okay<00:03:07.420> so<00:03:07.480> that<00:03:07.660> was<00:03:07.780> with<00:03:07.930> pedal

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
it together okay so that was with pedal

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.670 
it together okay so that was with pedal
listen<00:03:08.770> to<00:03:08.830> that<00:03:08.920> without<00:03:09.190> pedal<00:03:09.520> it<00:03:09.580> sounds

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
listen to that without pedal it sounds

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.780 
listen to that without pedal it sounds
sounds<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.709> bit<00:03:11.770> lame<00:03:12.010> in<00:03:12.190> a<00:03:12.250> bit<00:03:12.370> messy<00:03:12.610> I'm

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
sounds a bit lame in a bit messy I'm

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.280 
sounds a bit lame in a bit messy I'm
getting<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.030> few<00:03:13.150> wrong<00:03:13.330> notes<00:03:13.390> in<00:03:13.750> there<00:03:13.870> don't

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
getting a few wrong notes in there don't

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.270 
getting a few wrong notes in there don't
worry<00:03:14.500> about<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.770> oblong<00:03:15.040> notes<00:03:17.130> slow<00:03:18.130> it

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
worry about the oblong notes slow it

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:27.089 
worry about the oblong notes slow it
down

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.459 

and<00:03:28.299> arpeggiating<00:03:29.299> is<00:03:29.390> a<00:03:29.420> really<00:03:29.780> good<00:03:29.989> way<00:03:30.170> to

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:30.469 
and arpeggiating is a really good way to

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:32.739 
and arpeggiating is a really good way to
get<00:03:30.739> between<00:03:31.159> one<00:03:31.370> court<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:31.969> another<00:03:32.389> wants

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:32.749 
get between one court and another wants

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:50.960 
get between one court and another wants
of<00:03:33.049> and<00:03:33.670> variation<00:03:34.670> court<00:03:34.999> on<00:03:35.150> another

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.980 

okay<00:03:51.930> well<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:53.580> trick<00:03:53.850> there<00:03:54.090> is<00:03:54.240> to<00:03:54.720> just<00:03:54.900> be

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
okay well the trick there is to just be

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.480 
okay well the trick there is to just be
familiar<00:03:55.200> with<00:03:55.500> your<00:03:55.650> colored<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.190> your<00:03:56.280> poor

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
familiar with your colored and your poor

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.350 
familiar with your colored and your poor
traits<00:03:56.790> on<00:03:56.940> your<00:03:57.060> own<00:03:57.150> versions<00:03:58.340> okay<00:03:59.370> and<00:03:59.610> as

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
traits on your own versions okay and as

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.600 
traits on your own versions okay and as
ever<00:04:00.780> just<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.260> practice<00:04:01.680> so<00:04:02.070> maybe<00:04:02.280> take<00:04:02.580> a

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
ever just to practice so maybe take a

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.920 
ever just to practice so maybe take a
fairly<00:04:02.970> simple<00:04:03.330> chord<00:04:03.600> like<00:04:03.840> that<00:04:04.020> c9<00:04:05.930> tremolo

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
fairly simple chord like that c9 tremolo

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.210 
fairly simple chord like that c9 tremolo
run<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.170> bit<00:04:07.380> first<00:04:07.970> and<00:04:08.970> then<00:04:09.180> up<00:04:09.480> we<00:04:09.690> go

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
run a bit first and then up we go

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.330 
run a bit first and then up we go
don't<00:04:11.220> worry<00:04:11.340> about<00:04:11.400> making<00:04:11.610> mistakes<00:04:13.340> we'll

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
don't worry about making mistakes we'll

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.190 
don't worry about making mistakes we'll
make<00:04:14.490> mistakes<00:04:14.910> at<00:04:15.120> first<00:04:15.360> it's<00:04:15.810> a<00:04:15.900> kind<00:04:16.110> of

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
make mistakes at first it's a kind of

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:33.450 
make mistakes at first it's a kind of
rolling<00:04:16.500> motion

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.800 

one<00:04:34.460> thing<00:04:34.639> you'll<00:04:34.729> notice<00:04:35.150> just<00:04:35.180> say<00:04:35.509> is<00:04:35.689> that

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
one thing you'll notice just say is that

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:44.170 
one thing you'll notice just say is that
it's<00:04:35.960> a<00:04:36.080> lot<00:04:36.349> harder<00:04:36.620> to<00:04:36.919> come<00:04:37.099> down<00:04:42.969> okay

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
it's a lot harder to come down okay

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.270 
it's a lot harder to come down okay
whatever<00:04:44.840> reason<00:04:45.289> it's<00:04:45.530> just<00:04:45.560> hard<00:04:45.889> I<00:04:46.069> guess

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
whatever reason it's just hard I guess

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.490 
whatever reason it's just hard I guess
because<00:04:46.490> you've<00:04:47.090> got<00:04:47.270> to<00:04:47.360> take<00:04:47.569> the<00:04:47.780> potato

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
because you've got to take the potato

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.409 
because you've got to take the potato
hole<00:04:48.710> of<00:04:48.830> your<00:04:48.949> hand<00:04:49.129> over<00:04:49.520> in<00:04:50.210> that<00:04:50.360> direction

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
hole of your hand over in that direction

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.429 
hole of your hand over in that direction
going<00:04:51.080> on<00:04:51.319> ZZ<00:04:51.650> because<00:04:52.009> you<00:04:52.099> have<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:52.580> do<00:04:52.699> it

00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:53.439 
going on ZZ because you have to do it

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:56.649 
going on ZZ because you have to do it
keep<00:04:54.439> that<00:04:54.759> stick<00:04:55.759> of<00:04:55.879> some<00:04:56.030> underneath<00:04:56.389> to

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
keep that stick of some underneath to

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:00.010 
keep that stick of some underneath to
get<00:04:56.750> to<00:04:56.930> start<00:04:57.199> the<00:04:57.289> nectar<00:04:58.750> coming<00:04:59.750> down<00:04:59.900> the

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
get to start the nectar coming down the

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.920 
get to start the nectar coming down the
side<00:05:00.169> hole<00:05:00.590> of<00:05:00.830> the<00:05:00.889> hand<00:05:01.099> and<00:05:01.479> it's<00:05:02.479> quite

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
side hole of the hand and it's quite

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.140 
side hole of the hand and it's quite
difficult<00:05:03.110> and<00:05:03.469> so<00:05:06.430> you<00:05:07.430> can<00:05:07.550> do<00:05:07.669> it<00:05:07.699> down<00:05:07.940> over

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
difficult and so you can do it down over

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:23.790 
difficult and so you can do it down over
short<00:05:08.479> distances

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.550 

if<00:05:24.800> I'm<00:05:24.979> coming<00:05:25.310> down<00:05:25.430> and<00:05:26.110> you<00:05:27.110> know<00:05:27.319> our

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
if I'm coming down and you know our

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.439 
if I'm coming down and you know our
patriotic<00:05:27.949> tend<00:05:28.220> to<00:05:28.340> split<00:05:28.759> into<00:05:28.940> some<00:05:29.360> of

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:29.449 
patriotic tend to split into some of

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:32.619 
patriotic tend to split into some of
them<00:05:29.629> seven<00:05:30.530> riff<00:05:30.710> type<00:05:30.949> things<00:05:31.310> okay<00:05:32.060> so<00:05:32.120> and

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:32.629 
them seven riff type things okay so and

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:34.330 
them seven riff type things okay so and
obviously<00:05:32.900> if<00:05:33.379> you're<00:05:33.650> only<00:05:33.830> just<00:05:34.009> starting

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
obviously if you're only just starting

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.439 
obviously if you're only just starting
out<00:05:34.400> you're<00:05:34.520> not<00:05:34.580> going<00:05:34.729> to<00:05:34.970> do<00:05:35.030> that<00:05:35.150> sort<00:05:35.389> of

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
out you're not going to do that sort of

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:36.760 
out you're not going to do that sort of
things<00:05:35.629> straight<00:05:35.840> away<00:05:36.020> because<00:05:36.440> practice

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
things straight away because practice

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:37.779 
things straight away because practice
and<00:05:36.860> practice<00:05:36.949> and<00:05:37.159> practice<00:05:37.250> trying<00:05:37.729> to

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
and practice and practice trying to

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:39.790 
and practice and practice trying to
tremolo<00:05:38.180> try<00:05:38.750> not<00:05:38.960> pitch<00:05:39.139> shakes<00:05:39.440> and<00:05:39.620> stuff

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
tremolo try not pitch shakes and stuff

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.180 
tremolo try not pitch shakes and stuff
and<00:05:40.250> you<00:05:41.060> should<00:05:41.270> find<00:05:41.479> it<00:05:41.690> after<00:05:41.810> all<00:05:42.259> it<00:05:42.770> we

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
and you should find it after all it we

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.559 
and you should find it after all it we
can<00:05:43.370> stick<00:05:43.580> them<00:05:43.729> pretty<00:05:43.940> naturally<00:05:44.360> I<00:05:44.389> say

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:44.569 
can stick them pretty naturally I say

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:46.300 
can stick them pretty naturally I say
after<00:05:44.840> a<00:05:44.900> while<00:05:45.080> you<00:05:45.680> have<00:05:45.710> got<00:05:45.919> to<00:05:45.979> stick<00:05:46.099> with
