00:00:05.943 --> 00:00:07.943
 It is Tenjin Taira. It is departure. 

00:00:09.845 --> 00:00:11.845
 There is a wind than I thought, but the weather is very good. 

00:00:14.268 --> 00:00:16.268
 It is Shirage. 

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:17.801
 fight. 

00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:20.867
 How far can that Chibiko go? 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.580
 It feels good, isn't it? 

00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:25.511
 Look and see, scenery. You have never seen such a thing. 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:30.149
 Neh. I like it. 

00:00:30.242 --> 00:00:32.242
 I just climbed a little but I was already tired. 

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:33.997
 Let's do our best. It is still more. 

00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:35.704
 Hang in there-. 

00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:41.967
 I'm shooting. fight. 

00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:55.271
 It is a seminar. 

00:00:57.507 --> 00:00:59.507
 Wow. It's a big deal. 

00:01:02.707 --> 00:01:04.707
 It is a ridge line. There is a little wind. 

00:01:05.638 --> 00:01:07.638
 I'm afraid I can go. 

00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:10.896
 It's windy. 

00:01:10.483 --> 00:01:12.483
 It feels good, though. 

00:01:13.158 --> 00:01:15.158
 Do you want a hat? All right? 

00:01:15.454 --> 00:01:17.454
 All right. 

00:01:16.378 --> 00:01:18.378
 Let's go a little more. Well then 

00:01:33.857 --> 00:01:35.857
 No. The road is far, isn't it? 

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:40.890
 I can not climb that kind of thing. A little. 

00:01:40.925 --> 00:01:42.920
 I will do my best. 

00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:50.390
 I'm tired. It is completely over time. 

00:01:55.498 --> 00:01:57.500
 It's a good time. 

00:01:58.237 --> 00:02:00.240
 There are quite a few people over there. 

00:01:59.758 --> 00:02:01.760
 Will you drop it? 

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:06.860
 how is it? How are you? 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.210
 Yes. 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.260
 Can you still climb? 

00:02:09.225 --> 00:02:11.220
 Yes. 

00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:12.730
 Thank you. It seems that you can climb to such a place. 

00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:16.980
 Great views. 

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:18.540
 When you eat sweets. 

00:02:20.566 --> 00:02:22.570
 amazing. It is a great view. 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.240
 I can see Mt. Fuji here. 

00:02:31.502 --> 00:02:33.500
 (It is the first time to see from around Tanigawadake). 

00:02:33.636 --> 00:02:35.640
 Maybe I do not see it. 

00:02:44.416 --> 00:02:46.420
 That's great. I can see Sennokuradake that my father wants to go. 

00:02:48.665 --> 00:02:50.660
 What is that? Is it Naeba? It is not well understood. 

00:02:52.345 --> 00:02:54.340
 Awesome,. 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.020
 Good luck and I can go to the summit. It's a little over time. 

00:02:58.768 --> 00:03:00.770
 What is the rock of Tengu? 

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:04.310
 I'm on the big slope. 

00:03:05.868 --> 00:03:07.870
 I will do my best than I thought. . . . 

00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:11.010
 If you're not tired you can go to the summit. 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.440
 It doesn't look like that, but it's very sudden. 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.440
 Can you climb a difficult mountain like Mt. 

00:03:49.297 --> 00:03:51.300
 how is it? It is quite difficult though the Mt. 

00:03:52.155 --> 00:03:54.160
 Do your best. 

00:03:56.416 --> 00:03:58.420
 Hang in there-. 

00:04:06.021 --> 00:04:08.020
 It will be the summit soon. 

00:04:20.237 --> 00:04:22.240
 It's cold. 

00:04:24.506 --> 00:04:26.510
 Congratulations! 

00:04:26.795 --> 00:04:28.800
 No, it's amazing. 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:30.500
 Wind is also strong. 

00:04:30.062 --> 00:04:32.060
 well done. 

00:04:39.172 --> 00:04:41.170
 Oh my god. 

00:05:01.186 --> 00:05:03.190
 Yay. 

00:05:14.516 --> 00:05:16.520
 Congrats. 

00:05:16.321 --> 00:05:18.320
 the wind is strong. 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.820
 Please give me your impression. 

00:05:21.813 --> 00:05:23.810
 Is beautiful. 

00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:25.830
 Here. It is beautiful. 

00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:30.170
 It was very. There is a reward that was serious. 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.050
 Let's take a break and eat some rice and get off from it. 

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:36.840
 Hurry up! 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 shall we go! 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.960
 That's pretty. 

00:05:46.152 --> 00:05:48.150
 Oh, no, do you go through here (Tanigawa shore line)? 

00:05:48.338 --> 00:05:50.340
 I am in Shimoyama. 

00:05:51.131 --> 00:05:53.130
 It is good to go down. 

00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:06.330
 running. running. 

00:06:09.234 --> 00:06:11.230
 tired. 

00:06:11.097 --> 00:06:13.100
 Thank you for your hard work. 

00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:17.470
 I still have to walk, though. 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.700
 It is amazingly beautiful. 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.700
 It is amazingly beautiful. 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
 You climbed well. I'm up to that point. 

00:06:38.031 --> 00:06:40.030
 Shall we aim for Tenjin Taira? 

00:06:42.858 --> 00:06:44.860
 Do your best. 

00:06:46.606 --> 00:06:48.610
 Well, about three o'clock. 

00:06:49.996 --> 00:06:52.000
 The day was completely tilted and closed. 

00:07:17.934 --> 00:07:19.930
 It's windy. 

00:07:20.184 --> 00:07:22.180
 Thank you for your hard work. 

00:07:22.895 --> 00:07:24.900
 Is It was fun? Yes. 

00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:27.840
 What was fun? 

00:07:28.429 --> 00:07:30.430
 the top. 

00:07:29.772 --> 00:07:31.770
 The top was beautiful. 

00:07:48.226 --> 00:07:50.230
 Thank you for your hard work.
