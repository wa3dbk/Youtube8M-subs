00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 Today I'll do a little excursion 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.770
 the topic of his animal 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.280
 it really is also the Bernese 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.290
 currently everyone writes about it everyone 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.450
 like that somewhere and I have mine 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.750
 now, of course, together worried 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.939
 a long time ago and would like to say briefly 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.430
 what you can do if so and 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.430
 why together so healthy 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.810
 May, therefore, originally comes from 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.809
 before mayer and they are really 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.149
 unbelievably healthy because the incredible 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.800
 have many nutrients 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.410
 for example, they have five times more 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.270
 calcium as in milk they have twice 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.059
 as much protein as most others 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.750
 cereals or say we have 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:53.340
 Iron content, for example , is much more than 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.770
 in spinach potassium also a lot me 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.879
 loose twice as much potassium content as 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.199
 banana 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.300
 they have antioxidants that have something 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.400
 they have but we also have very 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.000
 important to have omega 3 and omega 6 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.619
 fatty acids and that's why these are things 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.590
 also incredibly healthy 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.330
 the can be stored for a long time so 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.390
 in comparison to other cereals 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.290
 maybe half a year in the year 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.960
 cabinet has what animals them up to 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.799
 four years that means you can 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.409
 Buy them on stock and the cost 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.200
 but doggedly much one can thus very 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.270
 do a lot of things and that should be done 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.640
 the animals always just know that 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.380
 I've been so happy with this 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.430
 then in principle they actually see it that way 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.860
 very small mini mini mini if ​​you 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:54.030
 the easy to see team I always say so 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:57.240
 So as fishermen from about giving so 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.219
 so what I was always so that we make 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.899
 Of course , just leave it for a moment 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.810
 Maybe I do not know that 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:08.550
 EUR 10 and of course main market ground 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.649
 You can also sew Greek yogurt 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:17.329
 or normal nature 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:19.489
 well so I just do away so 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:22.819
 constituency and raspberries 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.579
 I have always demanded besides in the 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.109
 fridge and there you can open the short 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:31.159
 lasting either in the riots or too 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:34.540
 so at room temperature in bern you can 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:37.930
 their day to eat in the evening so yes 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:41.239
 Not as many glucose as other varieties 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.799
 that's how it's done 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:49.750
 Wegmann could still relax 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:52.549
 or banana if you like it so much 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.200
 which only make history with four seeds 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.670
 give 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.470
 pudding taste that is if you do that 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.030
 so that's really closing 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.730
 we are exceptional so sitting casually 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.459
 you can do it with agave syrup 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:15.019
 with about sweetener or normal 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:16.879
 sugar so something just what that is 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.769
 very healthy and very tasty 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.160
 in between absolutely perfect 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.720
