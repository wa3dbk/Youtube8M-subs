00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.269
 Welcome Dear spectators from the Stuttgart gazi stadium 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:25.840
 it starts the semifinals for the German American Football Championship 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.429
 Stuttgart Scorpions last year in the round of the last four are the 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.820
 Five times champion Berlin Adler opposite where the special about this 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:35.440
 game 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.859
 with a win could 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:40.719
 right now there is another home game to be sure which life will be 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.179
 you probably on the 6th of October will be here in the year they start stadium 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.690
 with the sport very serious the four seconds before the end of a counterattack 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.430
 somehow he thinks he plays on Vogue 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.980
 Quarterback Kyle Berger was able to tire in the bar with a 64 Abarth 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.780
 Augsburg are home grown plants like Scholl 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.520
 obscured by the players who can barely grasp 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.090
 "What's going on there 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.430
 from a 13 to 14 Wertheim 19 5 14 indescribable cheering scenes data 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.960
 Stadium on the Waldau the Scorpions for the first time ever in the German Bowl 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.560
 and that in your own 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.260
 everyone's crazy 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.260
 This believes their fans can continue to dream of the title 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.370
 100 years 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.430
 because just awesome what he did I have worked so far 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.030
 Johnson cameraman everything worth knowing 110 this last game was pulling everything 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.110
 obscured by the teammates I've already cheered what's up 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.950
 played treadmills the corresponding Uhlig run not so easy 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.330
 No one sails like a gazelle if that sometimes happens 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.960
 slower I look if I kick the ball 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.200
 I already did some chairs after that 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.149
 the beaten four spacious but just after the first act the 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.370
 Under 25 Center Thomas won that was awesome 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.470
 Well with that I do not have more in defense all day 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.200
 I never go to Berlin apn 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.910
 the state has to fight more what should I have there as against Berlin RP 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.590
 Lorenzen, it was another madness to see these waters like seconds 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.539
 sold on the clock under steady 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.209
 who leaked from us it was just great 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.680
 after 90 seconds before the end of the game the main game will be blocked 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.079
 the Berlin Oliver Friedrich carries the ball to the touchdown over the whole 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:25.979
 Place on a 13 10 7-channel of the main club 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:31.089
 Wertheim 13 to 14 a very bitter moment for the Stuttgarters 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:37.219
 because time spoke now against the hosts the cyclists from Berlin Vienna like 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.259
 already in the final 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:43.680
 but then it came just the dream couple of which farmer and Tim Scholz wants 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:48.389
 him the man who was on the spot and could catch the ball for it will be in 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.579
 his teammates will be grateful for a long time and not only the 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.609
 real hype to ponder the hard moments in which he was very good 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:00.709
 and other 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.919
 just by not going for field goes or tabs but we could do it 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.009
 The Berliner started to let us have a good start, we knew that 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.199
 They have a very good defense and are really good today 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:16.329
 would have been if they percent with new furniture 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.339
 over the entire playing time, however, the progress was not 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:20.250
 fortunately 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.790
 but deserved winners 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.760
 13 to 0 against them already in the first quarter lead but then only that 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.229
 no leaseholder thriller yet 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:32.299
 In the final on 6 9 goalkeeper, the Scorpions meet the reigning champion 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.430
 Braunschweig and then the Ghazi Stadium will revive, but now 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:40.429
 a huge success for the Stuttgart Scorpions 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.049
 hard-won victory 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:48.669
 Dear spectators because he is now Klaus Mecherlein Manager of Stuttgart 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:50.939
 Scorpions first congratulations 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.529
 about the situation today teaser 1 so this first time move into the finals of the 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:58.129
 German American Football Championship will be defeated first 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.530
 only aged a few years but within a few gaming seconds 

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:03.889
 I have become of the moon and again 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.889
 in German for us, of course, percent means 

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:08.719
 should I say 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:12.229
 The recognition for many he has works a lot of hard work on the board 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:15.289
 anyway by the coaches of the team 

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:18.439
 During the World Cup, we will do everything possible around him 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:21.869
 14 days more than winning, I still remember 

00:04:21.869 --> 00:04:22.900
 not at all 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.249
 and the opponent is probably Braunschweig minimal retract 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.370
 but we will do everything we can for the players 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.800
 the coaches 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.740
 you can already say that is a fantastic success everything he does 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.120
 how did they manage this success? 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.139
 following that of course help in the board itself 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.569
 Paul is dead 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:47.569
 artnet great team run 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:49.620
 brought together 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.620
 second, we have a very good one 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.489
 But led by NATO had to have the other coaches with a great job 

00:04:57.489 --> 00:04:58.460
 made 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.680
 and have proven themselves as a team on the side 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.150
 and of course there are a few more 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.150
 Bremen wants Orenburg and a few more 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:13.870

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.990
