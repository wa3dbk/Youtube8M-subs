what I mean by this we're going to
quantify<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:17.550> footwork<00:00:17.939> because<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> lot<00:00:18.480> of

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:18.509 
quantify it footwork because a lot of

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:20.749 
quantify it footwork because a lot of
people<00:00:18.689> don't<00:00:19.050> really<00:00:19.230> appreciate<00:00:19.610> what<00:00:20.610> the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
going to quantify this is through a

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.299 
going to quantify this is through a
drill<00:00:27.450> called<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.930> footwork<00:00:28.259> number<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:29.299 --> 00:00:29.309 
drill called the footwork number and the

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:30.979 
drill called the footwork number and the
footwork<00:00:29.520> number<00:00:29.969> anybody<00:00:30.239> can<00:00:30.540> do<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.809> I

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:30.989 
footwork number anybody can do this I

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.590 
footwork number anybody can do this I
recommend<00:00:31.169> you<00:00:31.590> try<00:00:31.770> it<00:00:31.919> is<00:00:32.120> after<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.420> hit

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
recommend you try it is after you hit

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.020 
recommend you try it is after you hit
the<00:00:33.750> shot<00:00:33.899> Carly<00:00:34.350> BAM<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.190> ball<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.460> gone<00:00:35.670> and

the shot Carly BAM the ball is gone and

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.610 
the shot Carly BAM the ball is gone and
before<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.780> hit<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.020> next<00:00:37.170> shot<00:00:37.410> we're<00:00:37.590> going

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
before you hit the next shot we're going

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.860 
before you hit the next shot we're going
to<00:00:37.770> count<00:00:37.980> every<00:00:38.370> step<00:00:38.670> even<00:00:38.910> if<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:39.360> if<00:00:39.720> you

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
to count every step even if it's if you

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.470 
to count every step even if it's if you
go<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.830> that's<00:00:41.070> two<00:00:41.340> left<00:00:42.240> right<00:00:42.450> left

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
go like that that's two left right left

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.060 
go like that that's two left right left
right<00:00:42.720> right<00:00:42.990> right<00:00:43.020> right<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.530> know<00:00:43.650> a<00:00:43.680> split

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
right right right right you know a split

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.850 
right right right right you know a split
step<00:00:44.250> like<00:00:44.400> this<00:00:44.610> would<00:00:45.030> be<00:00:45.180> -<00:00:45.390> okay<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.710> we're

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
step like this would be - okay so we're

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.319 
step like this would be - okay so we're
going<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.040> add<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.430> I'm<00:00:47.520> going<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.730> count<00:00:48.000> okay

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
going to add and I'm going to count okay

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.780 
going to add and I'm going to count okay
I'm<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.560> do<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.739> for<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.160> initially<00:00:50.640> one

example at the pro level you'll see

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.389 
example at the pro level you'll see
footwork<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.410> between<00:01:01.770> shots<00:01:02.160> they

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
footwork in this between shots they

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.310 
footwork in this between shots they
average<00:01:02.700> twelve<00:01:03.059> or<00:01:03.300> more<00:01:03.329> steps<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:04.079> quite

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
average twelve or more steps it's quite

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:15.359 
you go to like 2 3 fives

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:17.209 
you go to like 2 3 fives
now<00:01:15.749> you're<00:01:15.869> getting<00:01:16.109> fives<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.560> sixes<00:01:16.710> maybe

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:17.219 
now you're getting fives and sixes maybe

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:19.849 
now you're getting fives and sixes maybe
seven<00:01:17.549> eight<00:01:17.789> so<00:01:18.539> it's<00:01:18.749> directly<00:01:19.049> correlated
