00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
people what we've got here

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.300 
people what we've got here
well<00:00:48.400> this<00:00:48.820> is<00:00:49.030> a<00:00:49.530> 1968<00:00:50.530> Camaro<00:00:50.650> that's<00:00:51.130> been

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.310 
well this is a 1968 Camaro that's been

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.050 
well this is a 1968 Camaro that's been
heavily<00:00:51.760> modified<00:00:53.400> probably<00:00:54.400> the<00:00:54.489> most

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.060 
heavily modified probably the most

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.660 
heavily modified probably the most
radical<00:00:55.480> kind<00:00:56.020> of<00:00:56.380> conversion<00:00:57.220> is<00:00:57.310> that<00:00:57.520> it's

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
radical kind of conversion is that it's

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.190 
radical kind of conversion is that it's
all-wheel<00:00:57.820> drive

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
all-wheel drive

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.280

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
assembly to modify the front end to

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.690 
assembly to modify the front end to
all-wheel<00:01:05.710> drive<00:01:05.950> and<00:01:05.979> then<00:01:06.220> built<00:01:06.430> a<00:01:06.520> custom

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.219 
understanding this right you got a
front-wheel<00:01:49.149> drive<00:01:49.179> and<00:01:49.689> all-wheel<00:01:49.810> drive

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.260 
front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive
hook<00:01:50.709> together<00:01:50.889> correct<00:01:51.490> so<00:01:51.819> you<00:01:51.849> didn't<00:01:52.119> use

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
hook together correct so you didn't use

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.719 
hook together correct so you didn't use
a<00:01:52.299> proven<00:01:53.139> all-wheel<00:01:53.770> drive<00:01:54.009> system<00:01:54.429> you<00:01:54.579> came

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
a proven all-wheel drive system you came

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.239 
a proven all-wheel drive system you came
well<00:01:54.880> you<00:01:55.029> had<00:01:55.119> engineer<00:01:55.599> Oleg<00:01:56.099> because<00:01:57.099> we

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:57.249 
well you had engineer Oleg because we

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:58.800 
well you had engineer Oleg because we
use<00:01:57.429> the<00:01:57.579> Trailblazer<00:01:57.999> SS<00:01:58.450> that<00:01:58.659> was

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
use the Trailblazer SS that was

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.539 
use the Trailblazer SS that was
essentially<00:01:59.499> at<00:01:59.590> all<00:01:59.709> wheel<00:01:59.889> drive<00:01:59.920> truck

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
essentially at all wheel drive truck

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.599 
essentially at all wheel drive truck
okay<00:02:01.060> I<00:02:01.240> use<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.349> front<00:02:02.740> drive<00:02:03.009> assembly<00:02:03.429> from

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609 
okay I use the front drive assembly from

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.960 
okay I use the front drive assembly from
that

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
that

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.500 
that
with<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.390> four<00:02:05.050> l70<00:02:05.620> transfer<00:02:06.340> case<00:02:06.550> and<00:02:06.820> the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
with the four l70 transfer case and the

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.350 
with the four l70 transfer case and the
14<00:02:08.110> bolt<00:02:08.260> rear<00:02:08.500> end<00:02:08.710> from<00:02:09.460> the<00:02:09.520> trailblazer<00:02:10.180> as

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
14 bolt rear end from the trailblazer as

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.410 
14 bolt rear end from the trailblazer as
well<00:02:10.600> I<00:02:10.780> just<00:02:11.230> narrowed<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.800> rear<00:02:11.950> end<00:02:12.420> six

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
well I just narrowed the rear end six

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.570 
well I just narrowed the rear end six
inches<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:14.770> that<00:02:14.890> that<00:02:15.040> way<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.250> would<00:02:15.430> get

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
inches so that that way you would get

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.340 
inches so that that way you would get
that<00:02:15.700> deep<00:02:15.910> dish<00:02:16.120> look<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.540> we're<00:02:16.720> oh<00:02:17.020> that's

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
that deep dish look and we're oh that's

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.510 
that deep dish look and we're oh that's
beautiful<00:02:17.620> what<00:02:18.070> is<00:02:18.100> it

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
beautiful what is it

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.700 
beautiful what is it
flip-flop<00:02:19.180> on<00:02:19.420> this<00:02:19.750> is<00:02:19.930> pro<00:02:20.140> spray<00:02:20.410> paint

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
flip-flop on this is pro spray paint

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.810 
flip-flop on this is pro spray paint
it's<00:02:21.120> it's<00:02:22.120> called<00:02:22.300> ecstasy<00:02:22.660> pearl<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:24.550> you

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
it's it's called ecstasy pearl so you

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.850 
it's it's called ecstasy pearl so you
can<00:02:25.000> see<00:02:25.180> it's<00:02:25.390> got<00:02:25.570> kind<00:02:25.780> of<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:25.990> greenish<00:02:26.260> gold

know<00:02:59.320> if<00:02:59.410> you<00:02:59.500> can<00:02:59.650> see<00:03:00.040> down<00:03:00.220> in<00:03:00.400> there<00:03:00.580> but

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
know if you can see down in there but

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.220 
know if you can see down in there but
you<00:03:00.820> can<00:03:00.850> actually<00:03:01.120> see<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.480> half<00:03:01.660> shafts<00:03:02.110> and

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
you can actually see the half shafts and

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.530 
you can actually see the half shafts and
stuff<00:03:02.440> running<00:03:02.800> down<00:03:02.950> there<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.970> know<00:03:04.000> the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
stuff running down there you know the

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.630 
stuff running down there you know the
the<00:03:05.140> drive<00:03:05.590> assembly<00:03:05.770> actually<00:03:06.340> runs<00:03:06.520> through

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
the drive assembly actually runs through

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.270 
the drive assembly actually runs through
the<00:03:06.970> oil<00:03:07.150> pan<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:08.140> drive<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.739> opposite<00:03:09.100> side

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
the oil pan to drive the opposite side

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.520 
the oil pan to drive the opposite side
yeah<00:03:09.580> because<00:03:10.209> that's<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.870> only<00:03:11.200> way<00:03:11.320> that

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
yeah because that's the only way that

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.070 
yeah because that's the only way that
that<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.310> front<00:03:13.090> drive<00:03:13.390> assembly<00:03:13.690> can<00:03:13.989> be

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
that the front drive assembly can be

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.260 
that the front drive assembly can be
high<00:03:14.590> enough<00:03:14.770> that<00:03:15.580> it<00:03:15.790> doesn't<00:03:15.970> make<00:03:16.239> it

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
high enough that it doesn't make it

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.880 
high enough that it doesn't make it
super<00:03:16.750> tall<00:03:16.959> I<00:03:17.110> mean<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:17.320> can<00:03:17.500> see<00:03:17.650> it's<00:03:17.800> a

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
super tall I mean you can see it's a

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.740 
super tall I mean you can see it's a
little<00:03:18.100> taller<00:03:18.310> than<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.940> normal<00:03:19.360> mode<00:03:19.510> right

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
little taller than a normal mode right

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.630 
little taller than a normal mode right
but<00:03:20.050> I<00:03:20.080> mean<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.410> all-wheel<00:03:20.830> drive<00:03:21.070> yet<00:03:21.280> cram

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
but I mean the all-wheel drive yet cram

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.460 
but I mean the all-wheel drive yet cram
it<00:03:21.760> in<00:03:21.850> there<00:03:21.880> somewhere<00:03:22.209> right<00:03:22.480> but<00:03:23.380> is

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
it in there somewhere right but is

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.600 
it in there somewhere right but is
really<00:03:23.739> custom-made<00:03:24.610> Oh

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
really custom-made Oh
