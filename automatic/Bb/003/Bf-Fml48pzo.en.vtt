00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
stroke roll speed now I am going to show

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.040 
stroke roll speed now I am going to show
you<00:00:38.370> an<00:00:38.579> exercise<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.420> do<00:00:39.480> on<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> daily

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
you an exercise that I do on a daily

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.139 
you an exercise that I do on a daily
basis<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:41.040> has<00:00:41.160> allowed<00:00:41.430> me<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.640> literally

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
basis that has allowed me to literally

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.170 
basis that has allowed me to literally
double<00:00:42.780> my<00:00:43.379> single<00:00:43.800> stroke<00:00:44.070> roll<00:00:44.250> speed<00:00:44.579> no

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
double my single stroke roll speed no

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.750 
double my single stroke roll speed no
work<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.780> exaggeration<00:00:46.590> you're<00:00:47.340> gonna<00:00:47.460> start

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
work of exaggeration you're gonna start

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.600 
work of exaggeration you're gonna start
off<00:00:47.910> with<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.360> basic<00:00:48.780> beat<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.559> basic<00:00:50.129> count<00:00:50.399> then

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
off with a basic beat a basic count then

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.490 
off with a basic beat a basic count then
you<00:00:50.700> can<00:00:50.820> do<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.210> metronome<00:00:51.719> or<00:00:51.930> just

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
you can do this to metronome or just

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.290 
you can do this to metronome or just
count<00:00:52.710> out<00:00:53.039> louder<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.640> your<00:00:53.760> head<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.090> I'm

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
count out louder in your head like I'm

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.200 
count out louder in your head like I'm
gonna<00:00:54.570> do<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.469> each<00:00:55.829> count<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.820> going<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.090> get

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
gonna do so each count is going to get

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.460 
gonna do so each count is going to get
one<00:00:57.600> hit<00:00:58.020> 1<00:00:58.980> 2<00:00:59.309> 3<00:01:00.120> 4<00:01:00.809> 1<00:01:01.410> 2<00:01:01.680> 3<00:01:02.300> 4<00:01:03.300> then<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.290> get<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
one hit 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 then you get a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.609 
one hit 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 then you get a
double<00:01:04.920> thats<00:01:05.339> piece<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.939> each<00:01:06.299> count<00:01:06.600> gets<00:01:07.020> 2

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
double thats piece on each count gets 2

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.310 
double thats piece on each count gets 2
hits<00:01:07.920> 1<00:01:08.520> 2<00:01:09.000> 3<00:01:09.479> 4<00:01:10.140> 1<00:01:10.619> 2<00:01:10.890> 3<00:01:11.220> 4<00:01:12.080> then<00:01:13.080> you're<00:01:13.229> gonna

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
hits 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 then you're gonna

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.859 
hits 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 then you're gonna
double<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.310> speed<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.180> each<00:01:15.540> count

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
double that speed so that each count

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.050 
double that speed so that each count
gets<00:01:16.140> 4<00:01:16.530> hits<00:01:16.909> 2<00:01:17.909> 3<00:01:18.450> 4<00:01:18.869> 1

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
gets 4 hits 2 3 4 1

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.570 
gets 4 hits 2 3 4 1
it's<00:01:21.990> literally<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.680> simple<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.400> if<00:01:23.490> you

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
it's literally that simple and if you

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.420 
it's literally that simple and if you
really<00:01:23.790> want<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.240> can<00:01:24.420> then<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.920> speed

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
really want you can then have that speed

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.510 
really want you can then have that speed
so<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.759> each<00:01:26.909> count<00:01:27.270> gets<00:01:27.450> 2<00:01:27.689> hits<00:01:27.930> again<00:01:28.290> 1<00:01:29.040> 2

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
so that each count gets 2 hits again 1 2

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.399 
so that each count gets 2 hits again 1 2
3<00:01:29.970> 4<00:01:30.540> 1<00:01:31.020> 2<00:01:31.320> 3<00:01:31.680> 4<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.759> then<00:01:33.360> have<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.259> that

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
3 4 1 2 3 4 and then have that so that

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.569 
3 4 1 2 3 4 and then have that so that
each<00:01:34.590> count<00:01:34.979> gets<00:01:35.250> one<00:01:35.820> hit<00:01:36.329> once<00:01:36.689> again<00:01:37.020> 1<00:01:37.619> 2<00:01:38.130> 3

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
each count gets one hit once again 1 2 3

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.069 
each count gets one hit once again 1 2 3
4<00:01:39.180> 1<00:01:39.689> 2<00:01:39.930> 3<00:01:40.200> 4<00:01:41.509> whatever<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.659> do<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.869> I'm<00:01:42.990> gonna

drummer now a little bonus tip that I
have<00:02:52.900> for<00:02:53.079> you<00:02:53.349> is<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:54.310> sort<00:02:54.730> of<00:02:54.849> increase<00:02:55.299> the

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
have for you is to sort of increase the

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.630 
have for you is to sort of increase the
muscles<00:02:56.019> that<00:02:56.140> you<00:02:56.379> have<00:02:56.590> in<00:02:56.799> your<00:02:56.920> forearms

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
muscles that you have in your forearms

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.250 
muscles that you have in your forearms
over<00:02:57.790> here<00:02:58.060> which<00:02:58.510> are<00:02:58.690> basically<00:02:59.110> the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
over here which are basically the

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.009 
over here which are basically the
muscles<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.769> allow<00:03:00.129> you<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:01.180> fast<00:03:01.720> twitch

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
muscles that allow you the fast twitch

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.600 
muscles that allow you the fast twitch
muscle<00:03:02.440> fibers<00:03:02.860> that<00:03:02.890> allow<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.400> play<00:03:03.549> a

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
muscle fibers that allow you to play a

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.270 
muscle fibers that allow you to play a
single<00:03:04.090> stroke<00:03:04.360> roll<00:03:04.599> so<00:03:05.019> quickly<00:03:05.530> now<00:03:06.099> if<00:03:06.190> you

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
single stroke roll so quickly now if you

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.160 
single stroke roll so quickly now if you
take<00:03:06.489> a<00:03:06.519> look<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.879> have<00:03:07.000> some<00:03:07.209> light<00:03:07.569> a<00:03:07.780> normal

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
take a look I have some light a normal

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.830 
take a look I have some light a normal
aluminum<00:03:08.890> nylon<00:03:09.430> six<00:03:09.760> right<00:03:09.940> here<00:03:09.970> if<00:03:10.630> I

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
aluminum nylon six right here if I

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.110 
aluminum nylon six right here if I
wanted<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.290> make<00:03:11.500> my<00:03:11.739> forearm<00:03:12.160> stronger<00:03:12.730> to

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
wanted to make my forearm stronger to

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.569 
wanted to make my forearm stronger to
increase<00:03:13.569> my<00:03:13.720> single<00:03:14.230> stroke<00:03:14.590> roll<00:03:14.799> speed<00:03:15.310> I

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
increase my single stroke roll speed I

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.180 
increase my single stroke roll speed I
would<00:03:16.090> get<00:03:16.650> I'm<00:03:17.650> sorry

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
would get I'm sorry

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.250 
would get I'm sorry
heavier<00:03:18.790> sticks<00:03:19.150> like<00:03:19.420> these<00:03:19.600> these<00:03:19.900> sticks

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
heavier sticks like these these sticks

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.069 
heavier sticks like these these sticks
are<00:03:20.380> much<00:03:20.799> thicker<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.549> much<00:03:22.180> much<00:03:22.599> heavier

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
are much thicker and much much heavier

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.129 
are much thicker and much much heavier
and<00:03:23.650> I<00:03:23.799> would<00:03:24.010> practice<00:03:24.250> my<00:03:24.840> single<00:03:25.840> stroke

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
and I would practice my single stroke

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.210 
and I would practice my single stroke
roll<00:03:27.599> with<00:03:28.599> these<00:03:28.810> heavier<00:03:29.349> sticks<00:03:29.950> that

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
roll with these heavier sticks that

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.370 
roll with these heavier sticks that
would<00:03:30.400> therefore<00:03:30.880> develop<00:03:31.299> my<00:03:31.810> forearm

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
would therefore develop my forearm

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.970 
would therefore develop my forearm
muscles<00:03:32.799> a<00:03:33.040> lot<00:03:33.579> better<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:34.810> allow<00:03:35.769> me<00:03:35.919> to

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
muscles a lot better and allow me to

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.490 
muscles a lot better and allow me to
play<00:03:36.190> my<00:03:36.340> single<00:03:36.730> stroke<00:03:37.000> roll<00:03:37.150> faster<00:03:37.930> now<00:03:38.380> if

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
play my single stroke roll faster now if

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.050 
play my single stroke roll faster now if
you<00:03:38.620> get<00:03:38.739> a<00:03:38.769> little<00:03:39.040> tense<00:03:39.280> feeling<00:03:39.609> in<00:03:39.910> your

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
you get a little tense feeling in your

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.599 
you get a little tense feeling in your
forearm<00:03:40.569> and<00:03:40.840> a<00:03:41.319> little<00:03:41.590> pain<00:03:41.859> that<00:03:42.459> is

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
forearm and a little pain that is

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.159 
forearm and a little pain that is
actually<00:03:43.030> good<00:03:43.329> because<00:03:43.660> that<00:03:43.690> means<00:03:43.959> that

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
actually good because that means that

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.229 
actually good because that means that
you<00:03:44.290> are<00:03:44.319> working<00:03:44.680> your<00:03:45.010> forearm<00:03:45.370> muscles<00:03:45.730> it

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
you are working your forearm muscles it

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.370 
you are working your forearm muscles it
also<00:03:46.450> means<00:03:46.720> you<00:03:46.810> should<00:03:46.989> take<00:03:47.169> a<00:03:47.200> little

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
also means you should take a little

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.629 
also means you should take a little
break<00:03:47.530> but<00:03:48.099> it<00:03:48.220> means<00:03:48.310> that<00:03:48.489> you're

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
break but it means that you're

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.640 
break but it means that you're
strengthening<00:03:49.269> them<00:03:49.450> now<00:03:49.930> another<00:03:50.500> little

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
strengthening them now another little

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.409 
strengthening them now another little
trick<00:03:51.010> if<00:03:51.130> you<00:03:51.160> don't<00:03:51.459> have<00:03:51.639> heavier<00:03:52.060> sticks

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:52.419 
trick if you don't have heavier sticks

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:54.120 
trick if you don't have heavier sticks
or<00:03:52.599> if<00:03:52.930> you<00:03:53.019> don't<00:03:53.169> want<00:03:53.349> to<00:03:53.410> use<00:03:53.530> heavier<00:03:53.889> six

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
or if you don't want to use heavier six

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.759 
or if you don't want to use heavier six
what<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.400> can<00:03:54.579> do<00:03:54.669> is<00:03:54.760> actually<00:03:55.030> take<00:03:55.989> your

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
what you can do is actually take your

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.370 
what you can do is actually take your
light<00:03:57.400> your<00:03:57.760> original<00:03:58.120> sticks<00:03:58.450> oh<00:03:58.750> the<00:03:59.169> light

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
light your original sticks oh the light

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.229
