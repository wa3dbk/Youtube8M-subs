comfortable<00:00:50.660> I<00:00:51.660> find<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.289> web<00:00:52.980> pages<00:00:53.340> are<00:00:53.460> a

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
comfortable I find that web pages are a

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.400 
comfortable I find that web pages are a
little<00:00:53.610> small<00:00:54.000> but<00:00:54.390> these<00:00:54.600> days<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.899> lot<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.289> web

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
little small but these days a lot of web

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.229 
little small but these days a lot of web
pages<00:00:55.440> are<00:00:55.920> designed<00:00:56.280> for<00:00:56.940> mobile<00:00:57.059> devices

Wi-Fi and even when you're disconnected
you<00:02:00.180> can<00:02:00.360> go<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.659> read<00:02:00.840> anything<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:02.070> is

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
you can go and read anything that is

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.069 
you can go and read anything that is
downloaded<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.060> that's<00:02:03.509> pretty<00:02:03.659> valuable

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
downloaded and that's pretty valuable

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.319 
downloaded and that's pretty valuable
because<00:02:04.380> obviously<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:05.310> have<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> Wi-Fi

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
because obviously I have the Wi-Fi

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.690 
because obviously I have the Wi-Fi
version<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.020> tablet<00:02:07.409> here<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.459> I'd<00:02:08.550> like

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
version of the tablet here and I'd like

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.919 
version of the tablet here and I'd like
to<00:02:08.819> read<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.090> news<00:02:09.239> when<00:02:09.479> I'm<00:02:09.569> out<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:09.780> about

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
to read the news when I'm out and about

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.260 
to read the news when I'm out and about
and<00:02:10.349> not<00:02:10.800> connected<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.520> that's<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.239> really

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
and not connected so that's a really

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.620 
and not connected so that's a really
valuable<00:02:12.780> applique

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
valuable applique

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.810 
valuable applique
for<00:02:13.930> me<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.350> was<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.500> something<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.430> didn't

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
for me and it was a something I didn't

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.610 
for me and it was a something I didn't
know<00:02:15.910> existed<00:02:16.390> but<00:02:16.570> was<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.110> pleasant<00:02:17.380> surprise

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
know existed but was a pleasant surprise

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.940 
know existed but was a pleasant surprise
when<00:02:17.920> I<00:02:18.310> got<00:02:18.550> my<00:02:18.670> tablet<00:02:19.470> another<00:02:20.470> application

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
when I got my tablet another application

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.770 
when I got my tablet another application
I'm<00:02:21.190> fairly<00:02:21.460> impressed<00:02:21.880> with<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.450> the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
I'm fairly impressed with is the

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.600 
I'm fairly impressed with is the
navigation<00:02:23.380> application<00:02:23.530> which<00:02:24.160> is<00:02:24.190> still<00:02:24.490> in

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
navigation application which is still in

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.520 
navigation application which is still in
beta<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:26.850> find<00:02:27.850> it<00:02:28.000> works<00:02:28.180> pretty<00:02:28.870> well<00:02:28.990> I<00:02:29.380> live

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
beta I find it works pretty well I live

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.260 
beta I find it works pretty well I live
in<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.710> pretty<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:30.700> guess<00:02:31.060> backwoods<00:02:31.630> area<00:02:32.050> of

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
in a pretty I guess backwoods area of

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.910 
in a pretty I guess backwoods area of
Pennsylvania<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:34.450> so<00:02:35.110> far<00:02:35.380> I've<00:02:35.470> not<00:02:35.590> had<00:02:35.710> any

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
Pennsylvania and so far I've not had any

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.500 
Pennsylvania and so far I've not had any
trouble<00:02:36.310> with<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.550> directions<00:02:37.000> this<00:02:37.210> gives

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
trouble with the directions this gives

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.220 
trouble with the directions this gives
now<00:02:38.380> there<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.620> a<00:02:38.650> drawback<00:02:39.720> by<00:02:40.720> default<00:02:41.050> it

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
now there is a drawback by default it

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.020 
now there is a drawback by default it
doesn't<00:02:41.650> store<00:02:42.070> any<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.460> maps<00:02:42.700> offline

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
doesn't store any of the maps offline

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.900 
doesn't store any of the maps offline
and<00:02:43.690> so<00:02:44.320> for<00:02:44.500> that<00:02:44.590> reason<00:02:44.650> if<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.730> have<00:02:45.880> a

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
and so for that reason if you have a

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.180 
and so for that reason if you have a
Wi-Fi<00:02:46.390> only<00:02:46.420> unit<00:02:46.990> like<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:47.320> have<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.620> is

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
Wi-Fi only unit like I have that is

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.800 
Wi-Fi only unit like I have that is
somewhat<00:02:48.550> of<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.700> problem<00:02:48.940> because<00:02:49.150> as<00:02:49.540> soon<00:02:49.690> as

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
somewhat of a problem because as soon as

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.320 
somewhat of a problem because as soon as
you<00:02:49.930> leave<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.830> lose<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.250> map<00:02:51.430> but<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:52.150> does

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
you leave you lose the map but it does

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.940 
you leave you lose the map but it does
have<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.630> option<00:02:52.960> of<00:02:53.020> downloading<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.590> fairly

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
have the option of downloading a fairly

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.550 
have the option of downloading a fairly
large<00:02:54.100> area<00:02:54.640> just<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:55.090> rectangular<00:02:55.990> block<00:02:56.260> of

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
large area just a rectangular block of

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.210 
large area just a rectangular block of
the<00:02:57.100> map<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:58.540> storing<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.410> offline<00:02:59.860> so<00:03:00.130> you

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
the map and storing it offline so you

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.720 
the map and storing it offline so you
can<00:03:00.400> use<00:03:00.640> it<00:03:00.990> it's<00:03:01.990> it's<00:03:02.320> probably<00:03:03.070> stores<00:03:03.550> a

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
can use it it's it's probably stores a

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.750 
can use it it's it's probably stores a
good<00:03:04.060> you<00:03:04.390> know<00:03:04.540> an<00:03:04.840> hour<00:03:05.020> to<00:03:05.410> drive<00:03:06.400> in<00:03:06.610> each

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
good you know an hour to drive in each

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.960 
good you know an hour to drive in each
direction<00:03:07.000> from<00:03:07.540> where<00:03:07.750> I<00:03:07.810> live<00:03:08.110> and<00:03:08.940> that<00:03:09.940> of

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
direction from where I live and that of

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.340 
direction from where I live and that of
course<00:03:10.120> isn't<00:03:10.450> sufficient<00:03:10.930> if<00:03:10.990> you're<00:03:11.110> going

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
course isn't sufficient if you're going

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.270 
course isn't sufficient if you're going
on<00:03:11.710> a<00:03:11.830> trip<00:03:12.160> there<00:03:12.880> are<00:03:13.060> other<00:03:13.530> free<00:03:14.530> gps

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
on a trip there are other free gps

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.690 
on a trip there are other free gps
applications<00:03:16.150> out<00:03:16.330> there<00:03:16.380> that<00:03:17.460> do<00:03:18.460> have

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
applications out there that do have

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.540 
applications out there that do have
offline<00:03:19.120> maps<00:03:19.450> but<00:03:20.170> i'm<00:03:20.320> guessing<00:03:20.620> that<00:03:20.860> at

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
offline maps but i'm guessing that at

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.800 
offline maps but i'm guessing that at
least<00:03:21.670> hopeful<00:03:22.120> that<00:03:22.240> google<00:03:22.660> will

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
least hopeful that google will

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.900 
least hopeful that google will
eventually<00:03:23.770> allow<00:03:23.860> you<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.340> download<00:03:24.490> the

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
eventually allow you to download the

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.450 
eventually allow you to download the
entire<00:03:25.150> US<00:03:25.630> or<00:03:26.140> at<00:03:26.530> least<00:03:26.710> you<00:03:27.070> know<00:03:27.160> several

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 
entire US or at least you know several

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.630 
entire US or at least you know several
states<00:03:27.850> worth<00:03:28.120> of<00:03:28.470> offline<00:03:29.470> maps<00:03:29.830> so<00:03:30.400> you<00:03:30.490> can

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
states worth of offline maps so you can

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.080 
states worth of offline maps so you can
use<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:30.940> more<00:03:31.150> effectively<00:03:32.700> as<00:03:33.700> far<00:03:33.970> as

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
use it more effectively as far as

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.960 
use it more effectively as far as
battery<00:03:34.480> life<00:03:34.690> it's<00:03:35.080> pretty<00:03:35.230> good<00:03:35.680> I<00:03:36.220> find<00:03:36.820> if

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
battery life it's pretty good I find if

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.410 
battery life it's pretty good I find if
I<00:03:37.150> if<00:03:37.690> I<00:03:37.870> charge<00:03:38.170> it<00:03:38.260> overnight<00:03:39.090> it'll<00:03:40.090> give<00:03:40.240> me

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
I if I charge it overnight it'll give me

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.240 
I if I charge it overnight it'll give me
pretty<00:03:40.660> much<00:03:40.840> all<00:03:41.050> day<00:03:41.080> of<00:03:41.470> use<00:03:41.710> now<00:03:42.010> I'm<00:03:42.100> not

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
pretty much all day of use now I'm not

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.920 
pretty much all day of use now I'm not
using<00:03:42.400> it<00:03:42.610> constantly<00:03:43.150> if<00:03:43.390> I<00:03:43.480> were<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:43.810> would

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
using it constantly if I were it would

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.110 
using it constantly if I were it would
probably<00:03:44.260> go<00:03:44.410> dead<00:03:44.650> but<00:03:45.130> I<00:03:45.160> can<00:03:45.400> use<00:03:45.580> it<00:03:45.730> a<00:03:45.850> lot

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
probably go dead but I can use it a lot

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.420 
probably go dead but I can use it a lot
throughout<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:47.110> day<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.590> by<00:03:48.070> the<00:03:48.100> end<00:03:48.250> of<00:03:48.340> the

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
throughout the day and by the end of the

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.160 
throughout the day and by the end of the
day<00:03:48.580> it's<00:03:48.730> pretty<00:03:49.030> much<00:03:49.240> depleted<00:03:49.540> and<00:03:49.990> ready

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
day it's pretty much depleted and ready
