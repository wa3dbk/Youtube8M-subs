00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
Oh literature this is a pool all new

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.170 
Oh literature this is a pool all new
xbla<00:03:20.250> game<00:03:20.550> xbla<00:03:21.420> game<00:03:21.690> yeah

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.809 

so<00:03:25.750> we<00:03:25.870> got<00:03:25.989> ton<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.409> new<00:03:26.500> enemies<00:03:26.920> like<00:03:27.640> the

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
so we got ton of new enemies like the

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.000 
so we got ton of new enemies like the
splitter<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:29.260> goes<00:03:29.469> against<00:03:29.769> everything

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
splitter that goes against everything

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.580 
splitter that goes against everything
that<00:03:30.159> we<00:03:30.310> taught<00:03:30.519> you<00:03:30.670> before<00:03:31.260> if<00:03:32.260> you<00:03:32.409> use

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
that we taught you before if you use

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.130 
that we taught you before if you use
your<00:03:32.769> light<00:03:33.010> on<00:03:33.040> them<00:03:33.430> that<00:03:33.760> was<00:03:33.909> split<00:03:34.209> as<00:03:34.989> you

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
your light on them that was split as you

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.349 
your light on them that was split as you
see<00:03:35.349> any<00:03:35.739> kind<00:03:35.980> of<00:03:36.040> lights<00:03:36.250> off<00:03:36.489> they'll<00:03:37.060> split

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
see any kind of lights off they'll split

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.240 
see any kind of lights off they'll split
they<00:03:37.480> go<00:03:38.049> to<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.319> white<00:03:38.530> you<00:03:38.650> have<00:03:38.799> to<00:03:38.890> shoot<00:03:39.099> it

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
they go to a white you have to shoot it

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.770 
they go to a white you have to shoot it
again<00:03:39.519> yeah<00:03:40.060> exactly<00:03:40.209> they<00:03:40.659> get

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
again yeah exactly they get

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.470 
again yeah exactly they get
progressively<00:03:40.930> weaker<00:03:41.760> but<00:03:42.760> there<00:03:43.329> is

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
progressively weaker but there is

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.970 
progressively weaker but there is
strength<00:03:43.780> in<00:03:43.989> numbers<00:03:44.049> so<00:03:44.560> you<00:03:44.650> need<00:03:44.799> to

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
strength in numbers so you need to

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.599 
strength in numbers so you need to
choose<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.670> tactics<00:03:46.209> carefully<00:03:47.400> another<00:03:48.400> new

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
choose the tactics carefully another new

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:51.270 
choose the tactics carefully another new
enemy<00:03:49.180> speed<00:03:49.719> grenades<00:03:50.079> coming<00:03:50.590> in<00:03:50.709> so<00:03:51.219> we

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
enemy speed grenades coming in so we

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.890 
enemy speed grenades coming in so we
have<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.400> Brenda<00:03:51.790> trenna<00:03:52.090> deer<00:03:52.329> that<00:03:52.510> keeps<00:03:52.780> his

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
have a Brenda trenna deer that keeps his

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.470 
have a Brenda trenna deer that keeps his
distance<00:03:53.250> again<00:03:54.250> offering<00:03:54.639> more<00:03:54.819> variation

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
distance again offering more variation

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.000 
distance again offering more variation
where<00:03:55.629> before<00:03:55.840> all<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.469> tape<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:56.889> would

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
where before all the tape and would

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.520 
where before all the tape and would
attack<00:03:57.310> you<00:03:57.489> always<00:03:57.879> there's<00:03:58.780> one<00:03:58.840> taker<00:03:59.260> that

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
attack you always there's one taker that

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.050 
attack you always there's one taker that
you<00:03:59.620> have<00:03:59.739> to<00:03:59.889> actually<00:04:00.040> hunt<00:04:00.400> down<00:04:00.639> and<00:04:00.909> kill

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
you have to actually hunt down and kill

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.789 
you have to actually hunt down and kill
otherwise<00:04:01.480> he'll<00:04:01.720> keep<00:04:02.049> his<00:04:02.109> distance<00:04:02.409> and

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
otherwise he'll keep his distance and

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:08.970 
otherwise he'll keep his distance and
