00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.430
 let us return to the assassin's creed reveletion parade of a direct test 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.289
 of the multiplayer sector in the space dedicated to the palasharp 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.710
 french 3 struscio flor of e3 2011 recently concluded yes 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.419
 let's look at guided tours with the developers allowed us to notice 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.629
 right away with the guys from ubisoft montreal we decided to keep 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.100
 basically the crowd already appreciated the predecessor 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.250
 however, making a number of corrections and small additions based on the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.650
 feedback received from critics and communities 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.990
 a few minutes in the company of the trial version are enough to make yourself go 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.010
 account of how the mechanics behind the commitments have remained unchanged and 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.290
 they offer once again the peculiar mix of slow and sudden rhythm 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.690
 acceleration 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.330
 you play the cat with the mouse in the alleys of Constantinople rodi these le 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.929
 settings up to night 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:05.479
 the only visible novelty represented the templar nature of ours 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:06.330
 alter ego 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.400
 in fact, the fraction indicates that a large number of safety was added 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.630
 new skins to be used in mestizos 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.050
 it is however sufficient to pause for a few moments more and spend the night 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.400
 interesting ajit 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.320
 the first long requested by the community is represented by 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.900
 improvement of the counter moxa that besides being much more intuitive 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.190
 if put on a score able to stun the opponent for a few seconds 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.770
 in the case instead it should fail failing the timing needed the fact of 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.110
 having identified the opponent will still guarantee the removal of a certain number 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.210
 more the suki scovolo 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.210
 steps forward also perillo course the opponent in turn vote + simple ed 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.890
 immediate use 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.020
 for obvious on the battlefield but equally important are 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.850
 system improvements made her come the characters 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.860
 the key ending in itself in the previous iteration 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.230
 although it was not possible to test it during the direct test is 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.869
 A system of monetary rewards has been implemented 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.110
 which were finally free access to new stylus weapons 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.510
 greatly improving the personalized approach to the growth of one's own 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.590
 alter ego 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.309
 there was also an excellent incentive for the spice killing to be noticed 

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:11.379
 while in brate not all of them asked for animation of the same 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.219
 duration in relation to the elimination of sneak will guarantee player one 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:19.099
 move much shorter speaking with read always keeping london for 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.779
 earn precious seconds and make the countermoves very difficult to guess 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:26.139
 naturally, new skills will not be lacking 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:29.370
 during our test we were able to test a kind of ny alla 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:32.699
 excellent busara land to surprise the pursuer 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:36.039
 the ubisoft guys also suggested that they also view the 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:39.099
 first single player will have an online multiplayer role 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.249
 the developers have also confirmed a greater commitment from the point of view 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:45.229
 of the contextualization of the multiplayer sector 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:48.319
 it will once again be through the introductory cocks 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.879
 which will carry forward the subplot dedicated to the destruction of the programs 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.260
 recruits at the explain in a more cohesive and understandable way 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.299
 as far as the novelties are concerned, it was merely refining the bases just having labradford 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.140
 the developers seem to have learned the right way 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.150
 listening to the free mind community 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.929
 and making what appears to be right click 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:10.439
 the rewards for the lastest players should discourage ramblers 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.159
 the introduction of the currency gives hope for much more interesting growth 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.079
