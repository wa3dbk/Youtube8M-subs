hi today I'm going to show you a

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.890 
hi today I'm going to show you a
technique<00:00:04.259> that's<00:00:04.770> gonna<00:00:04.950> help<00:00:05.280> reduce<00:00:06.060> bulk

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:06.900 
technique that's gonna help reduce bulk

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.020 
technique that's gonna help reduce bulk
in<00:00:07.410> your<00:00:07.770> quilt<00:00:08.069> blocks<00:00:08.400> where<00:00:08.670> you<00:00:08.700> have

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
in your quilt blocks where you have

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.750 
in your quilt blocks where you have
multiple<00:00:09.269> seams<00:00:09.809> come<00:00:10.260> together<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:11.190> lot<00:00:11.640> of

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:11.760 
multiple seams come together a lot of

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.230 
multiple seams come together a lot of
times<00:00:12.030> especially<00:00:12.690> on<00:00:13.170> stars<00:00:13.970> where<00:00:14.970> are<00:00:15.090> all

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
times especially on stars where are all

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.999 
times especially on stars where are all
the<00:00:15.480> points<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.109> star<00:00:16.320> meet<00:00:16.679> in<00:00:16.859> the

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:17.009 
the points of the star meet in the

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.120 
the points of the star meet in the
middle<00:00:17.369> you'll<00:00:17.909> have<00:00:18.150> a<00:00:18.179> big<00:00:18.539> thick<00:00:18.989> knot<00:00:19.560> feel

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
middle you'll have a big thick knot feel

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.029 
middle you'll have a big thick knot feel
where<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.730> seam<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.589> an<00:00:22.589> easy<00:00:22.739> way<00:00:23.009> to

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
where the seam is an easy way to

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.880 
where the seam is an easy way to
eliminate<00:00:23.429> this<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.899> press<00:00:25.199> your<00:00:25.560> seams

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
eliminate this is to press your seams

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.189 
eliminate this is to press your seams
either<00:00:26.369> in<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.849> clockwise<00:00:27.599> or<00:00:28.019> in<00:00:28.140> a

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
either in a clockwise or in a

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.009 
either in a clockwise or in a
counterclockwise<00:00:28.739> position<00:00:29.809> you<00:00:30.809> can<00:00:30.989> see

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
counterclockwise position you can see

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.810 
counterclockwise position you can see
here<00:00:31.559> that<00:00:31.910> I've<00:00:32.910> pressed<00:00:33.500> this<00:00:34.500> seam<00:00:34.860> towards

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
here that I've pressed this seam towards

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.300 
here that I've pressed this seam towards
my<00:00:36.000> lighter<00:00:36.210> fabric<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.830> one<00:00:38.070> also

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
my lighter fabric and this one also

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.370 
my lighter fabric and this one also
going<00:00:38.910> towards<00:00:39.150> the<00:00:39.270> lighter<00:00:39.450> fabric<00:00:39.990> so<00:00:40.170> it's

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.380 
going towards the lighter fabric so it's

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.540 
going towards the lighter fabric so it's
already<00:00:40.590> going<00:00:40.710> in<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.130> counterclockwise

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
already going in a counterclockwise

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.130 
already going in a counterclockwise
direction<00:00:42.710> so<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.940> middle<00:00:45.540> seam<00:00:45.870> where<00:00:46.110> I

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
direction so on this middle seam where I

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.000 
direction so on this middle seam where I
joined<00:00:46.560> the<00:00:47.040> two<00:00:47.280> blocks<00:00:48.180> together<00:00:48.770> I'm<00:00:49.770> going

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
joined the two blocks together I'm going

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.960 
joined the two blocks together I'm going
to<00:00:50.130> press<00:00:50.730> these<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.420> same<00:00:51.690> direction<00:00:51.960> and

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
to press these in the same direction and

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.290 
to press these in the same direction and
make<00:00:53.970> it<00:00:54.150> continue<00:00:54.990> in<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.410> counter<00:00:55.770> clockwise

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
make it continue in a counter clockwise

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.870 
make it continue in a counter clockwise
when<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.540> this<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.920> going<00:00:59.220> to<00:00:59.310> open<00:00:59.579> up

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
when I do this it's going to open up

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.720 
when I do this it's going to open up
this<00:01:00.120> center<00:01:00.570> point<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.320> make<00:01:02.130> a<00:01:02.160> star

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
this center point and make a star

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.330 
this center point and make a star
pinwheel<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.799> to<00:01:04.799> do<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.670> either

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
pinwheel and to do that you can either

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.090 
pinwheel and to do that you can either
just<00:01:08.340> twist<00:01:08.700> give<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.240> little<00:01:09.420> twist<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.170> pull

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
just twist give a little twist and pull

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.209 
just twist give a little twist and pull
it<00:01:11.280> apart<00:01:11.539> and<00:01:12.539> it<00:01:12.659> should<00:01:12.869> open<00:01:13.049> right<00:01:13.409> up<00:01:13.619> if

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
it apart and it should open right up if

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:15.950 
it apart and it should open right up if
you've<00:01:14.520> got<00:01:14.670> some<00:01:14.880> threads<00:01:15.240> there<00:01:15.569> you<00:01:15.780> can

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
you've got some threads there you can

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.020 
you've got some threads there you can
just<00:01:16.139> take<00:01:16.319> your<00:01:16.590> seam<00:01:17.189> ripper<00:01:17.219> and<00:01:17.609> kind<00:01:17.969> of

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
just take your seam ripper and kind of

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.129 
just take your seam ripper and kind of
break<00:01:18.270> those<00:01:18.509> loose<00:01:19.049> give<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.649> just<00:01:19.859> a<00:01:21.139> little

00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:22.139 
break those loose give you just a little

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:25.010 
break those loose give you just a little
loosening<00:01:22.799> up<00:01:22.950> there<00:01:23.219> and<00:01:23.789> that'll<00:01:24.569> open<00:01:24.689> that

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
loosening up there and that'll open that

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.039 
loosening up there and that'll open that
up<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.439> lay<00:01:26.039> it<00:01:26.159> out<00:01:26.249> flat<00:01:26.579> at<00:01:27.569> that<00:01:27.749> point

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
up and lay it out flat at that point

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.410 
up and lay it out flat at that point
then<00:01:28.229> you'll<00:01:28.469> just<00:01:28.740> continue<00:01:29.159> pressing<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:30.090> as

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
then you'll just continue pressing as as

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:39.859 
then you'll just continue pressing as as
normal

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.099 

and<00:01:40.619> give<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.130> little<00:01:41.719> tap<00:01:42.719> right<00:01:42.960> in<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
and give that little tap right in the

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:47.719 
and give that little tap right in the
middle<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:45.770> always<00:01:46.770> like<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:46.979> press<00:01:47.340> from<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
middle I always like to press from the

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.779 
middle I always like to press from the
front<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.479> don't<00:01:48.539> have<00:01:48.750> rolled<00:01:49.229> seams

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.109 

and<00:01:54.319> here<00:01:55.319> you<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.560> see<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.130> there's<00:01:57.030> a

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
and here you can see that there's a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.440 
and here you can see that there's a
little<00:01:57.360> pinwheel<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.740> middle<00:01:59.039> and<00:01:59.280> all<00:02:00.270> of

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
little pinwheel in the middle and all of

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.719 
little pinwheel in the middle and all of
these<00:02:00.630> seams<00:02:00.959> are<00:02:01.259> now<00:02:01.380> going<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:02.039> a

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
these seams are now going in a

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.059 
these seams are now going in a
counterclockwise<00:02:03.149> direction<00:02:03.679> so<00:02:04.679> depending

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
counterclockwise direction so depending

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.099 
counterclockwise direction so depending
on<00:02:05.159> your<00:02:05.310> block<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.909> know<00:02:06.329> your<00:02:06.450> seams<00:02:06.689> may<00:02:06.929> go

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
on your block you know your seams may go

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.169 
on your block you know your seams may go
the<00:02:07.259> other<00:02:07.380> direction<00:02:07.670> but<00:02:08.670> you'll<00:02:08.910> have<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the other direction but you'll have the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.119 
the other direction but you'll have the
same<00:02:09.360> result<00:02:09.810> you'll<00:02:09.989> have<00:02:10.170> this<00:02:10.379> little

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
same result you'll have this little

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.979 
same result you'll have this little
pinwheel<00:02:11.519> in<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.760> middle<00:02:12.030> when<00:02:12.180> it's<00:02:12.690> opened

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
pinwheel in the middle when it's opened

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.140 
pinwheel in the middle when it's opened
up
