could do for the exhaust I went for the
race<00:00:37.890> exhaust<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.610> think<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.149> looks<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.450> best

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
race exhaust I think it looks the best

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.790 
race exhaust I think it looks the best
you<00:00:39.870> know<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.200> obviously<00:00:40.260> it's<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.680> most

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
you know and it obviously it's the most

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.920 
you know and it obviously it's the most
expensive<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:42.030> lights<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.450> when<00:00:42.540> for<00:00:42.629> xenon

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
expensive for lights and when for xenon

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.090 
expensive for lights and when for xenon
lights<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.320> know<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.440> think<00:00:43.649> that's<00:00:43.800> what<00:00:43.920> most

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
lights you know I think that's what most

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.590

people<00:00:44.399> would<00:00:44.520> do<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.940> don't<00:00:45.120> really<00:00:45.420> like

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
people would do I don't really like

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.900

lights<00:00:48.030> look<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.360> lot<00:00:48.510> better<00:00:48.719> for<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.620> plate<00:00:49.829> I

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920
