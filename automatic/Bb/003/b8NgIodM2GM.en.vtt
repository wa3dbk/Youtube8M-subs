00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.620
 over the airport ust imsk gusty 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.870
 wind weather does not favor the flight 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.600
 but here it has long been nobody 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.600
 not 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:14.669
 view now he starts sometimes us 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:16.949
 there was once the best next to them 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.570
 more flight mechanic worked here 14 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.619
 years and in 2001 after bankruptcy 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.039
 enterprises like the other 300 employees 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.339
 left without wings and although in the eyes of Tuscany 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:28.679
 the camera he prefers not 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.129
 much more willing to be frank 

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:32.500
 chooses the role of guides museum 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.440
 where everything is plundered to the ground 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.000
 exhibits are our bare walls 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.600
 the walk begins with the control room 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.930
 item crews often dropped by our date 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.280
 our friends were mostly former 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.280
 aviators 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.590
 I believe that the busiest place was 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.880
 in the shelter 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.660
 all the information went through it 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.400
 who in terms of who is not in terms of something to work like 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.110
 since it is a friend the bus will not go to 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.570
 how much 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.470
 that's what turned us 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.160
 see 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.140
 we had the most comfortable and lively 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.719
 this year is ten years old 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:10.520
 since the bankruptcy of Ust Ilimsky 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.380
 the airport 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.070
 last ability he was 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.469
 the only harbor in Priangarya came 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:17.939
 on the way international airways therefore 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.280
 he was predicted of transpolar 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.290
 flights 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.040
 From the control room windows can be clearly seen 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.550
 landing strip envy the region 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.180
 3 kilometers long 300 meters 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.470
 not far from her remains only 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.840
 in the field of telescopic 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.760
 ladders 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.050
 this building did not see workers of radiation 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.890
 already nine years but despite this here 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.410
 still can be found working material 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.730
 this book is the bible for these 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.830
 risk compliance with it was produced 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.050
 aircraft maintenance that 154 any 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.090
 technique did he know about dogs 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.430
 according to experts, restoration 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.800
 the report is perhaps a reason for 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.840
 optimistic forecasts that serves 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.420
 the fact that the runway 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.520
 are in satisfactory 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.370
 condition the issue of resuscitation of the object 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.210
 repeatedly raised and 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.360
 a number of foreign 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.040
 carrier companies 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.870
 all I would just like for now is development 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.800
 small aircraft to start so you can 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.329
 It was 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.470
 This is due to the fact that demand 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.609
 with release 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:14.929
 perhaps with Krasnoyarsk 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:18.109
 few students are trained but 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.839
 but there is a big report 

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:23.399
 rub bargain big 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:25.759
 possibility of development of freight because 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:28.489
 Your mission was very convenient playground 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.439
 However, while specific plans for 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:31.969
 the revival of the hub 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:34.779
 no building hotel work takeoff 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.989
 the band all this is consigned to oblivion and 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.980
 only airplanes leaves asleep on 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.879
 trail like polled by airfield
