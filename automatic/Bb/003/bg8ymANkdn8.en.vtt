00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.510 
unlike most of the online streamers

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.690 
unlike most of the online streamers
where<00:06:18.750> it's<00:06:18.960> low<00:06:19.440> quality<00:06:19.770> like<00:06:20.160> you<00:06:20.460> can<00:06:20.610> see

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
where it's low quality like you can see

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.820 
where it's low quality like you can see
each<00:06:20.850> pixel<00:06:21.330> each<00:06:21.930> pixel's<00:06:22.350> half<00:06:22.500> the<00:06:22.650> screen

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
each pixel each pixel's half the screen

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.920 
each pixel each pixel's half the screen
not<00:06:23.790> like<00:06:23.910> that<00:06:24.060> is<00:06:24.180> very<00:06:24.420> high<00:06:24.570> quality

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
not like that is very high quality

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.930 
not like that is very high quality
content<00:06:25.110> so<00:06:25.590> there's<00:06:26.130> a<00:06:26.280> big<00:06:27.120> bonus<00:06:27.630> I<00:06:28.020> mean

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:28.940 
content so there's a big bonus I mean

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.510 
content so there's a big bonus I mean
makes<00:06:29.940> a<00:06:30.030> huge<00:06:30.300> difference<00:06:31.190> anyways<00:06:32.190> um

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:32.520 
makes a huge difference anyways um

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.460 
makes a huge difference anyways um
