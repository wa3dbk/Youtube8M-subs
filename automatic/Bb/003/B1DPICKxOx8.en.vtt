00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
auction system is a bit different so

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.850 
auction system is a bit different so

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
what I've done is instead of having one

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.920 
what I've done is instead of having one
centralized<00:00:47.489> auction<00:00:47.940> system<00:00:48.120> I've<00:00:48.539> given

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
turned out I think that this system will

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.039 
turned out I think that this system will
be<00:02:59.400> able<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.730> reward<00:03:00.090> sellers<00:03:00.630> who<00:03:00.780> have<00:03:00.900> taken

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
be able to reward sellers who have taken

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.470 
be able to reward sellers who have taken
time<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.560> acquire<00:03:02.130> crafty<00:03:02.850> items<00:03:03.030> that

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
time to acquire crafty items that

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.449 
time to acquire crafty items that
they're<00:03:03.660> selling<00:03:03.930> but<00:03:04.530> at<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.709> same<00:03:04.890> time<00:03:05.190> it

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
they're selling but at the same time it

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.979 
they're selling but at the same time it
doesn't<00:03:05.850> allow<00:03:06.060> buyers<00:03:06.329> to<00:03:06.630> just<00:03:06.810> get

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
doesn't allow buyers to just get

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.690 
doesn't allow buyers to just get
whatever<00:03:07.230> item<00:03:07.859> they<00:03:08.010> want<00:03:08.190> whenever<00:03:08.489> they
