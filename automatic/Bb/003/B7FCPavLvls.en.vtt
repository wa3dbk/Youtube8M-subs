00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
save least and I have a long list of

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.490 
save least and I have a long list of
reasons<00:00:20.970> as<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.359> why<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.660> game<00:00:22.080> could

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
potentially suck so I just figured it'd

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.670

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
are gonna cry a river about that

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.400 
are gonna cry a river about that
whatever<00:03:29.519> that's<00:03:30.299> that<00:03:30.599> i'm<00:03:30.750> not<00:03:30.780> going<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.169> do

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
whatever that's that i'm not going to do

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.780 
whatever that's that i'm not going to do
that<00:03:31.440> today<00:03:31.620> but<00:03:32.129> uh<00:03:33.349> it's<00:03:34.349> downloadable<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.459> i

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
that today but uh it's downloadable so i

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.619 
that today but uh it's downloadable so i
guess<00:03:37.400> that<00:03:38.400> doesn't<00:03:38.639> have<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.120> make<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.450> as

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
guess that doesn't have to make it as

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.759 
guess that doesn't have to make it as
high<00:03:39.989> profile<00:03:40.590> as<00:03:40.889> say<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.190> console<00:03:41.760> game<00:03:42.769> but

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
high profile as say a console game but

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.619 
high profile as say a console game but
those<00:03:44.010> games<00:03:44.250> take<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.489> while<00:03:44.699> to<00:03:44.849> make<00:03:44.970> too<00:03:45.239> so

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
those games take a while to make too so

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.270 
those games take a while to make too so
it<00:03:46.319> doesn't<00:03:46.680> sound<00:03:46.769> like<00:03:46.919> they<00:03:47.099> give

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
it doesn't sound like they give

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.339 
it doesn't sound like they give
themselves<00:03:47.519> a<00:03:47.849> lot<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.209> time<00:03:48.449> unless<00:03:48.810> they've

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
themselves a lot of time unless they've

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:51.909 
themselves a lot of time unless they've
been<00:03:49.500> developing<00:03:49.980> this<00:03:50.040> thing<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.340> long<00:03:50.669> time
