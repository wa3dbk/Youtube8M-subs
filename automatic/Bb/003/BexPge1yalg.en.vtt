00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
from binding in prison there I think

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:23.960

this<00:01:13.229> would<00:01:13.470> be<00:01:16.189> be<00:01:17.189> free<00:01:19.970> all<00:01:20.970> right<00:01:22.820> we<00:01:23.820> gotta

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
this would be be free all right we gotta

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.320 
this would be be free all right we gotta
win<00:01:24.920> but<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.130> know<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.700> figure<00:01:27.060> does

kind of the plastics a little bit chunky

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.240 
kind of the plastics a little bit chunky
as<00:01:47.730> I<00:01:48.570> said<00:01:48.870> before<00:01:48.900> in<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> Megatron<00:01:49.920> video

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
as I said before in the Megatron video

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:59.630 
as I said before in the Megatron video
uh<00:01:53.240> yeah<00:01:56.840> not<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:57.870> much<00:01:58.440> metallic<00:01:59.130> on<00:01:59.400> this

uh yeah not that much metallic on this

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.750 
uh yeah not that much metallic on this
figure<00:02:00.480> here<00:02:00.660> so<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:04.680> I'm<00:02:05.010> not<00:02:05.040> even<00:02:05.280> sure<00:02:05.610> I

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
figure here so and I'm not even sure I

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:14.480 
figure here so and I'm not even sure I
got<00:02:06.000> her<00:02:06.120> posed<00:02:06.450> up<00:02:06.750> right<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:13.310> that's<00:02:14.310> all

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
got her posed up right there that's all

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.300 
got her posed up right there that's all
we<00:02:14.640> got<00:02:15.680> this<00:02:16.680> rotator<00:02:17.250> around<00:02:17.730> there<00:02:19.280> get<00:02:20.280> a

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
we got this rotator around there get a

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.680 
we got this rotator around there get a
zoom<00:02:20.880> in<00:02:21.120> close<00:02:21.480> up<00:02:21.750> of<00:02:21.960> that<00:02:22.340> on<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:24.270> second

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
zoom in close up of that on the second

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.810 
zoom in close up of that on the second
pass<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:28.440> exactly<00:02:28.950> like<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.550> US

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
pass so is this exactly like the US

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.770 
pass so is this exactly like the US
version<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.480> think<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:32.550> chrome<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
version I think the the chrome the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
version I think the the chrome the
bronze<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:36.540> chrome<00:02:36.900> there's<00:02:37.170> no<00:02:37.260> chrome<00:02:37.560> them

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
bronze the chrome there's no chrome them

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.580 
bronze the chrome there's no chrome them
like<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:39.060> legs<00:02:39.360> have<00:02:39.990> a<00:02:40.020> little<00:02:40.350> bit<00:02:40.560> of

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
like the legs have a little bit of

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.850 
like the legs have a little bit of
bronze<00:02:41.220> metallic<00:02:41.990> kind<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.140> thing<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.650> them

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
bronze metallic kind of thing to them

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.530 
bronze metallic kind of thing to them

we're<00:03:27.890> gonna<00:03:28.010> transform<00:03:28.670> a<00:03:28.849> rough<00:03:29.090> let's<00:03:29.840> look

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
we're gonna transform a rough let's look

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.150 
we're gonna transform a rough let's look
at<00:03:30.049> the<00:03:30.110> bottom<00:03:30.470> side<00:03:30.680> there<00:03:33.430> yeah<00:03:34.540> of<00:03:35.540> course

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
at the bottom side there yeah of course

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.430 
at the bottom side there yeah of course
exactly<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.340> same<00:03:37.519> molded<00:03:38.030> is<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.170> US

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
exactly the same molded is the US

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.099 
exactly the same molded is the US
version<00:03:41.230> you<00:03:42.230> can<00:03:42.670> flip<00:03:43.670> around<00:03:43.879> to<00:03:44.810> get<00:03:44.989> her

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
version you can flip around to get her

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:53.190 
version you can flip around to get her
up<00:03:45.470> right<00:03:45.859> here

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200

alright<00:03:54.750> should<00:03:55.750> help<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:56.650> camera<00:03:56.980> up<00:03:57.040> a

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
alright should help the camera up a

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.320 
alright should help the camera up a
little<00:03:57.430> bit<00:03:57.550> higher<00:03:57.760> I<00:03:59.370> could<00:04:00.370> demonstrate

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
little bit higher I could demonstrate

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:22.190 
little bit higher I could demonstrate
that<00:04:02.110> on<00:04:02.349> camera<00:04:02.950> there<00:04:12.060> okay<00:04:17.459> there<00:04:18.459> we<00:04:18.609> go<00:04:18.639> I

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.030 

like<00:04:23.200> the<00:04:23.380> rubberized<00:04:23.710> feel<00:04:24.340> of<00:04:24.520> it<00:04:26.040> pretty

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
like the rubberized feel of it pretty

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.230

markup so let's see what zoom in there I
got<00:05:34.030> two<00:05:34.270> minutes<00:05:34.570> to<00:05:34.780> do<00:05:34.960> this<00:05:35.139> thing<00:05:40.470> what<00:05:41.470> do

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
got two minutes to do this thing what do

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.990 
got two minutes to do this thing what do
you<00:05:41.590> think<00:05:41.710> I<00:05:44.070> think<00:05:45.070> i<00:05:45.160> transformed<00:05:45.820> or

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
you think I think i transformed or

upright

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:00.719 

unlike<00:05:56.319> the<00:05:57.300> was<00:05:58.300> a<00:05:58.770> female<00:05:59.770> transformers

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
unlike the was a female transformers

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.649 
unlike the was a female transformers
which<00:06:00.909> don't<00:06:01.210> make<00:06:01.330> any<00:06:01.509> sense<00:06:01.719> but<00:06:03.270> and<00:06:04.270> her

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659 
which don't make any sense but and her

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:06.989 
which don't make any sense but and her
little<00:06:04.990> weapon<00:06:05.499> gun<00:06:05.800> thing<00:06:06.159> let's<00:06:06.550> put<00:06:06.849> that

00:06:06.989 --> 00:06:06.999 
little weapon gun thing let's put that

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:12.149 
little weapon gun thing let's put that
in<00:06:07.180> her<00:06:07.300> I<00:06:10.110> guess<00:06:11.110> it<00:06:11.379> goes<00:06:11.529> in<00:06:11.740> her<00:06:11.830> arm<00:06:11.949> like

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:12.159 
in her I guess it goes in her arm like

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:17.010 
in her I guess it goes in her arm like
that<00:06:12.189> I'm<00:06:12.580> guessing<00:06:13.770> what<00:06:15.059> you<00:06:16.059> close<00:06:16.659> up<00:06:16.689> over

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
that I'm guessing what you close up over

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:24.519 
that I'm guessing what you close up over
the<00:06:17.139> face

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:24.529 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:36.909
