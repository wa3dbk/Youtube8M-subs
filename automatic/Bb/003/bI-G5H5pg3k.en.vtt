 some time but who has better like 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.680
 this event works and hydrate 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.029
 nextel 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.300
 stay tuned that the video is 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.560
 to explain how the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.560
 draft f1 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.989
 personal speech here the atom today in the hfa 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.270
 will explain to you how 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.550
 nfl draft works 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.850
 the drastic one organized annual event 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.289
 by the league where the franchises have a chance 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.270
 to strengthen hiring recruiting 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:51.000
 main university players in the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.000
 last year this from such city 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.270
 where each franchise is supposed to be 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
 choose each draft round the draft 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.890
 and separate in seven rounds with 32 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.480
 choices that equals the number of 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.600
 existing franchises in li 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.210
 the ordering of these choices is given is a 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.110
 it is an inverted meritocracy what this 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.689
 I mean 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.689
 It's the worst team last year will have 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.790
 right to the best draft position of this 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.710
 for example are Texas that had the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.810
 worst campaign last year with only 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.400
 two wins and 14 losses 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.830
 this year will have the first choice in the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.689
 draft also the chance to hydrate the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.590
 best draft university player 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.409
 this year 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.900
 I'm turning the table on the last choice. 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.640
 of the first round the cearÃ¡ the ciosp was 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.780
 superbowl champion supposedly has the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.810
 best team 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.340
 daniel will have to chirp lower priority 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.259
 of choice in draft 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.450
 this is also for the faithful to maintain the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.299
 balance between teams and not letting 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.310
 that the champions hide and the teams 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.810
 who are with the worst campaigns are 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.990
 far behind so the main 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.880
 draft players relive the team that 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.430
 did not have such a good year 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.520
 past this relationship also has another 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.799
 which is the series separated into two 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.899
 the teams that checked the 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.879
 playoffs and then the teams do not 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.679
 reached the playoffs of the teams that 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.560
 They will make the playoffs exactly what 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.900
 I said the worst campaign 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.390
 the best campaign you had the worst 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.459
 houston texas campaign then comes a 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.470
 show ratings that had the exchange with 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.660
 two large public in a bit longer 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.239
 which are August 20 and the cleveland brown 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.340
 and so goes to number 20 and after 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.519
 Beautiful table also come with order of 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.680
 elimination of the playoffs had in 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.750
 social ciods super bowl champion 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.849
 Broncos duty then will be the penultimate 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.580
 choose vice champion 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.440
 then there are those eliminated in the final 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.690
 conference that San Francisco is 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.330
 no effect last year 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.250
 this is in order of deletion but there 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.260
 there are those cases for example 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.890
 teams that ended the same 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.049
 campaign and the teams that have 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.720
 same tale in the case of Saint Francis was 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.790
 nine and a thousand in breasts that the two 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.430
 reached the conference final 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.840
 There the tie breaker enters. 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.220
 calculated by fel 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.459
 according to the strength of the calendar 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.799
 these teams last year passing 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.780
 keep their record tied 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.780
 of these teams within the division itself 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.269
 certain teams were from the same division 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.890
 passing the record of these teams 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.380
 within the conference itself if the 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.329
 teams was from the same conference 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.390
 and if these teams still 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.730
 keep kicking you're going for the simple 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.950
 color decay which still takes place in the skin 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.819
 last instance of tiebreakers but 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.160
 happens 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:41.350
 your choice can be set in the 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.350
 lucky a simple play is not 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.900
 In addition, franchises may exchange 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.489
 your mania andras abnormally 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.440
 offering you extra exchanges or earning 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.270
 Exchanges to come down I'll give as 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.459
 example in 2002 when washington 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.940
 redskins wanted any ward form 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:03.730
 three play on show then it is to the other 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.680
 ranking of euros minus 3 choice of 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.080
 first round in exchange for choice 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.420
 number 2 in that year that is san luis 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.790
 mex so last year and this year 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.750
 their old had two choices 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.819
 first round 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.000
 this year specifically the athletic 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.530
 would be the second choice of draft because 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.990
 was the second worst campaign of the year 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.300
 past but because of this exchange of 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.340
 Egypt and the angles less owns this 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.290
 choice and your original choice then 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.050
 are Luis - you have two choices of choice 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.300
 2 and three good choice and today's video is 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.830
 That's a lot of people using the 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.050
 main topics for you to understand 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.270
 How does the daniel draft work? 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.610
 You still had doubts about 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.919
 How does the draft work? I'll put a 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.110

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.030
 my friend with him to a cyber 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.979
 explained very well also how it works 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.990
 this event then you can access the 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.729
 if that is still a type of 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.860
 You can also use the 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.419
 Comments below the video is on
