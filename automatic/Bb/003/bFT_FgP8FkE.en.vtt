FATHERÂ´S DAY SPECIAL - PAIRING WITH CHOCOLATE SANTANDER

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.360
Hi, I'm Mauricio Sanchez and I'm a Sommelier chef

00:00:08.477 --> 00:00:18.097
Food goes hand in hand with wine and beverages, and with both, with wine as much as food, I use Chocolate Santander

00:00:18.097 --> 00:00:22.377
Not only for sweets and desserts, but also for savory dishes

00:00:22.377 --> 00:00:29.657
We get great pairings to use with all the different types of Chocolate Santander

00:00:29.657 --> 00:00:36.417
Today, we will prepare three different recipes and have three recommendations for Father's Day

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.417
We're going to make French toast with Chocolate Santander 53% Banana Sunset

00:00:44.417 --> 00:00:53.617
we will also make bruschettas on French baguette with Spanish chorizo, pecorino cheese and Chocolate Santander 65%
