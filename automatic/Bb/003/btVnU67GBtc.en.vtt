information<00:02:21.300> back<00:02:21.870> where<00:02:22.080> it'll<00:02:22.200> show<00:02:22.410> it

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
information back where it'll show it

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.520 
information back where it'll show it
just<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.830> tenth<00:02:23.070> of<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.220> horsepower<00:02:23.610> gain<00:02:24.530> up

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
just a tenth of the horsepower gain up

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.380 
just a tenth of the horsepower gain up
to<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.130> know<00:02:26.250> hundreds<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.060> hundreds<00:02:27.299> of

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
to you know hundreds and hundreds of

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.270 
to you know hundreds and hundreds of
horsepower<00:02:27.600> games<00:02:28.019> and<00:02:28.290> then<00:02:28.799> we<00:02:28.920> transfer

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
horsepower games and then we transfer

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.550 
horsepower games and then we transfer
that<00:02:29.310> information<00:02:29.549> into<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.150> field<00:02:30.560> and

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
that information into the field and

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.440 
that information into the field and
field<00:02:32.370> test<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:32.850> make<00:02:32.910> sure<00:02:33.090> we're<00:02:33.239> seeing

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
field test it and make sure we're seeing

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.610 
field test it and make sure we're seeing
those<00:02:33.540> same<00:02:33.720> gains<00:02:34.019> in<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.230> field<00:02:34.440> and

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
those same gains in the field and

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:48.980 
those same gains in the field and
whatnot<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.480> pass<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.690> on<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.989> touch

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.630 

other<00:02:49.410> other<00:02:49.710> things<00:02:49.830> we're<00:02:50.160> gonna<00:02:50.280> hook<00:02:50.460> up

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
other other things we're gonna hook up

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.580 
other other things we're gonna hook up
as<00:02:50.910> well<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.360> know<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:51.660> like<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:52.140> said<00:02:52.350> before

we you guys are seeing like our solar

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.890 
we you guys are seeing like our solar
very<00:02:55.380> very<00:02:55.620> first<00:02:55.920> few<00:02:56.130> runs<00:02:56.340> here<00:02:56.780> we're<00:02:57.780> also

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
very very first few runs here we're also

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.080 
very very first few runs here we're also
going<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.170> be<00:02:58.230> hooking<00:02:58.410> up<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.680> know<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:59.090> boost

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
going to be hooking up you know a boost

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.570 
going to be hooking up you know a boost
gauge<00:03:00.530> oil<00:03:01.530> pressure<00:03:01.740> gauge<00:03:01.890> things<00:03:02.400> like

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
gauge oil pressure gauge things like

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.250 
gauge oil pressure gauge things like
that<00:03:02.760> we<00:03:03.240> don't<00:03:03.390> have<00:03:03.510> everything<00:03:03.750> set<00:03:04.080> up<00:03:04.110> on

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
that we don't have everything set up on

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.720 
that we don't have everything set up on
this<00:03:04.410> we're<00:03:04.620> just<00:03:04.770> I'm<00:03:05.310> working<00:03:05.610> they're

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
this we're just I'm working they're

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.820 
this we're just I'm working they're
working<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.180> bugs<00:03:06.330> out<00:03:06.540> of<00:03:06.690> it<00:03:06.750> right<00:03:06.930> now<00:03:07.110> you

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
working the bugs out of it right now you

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.280 
working the bugs out of it right now you
know<00:03:07.920> we<00:03:08.070> got<00:03:08.220> our<00:03:08.250> water<00:03:09.120> out<00:03:09.390> temperature<00:03:09.930> of

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
know we got our water out temperature of

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.010 
know we got our water out temperature of
water<00:03:10.530> in<00:03:10.740> the<00:03:11.520> over<00:03:11.760> very<00:03:12.120> very<00:03:12.209> important

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
water in the over very very important

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.820 
water in the over very very important
things<00:03:13.200> on<00:03:13.380> dynoing

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
things on dynoing

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.530 
things on dynoing
you<00:03:14.340> know<00:03:14.430> we<00:03:14.580> want<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.850> simulate<00:03:15.060> what<00:03:15.270> we're

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
you know we want to simulate what we're

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.330 
you know we want to simulate what we're
gonna<00:03:15.630> see<00:03:15.930> in<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.110> field<00:03:16.320> it<00:03:16.890> doesn't<00:03:17.130> do<00:03:17.310> us

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
gonna see in the field it doesn't do us

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.949 
gonna see in the field it doesn't do us
any<00:03:17.520> good<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.820> run<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:18.209> motor<00:03:18.420> when<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.810> the

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
any good to run this motor when it the

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.170 
any good to run this motor when it the
water<00:03:19.140> temps<00:03:19.560> ice-cold<00:03:19.980> because<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.850> guys<00:03:21.000> in

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
water temps ice-cold because the guys in

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
water temps ice-cold because the guys in
the<00:03:21.239> field<00:03:21.390> aren't<00:03:21.660> gonna<00:03:21.750> be<00:03:21.870> running<00:03:22.140> it

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
the field aren't gonna be running it

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.280 
the field aren't gonna be running it
there<00:03:23.180> so<00:03:24.180> far<00:03:24.390> you<00:03:24.570> know<00:03:24.630> we<00:03:24.750> got<00:03:24.870> about<00:03:25.020> 10

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
there so far you know we got about 10

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.250 
there so far you know we got about 10
runs<00:03:25.560> in<00:03:25.890> on<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.459> new<00:03:26.580> motor<00:03:27.260> everything

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
runs in on the new motor everything

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.630 
runs in on the new motor everything
looks<00:03:28.470> good<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:28.830> looks<00:03:28.950> like<00:03:29.100> a<00:03:29.250> coupler

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
looks good it looks like a coupler

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.840 
looks good it looks like a coupler
system<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.060> everything's<00:03:30.300> gonna<00:03:30.510> hold<00:03:30.720> up

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
system and everything's gonna hold up

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.070 
system and everything's gonna hold up
you've<00:03:32.850> got<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.510> know<00:03:33.630> what<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.810> power

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
you've got the you know what the power

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.240 
you've got the you know what the power
curve<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:34.500> everything's<00:03:34.739> gonna<00:03:34.860> look<00:03:34.950> like

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
curve and everything's gonna look like

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.580 
curve and everything's gonna look like
what<00:03:36.060> Artic<00:03:36.300> at<00:03:36.450> said<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.810> thing<00:03:36.959> they<00:03:37.080> make

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
what Artic at said the thing they make

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.380 
what Artic at said the thing they make
for<00:03:37.800> powered<00:03:38.100> actually<00:03:38.489> we<00:03:38.850> found<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.239> made<00:03:39.330> a

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
for powered actually we found it made a

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.360 
for powered actually we found it made a
little<00:03:39.570> bit<00:03:39.720> more<00:03:39.840> on

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.040

the so far you know everything is

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.540 
the so far you know everything is
looking<00:03:44.230> good<00:03:44.470> we're<00:03:45.069> gonna<00:03:45.160> start<00:03:45.430> throwing

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
looking good we're gonna start throwing

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.339 
looking good we're gonna start throwing
some<00:03:45.849> of<00:03:46.000> our<00:03:46.150> development<00:03:46.840> products<00:03:47.230> that

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
some of our development products that

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.290 
some of our development products that
we've<00:03:47.470> already<00:03:47.680> designed<00:03:48.130> and<00:03:48.370> been<00:03:48.940> working

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
we've already designed and been working

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.120 
we've already designed and been working
on<00:03:49.450> start<00:03:50.170> throwing<00:03:50.319> them<00:03:50.500> at<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.709> motor<00:03:50.920> and

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
on start throwing them at the motor and

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.220 
on start throwing them at the motor and
your<00:03:51.250> feel<00:03:51.400> we<00:03:51.580> find<00:03:51.790> four<00:03:52.000> teams<00:03:52.209> this<00:03:52.989> year

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
your feel we find four teams this year

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.660 
your feel we find four teams this year
is<00:03:53.349> that<00:03:53.530> the<00:03:53.590> chassis<00:03:54.250> of<00:03:54.459> the

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
motor you just seen on the dyno actually

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.160 
motor you just seen on the dyno actually
fits<00:04:00.700> in<00:04:00.850> here<00:04:01.000> believe<00:04:01.209> it<00:04:01.270> or<00:04:01.450> not<00:04:01.540> that's

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
fits in here believe it or not that's

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.350 
fits in here believe it or not that's
pretty<00:04:02.650> tight<00:04:02.920> pretty<00:04:03.280> cramped<00:04:03.580> feel<00:04:03.819> but<00:04:04.180> a
