longer than she's getting stronger and

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.750 
longer than she's getting stronger and
become<00:05:17.860> more<00:05:18.280> of<00:05:18.580> a<00:05:18.760> team<00:05:19.170> unit<00:05:20.580> which<00:05:21.580> is

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
become more of a team unit which is
