00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
tonics and that's how we're going to

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.389 
tonics and that's how we're going to
make<00:00:39.360> our<00:00:39.420> money<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.649> i<00:00:40.680> was<00:00:41.010> looking<00:00:41.309> at

make our money so i was looking at
prices<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.239> i'm<00:00:42.360> just<00:00:42.510> going<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.660> go<00:00:42.719> through

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
prices and i'm just going to go through

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.930 
prices and i'm just going to go through
this<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.500> average<00:00:43.800> price<00:00:44.010> right<00:00:44.370> now<00:00:44.399> of

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
this so the average price right now of

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.380 
this so the average price right now of
the<00:00:45.270> enormous<00:00:45.600> sea<00:00:46.260> scorpion<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.100> for<00:00:47.969> gold

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
the enormous sea scorpion is for gold

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.799 
the enormous sea scorpion is for gold
each<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.410> then<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> average<00:00:50.789> price<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
each and then the average price of the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.680 
each and then the average price of the
sea<00:00:52.050> scorpion<00:00:52.649> segments<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.399> two<00:00:54.059> gold<00:00:54.420> each

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
sea scorpion segments is two gold each

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.860 
sea scorpion segments is two gold each
and<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> average<00:00:56.309> price<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:57.000> servers

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
and then the average price on servers

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.709 
and then the average price on servers
for<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.559> healing<00:00:58.829> tonic<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.550> five<00:01:00.059> gold<00:01:00.420> each

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
for the healing tonic is five gold each

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.630 
for the healing tonic is five gold each
so<00:01:01.680> those<00:01:01.859> are<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.070> numbers<00:01:02.190> we're<00:01:02.460> going<00:01:02.579> to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
so those are the numbers we're going to

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.969 
so those are the numbers we're going to
be<00:01:02.699> using<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:03.359> i<00:01:03.510> said<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:04.199> varies<00:01:04.619> server

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
be using like i said this varies server

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.179 
be using like i said this varies server
to<00:01:05.129> server<00:01:05.280> also<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:06.360> my<00:01:06.810> server<00:01:07.080> even<00:01:07.530> there

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
to server also on my server even there

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.219 
to server also on my server even there
are<00:01:08.280> times<00:01:08.520> when<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:08.970> doesn't<00:01:09.810> work<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
are times when this doesn't work and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.510 
are times when this doesn't work and
there<00:01:10.320> are<00:01:10.470> times<00:01:10.770> when<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.070> works<00:01:11.159> really

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
there are times when it works really

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.750 
there are times when it works really
well<00:01:12.290> but<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.040> first<00:01:14.250> thing<00:01:14.340> there's<00:01:14.610> two

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
well but so the first thing there's two

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.850 
well but so the first thing there's two
parts<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.180> first<00:01:15.270> thing<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:15.960> often

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
parts the first thing is that often

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.090 
parts the first thing is that often
times<00:01:16.890> people<00:01:17.840> post<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.380> enormous<00:01:19.860> sea

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
times people post the enormous sea

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.749 
times people post the enormous sea
scorpion<00:01:20.670> for<00:01:21.150> like<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.600> said<00:01:21.780> about<00:01:21.930> four<00:01:22.229> gold

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
scorpion for like I said about four gold

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.760 
scorpion for like I said about four gold
thing<00:01:23.759> they<00:01:23.880> don't<00:01:24.060> realize<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.170> one

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
thing they don't realize is that one

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.910 
thing they don't realize is that one
enormous<00:01:26.460> sea<00:01:26.850> scorpion<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.829> equivalent<00:01:28.829> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
enormous sea scorpion is equivalent to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.850 
enormous sea scorpion is equivalent to
four<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:30.090> sea<00:01:30.270> scorpion<00:01:30.750> segments<00:01:31.320> so

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
four of the sea scorpion segments so

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.219 
four of the sea scorpion segments so
basically<00:01:32.790> you're<00:01:33.000> doubling<00:01:33.509> your<00:01:33.600> gold<00:01:33.900> just

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
basically you're doubling your gold just

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.980 
basically you're doubling your gold just
right<00:01:34.409> there<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.920> then<00:01:35.549> also<00:01:35.790> well<00:01:36.720> disease

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
right there and then also well disease

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.020 
right there and then also well disease
for<00:01:37.170> sea<00:01:37.710> scorpion<00:01:38.159> segments<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.820> can

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
for sea scorpion segments you can

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.940 
for sea scorpion segments you can
convert<00:01:39.509> those<00:01:39.720> into<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.079> healing<00:01:40.530> tonics

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
convert those into the healing tonics

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.420 
convert those into the healing tonics
which<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.520> can<00:01:41.700> add<00:01:41.880> even<00:01:42.420> more<00:01:42.740> gold<00:01:43.740> making

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
which you can add even more gold making

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.090 
which you can add even more gold making
ability<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:45.720> many<00:01:46.649> ways<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:47.009> this

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
ability to that so many ways in this

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.929 
ability to that so many ways in this
example<00:01:47.460> here<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.119> spent<00:01:48.869> just<00:01:49.799> under<00:01:49.979> 1,000

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
example here I spent just under 1,000

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.030 
example here I spent just under 1,000
gold<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.390> buying<00:01:51.780> enormous<00:01:52.170> sea<00:01:52.500> scorpions

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
gold on buying enormous sea scorpions

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.730 
gold on buying enormous sea scorpions
and<00:01:53.159> then<00:01:53.540> once<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.630> have<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> stack<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.049> 5<00:01:55.409> you

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
and then once you have a stack of 5 you

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.590 
and then once you have a stack of 5 you
can<00:01:55.920> gut<00:01:56.130> them<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.490> gives<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.790> 20<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
can gut them and it gives you 20 of the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.770 
can gut them and it gives you 20 of the
flesh<00:01:57.869> like<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.259> can<00:01:58.380> see<00:01:58.530> here<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.920> then

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
flesh like you can see here and then

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.139 
flesh like you can see here and then
what<00:02:00.780> i<00:02:00.810> did<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.439> i<00:02:01.710> use<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.520> sea<00:02:02.700> scorpion
