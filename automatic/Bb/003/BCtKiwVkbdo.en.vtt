the bone construct in melee and just the

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
lines to fire out everywhere now we had

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.420 
lines to fire out everywhere now we had
two<00:02:58.970> sort<00:02:59.870> of<00:02:59.930> camps<00:03:00.410> for<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.680> melee<00:03:01.100> at<00:03:01.250> this

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
two sort of camps for the melee at this

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.100 
two sort of camps for the melee at this
point<00:03:01.670> because<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.120> fire<00:03:02.330> could<00:03:02.570> still<00:03:02.900> land

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
point because the fire could still land

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.110 
point because the fire could still land
in<00:03:03.290> melee<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:03.650> believe<00:03:03.920> it<00:03:04.070> actually<00:03:04.790> can't

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
in melee I believe it actually can't

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.610 
in melee I believe it actually can't
anymore<00:03:05.480> right<00:03:05.780> now<00:03:05.810> I've<00:03:06.140> heard<00:03:06.290> reports

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
anymore right now I've heard reports

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.880 
anymore right now I've heard reports
that<00:03:06.799> people<00:03:07.100> saying<00:03:07.400> that<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:09.260> they<00:03:09.530> will

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
that people saying that that they will

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.130 
that people saying that that they will
put<00:03:10.220> only<00:03:10.610> one<00:03:10.850> person<00:03:11.269> at<00:03:11.390> range<00:03:11.600> and<00:03:11.870> it's<00:03:11.989> in

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
put only one person at range and it's in

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.569 
put only one person at range and it's in
fact<00:03:12.290> enough<00:03:12.860> to<00:03:14.380> to<00:03:15.380> prevent<00:03:16.100> any<00:03:16.310> from

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
fact enough to to prevent any from

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.210 
fact enough to to prevent any from
spawning<00:03:16.910> in<00:03:17.000> melee<00:03:17.150> so<00:03:17.989> that's<00:03:18.739> that's

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
spawning in melee so that's that's

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.970 
spawning in melee so that's that's
certainly<00:03:19.579> something<00:03:19.820> worth<00:03:20.329> testing<00:03:20.980> with

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
certainly something worth testing with

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.449

them<00:05:37.740> before<00:05:38.010> you<00:05:38.070> healers<00:05:38.340> run<00:05:38.520> out<00:05:38.669> of<00:05:38.700> mana

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.000 

right<00:05:42.600> there<00:05:42.900> we<00:05:43.110> just<00:05:43.320> lost<00:05:43.500> a<00:05:43.680> few<00:05:43.800> members

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
right there we just lost a few members

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.700 
right there we just lost a few members
again<00:05:44.370> to<00:05:44.520> the<00:05:44.640> lava-spewing<00:05:44.970> and<00:05:47.180> that's

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
again to the lava-spewing and that's

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.510 
again to the lava-spewing and that's
actually<00:05:49.710> not<00:05:49.830> going<00:05:49.979> to<00:05:50.040> turn<00:05:50.190> out<00:05:50.280> to<00:05:50.310> be<00:05:50.490> a

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
actually not going to turn out to be a

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.980 
actually not going to turn out to be a
very<00:05:50.700> big<00:05:50.850> deal<00:05:50.970> at<00:05:51.150> all<00:05:51.240> at<00:05:51.510> this<00:05:51.690> point<00:05:51.780> in

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
very big deal at all at this point in

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.520 
very big deal at all at this point in
the<00:05:52.050> fight<00:05:53.270> I've<00:05:54.270> seen<00:05:54.510> a<00:05:54.540> few<00:05:55.020> kills<00:05:55.289> where

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530

I'm that magma on pail himself on that

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.160 
I'm that magma on pail himself on that
stake<00:06:00.580> there<00:06:00.880> and<00:06:01.330> they<00:06:01.660> still<00:06:01.900> managed<00:06:02.140> to

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
stake there and they still managed to

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.260 
stake there and they still managed to
get<00:06:02.380> him<00:06:02.470> down<00:06:04.680> we<00:06:05.680> waited<00:06:06.250> until<00:06:06.430> right<00:06:06.790> now

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
get him down we waited until right now

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.020 
get him down we waited until right now
to<00:06:07.450> pop<00:06:07.660> lust<00:06:08.230> to<00:06:09.040> try<00:06:09.190> to<00:06:09.250> maximize<00:06:09.490> our

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
to pop lust to try to maximize our

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.440 
to pop lust to try to maximize our
damage<00:06:10.420> on<00:06:10.630> the<00:06:10.870> on<00:06:11.290> the<00:06:11.470> head<00:06:11.590> and<00:06:12.450> that

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
damage on the on the head and that

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.290 
damage on the on the head and that
seemed<00:06:14.110> to<00:06:14.140> really<00:06:14.410> help<00:06:14.740> he<00:06:14.860> also<00:06:14.980> dies<00:06:15.850> for

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
seemed to really help he also dies for

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.200 
seemed to really help he also dies for
some<00:06:16.450> reason<00:06:16.780> at<00:06:17.050> like<00:06:17.470> 1.3<00:06:18.460> percent<00:06:18.700> rather

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
some reason at like 1.3 percent rather

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.650 
some reason at like 1.3 percent rather
than<00:06:19.480> then<00:06:20.410> at<00:06:20.620> 0<00:06:21.130> so<00:06:21.850> he<00:06:22.000> does<00:06:22.150> die<00:06:22.360> a<00:06:22.390> little

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 
than then at 0 so he does die a little

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.380 
than then at 0 so he does die a little
bit<00:06:22.810> sooner<00:06:23.170> than<00:06:23.320> you<00:06:23.440> might<00:06:23.590> think<00:06:24.390> unless

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390 
bit sooner than you might think unless

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.750 
bit sooner than you might think unless
they've<00:06:25.600> fixed<00:06:26.260> that<00:06:26.650> recently<00:06:27.400> which<00:06:27.610> is

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
they've fixed that recently which is

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.140 
they've fixed that recently which is
entirely<00:06:28.360> possible<00:06:29.610> but<00:06:30.610> as<00:06:30.820> you<00:06:30.910> can<00:06:31.000> see

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
entirely possible but as you can see

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.790 
entirely possible but as you can see
this<00:06:31.360> phase<00:06:31.570> is<00:06:31.750> really<00:06:31.780> just<00:06:32.170> about<00:06:32.260> not

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
this phase is really just about not

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.160 
this phase is really just about not
standing<00:06:33.220> in<00:06:33.280> fire<00:06:33.490> or<00:06:33.520> pillars<00:06:34.240> and<00:06:34.570> just

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:35.170 
standing in fire or pillars and just

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.170 
standing in fire or pillars and just
burning<00:06:35.590> him<00:06:35.710> down<00:06:35.890> you<00:06:36.730> can<00:06:36.850> see<00:06:36.970> him<00:06:37.060> die

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
burning him down you can see him die

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.510 
burning him down you can see him die
right<00:06:37.390> here<00:06:37.630> yep<00:06:38.350> 1.3<00:06:39.250> percent<00:06:39.400> I<00:06:39.790> don't<00:06:40.420> know

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
right here yep 1.3 percent I don't know

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.920 
right here yep 1.3 percent I don't know
anyway<00:06:42.520> well<00:06:42.670> thanks<00:06:42.910> for<00:06:43.000> watching<00:06:43.300> and<00:06:43.450> good

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:45.970 
luck taking him out it's pretty
