00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:05.170
 I'm alone, I'm from those dates 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.439
 record newspaper that now I have to be 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:09.589
 nor did he make my pininos 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:11.239
 omit 15 hoeness 

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:14.239
 this opinion section 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.599
 i 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.769
 the truth is that the pp 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:21.529
 state institutions fge 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.039
 there will be a camera and you can talk about anything and the truth is that one of 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:25.949
 the topics 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.949
 What else 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.970
 this 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.010
 -Community lack of social commitment that 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.940
 it reflects them 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.560
 we opted for fact that Mexican football has 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.960
 next to their 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.930
 or as a fiscal every tournament we see that they are created 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.930
 Commissions Counter Commission 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.910
 Lingo is usually soccer 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.140
 any sport 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.380
 with which people more money is spent without spending 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.020
 buy your jerseys january your matches 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.420
 in buying it as in paying cable systems or transmitting meetings 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.760
 on pay television and so on 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.430
 i change 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.470
 p 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.090
 what the federation own teams 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.500
 they turn very little to say nothing 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.810
 to society back not something that I hope I'm going to tell you 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.100
 to be much more 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.750
 percent and raise awareness much more organized not only level of 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.430
 equipment that for example 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.670
 I know that the pachuca organized his day of kings and blankets 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.470
 this concert have aquivaldo mosquera do not propose aquivaldo king's quest 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.570
 magician and come from winning clients 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.780
 but it remains as an isolated action 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:36.940
 I think 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.780
 p 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.390
 the country 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.950
 the subject needs a true 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.770
 looked more thoroughly than if you want a 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.010
 commission 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.380
 of the heras and nekane soccer that speedy that adapts procurador percent and 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.720
 social services 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.340
 read 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.570
 related to football as ballads 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.110
 with the commitments of benefits and that have the 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.650
 television call exists in these Mexican times 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.520
 if not also the one that can 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.809
 open your perspectives and support the foot 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:11.809
 because any other social cause wants the best 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.269
 e will carry equipment 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.949
 about your team be 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.529
 units marginalized 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:20.969
 play a day soccer with children 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.969
 helpless 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:26.869
 get organized and each tournament 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:29.299
 build a school 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:30.559
 etc. not 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:32.939
 I insist I think they are themes 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.619
 that the best area like buick chiquitas 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:38.929
 but then we also do not live in Norway not to be living in a country that really 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:42.109
 needs to 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.549
 ominami the people who have resources and the teams that have 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.959
 put on your part that not only be 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.189
 let's have ground 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.769
 oo not pay nor the most expensive tickets each tournament comprises a new uniform 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.709
 than six months in which they also have to assume their commitment as 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:00.819
 institutions and pay something like that 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.919
 orchards town subject 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.699
 has indicated that in the end process 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:08.699
 At the same time, it will help different teams to have a 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:14.109
 the contributions are lost I do not think that if people 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:17.109
 will dedicate a little bit of effort 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.059
 the relaxation they bring between 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:24.399
 between bernat cid grating watered and in the amendment they will explain 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:25.370
 the 10% 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.879
 that time they bring that row 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.169
 despite this, give a little further 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:33.649
 children of the sierra poblana hospitals and so on 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:35.349
 I think we all have a goal 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.989
 A better impression of what is as an institution 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.989
 beyond what can be the technical chelista and its players 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.449
 where the impression of 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:52.449
 I insist on teams like the bush people 

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:56.899
 I insist that they are also 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.659
 or for every six months he spent a million dollars 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.149
 hire a pure Argentine pulse that is useless 

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:05.159
 intuitive hawks and january could 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.819
 help 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:08.879
 the session 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.449
 to your locality 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:13.700
 the Mexican also think that it would be 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.289
 a noble gesture that 

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:17.879
 in some way or another the Mexican soccer federation 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:21.120
 will start to get down to business 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.120
 and especially that he did 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.009
 with transparency it would be what it is 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:29.269
 has shown that I can look at this country is soccer I did something we need 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:31.610
 is to be united 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.960
 the news separates us 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.960
 arsenio ahead for harvesting osuna 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:39.300
 Haiti 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.400
 i 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.409
 it is true that what 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:44.930
 then as a reflection of 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.590
 the present day 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.529
 I hope it's the first of many 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:51.409
 over here we will be seeing 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.779
 but you have to lie talking about topics 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.360
 as important as this city can be 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.340
 Social 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.680
 much more things 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.889
 analysts 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.110
 not be more attractive as they can be 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.330
 the tennis players who are right now in the Australian Open who are 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.469
 incredible all 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:13.639
 in a process that these do not give more equal
