example I have this other minecraft
session<00:00:25.590> here<00:00:25.800> open<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:27.230> because<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.260> have

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
session here open and because I have

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.210

do that so to fix this you just have to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.180 
do that so to fix this you just have to
close<00:00:38.760> out<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.210> one<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.750> open<00:00:40.680> up<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.980> new

close<00:00:47.640> up<00:00:47.850> nice<00:00:48.090> then<00:00:48.510> try<00:00:48.719> connect<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.260> your

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
close up nice then try connect to your

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.700 
close up nice then try connect to your
server<00:00:50.420> in<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.570> tutorial<00:00:51.750> I'll<00:00:52.230> be<00:00:52.260> using<00:00:52.410> my

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
server in this tutorial I'll be using my

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.000 
server in this tutorial I'll be using my
minecraft<00:00:53.370> server<00:00:53.670> called<00:00:54.000> longs<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:55.559> IP

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
minecraft server called longs the IP

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.400 
minecraft server called longs the IP
will<00:00:56.340> be<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.670> description<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:58.079> will<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
will be in a description and so will the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.450 
will be in a description and so will the
website<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.850> just<00:00:59.879> join<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.600> server<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.460> as

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
website so just join the server and as

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.579 
website so just join the server and as
you<00:01:02.579> can<00:01:02.730> see<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.180> now<00:01:03.539> let<00:01:03.989> me<00:01:04.140> connect<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
you can see it now let me connect to the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.520 
you can see it now let me connect to the
server<00:01:07.250> without<00:01:08.250> any<00:01:08.610> problems<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.990> basically

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
server without any problems so basically

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.440 
server without any problems so basically
to<00:01:11.130> prevent<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.640> happen<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> future

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
to prevent this happen in the future

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.770 
to prevent this happen in the future
just<00:01:13.110> once<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.920> open<00:01:14.909> up<00:01:15.000> your<00:01:15.150> minecraft<00:01:15.630> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
just once you open up your minecraft and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.050 
just once you open up your minecraft and
then<00:01:16.409> get<00:01:16.560> onto<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.890> page<00:01:17.240> sometimes<00:01:20.060> you

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
then get onto this page sometimes you

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.690 
then get onto this page sometimes you
might<00:01:21.270> hit<00:01:21.509> play<00:01:21.869> twice<00:01:22.350> by<00:01:22.680> mistake<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.430> if

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
might hit play twice by mistake and if

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.219 
might hit play twice by mistake and if
you<00:01:23.790> do<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.450> would<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.810> open<00:01:24.990> up

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
you do that it would just open up

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.590 
you do that it would just open up
another<00:01:25.460> session<00:01:26.460> without<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.909> realizing

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
another session without you realizing

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.170 
another session without you realizing
and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:27.829> this<00:01:28.829> will<00:01:29.100> make<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.909> get<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
and then this will make you get the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.260 
and then this will make you get the
error<00:01:31.040> but<00:01:32.040> basically<00:01:32.400> if<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:32.880> happens

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
error but basically if it just happens

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.620 
error but basically if it just happens
then<00:01:33.630> just<00:01:33.900> try<00:01:34.110> relogin<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:35.390> logging<00:01:36.390> out
