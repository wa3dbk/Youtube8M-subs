two<00:03:30.510> loyalty<00:03:30.900> points<00:03:31.230> like<00:03:31.379> the<00:03:31.530> ps3<00:03:32.010> had<00:03:32.190> and

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
two loyalty points like the ps3 had and

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.240 
two loyalty points like the ps3 had and
probably<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.879> ps4<00:03:33.090> still<00:03:33.569> has<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:34.470> don't

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
probably the ps4 still has I don't

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.099 
probably the ps4 still has I don't
really<00:03:35.579> know<00:03:35.790> how<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:36.060> ps4<00:03:36.389> is<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.720> haven't

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
really know how the ps4 is I haven't

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.939 
really know how the ps4 is I haven't
played<00:03:37.319> on<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.739> but<00:03:38.930> anyway<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:40.169> want<00:03:40.739> to<00:03:40.829> know

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
played on it but anyway I want to know

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.229 
played on it but anyway I want to know
what<00:03:41.129> you<00:03:41.250> guys<00:03:41.280> think<00:03:41.489> about<00:03:41.609> that<00:03:41.879> you<00:03:41.940> guys

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
what you guys think about that you guys

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.000 
what you guys think about that you guys
think<00:03:42.959> that<00:03:43.019> they<00:03:43.229> should<00:03:43.260> merge<00:03:43.620> servers

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
think that they should merge servers

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.909 
think that they should merge servers
because<00:03:44.220> they<00:03:44.609> do<00:03:44.669> have<00:03:44.900> I'm<00:03:45.900> almost<00:03:46.739> positive

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
because they do have I'm almost positive

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.099 
because they do have I'm almost positive
that<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.459> ps3<00:03:47.940> servers<00:03:48.329> are<00:03:48.510> merged<00:03:48.780> with<00:03:48.959> the

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
that the ps3 servers are merged with the

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.460 
that the ps3 servers are merged with the
ps4<00:03:49.349> servers<00:03:50.090> so<00:03:51.090> there's<00:03:51.900> kind<00:03:52.169> of<00:03:52.349> a

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
ps4 servers so there's kind of a

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.289 
ps4 servers so there's kind of a
difference<00:03:52.889> in<00:03:53.099> the<00:03:53.280> system<00:03:53.729> there<00:03:54.060> and

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
difference in the system there and

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.030 
difference in the system there and
there's<00:03:55.049> probably<00:03:55.199> a<00:03:55.379> little<00:03:55.470> bit<00:03:55.650> different

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
there's probably a little bit different

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.520 
there's probably a little bit different
frame<00:03:56.280> rate<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:56.699> rendering<00:03:57.299> the<00:03:57.750> ps4<00:03:58.049> is<00:03:58.349> by

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
frame rate and rendering the ps4 is by

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.619 
frame rate and rendering the ps4 is by
obviously<00:03:59.159> better<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.669> a<00:03:59.909> little<00:04:00.209> bit<00:04:00.419> faster

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
obviously better and a little bit faster

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.009 
obviously better and a little bit faster
than<00:04:01.139> the<00:04:01.290> ps3's<00:04:01.560> gameplay<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:02.940> if<00:04:03.329> they<00:04:03.840> can

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
than the ps3's gameplay so if they can

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.439 
than the ps3's gameplay so if they can
do<00:04:04.139> that<00:04:04.169> I<00:04:04.530> would<00:04:04.709> think<00:04:04.739> that<00:04:04.949> they<00:04:05.190> should

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:05.449 
do that I would think that they should

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:10.250 
do that I would think that they should
be<00:04:06.449> able<00:04:06.569> to<00:04:06.930> merge<00:04:07.109> the<00:04:07.409> ps3<00:04:08.010> ps4<00:04:08.519> sand<00:04:09.260> us

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
be able to merge the ps3 ps4 sand us

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.869 
be able to merge the ps3 ps4 sand us
servers<00:04:10.560> all<00:04:10.889> together<00:04:11.040> because<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.639> US

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
servers all together because the US

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.629 
servers all together because the US
server<00:04:12.150> is<00:04:12.389> arming<00:04:13.379> the<00:04:13.500> US<00:04:13.829> server<00:04:14.069> the<00:04:14.250> pc

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
server is arming the US server the pc

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.120 
server is arming the US server the pc
server<00:04:14.879> is<00:04:15.150> kind<00:04:15.930> of<00:04:16.049> inactive<00:04:16.680> compared<00:04:17.039> to

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
server is kind of inactive compared to

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.039 
server is kind of inactive compared to
the<00:04:17.220> ps3<00:04:17.669> i<00:04:17.820> remember<00:04:18.419> i<00:04:18.450> used<00:04:18.479> to<00:04:18.659> be<00:04:18.750> able<00:04:18.840> to

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
the ps3 i remember i used to be able to

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:19.580 
the ps3 i remember i used to be able to
get<00:04:19.260> on

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
get on

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.009 
get on
three<00:04:19.889> at<00:04:20.010> like<00:04:20.160> four<00:04:20.760> three<00:04:21.389> in<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.630> morning

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
three at like four three in the morning

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.820 
three at like four three in the morning
you<00:04:22.830> know<00:04:22.949> I<00:04:23.160> usually<00:04:23.400> play<00:04:24.030> in<00:04:24.389> the<00:04:24.510> am<00:04:24.870> but<00:04:25.560> i

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
you know I usually play in the am but i

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.740 
you know I usually play in the am but i
remember<00:04:26.490> it<00:04:26.580> was<00:04:26.610> so<00:04:26.850> easy<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:27.270> pug<00:04:27.449> groups

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
remember it was so easy to pug groups

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.780 
remember it was so easy to pug groups
back<00:04:27.990> then<00:04:28.199> that<00:04:28.710> you<00:04:28.770> pretty<00:04:29.250> much<00:04:29.340> just<00:04:29.460> had

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
back then that you pretty much just had

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.120 
back then that you pretty much just had
to<00:04:29.910> say<00:04:30.030> anything<00:04:30.300> in<00:04:30.600> you<00:04:31.470> get<00:04:31.650> tons<00:04:31.979> of

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
to say anything in you get tons of

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.700 
to say anything in you get tons of
towels<00:04:32.340> back<00:04:32.639> but<00:04:33.360> I'm<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.990> pc<00:04:34.320> it<00:04:34.440> doesn't

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
towels back but I'm the pc it doesn't

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.080 
towels back but I'm the pc it doesn't
seem<00:04:34.919> like<00:04:35.100> that<00:04:35.130> sometimes<00:04:35.490> you<00:04:35.880> have<00:04:35.970> two

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
seem like that sometimes you have two

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.960 
seem like that sometimes you have two
pug<00:04:36.270> for<00:04:36.840> a<00:04:36.870> troll<00:04:37.229> for<00:04:37.470> like<00:04:37.860> 30<00:04:38.250> 45<00:04:38.610> minutes

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
pug for a troll for like 30 45 minutes

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.260 
pug for a troll for like 30 45 minutes
before<00:04:39.360> you<00:04:39.449> find<00:04:39.660> a<00:04:39.720> control<00:04:40.080> but<00:04:40.680> um<00:04:41.130> I<00:04:41.490> would

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
before you find a control but um I would

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.060 
before you find a control but um I would
definitely<00:04:42.419> like<00:04:42.750> numb<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:43.470> merchant<00:04:43.800> service

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
definitely like numb to merchant service

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.610 
definitely like numb to merchant service
because<00:04:44.400> of<00:04:44.610> that<00:04:44.820> because<00:04:45.810> I<00:04:46.199> would<00:04:46.380> like<00:04:46.500> to

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
because of that because I would like to

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.439 
because of that because I would like to
play<00:04:46.770> with<00:04:46.889> my<00:04:46.979> old<00:04:47.160> friends<00:04:47.220> and<00:04:47.699> new<00:04:47.729> fans<00:04:48.120> on

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
play with my old friends and new fans on

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.520 
play with my old friends and new fans on
the<00:04:48.570> ps3<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:50.010> ps4<00:04:50.250> but<00:04:50.790> I<00:04:51.180> know<00:04:52.169> that

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
the ps3 and the ps4 but I know that

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.020 
the ps3 and the ps4 but I know that
they're<00:04:52.680> probably<00:04:52.889> people<00:04:53.370> talking<00:04:53.790> about

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
they're probably people talking about

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.420 
they're probably people talking about
the<00:04:54.240> difference<00:04:54.570> in<00:04:54.810> systems<00:04:55.470> because<00:04:56.040> when<00:04:56.340> I

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
the difference in systems because when I

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.600 
the difference in systems because when I
have<00:04:56.580> to<00:04:56.729> change<00:04:56.970> from<00:04:57.300> ps3<00:04:57.570> to<00:04:57.840> my<00:04:58.830> pc<00:04:59.220> and<00:04:59.250> got

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
have to change from ps3 to my pc and got

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.790 
have to change from ps3 to my pc and got
a<00:04:59.639> good<00:04:59.820> graphics<00:05:00.240> card<00:05:00.479> a<00:05:00.570> decent<00:05:00.930> pc<00:05:01.229> it's

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
a good graphics card a decent pc it's

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.610 
a good graphics card a decent pc it's
obviously<00:05:02.340> a<00:05:02.430> lot<00:05:02.610> faster<00:05:02.820> than<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.540> ps3<00:05:04.110> the

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
obviously a lot faster than the ps3 the

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.730 
obviously a lot faster than the ps3 the
frame<00:05:04.979> rate<00:05:05.220> itself<00:05:05.850> has<00:05:06.240> a<00:05:06.479> I<00:05:07.080> mean<00:05:07.620> the

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
frame rate itself has a I mean the

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.800 
frame rate itself has a I mean the
gameplay<00:05:08.100> itself<00:05:08.250> looks<00:05:08.910> a<00:05:09.030> bit<00:05:09.150> faster<00:05:09.630> and

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
gameplay itself looks a bit faster and

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.190 
gameplay itself looks a bit faster and
I'm<00:05:10.139> almost<00:05:10.590> positive<00:05:10.770> it<00:05:11.100> is<00:05:11.250> a<00:05:11.310> bit<00:05:11.580> faster

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
I'm almost positive it is a bit faster

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.480 
I'm almost positive it is a bit faster
including<00:05:13.200> loading<00:05:13.530> times<00:05:13.770> rendering<00:05:14.280> times

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
including loading times rendering times

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.430 
including loading times rendering times
and<00:05:14.729> stuff<00:05:14.850> like<00:05:15.030> that<00:05:15.090> so<00:05:15.479> it<00:05:16.080> would<00:05:16.200> probably

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
and stuff like that so it would probably

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.290 
and stuff like that so it would probably
have<00:05:16.710> you<00:05:17.100> probably<00:05:17.280> have<00:05:17.520> a<00:05:17.550> disadvantage<00:05:17.880> on

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
have you probably have a disadvantage on

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.610 
have you probably have a disadvantage on
a<00:05:18.870> ps3<00:05:19.940> pvping<00:05:20.940> of<00:05:21.300> player<00:05:21.539> like<00:05:22.139> the<00:05:22.350> most

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
a ps3 pvping of player like the most

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.580 
a ps3 pvping of player like the most
beast<00:05:22.949> pc<00:05:23.370> that<00:05:23.580> you've<00:05:23.729> ever<00:05:23.880> seen<00:05:24.590> there's

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
beast pc that you've ever seen there's

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.930 
beast pc that you've ever seen there's
probably<00:05:25.710> going<00:05:25.979> to<00:05:26.039> be<00:05:26.100> a<00:05:26.160> lot<00:05:26.430> of<00:05:26.460> difference

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
probably going to be a lot of difference

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.969 
probably going to be a lot of difference
in<00:05:27.090> there<00:05:27.240> but<00:05:27.900> i<00:05:28.110> don't<00:05:28.410> really<00:05:28.560> know<00:05:28.680> if<00:05:28.830> it's

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
in there but i don't really know if it's

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.950 
in there but i don't really know if it's
gonna<00:05:29.160> be<00:05:29.340> that<00:05:29.370> drastic<00:05:29.789> and<00:05:30.240> it<00:05:30.600> doesn't

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
gonna be that drastic and it doesn't

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.240 
gonna be that drastic and it doesn't
really<00:05:31.020> matter<00:05:31.229> to<00:05:31.440> me<00:05:31.560> because<00:05:31.650> I'm<00:05:31.889> not<00:05:32.070> too

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
really matter to me because I'm not too

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.129 
really matter to me because I'm not too
much<00:05:32.280> of<00:05:32.430> a<00:05:32.580> pvp<00:05:33.060> player<00:05:33.330> I<00:05:33.600> don't<00:05:34.050> think

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 
much of a pvp player I don't think

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.029 
much of a pvp player I don't think
really<00:05:34.620> BEC<00:05:34.950> PvE<00:05:35.360> content<00:05:36.360> as<00:05:36.840> much<00:05:37.080> but<00:05:37.800> you

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
really BEC PvE content as much but you

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.279 
really BEC PvE content as much but you
know<00:05:38.220> that<00:05:38.520> if<00:05:38.669> you<00:05:38.700> be<00:05:39.060> are<00:05:39.270> there<00:05:39.960> are<00:05:40.110> going

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
have a slight disadvantage but they

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.839 
have a slight disadvantage but they
don't<00:05:54.210> regulate<00:05:54.960> that<00:05:55.289> for<00:05:55.530> PC<00:05:55.860> to<00:05:55.950> PC<00:05:55.979> because

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
don't regulate that for PC to PC because

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:58.400 
don't regulate that for PC to PC because
I<00:05:57.300> could<00:05:57.510> go<00:05:57.660> to<00:05:57.690> Walmart<00:05:58.139> and<00:05:58.200> buy<00:05:58.349> the

Universe and play against a player with
you<00:06:04.289> know<00:06:04.410> real<00:06:05.190> good<00:06:05.400> graphics<00:06:05.820> card<00:06:06.060> and

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
you know real good graphics card and

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.610 
you know real good graphics card and
stuff<00:06:06.360> like<00:06:06.479> that<00:06:06.539> so<00:06:06.900> they<00:06:07.380> don't<00:06:07.560> really

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
stuff like that so they don't really

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.860 
stuff like that so they don't really
regulate<00:06:08.039> frame<00:06:08.370> rates<00:06:08.580> on<00:06:08.700> the<00:06:08.789> pc<00:06:09.479> so<00:06:09.840> i

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
regulate frame rates on the pc so i

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.839 
regulate frame rates on the pc so i
don't<00:06:10.470> i<00:06:10.680> don't<00:06:10.800> think<00:06:11.280> that<00:06:11.340> should<00:06:11.669> be<00:06:11.729> a

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:11.849 
don't i don't think that should be a

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:14.420 
don't i don't think that should be a
problem<00:06:12.030> i<00:06:12.240> mean<00:06:12.389> if<00:06:12.510> you<00:06:12.630> want<00:06:12.840> to<00:06:13.190> play<00:06:14.190> on

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
problem i mean if you want to play on

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.089 
problem i mean if you want to play on
the<00:06:14.610> servers<00:06:15.030> you<00:06:15.599> can<00:06:15.780> play<00:06:15.990> you<00:06:16.050> can<00:06:16.289> pvp<00:06:16.830> but

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099 
the servers you can play you can pvp but

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:19.250 
the servers you can play you can pvp but
you<00:06:17.550> if<00:06:18.300> you<00:06:18.479> don't<00:06:18.660> have<00:06:18.750> the<00:06:18.840> best<00:06:18.960> system

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.260 
you if you don't have the best system

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.800 
you if you don't have the best system
kind<00:06:19.560> of

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
kind of

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.560 
kind of
a<00:06:19.870> bit<00:06:20.350> of<00:06:20.530> a<00:06:20.620> disadvantage<00:06:20.919> but<00:06:21.880> I<00:06:22.090> don't<00:06:22.270> like

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:22.570 
a bit of a disadvantage but I don't like

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:23.610 
a bit of a disadvantage but I don't like
I<00:06:22.660> said<00:06:22.870> I<00:06:22.900> don't<00:06:22.990> think<00:06:23.290> it<00:06:23.380> would<00:06:23.500> really

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
I said I don't think it would really

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.010 
I said I don't think it would really
affect<00:06:23.800> PPE<00:06:24.280> and<00:06:24.580> that's<00:06:25.060> more<00:06:25.300> what<00:06:25.419> i<00:06:25.480> am<00:06:25.750> so

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
affect PPE and that's more what i am so

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.750 
affect PPE and that's more what i am so
it<00:06:26.410> wouldn't<00:06:26.680> i<00:06:26.950> wouldn't<00:06:27.010> really<00:06:27.370> care<00:06:27.610> about

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
it wouldn't i wouldn't really care about

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.010 
it wouldn't i wouldn't really care about
it<00:06:28.000> i<00:06:28.090> would<00:06:28.240> just<00:06:28.389> want<00:06:28.600> to<00:06:28.660> play<00:06:28.810> with<00:06:28.960> the

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
they are going to virtual servers

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.390 
they are going to virtual servers
because<00:06:34.900> you<00:06:35.530> know<00:06:35.650> we're<00:06:35.860> switching<00:06:36.070> over<00:06:36.250> to

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
because you know we're switching over to

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.280 
because you know we're switching over to
loyalty<00:06:36.730> points<00:06:37.090> just<00:06:37.300> like<00:06:37.330> the<00:06:37.510> ps3<00:06:37.960> and<00:06:38.080> ps4

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.290 
loyalty points just like the ps3 and ps4

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.190 
loyalty points just like the ps3 and ps4
and<00:06:38.800> you<00:06:39.730> know<00:06:39.850> we're<00:06:40.060> becoming<00:06:40.540> more<00:06:40.810> common

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.200 
and you know we're becoming more common

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.500 
and you know we're becoming more common
are<00:06:41.440> like<00:06:42.370> I<00:06:42.580> guess<00:06:42.850> you<00:06:43.000> could<00:06:43.150> say<00:06:43.270> but

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
are like I guess you could say but

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.780 
are like I guess you could say but
