chainsaws so they kind of give you a
hint<00:02:31.269> there<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:33.040> as<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.549> can<00:02:33.670> see<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:34.569> rack<00:02:34.780> up

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
hint there so as you can see you rack up

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.250 
hint there so as you can see you rack up
a<00:02:35.140> lot<00:02:35.560> of<00:02:35.739> kills<00:02:36.780> with<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.959> chainsaw

Yucatan the place where you get the item
the<00:03:08.139> LMG<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:11.170> is<00:03:11.349> also<00:03:11.560> another<00:03:11.920> bike

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
the LMG that is also another bike

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.509 
the LMG that is also another bike
combination<00:03:13.060> as<00:03:13.269> you<00:03:13.659> probably<00:03:14.049> guessed<00:03:14.620> it's

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
combination as you probably guessed it's

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.809 
combination as you probably guessed it's
right<00:03:15.940> up<00:03:16.180> there<00:03:16.620> it's<00:03:17.620> not<00:03:17.889> very<00:03:18.099> hard<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.579> get

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
right up there it's not very hard to get

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.869 
right up there it's not very hard to get
and<00:03:19.030> there's<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:20.079> zombie<00:03:20.590> with<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.129> shotgun<00:03:21.549> up

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
and there's a zombie with a shotgun up

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:27.119 
and there's a zombie with a shotgun up
here<00:03:24.060> so<00:03:25.060> I<00:03:25.090> failed<00:03:25.599> it<00:03:25.810> he<00:03:26.500> is<00:03:26.620> right<00:03:26.829> there

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
here so I failed it he is right there

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.119 
here so I failed it he is right there
obviously<00:03:28.060> is<00:03:28.269> a<00:03:28.299> shotgun<00:03:28.750> you<00:03:29.590> kill<00:03:29.859> him<00:03:30.010> and

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
obviously is a shotgun you kill him and

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.789 
obviously is a shotgun you kill him and
then<00:03:30.190> he<00:03:30.310> drops<00:03:30.579> a<00:03:30.760> shotgun<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:32.590> get<00:03:32.769> a

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
then he drops a shotgun and you get a

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.890 
then he drops a shotgun and you get a
shotgun<00:03:33.129> which<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:33.910> nice<00:03:36.449> so<00:03:37.449> you<00:03:37.510> hop<00:03:37.870> up

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
shotgun which is nice so you hop up

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.670 
shotgun which is nice so you hop up
these<00:03:38.260> stone<00:03:39.010> steps<00:03:39.699> and<00:03:40.079> there<00:03:41.079> will<00:03:41.470> be<00:03:41.500> a

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
these stone steps and there will be a

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.939 
these stone steps and there will be a
Zombrex<00:03:42.519> as<00:03:42.819> you<00:03:43.000> can<00:03:43.150> see<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:45.389> an<00:03:46.389> algae<00:03:46.949> crud

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:47.949 
Zombrex as you can see and an algae crud

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.220 
Zombrex as you can see and an algae crud
why<00:03:48.579> don't<00:03:48.730> I<00:03:48.790> keep<00:03:49.000> doing<00:03:49.389> that<00:03:49.540> I'm<00:03:49.930> such<00:03:50.199> a

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
why don't I keep doing that I'm such a

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:56.420 
why don't I keep doing that I'm such a
failure<00:03:52.169> so<00:03:53.489> lava<00:03:54.489> hopping<00:03:55.329> the<00:03:55.449> steps<00:03:55.750> and

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
failure so lava hopping the steps and

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.569 
failure so lava hopping the steps and
LMG<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:58.780> LMG<00:03:59.260> combination<00:03:59.949> is<00:04:00.099> probably<00:04:00.400> one

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
LMG the LMG combination is probably one

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.490 
LMG the LMG combination is probably one
of<00:04:00.609> my<00:04:00.760> least<00:04:00.790> favorites<00:04:01.720> because<00:04:01.930> it's<00:04:02.290> kind

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
of my least favorites because it's kind

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.920 
of my least favorites because it's kind
of<00:04:02.530> hard<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:02.799> hit<00:04:02.980> zombies<00:04:03.579> and<00:04:03.879> you<00:04:04.359> don't<00:04:04.540> get

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
of hard to hit zombies and you don't get

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.950 
of hard to hit zombies and you don't get

the finished product you get two LMGs on

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.760 
the finished product you get two LMGs on
the<00:04:37.850> handlebars<00:04:38.420> and<00:04:39.460> you<00:04:40.460> press<00:04:40.790> X<00:04:41.140> to<00:04:42.140> shoot

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
somewhere pretty fast it clears the path

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.550 
somewhere pretty fast it clears the path
so<00:04:57.620> you<00:04:57.680> don't<00:04:57.920> hit<00:04:58.100> any<00:04:58.310> zombies<00:05:02.380> so<00:05:03.380> it

so you don't hit any zombies so it
actually<00:05:04.510> like<00:05:05.510> you<00:05:05.660> can<00:05:05.810> get<00:05:05.960> places<00:05:06.530> really

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
actually like you can get places really

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.920 
actually like you can get places really
fast<00:05:07.460> with<00:05:07.700> this<00:05:07.850> because<00:05:08.090> you<00:05:08.270> don't<00:05:08.300> hit<00:05:08.660> any

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
fast with this because you don't hit any

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:15.100 
fast with this because you don't hit any
zombies<00:05:09.380> and<00:05:11.020> you<00:05:12.020> are<00:05:13.570> you<00:05:14.570> don't<00:05:14.750> hit<00:05:14.960> as

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
zombies and you are you don't hit as

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.990 
zombies and you are you don't hit as
many<00:05:15.260> zombies<00:05:15.800> so<00:05:16.040> it<00:05:16.490> lasts<00:05:17.060> pretty<00:05:17.090> long<00:05:17.920> if

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
many zombies so it lasts pretty long if

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.060 
many zombies so it lasts pretty long if
if<00:05:20.000> you<00:05:20.150> go<00:05:20.300> through<00:05:20.480> a<00:05:20.570> horde<00:05:20.780> of<00:05:20.870> zombies<00:05:21.070> you

like<00:05:29.750> benches<00:05:30.380> and<00:05:30.590> stuff<00:05:32.560> but<00:05:33.560> yeah<00:05:34.310> that's

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
like benches and stuff but yeah that's

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:35.819 
just

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:38.420 
just
and<00:05:36.529> this<00:05:37.529> is<00:05:37.710> sort<00:05:38.009> of<00:05:38.099> the<00:05:38.219> final

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
and this is sort of the final

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.600 
and this is sort of the final
combination<00:05:38.909> but<00:05:39.449> there's<00:05:39.659> one<00:05:39.930> more<00:05:40.610> but

combination but there's one more but
it's<00:05:41.819> not<00:05:41.999> really<00:05:42.240> a<00:05:42.270> combination<00:05:42.569> to<00:05:43.050> help

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:43.379
