00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 my shawl grapevine on mommies us 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.840
 canary in general shawl for me is a symbol 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.840
 some kind of calm person 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.849
 who lives in vanity he will not come to him 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.840
 head on faith tie shawl 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.779
 but if there are moments when you can 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.410
 go look at the nature around 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.859
 pay attention to her or get confused 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.099
 in a shawl and sit on the sofa with a warm 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.340
 tea to watch some movie with 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.890
 such moments it seems to me a step is that 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.160
 need a reference to the master class I like 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.670
 usually leave in the description under the video on 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.590
 youtube as I told you I was knitting her 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.590
 from vita brilliant yarn 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.230
 and now I want to tell you what it is 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.530
 I finally got my opinion about 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.039
 the ball of this yarn first turned out 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.129
 I have it in size at the top 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.549
 side a little more than one and a half meters, it 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.610
 It turned out and height if from top to 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.810
 Angle somewhere seventy centimeters 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:17.430
 five diagonally along the sides have 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:21.060
 she had 15 grapes all gone 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:24.060
 I'm 400 grams on it by the brilliant 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.610
 on a brush about gone pomo. 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.759
 maybe even smaller when I'm 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.840
 finished knit shawl from 3 ma. 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:37.229
 it was a diamond it was either 12 or 13 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.740
 clusters of grapes around the edge I started 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.310
 do 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.899
 tassels with 4 hanks here these tassels 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.829
 did and then continued to knit rows 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.009
 up this shawl 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:53.700
 and as I continued to write and 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.770
 dash you I tied side tassels not 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.100
 in each side loop I did 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:03.899
 tassels and through the loop and get 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:06.600
 continued to run from one end ismo . 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.930
 and the second stretched and made 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.230
 parallel tassels 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.780
 and therefore stopped then when u 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.260
 I just ran out of yarn tassels 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.590
 avella as shown in the master class I 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.680
 I measured the length of the hook thread in two 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.100
 times i have a double hook length and 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.060
 then this one thing I did 10 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.340
 layers otmazyvat 10 layers cut off 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.250
 thread and made such a loop 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.670
 tying the brush on the shawl did not cut 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.880
 I tassels these so that they were more magnificent I 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.610
 did 10 points but someone did 7 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.770
 strings for example every brush but 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.959
 less family is definitely not worth doing if 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.580
 you want to save yarn you can not 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.760
 make a little smaller look at 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.090
 pomp yourself I did 10 ball on my 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.489
 The look turned out very beautiful and very 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.550
 nice and what size does it take 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:07.080
 after washing I did not wash 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:10.000
 gently I shook her hands 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.769
 survived even by a slight twisting and 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.620
 hung it just to dry in nature 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:20.019
 at the top fastened with clothespins and she here 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.120
 so here I hung in miss she was not 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.489
 so raw to drip from it 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.890
 but she was still raw and falcon 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.760
 such a suspension just everything 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:33.010
 grapes they stretched as they should 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.549
 it turns out that this shawl goes 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.489
 about one and a half thousand meters of yarn 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:42.070
 maybe a little more so if you 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.940
 take the yarn with a big meter 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.769
 then you will have less hank that is 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.290
 This shawl from vita brilliant is obtained 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.630
 400 grams someone may find that this 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.750
 heavy shawls if you want easier 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.549
 shawl then take a bigger yarn and 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.940
 then it will be easier 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:04.720
 for example someone knitted from lanagold 800 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:08.200
 it's 800 meters 100 grams and it only took 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.410
 2 hanks 200 grams per size 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.810
 shawl but the grapes were a little smaller 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.690
 share your impressions about this 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.239

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.250
 tied up how much yarn is gone it will be 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.710
 very interesting 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.660
