00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
maybe hunched over a little bit like

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:07.060 
maybe hunched over a little bit like
that<00:06:03.580> watch<00:06:04.580> a<00:06:04.729> clock<00:06:05.000> get<00:06:05.630> a<00:06:05.659> timer<00:06:06.070> but

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:09.349 
really pull that in and what this is

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:11.020 
really pull that in and what this is
gonna<00:06:09.470> do<00:06:09.770> it's<00:06:10.010> gonna<00:06:10.159> hit<00:06:10.370> that<00:06:10.400> transverse

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
gonna do it's gonna hit that transverse
