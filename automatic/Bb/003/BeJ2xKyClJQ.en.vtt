00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
drilling operation but you're going to

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.169 
drilling operation but you're going to
come<00:00:34.899> back<00:00:34.929> and<00:00:35.319> watch<00:00:35.829> that<00:00:35.859> one<00:00:36.550> row<00:00:36.850> where

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:37.179 
come back and watch that one row where

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:39.299 
come back and watch that one row where
you<00:00:37.269> put<00:00:37.479> some<00:00:37.659> corn<00:00:37.989> in<00:00:38.199> and<00:00:38.409> just<00:00:39.129> see<00:00:39.280> how

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
you put some corn in and just see how

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.610 
you put some corn in and just see how
how<00:00:39.999> deep<00:00:40.389> you<00:00:40.569> plant<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:40.929> corn<00:00:41.170> it<00:00:41.319> actually

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
how deep you plant the corn it actually

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.049 
how deep you plant the corn it actually
should<00:00:41.829> be<00:00:41.859> right<00:00:42.190> on<00:00:42.309> the<00:00:42.429> surface<00:00:42.639> or<00:00:42.999> you

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
should be right on the surface or you

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.180 
should be right on the surface or you
should<00:00:43.239> be<00:00:43.389> able<00:00:43.569> to<00:00:43.659> see<00:00:43.870> just<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.620> very<00:00:44.889> top

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
should be able to see just the very top

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.219 
should be able to see just the very top
of<00:00:45.219> that<00:00:45.489> kernel<00:00:45.940> I<00:00:46.059> there's<00:00:46.449> one<00:00:46.809> and<00:00:47.049> there's

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:47.229 
of that kernel I there's one and there's

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:49.739 
of that kernel I there's one and there's
one<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:47.739> that's<00:00:48.699> kind<00:00:48.969> of<00:00:48.999> telling<00:00:49.389> you<00:00:49.510> that

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:49.749 
one and that's kind of telling you that

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.079 
one and that's kind of telling you that
you're<00:00:50.229> planting<00:00:50.530> shallow<00:00:51.159> enough<00:00:51.549> because

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
you're planting shallow enough because

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:53.699 
you're planting shallow enough because
the<00:00:52.269> prairie<00:00:52.479> grass<00:00:52.749> can<00:00:52.929> be<00:00:53.049> extremely<00:00:53.440> hard

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:53.709 
the prairie grass can be extremely hard

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:55.410 
the prairie grass can be extremely hard
to<00:00:53.859> figure<00:00:54.129> out<00:00:54.280> what<00:00:54.519> it<00:00:54.639> is<00:00:54.670> and<00:00:54.760> to<00:00:55.089> see<00:00:55.119> it

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
to figure out what it is and to see it

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.660 
to figure out what it is and to see it
but<00:00:56.019> walk<00:00:56.229> along<00:00:56.589> that<00:00:56.829> row<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:57.129> see<00:00:57.519> that

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
but walk along that row and see that

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.569 
but walk along that row and see that
corn<00:00:58.269> just<00:00:58.539> barely<00:00:59.139> seated<00:00:59.889> barely<00:01:00.369> in<00:01:00.489> the

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
corn just barely seated barely in the

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.669 
corn just barely seated barely in the
ground<00:01:00.819> there<00:01:01.600> you<00:01:01.839> know<00:01:02.019> you're<00:01:02.229> planting<00:01:02.589> at

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
ground there you know you're planting at

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.670 
ground there you know you're planting at
a<00:01:02.709> quarter<00:01:03.069> inch<00:01:03.309> or<00:01:03.459> less<00:01:04.409> another<00:01:05.409> thing

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
a quarter inch or less another thing

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.410 
a quarter inch or less another thing
that<00:01:05.829> we<00:01:05.950> do<00:01:06.130> when<00:01:06.490> we're<00:01:06.640> planning<00:01:06.850> in<00:01:07.240> with

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
that we do when we're planning in with

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.630 
that we do when we're planning in with
pollinator<00:01:08.049> mixes<00:01:08.500> is<00:01:08.649> just<00:01:08.890> how<00:01:09.159> to<00:01:09.219> be<00:01:09.520> able

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
pollinator mixes is just how to be able

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.120 
pollinator mixes is just how to be able
to<00:01:09.789> plant<00:01:10.180> that<00:01:10.420> pollinator<00:01:11.020> mix<00:01:11.320> it<00:01:11.500> so<00:01:11.710> small

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
to plant that pollinator mix it so small

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.959 
to plant that pollinator mix it so small
we<00:01:12.909> buy<00:01:13.119> coca<00:01:13.630> hauls<00:01:14.399> they're<00:01:15.399> just<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.759> holes

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:15.969 
we buy coca hauls they're just the holes

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:18.179 
we buy coca hauls they're just the holes
of<00:01:16.180> coca<00:01:16.450> beans<00:01:16.719> they<00:01:17.020> smell<00:01:17.649> like<00:01:17.829> chocolate

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
of coca beans they smell like chocolate

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.139 
of coca beans they smell like chocolate
and<00:01:18.670> mix<00:01:19.210> it<00:01:19.390> with<00:01:19.539> the<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:21.009> pollinator<00:01:21.820> mix

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
and mix it with the the pollinator mix

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.080 
and mix it with the the pollinator mix
and<00:01:22.359> make<00:01:22.479> it<00:01:22.659> about<00:01:23.070> double<00:01:24.070> in<00:01:24.219> size<00:01:24.460> double

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
and make it about double in size double

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.940 
and make it about double in size double
in<00:01:25.240> bulk<00:01:25.270> so<00:01:25.960> that<00:01:26.109> it<00:01:26.200> will<00:01:26.380> go<00:01:26.590> through<00:01:26.770> the

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
in bulk so that it will go through the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.080 
in bulk so that it will go through the
cedar<00:01:27.219> the<00:01:27.460> other<00:01:27.609> thing<00:01:27.850> we've<00:01:28.000> used<00:01:28.299> is<00:01:28.719> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
cedar the other thing we've used is the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.810 
cedar the other thing we've used is the
ground<00:01:31.090> up<00:01:31.270> corn<00:01:31.539> corn<00:01:32.049> corn<00:01:32.679> cobs<00:01:33.249> those<00:01:33.579> work

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
ground up corn corn corn cobs those work

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.459 
ground up corn corn corn cobs those work
too

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
too

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.109 
too

add spacers on your on your hydraulic

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.810 
add spacers on your on your hydraulic
cylinders<00:01:40.749> on<00:01:40.899> the<00:01:41.020> Truex<00:01:41.409> drill<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:42.520> Truex

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
cylinders on the Truex drill the Truex

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.520 
cylinders on the Truex drill the Truex
drill<00:01:43.090> is<00:01:43.179> very<00:01:43.420> good<00:01:43.749> at<00:01:43.899> planning<00:01:44.079> seed

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
drill is very good at planning seed

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.959 
drill is very good at planning seed
shallow<00:01:44.890> but<00:01:45.189> if<00:01:45.249> you<00:01:45.340> want<00:01:45.549> to<00:01:45.609> just<00:01:45.729> make

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
shallow but if you want to just make

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:47.760

sure<00:01:46.030> and<00:01:46.509> make<00:01:46.569> sure<00:01:46.719> that<00:01:47.020> it's<00:01:47.200> it's

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770

getting in their shell especially with
these<00:01:49.509> forbs<00:01:49.990> we'll<00:01:50.469> put<00:01:50.679> a<00:01:50.710> spacer<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:52.420> the

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
these forbs we'll put a spacer to on the

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.440 
these forbs we'll put a spacer to on the
side<00:01:52.840> that<00:01:53.170> sort<00:01:53.649> of<00:01:53.740> help<00:01:54.009> these<00:01:54.399> these<00:01:55.030> depth

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
side that sort of help these these depth

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.090 
side that sort of help these these depth
bands<00:01:55.780> that's<00:01:56.109> what's<00:01:56.380> unique<00:01:56.560> about<00:01:56.829> the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
bands that's what's unique about the

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.580 
bands that's what's unique about the
Truex<00:01:57.490> drill<00:01:57.789> it's<00:01:57.909> got<00:01:58.060> a<00:01:58.090> depth<00:01:58.990> band<00:01:59.319> so<00:01:59.530> you

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
Truex drill it's got a depth band so you

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.029 
Truex drill it's got a depth band so you
can't<00:01:59.979> hardly<00:02:00.340> plant<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.450> seed<00:02:01.659> too<00:02:01.929> deep<00:02:02.170> but

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
can't hardly plant the seed too deep but

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:04.109 
can't hardly plant the seed too deep but
if<00:02:03.159> you<00:02:03.219> want<00:02:03.369> to<00:02:03.429> help<00:02:03.579> yourself<00:02:03.700> out<00:02:04.090> a

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
if you want to help yourself out a

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.389 
if you want to help yourself out a
little<00:02:04.270> more<00:02:04.539> use<00:02:04.899> the<00:02:05.079> spacers<00:02:05.619> and<00:02:05.829> on<00:02:06.100> the

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
little more use the spacers and on the

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.809 
little more use the spacers and on the
cylinders<00:02:07.210> and<00:02:07.420> it'll<00:02:07.929> help<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.610> plant<00:02:09.610> as

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
cylinders and it'll help you plant as

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.059 
cylinders and it'll help you plant as
shallow<00:02:10.179> as<00:02:10.299> possible<00:02:10.989> now<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:11.560> think<00:02:11.680> here

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
shallow as possible now I think here

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.559 
shallow as possible now I think here
you're<00:02:12.220> just<00:02:12.430> seeing<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.730> operation<00:02:13.360> the

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
you're just seeing the operation the

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.120 
you're just seeing the operation the
drill<00:02:14.110> going<00:02:14.290> by<00:02:14.590> and<00:02:14.799> we're<00:02:14.950> going

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
drill going by and we're going

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.370 
drill going by and we're going
go<00:02:15.280> back<00:02:15.490> here<00:02:15.850> behind<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.390> now<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.780> try<00:02:17.020> to

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
go back here behind it now and try to

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.680 
go back here behind it now and try to
see<00:02:17.650> if<00:02:17.770> we<00:02:17.800> can<00:02:18.040> find<00:02:18.250> some<00:02:18.520> seed<00:02:18.820> that<00:02:19.450> can<00:02:19.600> be

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
see if we can find some seed that can be

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.360 
see if we can find some seed that can be
difficult<00:02:19.960> but<00:02:20.440> if<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.620> get<00:02:20.800> in<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:21.010> row<00:02:21.190> and

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
difficult but if you get in a row and

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.370 
difficult but if you get in a row and
start<00:02:21.640> looking<00:02:22.000> close<00:02:22.270> you<00:02:22.540> can<00:02:22.720> pick<00:02:22.960> out<00:02:23.140> a

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
start looking close you can pick out a

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.350 
start looking close you can pick out a
few<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.220> seeds<00:02:24.490> that<00:02:24.700> are<00:02:24.820> in<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:24.940> row

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
few of the seeds that are in that row

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.250 
few of the seeds that are in that row
and<00:02:25.710> my<00:02:26.710> rule<00:02:27.610> of<00:02:27.760> thumb<00:02:28.030> is<00:02:28.240> is<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.660> if<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:28.960> see

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
and my rule of thumb is is that if I see

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.760 
and my rule of thumb is is that if I see
as<00:02:29.410> much<00:02:29.680> as<00:02:29.920> even<00:02:30.900> 25%<00:02:31.900> of<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.110> seed<00:02:32.380> on<00:02:32.410> the

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
as much as even 25% of the seed on the

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.100 
as much as even 25% of the seed on the
surface<00:02:33.220> that's<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.940> good<00:02:34.120> thing<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.600> means

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
surface that's a good thing that means

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.450 
surface that's a good thing that means
your<00:02:35.260> plant<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:35.560> she'll<00:02:35.830> enough<00:02:36.190> because

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
your plant and she'll enough because

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.340 
your plant and she'll enough because
there's<00:02:36.820> some<00:02:37.060> of<00:02:37.180> these<00:02:37.240> four<00:02:37.630> seeds<00:02:37.930> are<00:02:38.140> so

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
there's some of these four seeds are so

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.340 
there's some of these four seeds are so
small<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:38.980> so<00:02:39.240> minut<00:02:40.240> that<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.750> know<00:02:40.870> even<00:02:41.080> up

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
small and so minut that you know even up

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.680 
small and so minut that you know even up
a<00:02:41.560> sixteenth<00:02:42.130> of<00:02:42.280> an<00:02:42.400> inch<00:02:42.490> depth<00:02:42.910> is<00:02:43.150> is

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
a sixteenth of an inch depth is is

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.390 
a sixteenth of an inch depth is is
plenty<00:02:44.260> for<00:02:44.440> those<00:02:44.620> so<00:02:44.860> you<00:02:44.920> want<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.280> make

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
plenty for those so you want to make

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.280 
plenty for those so you want to make
sure<00:02:45.430> that<00:02:45.730> you're<00:02:45.940> planting<00:02:46.600> definitely

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
sure that you're planting definitely

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.480 
sure that you're planting definitely
less<00:02:47.440> than<00:02:47.470> a<00:02:47.650> quarter<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:48.010> an<00:02:48.070> inch<00:02:48.190> that's

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
less than a quarter of an inch that's

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.850 
less than a quarter of an inch that's
for<00:02:48.670> sure
