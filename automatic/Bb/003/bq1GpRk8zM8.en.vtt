00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
thought they were absolutely perfect for

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.100 
thought they were absolutely perfect for
the<00:00:44.370> piggies<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.570> I've<00:00:45.660> got<00:00:45.840> lots<00:00:45.930> of

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
the piggies so I've got lots of

the piggies so I've got lots of
different<00:00:46.559> funky<00:00:47.399> shapes<00:00:47.730> for<00:00:48.180> them<00:00:48.360> to

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
different funky shapes for them to

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.139 
different funky shapes for them to
explore<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.039> they<00:00:50.550> seem<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.760> be<00:00:50.879> absolutely

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
explore and they seem to be absolutely

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.600 
explore and they seem to be absolutely
loving<00:00:51.629> them<00:00:51.750> at<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> moment<00:00:52.379> at<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.309> moment

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
loving them at the moment at the moment

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.369
