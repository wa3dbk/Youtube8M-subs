00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.839
 I'm a player 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.300
 gambling decided me only once 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.190
 in pursuit of adventure and luck I 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:17.010
 lost all home family money and most 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.949
 the main thing I lost my life when I took 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.650
 the duty of money from the mafia they told me that 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.680
 if I donâ€™t bring them to me by the end of the week 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.769
 cover what many would have long lost heart 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.710
 but not me I'm going to try my luck 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.000
 for the last time and do something that will help 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.940
 us save my life 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.790
 what am I going to do, I thought for a long time 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.629
 over it and realized what so much 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.149
 short term 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.340
 I got the right amount I decided for 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.340
 myself i will rob a bank 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.960
 for this I came to this city 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.940
 first thing I rented an apartment if 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.350
 god forgotten place could be called 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.290
 so i started thinking how not 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.170
 crank it up 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.790
 I first had to choose a bank 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.700
 did not bother and chose the bank 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.800
 who was across the road not long 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.220
 thinking I decided to go to this bank on 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.220
 intelligence 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:46.710
 going inside the bank I saw the cashier and 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:50.770
 a young guard the cashier asked me 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:53.400
 sir something you want nothing i just 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.400
 wrong door 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.410
 leaving the bank I met my 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.510
 old friend john 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.250
 my eyes do not believe before me john 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.380
 bering 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.620

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.620

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:32.570

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.890

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.890
 I rented an apartment near me 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.180
 Yes 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.120
 having come to my house we got to talking i 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.609
 learned that the night is very sick and 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.860
 I needed an expensive operation 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.910
 very sorry for john i offered him 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.910
 own solution 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:38.230
 john i have sentences for you what 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.230
 sentence 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.050
 i am going to rob a bank i think there 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:47.490
 enough money to own the operation 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.319
 your daughter and solve my problem 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.749
 after thinking for a few seconds he gave his 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:56.819
 the answer is yes 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:58.020
 deep down I knew that if we 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:00.659
 do something wrong 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.460
 John and I will be behind bars and so 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:05.309
 he just can't help his daughter 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.900
 but its from fi sounded so firm that he 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:08.900
 clenched his fists when he said it 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:14.699
 we needed to discuss a plan of action from 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.069
 talk with john i found out that he 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.960
 It works in a bank on the other hand it is 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:21.300
 the bank that I want to rob 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.770
 john told me that banking 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.710
 the store is on the top floor 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.590
 the buildings the walls he had made of 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.270
 strong steel lambing vault door he 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.800
 did not know and we decided that we would 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.840
 wade into the vault through the roof 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.720
 which was cast from concrete 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.330
 it was necessary to blow her part but we were 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.410
 need a specialist in explosives but I had 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:42.410
 one man in mind 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.600
 I met and the wall in the same bar 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.480
 Now multiply sat then spelled 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:00.400
 his term and according to my data was in the city I 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.400
 called him and we made an appointment 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:15.460

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.910

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.170

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:26.680

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:54.220
 in meeting in my apartment I 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:59.010
