00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.860
 qualities 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.020
 we distinguish between hobby and 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.610
 art of quality it is not anymore 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.760

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.140
 in quality are considered expensive colors 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.989
 much more important to know which 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.440
 Qualify them where and when to use 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.789

 I'll make you short here 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:35.979
 would like to introduce there for example 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.720
 the round brush with synthetic and brush 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.430
 can absorb a lot of water and 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.080
 are good in the use of liquid 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.850
 to dye 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.920
 they are so fine that they are gentle 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.750
 color transitions create with yours 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.070

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.610
 to absorb a lot of liquid and is for 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.410
 larger areas ideally suited yet 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.940
 to be with the brush could 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:11.890
