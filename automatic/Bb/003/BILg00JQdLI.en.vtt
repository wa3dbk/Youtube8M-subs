it looks so hungry it can eat up all
these<00:00:45.350> little<00:00:45.650> fishes<00:00:46.900> now<00:00:47.900> stary<00:00:48.370> take<00:00:49.370> a

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
these little fishes now stary take a

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.280 
these little fishes now stary take a
closer<00:00:49.970> look<00:00:50.239> at<00:00:50.690> the<00:00:51.379> shape<00:00:51.710> of<00:00:51.920> its<00:00:52.309> mouth

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
closer look at the shape of its mouth

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.960 
closer look at the shape of its mouth
the<00:00:54.290> shape<00:00:54.650> is<00:00:55.040> like<00:00:55.100> this<00:00:56.860> do<00:00:57.860> you<00:00:58.040> know<00:00:58.339> what

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
the shape is like this do you know what

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:04.830 
the shape is like this do you know what
the<00:00:59.300> sign<00:00:59.659> is<00:01:00.550> it<00:01:01.550> is<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.659> greater-than<00:01:03.140> sign

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:04.840 
the sign is it is the greater-than sign

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.500 
the sign is it is the greater-than sign
to<00:01:05.840> help<00:01:06.170> you<00:01:06.560> remember<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:08.090> greater-than

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
to help you remember the greater-than

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.050 
to help you remember the greater-than
sign<00:01:09.790> just<00:01:10.790> think<00:01:11.299> of<00:01:11.540> the<00:01:11.930> alligator<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:13.130> its

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
sign just think of the alligator and its

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.320 
sign just think of the alligator and its
open<00:01:14.930> mouth

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
open mouth

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.800 
open mouth
remember<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:18.110> alligator<00:01:19.030> always<00:01:20.030> eats<00:01:20.450> a

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
remember the alligator always eats a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:29.109 
remember the alligator always eats a
greater<00:01:21.710> number<00:01:22.159> of<00:01:22.450> fishes<00:01:27.549> suppose<00:01:28.549> we<00:01:28.850> have

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
greater number of fishes suppose we have

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.480 
greater number of fishes suppose we have
five<00:01:29.960> fishes<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.060> three<00:01:32.060> fishes<00:01:33.189> we<00:01:34.189> write

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
five fishes and three fishes we write

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.300 
five fishes and three fishes we write
five<00:01:35.390> is<00:01:35.750> greater<00:01:36.380> than<00:01:36.979> three<00:01:38.649> the<00:01:39.649> mouth<00:01:40.009> of

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
five is greater than three the mouth of

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.919 
five is greater than three the mouth of
the<00:01:40.850> alligator<00:01:41.539> story<00:01:42.109> is<00:01:42.759> open<00:01:43.780> towards<00:01:44.780> the

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
the alligator story is open towards the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.779 
the alligator story is open towards the
greater<00:01:45.590> number<00:01:46.159> of<00:01:46.579> fishes<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:48.740> closed<00:01:49.250> part

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
greater number of fishes the closed part

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.429 
greater number of fishes the closed part
of<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.929> mouth<00:01:51.490> points<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.149> smaller

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
of the mouth points to the smaller

00:01:53.439 --> 00:02:00.609 
of the mouth points to the smaller
number<00:01:54.439> of<00:01:54.560> fishes<00:01:57.909> here<00:01:58.909> we<00:01:59.179> have<00:01:59.619> seven

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
number of fishes here we have seven

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.760 
number of fishes here we have seven
fishes<00:02:01.159> and<00:02:01.719> two<00:02:02.719> fishes<00:02:03.880> now<00:02:04.880> seven<00:02:05.689> is<00:02:05.899> the

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
fishes and two fishes now seven is the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.950 
fishes and two fishes now seven is the
greater<00:02:07.219> number<00:02:07.460> of<00:02:08.179> fish<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.729> so<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:11.660> mouth

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
greater number of fish and so the mouth

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.470 
greater number of fish and so the mouth
of<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.680> alligator<00:02:13.430> will<00:02:14.420> be<00:02:14.660> open<00:02:15.380> towards

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
of the alligator will be open towards

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.000 
of the alligator will be open towards
seven<00:02:17.480> study<00:02:18.760> we<00:02:19.760> write<00:02:20.090> seven<00:02:20.990> is<00:02:21.200> greater

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
seven study we write seven is greater

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.990 
seven study we write seven is greater
than<00:02:22.880> two

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.370 

study<00:02:29.530> suppose<00:02:30.530> we<00:02:30.860> want<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.460> show<00:02:31.730> one<00:02:32.720> number

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
study suppose we want to show one number

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.160 
study suppose we want to show one number
is<00:02:33.710> less<00:02:34.580> than<00:02:35.360> another<00:02:36.790> all<00:02:37.790> we<00:02:38.450> have<00:02:38.690> to<00:02:38.960> do

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
is less than another all we have to do

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.770 
is less than another all we have to do
is<00:02:39.860> turn<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:41.030> alligator's<00:02:42.020> mouth<00:02:42.050> around

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
is turn the alligator's mouth around

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.910 
is turn the alligator's mouth around
because<00:02:44.860> remember<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.910> alligator<00:02:47.920> always

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
because remember the alligator always

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.330 
because remember the alligator always
eats<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:50.030> greater<00:02:50.480> number<00:02:52.750> so<00:02:53.750> if<00:02:54.080> we<00:02:54.980> have

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
eats the greater number so if we have

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.620 
eats the greater number so if we have
three<00:02:55.820> fishes<00:02:56.360> and<00:02:56.810> eight<00:02:57.710> fishes<00:02:58.460> we<00:02:59.300> write

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
three fishes and eight fishes we write

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:07.500 
three fishes and eight fishes we write
it<00:02:59.900> as<00:03:00.430> 3<00:03:01.430> is<00:03:01.700> less<00:03:02.600> than<00:03:02.660> 8<00:03:03.410> and<00:03:05.320> if<00:03:06.320> we<00:03:07.130> have

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
it as 3 is less than 8 and if we have

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.470 
it as 3 is less than 8 and if we have
five<00:03:08.510> fishes<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:09.580> 7<00:03:10.580> fishes<00:03:11.440> we<00:03:12.440> write<00:03:12.800> it<00:03:13.100> as

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
five fishes and 7 fishes we write it as

five fishes and 7 fishes we write it as
5<00:03:14.480> is<00:03:14.900> less<00:03:15.770> than<00:03:16.330> 7

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
remember study greater than and less

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.510 
remember study greater than and less
than<00:03:42.340> are<00:03:42.970> two<00:03:43.720> different<00:03:44.650> signs<00:03:45.720> now<00:03:46.720> study

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
than are two different signs now study

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.820 
than are two different signs now study
what<00:03:48.520> if<00:03:48.790> we<00:03:49.209> have<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.840> same<00:03:50.440> number<00:03:51.160> of<00:03:51.340> fish
