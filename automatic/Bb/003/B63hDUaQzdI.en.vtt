00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:23.000
 choreography we chose the 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.790
 choreography by medvedev for the reason 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.400
 which was very interesting in the sense 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.770
 that there were more than one choice there is a 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:36.540
 another director who treated this 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:39.090
 but in my face it was the work that 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.040
 choreographed by medved who respected more 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.750
 the original version of the work by 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.210
 puskin of dio neghin therefore we have 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.720
 certainly god for this reason why 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:59.210
 it reflected more the original version 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:59.210
 of chan free him for 2 robo-samones 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.179
 Hello 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.540
 dirty now the collaboration with how it is 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.229
 started about two and a half years ago 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:43.229
 when he was invited by the director 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:47.350
 general the arabesque mr as a 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.679
 period this was like I said the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:56.049
 general manager of the opera theater 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:59.380
 national of an action started after that 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:03.789
 we saw the show in braga later 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:07.240
 pd that it was decided to call ours 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:12.119
 set designers to renew a 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.119
 po the version that was made 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.920
 talking about differences between ballet 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:16.069
 repertoire and neoclassical bed e 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.480
 worthy music 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:23.480
 present classical ballet must 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.239
 absolutely respect other than it is 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:34.159
 was respected by parents therefore not 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:37.670
 it is a true and proper interpretation 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:40.010
 red neoclassical ballet we can say 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.049
 who may not respect all of these 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:47.090
 rules that are forced minter 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:50.120
 broken into the class even still not 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:55.129
 too much in these cases on the stake 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:57.949
 neoclassical in quotation marks freedom to 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:01.209
 dancer to pull out emotions a 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:04.219
 please look like the role really 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.620
 natural what you can't sometimes 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:11.650
 in the sea with my classical ballet 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.650
 place district project 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.289
