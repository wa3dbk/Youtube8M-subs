00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
hard drive in a dvd-rw when I got this

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.520 
hard drive in a dvd-rw when I got this
maybe<00:00:41.190> four<00:00:41.850> years<00:00:41.879> ago<00:00:42.390> i<00:00:42.570> think<00:00:43.230> i<00:00:43.290> bought

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
maybe four years ago i think i bought

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.729 
maybe four years ago i think i bought
this<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.829> best<00:00:44.070> buy<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:45.050> i<00:00:46.050> would<00:00:46.649> have

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
this in best buy and i would have

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.100 
this in best buy and i would have
normally<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.250> built<00:00:47.550> one<00:00:47.850> but<00:00:48.629> at<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:48.989> time

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
normally just built one but at the time

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.200 
normally just built one but at the time
I<00:00:49.320> needed<00:00:49.710> something<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.309> right<00:00:50.670> away<00:00:50.820> and

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
I needed something like right away and

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.240 
I needed something like right away and
so<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.320> was<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.500> best<00:00:52.770> thing<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.010> could<00:00:53.160> get

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
so this was the best thing I could get

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.850 
so this was the best thing I could get
my<00:00:53.340> hands<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:54.140> event<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.230> used<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.649> for<00:00:55.829> a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
my hands on event I used this for a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.139 
my hands on event I used this for a
little<00:00:56.010> bit<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.309> eventually<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.699> just<00:00:56.910> gave<00:00:57.000> it

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
little bit and eventually I just gave it

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.510 
little bit and eventually I just gave it

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.190 
this thing and stuck it in her new
computer<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.820> let<00:01:11.909> me<00:01:12.000> show<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.180> what<00:01:12.479> what

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
computer so let me show you what what

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.840 
computer so let me show you what what
the<00:01:13.320> inside<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.920> thing<00:01:14.100> looks<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:16.850> our

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
the inside of this thing looks like our

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.800 
the inside of this thing looks like our
so<00:01:18.060> here's<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> inside<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:19.020> pretty<00:01:19.530> clean<00:01:20.130> case

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
so here's the inside a pretty clean case

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
so here's the inside a pretty clean case
micro-atx<00:01:21.810> board<00:01:22.439> six<00:01:23.250> gigs<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.729> memory<00:01:24.830> these

micro-atx board six gigs of memory these

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.069 
micro-atx board six gigs of memory these
are<00:01:26.070> each<00:01:26.340> two<00:01:26.939> gigs<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.770> ddr3<00:01:29.270> 1333<00:01:31.280> memory

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
are each two gigs of ddr3 1333 memory

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.039 
are each two gigs of ddr3 1333 memory
processor<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:35.030> believe<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> 300<00:01:36.930> watt

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
to point out this guy right here I added

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.639 
to point out this guy right here I added
this<00:01:46.920> was<00:01:47.189> an<00:01:47.430> XFX<00:01:47.759> or<00:01:48.720> as<00:01:49.020> i<00:01:49.229> should<00:01:49.380> say<00:01:49.530> an

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
this was an XFX or as i should say an

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.149 
this was an XFX or as i should say an
effort<00:01:49.920> XFX<00:01:50.700> radeon<00:01:51.509> HD<00:01:52.430> 4350<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:55.040> on<00:01:56.040> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
effort XFX radeon HD 4350 and on the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.090 
effort XFX radeon HD 4350 and on the
back<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:58.250> sort<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.340> standard<00:01:59.729> array<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.000> i/o

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
back you sort of standard array of i/o

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.410 
back you sort of standard array of i/o
at<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.430> time<00:02:02.640> what<00:02:02.850> i<00:02:02.880> thought<00:02:03.090> was<00:02:03.180> kind<00:02:03.329> of

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
at the time what i thought was kind of

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.130 
at the time what i thought was kind of
cool<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.840> had<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> hdmi<00:02:05.009> as<00:02:05.670> well<00:02:06.270> as<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.540> DVI

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
cool this had a hdmi as well as a DVI

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.130 
cool this had a hdmi as well as a DVI
vga<00:02:08.780> USB<00:02:09.780> 2.0<00:02:09.989> ports<00:02:10.709> gigabit<00:02:11.640> lan<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.120> sound

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
vga USB 2.0 ports gigabit lan and sound

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.589 
vga USB 2.0 ports gigabit lan and sound
so<00:02:14.140> overall<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.560> pretty<00:02:14.830> basic<00:02:15.150> pc<00:02:16.150> i<00:02:16.180> think<00:02:16.540> i

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
so overall a pretty basic pc i think i

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.890 
so overall a pretty basic pc i think i
might<00:02:16.720> have<00:02:16.870> paid<00:02:17.879> maybe<00:02:18.879> 300<00:02:19.450> bucks<00:02:19.629> for<00:02:19.810> this

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
might have paid maybe 300 bucks for this

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.350 
might have paid maybe 300 bucks for this
thing<00:02:19.959> maybe<00:02:20.650> less<00:02:20.950> i<00:02:21.129> can't<00:02:21.340> remember<00:02:21.459> but<00:02:22.269> I

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
thing maybe less i can't remember but I

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.030 
thing maybe less i can't remember but I
know<00:02:22.420> it<00:02:22.599> wasn't<00:02:22.810> terribly<00:02:23.410> expensive<00:02:23.680> when<00:02:24.010> I

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
know it wasn't terribly expensive when I

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.309 
know it wasn't terribly expensive when I
got<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.480> really<00:02:25.780> served<00:02:26.140> its<00:02:26.290> purpose

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
got it and it really served its purpose

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.380 
got it and it really served its purpose
really<00:02:26.739> well<00:02:29.640> ok<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:30.700> I've<00:02:30.910> had<00:02:31.060> this<00:02:31.209> thing

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
really well ok so I've had this thing

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.789 
really well ok so I've had this thing
sitting<00:02:31.690> in<00:02:31.780> my<00:02:31.870> workbench<00:02:32.230> for<00:02:32.379> a<00:02:32.500> couple

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
sitting in my workbench for a couple

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.770 
sitting in my workbench for a couple
months<00:02:33.090> since<00:02:34.090> i<00:02:34.180> finished<00:02:34.239> my<00:02:34.569> wife's

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
months since i finished my wife's

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.740 
months since i finished my wife's
upgrade<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.489> i<00:02:36.489> started<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.540> think<00:02:37.569> about

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
upgrade and i started to think about

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.300 
upgrade and i started to think about
what<00:02:38.140> i<00:02:38.319> wanted<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.709> do<00:02:38.890> with<00:02:39.010> this<00:02:39.129> thing

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
what i wanted to do with this thing

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.330 
what i wanted to do with this thing
because<00:02:40.150> it's<00:02:40.269> certainly<00:02:40.590> no<00:02:41.590> new<00:02:41.890> enough

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
because it's certainly no new enough

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.550 
because it's certainly no new enough
that<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:43.060> know<00:02:43.150> would<00:02:43.360> still<00:02:43.660> work<00:02:44.230> as<00:02:44.530> a

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
that you know would still work as a

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.130 
that you know would still work as a
pretty<00:02:45.130> decent<00:02:45.430> machine<00:02:45.700> i<00:02:46.019> first<00:02:47.019> thought

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
pretty decent machine i first thought

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.339 
pretty decent machine i first thought
about<00:02:47.670> using<00:02:48.670> this<00:02:48.970> as<00:02:49.209> a<00:02:49.239> computer<00:02:50.140> that<00:02:50.170> my

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
about using this as a computer that my

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.199 
about using this as a computer that my
kids<00:02:50.560> could<00:02:50.709> use<00:02:50.950> but<00:02:51.670> I've<00:02:51.819> already<00:02:51.970> have<00:02:52.180> a

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
kids could use but I've already have a

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.670 
kids could use but I've already have a
couple<00:02:52.599> of<00:02:52.660> laptops<00:02:52.810> that<00:02:53.140> they<00:02:53.319> use<00:02:53.470> right

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
couple of laptops that they use right

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.199 
couple of laptops that they use right
now<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.220> that<00:02:54.489> would<00:02:54.700> work<00:02:54.730> really<00:02:55.060> well

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
now and and that would work really well

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.900 
now and and that would work really well
or<00:02:55.569> works<00:02:56.110> really<00:02:56.290> well<00:02:56.410> for<00:02:56.530> them<00:02:56.799> so<00:02:57.099> I<00:02:57.310> kind

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
or works really well for them so I kind

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.850 
or works really well for them so I kind
of<00:02:57.940> scrap<00:02:58.180> that<00:02:58.209> idea<00:02:58.500> then<00:02:59.500> I<00:02:59.530> thought<00:02:59.799> about

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
of scrap that idea then I thought about

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.610 
of scrap that idea then I thought about
using<00:03:00.250> this<00:03:00.549> as<00:03:00.760> like<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.299> media<00:03:01.720> pc<00:03:01.989> for<00:03:02.500> my

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
using this as like a media pc for my

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.170 
using this as like a media pc for my
bedroom<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:04.299> problem<00:03:04.959> with<00:03:05.110> that<00:03:05.260> though<00:03:05.500> is

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
bedroom the problem with that though is

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.259 
bedroom the problem with that though is
this<00:03:07.180> thing<00:03:07.360> is<00:03:07.510> so<00:03:07.750> big<00:03:08.430> at<00:03:09.430> least<00:03:09.610> you<00:03:10.180> know

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
this thing is so big at least you know

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.360 
this thing is so big at least you know
in<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.720> bedroom<00:03:10.930> anyways<00:03:11.349> that<00:03:11.620> it<00:03:12.010> probably

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
in a bedroom anyways that it probably

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.069 
in a bedroom anyways that it probably
wouldn't<00:03:12.640> work<00:03:12.730> right<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.810> guess<00:03:13.959> the

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
wouldn't work right and I guess the

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.350 
wouldn't work right and I guess the
other<00:03:14.110> thing<00:03:14.290> is<00:03:14.819> I've<00:03:15.819> got<00:03:15.879> one<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.239> these

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
other thing is I've got one of these

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.879 
other thing is I've got one of these

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
home i did have a thought and what i

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.520 
home i did have a thought and what i
think<00:03:45.940> i<00:03:46.120> might<00:03:46.540> want<00:03:46.840> to<00:03:46.930> do<00:03:47.049> with<00:03:47.169> this<00:03:47.319> thing

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
think i might want to do with this thing

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.259 
think i might want to do with this thing
and<00:03:47.709> it<00:03:47.980> will<00:03:48.160> take<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:48.400> little<00:03:48.549> time<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:48.880> put<00:03:49.180> it

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
and it will take a little time to put it

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:50.610 
and it will take a little time to put it
all<00:03:49.329> together<00:03:49.510> because<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.019> will<00:03:50.139> get<00:03:50.290> pricey

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
all together because it will get pricey

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.559 
all together because it will get pricey
i<00:03:50.799> think<00:03:51.099> is<00:03:51.299> i<00:03:52.299> might<00:03:53.230> try<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:53.799> build<00:03:54.160> a<00:03:54.940> nun

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
i think is i might try and build a nun

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.199 
i think is i might try and build a nun

think would be pretty cool to have one
especially<00:04:21.900> because<00:04:22.900> i<00:04:22.930> would<00:04:23.260> like<00:04:23.440> to<00:04:23.590> get

else so that's sort of the ultimate
dream<00:04:45.200> here<00:04:45.440> with<00:04:45.620> this<00:04:45.740> that<00:04:46.010> I<00:04:46.220> could<00:04:47.060> use

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
dream here with this that I could use

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.370 
dream here with this that I could use
the<00:04:47.330> innards<00:04:47.810> of<00:04:47.840> this<00:04:48.560> guy<00:04:48.740> and<00:04:50.290> put<00:04:51.290> together

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
the innards of this guy and put together

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.980 
the innards of this guy and put together
a<00:04:51.620> little<00:04:52.210> server<00:04:53.210> that<00:04:53.419> I<00:04:53.450> could<00:04:53.600> have<00:04:53.750> that

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
a little server that I could have that

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.400 
a little server that I could have that
will<00:04:54.200> be<00:04:54.500> my<00:04:54.800> unraid<00:04:55.430> server<00:04:55.870> that's<00:04:56.870> probably

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
will be my unraid server that's probably

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.280 
will be my unraid server that's probably
going<00:04:57.530> to<00:04:57.620> take<00:04:57.710> a<00:04:57.770> long<00:04:57.980> time<00:04:58.330> because<00:04:59.330> you

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
going to take a long time because you

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.290 
going to take a long time because you
know<00:05:00.410> hard<00:05:00.980> drive<00:05:01.220> space<00:05:01.430> alone<00:05:01.880> is<00:05:02.030> going<00:05:02.240> to

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
know hard drive space alone is going to

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.730 
know hard drive space alone is going to
probably<00:05:02.600> run<00:05:02.870> me<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:03.050> few<00:05:03.230> hundred<00:05:03.290> dollars

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
probably run me a few hundred dollars

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.590 
probably run me a few hundred dollars
and<00:05:03.919> that<00:05:04.040> that's<00:05:04.190> going<00:05:04.370> to<00:05:04.430> be<00:05:04.610> probably<00:05:05.480> the

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
and that that's going to be probably the

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.140 
and that that's going to be probably the
priciest<00:05:06.290> thing<00:05:06.550> so<00:05:07.550> I<00:05:07.610> need<00:05:07.760> to<00:05:07.850> do<00:05:07.970> some
