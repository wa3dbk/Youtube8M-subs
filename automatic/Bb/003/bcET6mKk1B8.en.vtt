 very fruitful it was a solid piece 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:47.489
 titanium and the inner ones were completely 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.760
 carved on a special machine then 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.139
 after that we applied this texture 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.480
 distinctive and feature is then 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.819
 that it originates from the bottom 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.169
 and stretches across the handle 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.879
 even along these grooves to the very top 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:05.219
 this texture covers the whole hilt 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:08.030
 to achieve such a result was not easy 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:11.730

 beautiful and very comfortable we are grateful 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.419

 This knife knife will be on sale 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:43.229
 around the beginning of next year 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:45.540
 this is because the handle 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:47.459
 made of a single piece of titanium and this 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:04:04.139
 very laborious process in terms of 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:04:05.669
 production is a knife that is given 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.250

 a product of long collaboration to us 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.349
 Immediately liked the design of the knife and we knew 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.690
 that production will be very laborious 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:21.090
 the handle is made of special titanium 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.340
 difficulty represented cut out the handle 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.080
 it was the most real of 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.180
 they are at the time of the process 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.139
 production took a lot of time 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.280
 but now the pace of production has increased 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.290
 the handle is made of a single piece 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.440

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:40.139
 very comfortable and beautiful and geometry 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.370
 blade modified there on shoes 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.070
 there is a small descent 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.260
 it is made from one side only in 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.550
 the result is that it is nicely reflected 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.150
 on the appearance of the knife 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.970
 and also on its weight the handle is very comfortable 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.280
