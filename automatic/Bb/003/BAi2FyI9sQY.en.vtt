00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
to get back on a can done and we've

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.250 
to get back on a can done and we've
saved<00:02:43.030> up<00:02:43.300> for<00:02:43.420> Reaper<00:02:43.660> power<00:02:43.870> we're<00:02:44.140> gonna

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
saved up for Reaper power we're gonna

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.650

drain<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.190> right<00:02:45.430> now<00:02:46.800> with<00:02:47.800> every<00:02:48.069> proposed

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
drain that right now with every proposed

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.210 
drain that right now with every proposed
and<00:02:49.660> because<00:02:50.290> we're<00:02:50.440> in<00:02:50.530> Reaper<00:02:50.830> mode<00:02:51.010> we're

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
and because we're in Reaper mode we're

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.890 
and because we're in Reaper mode we're
not<00:02:51.340> too<00:02:51.459> worried<00:02:51.790> about<00:02:51.850> dodging<00:02:52.510> but<00:02:52.660> again

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
not too worried about dodging but again

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.330 
not too worried about dodging but again
it's<00:02:53.200> pretty<00:02:53.319> much<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.650> same<00:02:53.830> thing<00:02:54.160> the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
it's pretty much the same thing the

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.500 
it's pretty much the same thing the
electric<00:02:54.670> burst<00:02:54.850> seemed<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.209> come<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.390> little

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
electric burst seemed to come a little

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.590 
electric burst seemed to come a little
bit<00:02:55.720> quicker<00:02:56.459> just<00:02:57.459> unload<00:02:57.940> on<00:02:58.150> him<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.450> dodge

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
bit quicker just unload on him and dodge

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.009 
bit quicker just unload on him and dodge
those<00:02:58.870> tags<00:02:59.970> right<00:03:00.970> here<00:03:01.239> we<00:03:01.510> can<00:03:01.630> see<00:03:01.780> we<00:03:01.870> got

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
those tags right here we can see we got

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.100 
those tags right here we can see we got
a<00:03:02.100> pretty<00:03:03.100> low<00:03:03.340> although<00:03:03.940> look<00:03:04.450> at<00:03:04.480> how<00:03:04.989> much

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
a pretty low although look at how much

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.509 
a pretty low although look at how much
damage<00:03:05.170> she's<00:03:05.620> doing<00:03:05.890> don't<00:03:06.100> get<00:03:06.310> too

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
damage she's doing don't get too

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.539 
damage she's doing don't get too
reckless<00:03:07.170> we<00:03:08.170> figured<00:03:08.500> hey<00:03:08.709> if<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:08.890> health<00:03:09.310> so

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
reckless we figured hey if the health so

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:10.890 
reckless we figured hey if the health so
low<00:03:09.760> will<00:03:09.940> probably<00:03:10.239> finish<00:03:10.390> him<00:03:10.600> off<00:03:10.660> with<00:03:10.810> a

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
low will probably finish him off with a

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.840 
low will probably finish him off with a
couple<00:03:11.140> more<00:03:11.260> hits<00:03:11.470> but<00:03:11.799> actually<00:03:12.610> if<00:03:12.700> we've

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
couple more hits but actually if we've

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.220 
couple more hits but actually if we've
got<00:03:13.030> hit<00:03:13.239> one<00:03:13.450> more<00:03:13.600> time<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:13.930> would<00:03:14.049> have<00:03:14.140> been

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
got hit one more time it would have been

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.050 
got hit one more time it would have been
down
