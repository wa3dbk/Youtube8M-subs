00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.400
 this is not just a relegated one, I feel the same through hundreds of 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.090
 Almost forgotten from five places before, but they were a family 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.090
 First of all, the apple shows us something amazing 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:15.399
 does not fall far from the trunk and secondly the apple juice that's right next to it 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.929
 that's the point from Rostock for me 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:23.929
 Those are right flying Innsbruck feeling goes 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.569
 That's why there's always a need for replenishment 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.050
 that's what it's all about out of the city 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.210
 they have a video of a date with an apple tree to promise 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.860
 should have big fortune we need the whole lot of apples 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.950
 see the whole picture and hope that it will be fast and then 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.760
 the car is full 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.860
 the amplify the case is the niece dearest friend 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.350
 on the orchard in Rostock Schlager the clan meets 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.860
 big collection action 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.570
 here there are trees full of apples with names hardly anyone knows Osnabrücker 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.370
 Renette Marienberger Bull Berlin or big apple 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.620
 You can not reach the trees in ten minutes 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.790
 Fuchsia did that, too 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.600
 we are now looking for the tree 49 so row 4 tree new music where 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.180
 was not pleasing run 150 different trees 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.040
 As you quickly lose the overview son Martin is very strategic 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.350
 Look for the name tag the pineapple René Adler 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.580
 the guest chooses 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.470
 here is more than questionable 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.710
 that means around 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.120
 slightly knocked down to 4th place from ff 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.210
 finally gave them the red line but they are from time to time 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.210
 earlier" 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.670
 Dr. Whistler 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.159
 the Chancellor is long gone 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.689
 and the Bismarck Altfeld would not have been there any longer 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.689
 there are quarrels that Finks will 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.910
 In the trade the apple flew from the assortment reason 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.410
 Shape and color do not conform to the norm 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.470
 it does not matter to the punks 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.629
 private 50 2 off 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.180
 The finds are much larger here as well, especially Christkind are dismissed 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.209
 Who led the first five minutes after the start is exhausting 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.309
 25 00 take 25 minutes 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:27.729
 they knew him until the last of April 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:30.729
 Screen of Death left a clear case 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.159
 Adler was for premature b 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:41.099
 The football as long as possible have something from their parents and leave them the same 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.499
 to write 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:45.789
 with the mobile cider press he would get 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:48.789
 such patterns are fine 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.909
 the difference between the samples cleaned up another 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.909
 possibly out of which one perceived 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:59.279
 piled up in front of them 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.319
 not treated 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.029
 everyone else too 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:04.499
 there was Elvis 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:06.419
 Rippberg room 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.419
 without not missing out 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:14.309
 However, you have to bring some time depending on the amount 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:18.949
 at the 200 kilos deep and the ANDTEK the press needs about one 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:19.949
 hour 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.949
 but you can already try in advance 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.639
 beat in freshly pressed Bismarck, so to speak 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.639
 Ramsauer 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:45.739
 Dr 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.669
 so it does not kick in and say heated to 81 degrees 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:53.259
 as the demolition varieties and modern drive technology that fits 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:58.449
 not bottled but imported the juice is bottled 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.559
 The now unopened up to 15 months without cooling 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.859
 All these are ten liters of packs for large families 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.599
 like the fox 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:17.840
 and how much have they tricked out of their 200 kilos of apples? 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:19.779
 Colette m 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.330
 at least 75 euros plus 25 euros rent 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.710
 that means the radio spots Ahlen not a Euro per liter of apple juice that counts 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.710
 I'm still cheaper than in business 

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:37.099
 until the next Dez then maybe with the Andernach sends
