00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.560
 ah 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.300
 very good I do we go this spring 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:24.689
 I bought this and it screams is a palitroque not 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.160
 have the pool stick and look 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.619
 I had these little kids, guys, I was 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.800
 excited minguito but look how 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.739
 is this fig I do not know if it is unique or a 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.460
 brief has never known the difference and 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.210
 I hope someone tells me 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.210
 and so 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.410
 well thought 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.940
 so a second 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.740
 can not stand decent 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.210
 how will it be good I think so 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.480
 let's see 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.120
 tell you because this is very rich 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.700
 and this is the fruit of the cycle of law 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.180
 of the word comes from the Greek that 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.180
 means friend 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.590
 fix 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.590
 or 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.220
 and I say it's not a fruit but a flora 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.600
 inverted biblical punishment they gave him 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.140
 to the snow 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.310
 because in the time of Adam and Eve 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.390
 there was no apple if I do not say 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.390
 let's try it 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.479
 I will die 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.090
 delicious 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.350
 I used to have a war that has left 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.130
 studies studies 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.130
 and it's down 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.000
 from sadaba the children who are more 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.560
 immoral 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.560
 It was white, it was terrific 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.980
 this is evolving 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.160
 but this year we 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.380
 but I hope that next year it will 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.220
 fill whole 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.220
 of figs 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.160
 irrigation 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:29.990
 sweet as sugar 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:34.480
 because right here I have the almond tree and the 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.480
 almendro we raised it in 2010 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.890
 in the most elegant way of eating one 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.890
 test or a son 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:59.340
 that do not have the knife in the field 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.310
 to ask the hand what are we going to eat 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.580
 see what korver cited sweet candy 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.580

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.660
 a door to the wind 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:14.800

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:28.610

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.710
 the almond tree is full but I never 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.990
 I ate the almond 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.680
 although we could sow the 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.900
 Almond habits 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.650

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.650

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.480
