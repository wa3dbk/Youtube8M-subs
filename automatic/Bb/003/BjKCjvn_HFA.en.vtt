you whether transformers games can be
good<00:00:37.180> it<00:00:37.660> really<00:00:37.900> is<00:00:38.050> to<00:00:38.170> show<00:00:38.350> you<00:00:38.410> how<00:00:38.890> great

they<00:00:39.460> can<00:00:39.640> actually<00:00:39.879> be<00:00:40.450> I<00:00:44.790> think<00:00:45.790> it<00:00:45.910> more<00:00:46.090> for

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
they can actually be I think it more for

Cybertron<00:00:46.690> we<00:00:46.840> had<00:00:46.960> a<00:00:46.989> lot<00:00:47.170> of<00:00:47.199> characters<00:00:47.680> to

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
Cybertron we had a lot of characters to

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.590 
Cybertron we had a lot of characters to
choose<00:00:47.830> from<00:00:48.010> but<00:00:48.250> gameplay<00:00:48.879> variety<00:00:49.269> wasn't

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
choose from but gameplay variety wasn't

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.119 
choose from but gameplay variety wasn't
that<00:00:49.720> meaningful<00:00:50.199> now<00:00:50.410> maybe<00:00:50.620> one<00:00:50.830> guy<00:00:50.949> was

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
that meaningful now maybe one guy was

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.189 
that meaningful now maybe one guy was
slightly<00:00:51.340> faster<00:00:51.640> in<00:00:52.120> fall<00:00:52.510> of<00:00:52.540> Cybertron<00:00:53.080> we

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
slightly faster in fall of Cybertron we

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.200 
slightly faster in fall of Cybertron we
topped<00:00:53.470> that<00:00:53.590> on<00:00:53.830> its<00:00:53.980> head<00:00:54.040> so<00:00:54.550> we<00:00:54.730> really

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
topped that on its head so we really

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.780 
topped that on its head so we really
have<00:00:55.390> pushed<00:00:55.690> every<00:00:56.290> aspect<00:00:56.800> of<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.040> game<00:00:57.070> to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
have pushed every aspect of the game to

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.410 
have pushed every aspect of the game to
be<00:00:57.820> super<00:00:58.449> tight<00:00:58.710> really<00:00:59.710> clean<00:01:00.070> and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
be super tight really clean and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.670 
be super tight really clean and
incredibly<00:01:01.420> well-balanced<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.470> gameplay

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
incredibly well-balanced the gameplay

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.649 
incredibly well-balanced the gameplay
experience<00:01:03.280> can<00:01:03.519> can<00:01:03.940> change<00:01:04.180> dramatically

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
experience can can change dramatically

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.060 
experience can can change dramatically
with<00:01:05.110> some<00:01:05.229> of<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.379> flying<00:01:05.620> missions<00:01:05.799> you're

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
with some of the flying missions you're

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.890 
with some of the flying missions you're
able<00:01:06.250> to<00:01:06.370> fly<00:01:06.670> around<00:01:06.790> and<00:01:07.150> don't<00:01:07.690> get<00:01:07.780> the

able to fly around and don't get the

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.870 
able to fly around and don't get the
drop<00:01:08.320> on<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.590> enemy<00:01:08.799> from<00:01:08.979> above<00:01:09.220> how<00:01:09.520> you<00:01:09.580> use

drop on the enemy from above how you use

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.240 
drop on the enemy from above how you use
that<00:01:09.909> as<00:01:10.180> a<00:01:10.210> survival<00:01:11.049> tactic<00:01:11.409> it<00:01:11.830> all<00:01:11.920> depends

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
that as a survival tactic it all depends

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.130 
that as a survival tactic it all depends
on<00:01:12.340> how<00:01:12.430> you<00:01:12.460> want<00:01:12.610> to<00:01:12.850> play<00:01:13.210> it<00:01:13.299> we<00:01:13.479> definitely

made sure that all the transformation is

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.730 
made sure that all the transformation is
a<00:01:16.330> viable<00:01:16.570> strategy<00:01:16.780> throughout<00:01:17.470> all<00:01:17.619> these

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740
