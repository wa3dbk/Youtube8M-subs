00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.970

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.760
 good afternoon I am cartif and today I bring you 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.139
 a new mystery of jeta 5 in play 4 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.080
 today I bring you a mystery related 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.360
 with walking dead and nothing kids this 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.099
 series that so many people see as well as 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.360
 you know the zombies and the character 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.150
 principal the most important character 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.500
 well it's called rick wright no and in that 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.720
 plate as you have seen on the plate this 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.270
 police then appreciates the bellido's 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.840
 this good character what we have to 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.910
 to do is come to this part of the map that 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.460
 it is this police that has the 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.340
 different outfit worth brown and 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.930
 nothing here we will get to know you 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.940
 I do not die because I am in campaign and good 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.710
 I have the invincible trick I'll leave it for 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.720
 the efficiency that wants to do it and nothing 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.030
 here we will find enough policemen 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.440
 we call the attention of police and I 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.570
 in this case what I have done is 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.070
 kill them, then I killed him and 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.560
 Once on the ground, I look at the 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.480
 plate as you see on the plate as I say 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.740
 puts wine the last name of the character 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.199
 main you are seeing on screen 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.390
 as well 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.539
 from walking from the walking series 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.850
 this leak because it came out a long time ago 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:14.920
 and well, there are people who have already investigated 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.539
 and all that we exited such as in 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.340
 play 4 in the new generation in teams 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.990
 one too, yes you are kids 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.640
 so it is not open this part of the map 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.409
 We kill a pair of policemen or 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.630
 simply because they already appear to us 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.429
 policemen and we look at the plates and 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.110
 you will see that it was some in the hat 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.149
 always we will appear a policeman with 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.920
 hat then that also the 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.719
 very characteristic hats rick 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.209
 wright then we will leave the plate as 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.890
 You see in this one that is different but 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:41.470
 nothing comes out the plate is as fuzzy 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.939
 and from previous as it teaches eyes and so 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.500
 there are kids from a ministry that 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.360
 I like it a lot since I sometimes see 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.549
 I must write I'm not very tainted but 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.869
 good many friends and all that yes 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.090
 that nothing if you are flawed 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.340
 say it for the comments if you have 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.110
 seen your favorite chapter 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.909
 also tell me and na kids know 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.700
 what do you think about this the reference of 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.530
 walking dead in gta 5 and nothing to give him aic 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.489
 for more videos like these a greeting and 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.209
 until next time 

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:06.209
 goodbye
