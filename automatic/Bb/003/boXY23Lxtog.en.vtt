00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.330 
there so we're going to play around with
the<00:01:06.810> tuning<00:01:07.200> finally<00:01:07.530> see<00:01:07.710> how<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.010> performs

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the tuning finally see how it performs

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.399 
the tuning finally see how it performs
in<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.549> muskeg<00:01:09.000> see<00:01:09.180> if<00:01:09.240> I've<00:01:09.360> got<00:01:09.390> my<00:01:09.690> top<00:01:09.750> rpm

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
in the muskeg see if I've got my top rpm

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.920 
in the muskeg see if I've got my top rpm
figured<00:01:10.800> out<00:01:10.980> I<00:01:11.300> think<00:01:12.300> I<00:01:12.390> got<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.570> all<00:01:12.780> ready
