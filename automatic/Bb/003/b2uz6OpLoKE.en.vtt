00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
more pliable when something has more

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.150 
more pliable when something has more
weight<00:00:39.329> like<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.750> it's<00:00:39.960> not<00:00:40.110> pliable<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.070> you

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
parallel with it this would not be

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.389 
parallel with it this would not be
parallel<00:00:51.780> what's<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.680> happen<00:00:53.010> if<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.219> go

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
parallel what's going to happen if I go

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.560 
parallel what's going to happen if I go
in<00:00:53.550> there<00:00:53.670> you're<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.030> create<00:00:54.180> too<00:00:54.390> much
