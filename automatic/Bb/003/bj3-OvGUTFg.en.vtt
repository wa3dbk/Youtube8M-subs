Moscow<00:01:14.850> research<00:01:15.930> creativity<00:01:16.930> I<00:01:16.960> think<00:01:17.380> just

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
Moscow research creativity I think just

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.010 
Moscow research creativity I think just
absolutely<00:01:18.340> go<00:01:18.610> hand<00:01:18.939> in<00:01:19.090> hand<00:01:19.150> there<00:01:19.900> is

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
absolutely go hand in hand there is

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.200 
absolutely go hand in hand there is
really<00:01:20.350> much<00:01:20.530> of<00:01:20.560> a<00:01:20.740> distinction<00:01:21.070> between<00:01:21.250> the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
really much of a distinction between the

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.900 
really much of a distinction between the
two<00:01:22.420> of<00:01:22.450> them<00:01:22.620> but<00:01:23.620> the<00:01:23.710> notion<00:01:23.950> of<00:01:24.220> creativity

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
two of them but the notion of creativity

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.340 
two of them but the notion of creativity
and<00:01:25.210> freedom<00:01:25.510> and<00:01:25.810> there<00:01:25.900> was<00:01:25.990> a<00:01:26.020> question

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
and freedom and there was a question

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.040 
and freedom and there was a question
about<00:01:26.590> creativity<00:01:27.340> and<00:01:27.880> how<00:01:28.060> it<00:01:28.300> can<00:01:28.510> be

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
about creativity and how it can be

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.950 
about creativity and how it can be
sustained<00:01:30.010> in<00:01:30.280> children<00:01:30.760> one<00:01:31.450> of<00:01:31.480> the<00:01:31.600> ways<00:01:31.750> it

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
sustained in children one of the ways it

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.800 
sustained in children one of the ways it
seems<00:01:31.990> to<00:01:32.260> me<00:01:32.350> is<00:01:32.530> that<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:33.520> best<00:01:33.730> advice<00:01:34.330> for

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
seems to me is that the best advice for

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.260 
seems to me is that the best advice for
anything<00:01:35.260> is<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:35.530> good<00:01:35.710> example<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.880> two<00:01:37.060> areas

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
anything is a good example in two areas

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.540 
anything is a good example in two areas
where<00:01:38.110> my<00:01:38.260> lab<00:01:38.440> is<00:01:38.620> interested<00:01:39.010> in<00:01:39.400> is

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
where my lab is interested in is

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.550 
where my lab is interested in is
contrast<00:01:40.390> agents<00:01:40.720> for<00:01:40.840> magnetic<00:01:41.050> resonance

contrast agents for magnetic resonance

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.260 
contrast agents for magnetic resonance
imaging<00:01:41.650> so<00:01:42.130> we<00:01:42.250> use<00:01:42.430> the<00:01:42.909> magnetic

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
imaging so we use the magnetic

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.540 
imaging so we use the magnetic
properties<00:01:43.870> of<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.080> lanthanides<00:01:44.530> to<00:01:45.100> try<00:01:45.340> and

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
properties of the lanthanides to try and

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.300 
properties of the lanthanides to try and
do<00:01:46.030> things<00:01:46.270> like<00:01:46.479> diagnosed<00:01:47.409> tumors<00:01:47.680> in<00:01:47.979> early

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
do things like diagnosed tumors in early
