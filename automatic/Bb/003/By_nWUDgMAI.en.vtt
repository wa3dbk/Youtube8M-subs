when we built this we wanted to be the

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.090 
when we built this we wanted to be the
world's<00:00:17.820> fastest<00:00:18.570> GPU<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.500> we<00:00:19.590> accomplished

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
world's fastest GPU and we accomplished

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.310 
world's fastest GPU and we accomplished
that<00:00:20.189> but<00:00:21.060> we<00:00:21.150> also<00:00:21.300> wanted<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.689> be<00:00:21.900> extremely

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
that but we also wanted to be extremely

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.960 
that but we also wanted to be extremely

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
up a lot of heat and that's what we've

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.979 
up a lot of heat and that's what we've
built<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:32.759> we<00:00:33.360> invented<00:00:33.780> some<00:00:33.960> new

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
built here we invented some new

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.600 
built here we invented some new
technology<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.800> goes<00:00:34.890> hand<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.309> hand<00:00:35.370> with

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
technology that goes hand in hand with

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.220 
technology that goes hand in hand with
this<00:00:35.790> graphics<00:00:36.210> card<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.570> first<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.050> call

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
this graphics card the first one we call

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.040 
this graphics card the first one we call
GPU<00:00:37.680> boost<00:00:37.980> which<00:00:38.489> boosts<00:00:39.059> your<00:00:39.239> clock<00:00:39.719> speed

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
GPU boost which boosts your clock speed

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.080 
GPU boost which boosts your clock speed
when<00:00:40.320> you're<00:00:40.410> playing<00:00:40.620> certain<00:00:40.980> games<00:00:41.219> so

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
when you're playing certain games so

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.150 
when you're playing certain games so
here<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.360> how<00:00:42.450> GPU<00:00:42.840> boost<00:00:43.110> works<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:43.860> used<00:00:44.040> to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
here is how GPU boost works we used to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.770 
here is how GPU boost works we used to
set<00:00:44.399> our<00:00:44.520> clocks<00:00:44.700> based<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> power

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
set our clocks based on the power

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.180 
set our clocks based on the power
consumed<00:00:46.260> when<00:00:46.410> you're<00:00:46.590> running<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.920> really

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
consumed when you're running a really

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.250 
consumed when you're running a really
stressful<00:00:47.460> application<00:00:48.270> we<00:00:48.719> found<00:00:48.899> there's<00:00:49.200> a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
stressful application we found there's a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.900 
stressful application we found there's a
lot<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.440> 3d<00:00:49.829> games<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.370> actually<00:00:50.399> don't

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
lot of 3d games that actually don't

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.939 
lot of 3d games that actually don't
consume<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.510> much<00:00:51.570> power<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.289> what<00:00:52.800> do<00:00:52.860> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
consume that much power so what do you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.740 
consume that much power so what do you
do<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.280> extra<00:00:53.340> power<00:00:53.789> well<00:00:54.239> what<00:00:54.420> GPU

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
do with that extra power well what GPU

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.080 
do with that extra power well what GPU
boost<00:00:55.050> does<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.559> lets<00:00:56.039> us<00:00:56.219> convert<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.789> power

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
boost does it lets us convert that power

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.139 
boost does it lets us convert that power
into<00:00:57.989> increased<00:00:58.530> clock<00:00:58.829> speeds<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.760> we<00:00:59.879> do<00:01:00.030> it

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
into increased clock speeds and we do it

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.119 
into increased clock speeds and we do it
automatically<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.260> result<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.829> when<00:01:02.010> you're

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
automatically the result is when you're

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.130 
automatically the result is when you're
playing<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.520> game<00:01:02.760> you'll<00:01:03.300> get<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.449> boost<00:01:03.870> in

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
playing a game you'll get a boost in

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.320 
playing a game you'll get a boost in
your<00:01:04.470> GPU<00:01:04.830> clock<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.580> will<00:01:05.760> result<00:01:06.060> in

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
your GPU clock that will result in

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.240 
your GPU clock that will result in
increased<00:01:06.840> gaming<00:01:07.229> performance<00:01:07.350> it's<00:01:07.920> really

to make your gaming experience smoother
what<00:01:14.340> we<00:01:14.460> did<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.729> we<00:01:14.760> invented<00:01:15.270> technologies

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
what we did is we invented technologies

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.899 
what we did is we invented technologies
on<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.560> AAA<00:01:16.710> side<00:01:17.159> we're<00:01:17.520> going<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> call<00:01:17.880> it

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
on the AAA side we're going to call it

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.840 
on the AAA side we're going to call it
TX<00:01:18.360> AAA<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.470> really<00:01:19.799> gets<00:01:20.310> rid<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.610> all<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
TX AAA and it really gets rid of all the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.640 
TX AAA and it really gets rid of all the
jaggies<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.420> game<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.170> doesn't<00:01:22.470> take

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
jaggies in the game but it doesn't take

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.109 
jaggies in the game but it doesn't take
a<00:01:22.680> performance<00:01:23.189> hit<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:23.850> great

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
a performance hit so you can have great

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.149 
a performance hit so you can have great
image<00:01:24.420> quality<00:01:24.659> but<00:01:25.259> really<00:01:25.530> fast<00:01:25.799> smooth

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
image quality but really fast smooth

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.850 
image quality but really fast smooth
gaming<00:01:26.400> performance<00:01:27.200> we've<00:01:28.200> also<00:01:28.380> made<00:01:28.680> some

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
gaming performance we've also made some

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.010 
gaming performance we've also made some

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
advancements in the area of physics so

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.050 
advancements in the area of physics so
previously<00:01:31.380> we<00:01:31.650> had<00:01:31.799> our<00:01:31.979> apex<00:01:32.430> destruction

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
previously we had our apex destruction

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.580 
previously we had our apex destruction
module<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.659> if<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.020> wanted<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.290> have<00:01:34.409> this

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
module and if you wanted to have this

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.710 
module and if you wanted to have this
type<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.890> destruction<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.700> video<00:01:35.909> game<00:01:35.970> what

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
type of destruction in a video game what

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.260 
type of destruction in a video game what
the<00:01:36.840> artist<00:01:37.229> would<00:01:37.409> do<00:01:37.680> was<00:01:38.220> pre<00:01:38.610> compute<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the artist would do was pre compute the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.880 
the artist would do was pre compute the
fracture<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:39.960> then<00:01:40.350> once<00:01:40.530> you're<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
fracture and then once you're in the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.980 
fracture and then once you're in the
video<00:01:41.130> game<00:01:41.159> if<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.060> shot<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.479> pillar<00:01:42.689> it

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
video game if you shot the pillar it

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.289 
video game if you shot the pillar it
would<00:01:43.110> fracture<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.710> specific<00:01:43.920> way<00:01:44.299> what

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
would fracture in a specific way what

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.030 
would fracture in a specific way what
we're<00:01:45.450> looking<00:01:45.720> at<00:01:45.840> here<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.320> dynamic

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
we're looking at here is dynamic

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.819 
we're looking at here is dynamic
fracture<00:01:47.450> nothing<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.570> pre<00:01:48.810> computed<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.500> all

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
fracture nothing is pre computed it all

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.429 
fracture nothing is pre computed it all

happens in real time whenever you shoot
this<00:01:52.619> pillar<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.430> will<00:01:53.640> never<00:01:53.909> break<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.329> same

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
this pillar it will never break the same

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.950 
this pillar it will never break the same
ever

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
ever

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.940 
ever
now<00:01:57.960> let's<00:01:58.140> look<00:01:58.229> at<00:01:58.350> what<00:01:58.530> we've<00:01:58.650> done<00:01:58.800> with

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
now let's look at what we've done with

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.190 
now let's look at what we've done with
fur<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.550> video<00:01:59.790> games<00:02:00.030> now<00:02:00.420> if<00:02:00.690> you<00:02:00.870> wanted<00:02:01.110> to

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
fur and video games now if you wanted to

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200 
fur and video games now if you wanted to
build<00:02:01.440> a<00:02:01.650> beast<00:02:01.890> like<00:02:02.010> this<00:02:02.370> before<00:02:02.760> you<00:02:03.030> have

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
build a beast like this before you have

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.120 
build a beast like this before you have
a<00:02:03.240> hundred<00:02:03.630> hairs<00:02:03.870> and<00:02:04.200> interpolated<00:02:04.979> between

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
a hundred hairs and interpolated between

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.820 
a hundred hairs and interpolated between
all<00:02:05.550> the<00:02:05.640> hairs<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:07.110> guys<00:02:07.260> have<00:02:07.470> seen<00:02:07.680> it

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
all the hairs and you guys have seen it

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.380 
all the hairs and you guys have seen it
you've<00:02:07.920> seen<00:02:08.160> lots<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.580> characters<00:02:09.060> where<00:02:09.300> it

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
you've seen lots of characters where it

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.330 
you've seen lots of characters where it
just<00:02:09.539> doesn't<00:02:09.840> look<00:02:09.899> realistic<00:02:10.259> or<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:11.160> see

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
just doesn't look realistic or you see

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.160 
just doesn't look realistic or you see
bald<00:02:11.610> characters<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.360> video<00:02:12.569> games<00:02:12.840> or<00:02:13.080> they

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
bald characters and video games or they

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.380 
bald characters and video games or they
have<00:02:13.320> you<00:02:13.590> know<00:02:13.680> plastic<00:02:13.950> looking<00:02:14.459> here<00:02:14.700> well

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
have you know plastic looking here well

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.360 
have you know plastic looking here well
here<00:02:15.750> we're<00:02:15.900> simulating<00:02:16.260> a<00:02:16.560> hundred<00:02:16.890> thousand

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
here we're simulating a hundred thousand

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.370 
here we're simulating a hundred thousand
hairs<00:02:17.550> in<00:02:17.790> real<00:02:18.000> time<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:19.020> can<00:02:19.140> see<00:02:19.290> it

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
hairs in real time and you can see it

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.500 
hairs in real time and you can see it
just<00:02:19.530> looks<00:02:19.709> super<00:02:20.190> realistic<00:02:20.580> we<00:02:21.240> can<00:02:21.360> even

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
just looks super realistic we can even

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.240 
just looks super realistic we can even
do<00:02:21.750> some<00:02:21.959> really<00:02:22.170> cool<00:02:22.260> effects<00:02:22.800> like<00:02:23.040> these

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
do some really cool effects like these

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.040 
do some really cool effects like these
hair<00:02:23.550> dryer<00:02:23.850> effects<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.510> we're<00:02:24.660> looking<00:02:24.780> at

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
hair dryer effects that we're looking at

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.740 
hair dryer effects that we're looking at
right<00:02:25.080> now<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:26.010> once<00:02:26.550> again<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:27.030> adding<00:02:27.540> more

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
right now so once again just adding more

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.060 
right now so once again just adding more
realism<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:28.680> video<00:02:28.920> games<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:31.050> then<00:02:31.680> finally

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
realism to video games and then finally

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.250 
realism to video games and then finally
we<00:02:32.220> wanted<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.520> have<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.640> richer<00:02:33.060> experience

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
we wanted you have a richer experience

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.290 
we wanted you have a richer experience
so<00:02:34.260> things<00:02:34.680> like<00:02:34.860> 3d<00:02:35.220> vision<00:02:35.400> surround<00:02:35.820> off<00:02:36.090> of

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
so things like 3d vision surround off of

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.300 
so things like 3d vision surround off of
a<00:02:36.330> single<00:02:36.840> graphics<00:02:37.230> card<00:02:37.470> or<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.650> single<00:02:37.980> GPU

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
a single graphics card or a single GPU

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.440 
a single graphics card or a single GPU
and<00:02:38.580> even<00:02:39.300> support<00:02:39.660> up<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.900> four<00:02:40.080> displays<00:02:41.450> so

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
and even support up to four displays so

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.570 
and even support up to four displays so
there<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.750> have<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.230> geforce<00:02:43.620> gtx<00:02:44.100> 680

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
there you have it the geforce gtx 680

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.060 
there you have it the geforce gtx 680
it's<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.090> fastest<00:02:45.660> most<00:02:46.200> efficient<00:02:46.709> GPU

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
it's the fastest most efficient GPU

00:02:47.070 --> 00:03:00.190 
it's the fastest most efficient GPU
we've<00:02:47.310> ever<00:02:47.519> built

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.260
