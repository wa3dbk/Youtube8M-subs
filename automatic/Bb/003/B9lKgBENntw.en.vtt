00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.420
 I think society did not want to see 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.550
 certain things that were happening 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.550
 but there was a lot of fear 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:38.810
 you had to have courage 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:38.810
 [Music] 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.680
 first of madrid 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.500
 I declare myself as the photographer of the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.590
 losers and from the dead I got to 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.150
 that part of me 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.150
 defend those who had no voice 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:04.120
 so I was photographing the pain 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.120
 for your feeling is a good picture here 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.450
 and suddenly my camera became 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.159
 miami 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.159
 [Music] 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.360
 two 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.980
 well I went through everything I filed 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.450
 note that all the photos did not exist 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.570
 the beginning trend I will not do 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.090
 that was doubly missing 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.420
 did not know as a duty to return them to 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.420
 life 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.650
 and not having family photos 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.250
 [Music] 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.130
 and as not 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.550
 it was more part of the history of the 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:03.019
 humanity 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:03.019
