actions<00:00:33.010> on<00:00:33.129> us<00:00:33.280> with<00:00:33.489> pocket<00:00:33.879> sevens<00:00:34.239> how<00:00:34.780> do

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
actions on us with pocket sevens how do

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.170 
actions on us with pocket sevens how do
we<00:00:35.050> proceed<00:00:35.850> well<00:00:36.850> there's<00:00:36.970> a<00:00:37.030> few

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
we proceed well there's a few

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.259 
we proceed well there's a few
interesting<00:00:37.629> dynamics<00:00:38.140> here<00:00:38.350> and<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:40.030> first

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
interesting dynamics here and the first

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:42.119 
interesting dynamics here and the first
piece<00:00:40.480> of<00:00:40.510> information<00:00:40.840> is<00:00:41.350> that<00:00:41.769> the<00:00:41.920> player

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
piece of information is that the player

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.540 
piece of information is that the player
that<00:00:42.280> slumped<00:00:42.610> utg<00:00:43.120> has<00:00:43.629> been<00:00:43.870> playing<00:00:44.489> 60%<00:00:45.489> of

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
that slumped utg has been playing 60% of

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.439 
that slumped utg has been playing 60% of
hands<00:00:45.850> so<00:00:46.510> we<00:00:47.110> can<00:00:47.140> disregard<00:00:47.620> the<00:00:47.949> fact<00:00:47.980> that

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
hands so we can disregard the fact that

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.690 
hands so we can disregard the fact that
the<00:00:49.449> very<00:00:49.750> unlikely<00:00:50.350> possibility<00:00:50.769> that

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 
the very unlikely possibility that

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.750 
the very unlikely possibility that
they're<00:00:52.270> trapping<00:00:53.190> we<00:00:54.190> don't<00:00:54.370> really<00:00:54.520> know<00:00:54.730> a

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
they're trapping we don't really know a

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.060 
they're trapping we don't really know a
lot<00:00:55.030> about<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:56.140> cutoff<00:00:56.469> player<00:00:56.860> that's

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
lot about the cutoff player that's

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.369 
lot about the cutoff player that's
limped<00:00:57.460> but<00:00:58.030> you<00:00:58.539> would<00:00:58.660> presume<00:00:58.989> limping

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
limped but you would presume limping

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.080 
limped but you would presume limping
behind<00:00:59.710> generally<00:01:00.640> they're<00:01:00.789> not<00:01:00.910> going<00:01:01.059> to

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
behind generally they're not going to

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.520 
behind generally they're not going to
have<00:01:01.239> a<00:01:01.270> very<00:01:01.600> strong<00:01:01.840> hand<00:01:02.079> and<00:01:02.260> they're

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
have a very strong hand and they're

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.820 
have a very strong hand and they're
probably<00:01:02.770> playing<00:01:03.219> something<00:01:03.610> speculatively

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
probably playing something speculatively

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.430 
probably playing something speculatively
now<00:01:05.830> the<00:01:05.890> button<00:01:06.220> who's<00:01:06.340> jammed<00:01:07.229> only<00:01:08.229> has<00:01:08.410> a

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
now the button who's jammed only has a

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.790 
now the button who's jammed only has a
rounded<00:01:08.770> m3<00:01:09.280> stack<00:01:09.610> but<00:01:10.600> if<00:01:10.690> we<00:01:10.810> call<00:01:11.020> that<00:01:11.200> M<00:01:11.380> 3

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
rounded m3 stack but if we call that M 3

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.370 
rounded m3 stack but if we call that M 3
and<00:01:12.070> then<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.759> utg<00:01:13.270> player<00:01:13.479> say<00:01:13.690> does<00:01:14.050> jam

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
and then the utg player say does jam

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.940 
and then the utg player say does jam
will<00:01:15.130> now<00:01:15.310> probably<00:01:15.610> be<00:01:15.970> forced<00:01:16.240> to<00:01:16.390> call<00:01:16.630> off

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
will now probably be forced to call off

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.310 
will now probably be forced to call off
which<00:01:18.030> might<00:01:19.030> not<00:01:19.180> necessarily<00:01:19.390> be<00:01:20.020> such<00:01:20.289> a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
which might not necessarily be such a

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.859 
which might not necessarily be such a
bad<00:01:20.590> thing<00:01:20.619> if<00:01:20.979> they<00:01:21.130> would<00:01:21.340> Jam<00:01:21.580> wide<00:01:22.330> which

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
bad thing if they would Jam wide which

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.080 
bad thing if they would Jam wide which
given<00:01:23.530> how<00:01:23.619> loose<00:01:23.860> they<00:01:24.069> are<00:01:24.220> they<00:01:24.369> might<00:01:24.550> but

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
given how loose they are they might but

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.570 
given how loose they are they might but
what's<00:01:25.330> more<00:01:25.690> likely<00:01:25.990> is<00:01:26.349> the<00:01:26.890> utg<00:01:27.369> player

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
what's more likely is the utg player

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.969 
what's more likely is the utg player
would<00:01:27.729> call<00:01:28.060> given<00:01:28.840> their<00:01:28.959> playing<00:01:29.170> 60%<00:01:29.890> of

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
would call given their playing 60% of

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.219 
would call given their playing 60% of
hands<00:01:30.130> they're<00:01:30.369> obviously<00:01:30.759> very<00:01:30.880> loose<00:01:31.330> so

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
hands they're obviously very loose so

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.680 
hands they're obviously very loose so
rather<00:01:32.920> than<00:01:33.190> have<00:01:33.429> that<00:01:33.459> problem<00:01:34.030> of<00:01:34.149> perhaps

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
rather than have that problem of perhaps

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.960 
rather than have that problem of perhaps
calling<00:01:35.619> because<00:01:36.069> I<00:01:36.099> feel<00:01:36.399> like<00:01:36.429> the<00:01:36.640> sevens

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
calling because I feel like the sevens

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.219 
calling because I feel like the sevens
are<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:37.119> little<00:01:37.240> bit<00:01:37.450> too<00:01:37.599> strong<00:01:37.660> here<00:01:38.050> to<00:01:38.110> be

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
are a little bit too strong here to be

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.290 
are a little bit too strong here to be
folding<00:01:38.649> rather<00:01:39.340> than<00:01:39.550> calling<00:01:39.819> the<00:01:40.030> short

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
folding rather than calling the short

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.249 
folding rather than calling the short
stack<00:01:40.539> m3<00:01:40.990> jam<00:01:41.349> and<00:01:41.679> then<00:01:42.429> probably<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:43.420> utg

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
stack m3 jam and then probably the utg

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.109 
stack m3 jam and then probably the utg
player<00:01:44.500> calling<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.160> potentially<00:01:45.970> the

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
player calling and potentially the

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.160 
player calling and potentially the
cutoff<00:01:46.390> as<00:01:46.690> well

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
cutoff as well

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.080 
cutoff as well
I<00:01:47.200> decide<00:01:48.069> to<00:01:48.160> opt<00:01:48.310> for<00:01:48.429> the<00:01:48.550> more<00:01:48.580> aggressive

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
I decide to opt for the more aggressive

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.210 
I decide to opt for the more aggressive
route<00:01:49.420> here<00:01:49.630> which<00:01:49.810> is<00:01:49.989> to<00:01:50.229> jam<00:01:50.800> all<00:01:50.830> in<00:01:51.099> an

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
route here which is to jam all in an

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.089 
route here which is to jam all in an
isolate<00:01:51.700> now<00:01:52.599> it's<00:01:52.780> a<00:01:52.869> big<00:01:53.140> jam<00:01:53.440> it's<00:01:53.649> around<00:01:53.950> M

00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:54.099 
isolate now it's a big jam it's around M

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:56.729 
isolate now it's a big jam it's around M
20<00:01:54.520> but<00:01:55.360> we're<00:01:55.869> pretty<00:01:56.050> sure<00:01:56.170> that<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.530> cutoff

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:56.739 
20 but we're pretty sure that the cutoff

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:59.160 
20 but we're pretty sure that the cutoff
players<00:01:57.039> gonna<00:01:57.190> fold<00:01:57.459> and<00:01:57.759> as<00:01:58.209> I<00:01:58.330> said<00:01:58.539> the<00:01:58.690> utg

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
players gonna fold and as I said the utg

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.620 
players gonna fold and as I said the utg
player<00:01:59.410> well<00:01:59.920> he<00:02:00.340> only<00:02:00.459> has<00:02:00.700> around<00:02:00.819> them<00:02:01.119> 10

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
player well he only has around them 10

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.229 
player well he only has around them 10
ish<00:02:01.780> and<00:02:02.020> he's<00:02:02.890> been<00:02:03.130> very<00:02:03.520> loose<00:02:03.789> so<00:02:04.090> I'm

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:04.239 
ish and he's been very loose so I'm

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:05.850 
ish and he's been very loose so I'm
expecting<00:02:04.539> he's<00:02:04.840> gonna<00:02:04.959> fold<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.410> majority

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
expecting he's gonna fold the majority

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.680 
expecting he's gonna fold the majority
of<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:06.039> time<00:02:06.280> so<00:02:06.970> when<00:02:07.060> you<00:02:07.149> put<00:02:07.330> all<00:02:07.360> that

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
of the time so when you put all that

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.570 
of the time so when you put all that
together<00:02:07.840> I<00:02:08.289> think<00:02:08.770> that's<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.190> best<00:02:09.369> play<00:02:09.520> in

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
together I think that's the best play in

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.940 
together I think that's the best play in
this<00:02:09.789> spot<00:02:10.050> especially<00:02:11.050> when<00:02:11.200> we<00:02:11.319> see<00:02:11.560> our

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
this spot especially when we see our

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.280 
this spot especially when we see our
ponent<00:02:12.580> has<00:02:12.670> six<00:02:12.940> high

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290

quite a juicy pot now and pocket sevens

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.600 
quite a juicy pot now and pocket sevens
figured<00:02:41.810> it'd<00:02:41.930> be<00:02:41.960> in<00:02:42.410> very<00:02:42.980> good<00:02:43.160> shape<00:02:43.220> and

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
figured it'd be in very good shape and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.760 
figured it'd be in very good shape and
the<00:02:43.670> best<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.060> most<00:02:44.210> of<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.420> time<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:44.870> it's<00:02:45.650> a

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
the best and most of the time and it's a

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.850 
the best and most of the time and it's a
good<00:02:45.980> risk<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.490> take<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:47.390> pick<00:02:47.930> up<00:02:48.110> a<00:02:48.320> juicy

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
good risk to take to pick up a juicy

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.800 
good risk to take to pick up a juicy
little<00:02:49.130> pot<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.580> one<00:02:50.209> of<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.360> key<00:02:50.570> things

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
little pot and one of the key things

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.780 
little pot and one of the key things
here<00:02:50.900> was<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.590> player<00:02:51.800> tendencies<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.459> the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
here was the player tendencies and the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.880 
here was the player tendencies and the
stack<00:02:53.030> size<00:02:53.240> if<00:02:53.870> we<00:02:54.050> had<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:54.290> just<00:02:54.440> called<00:02:54.650> and

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
stack size if we had it just called and

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.280 
stack size if we had it just called and
the<00:02:55.070> utg<00:02:55.520> player<00:02:55.730> called<00:02:56.000> as<00:02:56.120> well<00:02:56.330> then<00:02:57.140> the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
the utg player called as well then the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.110 
the utg player called as well then the
cutoff<00:02:57.500> would<00:02:57.709> probably<00:02:57.980> call<00:02:58.190> then<00:02:59.000> when

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
cutoff would probably call then when

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.550 
cutoff would probably call then when
this<00:02:59.240> flop<00:02:59.480> comes<00:02:59.660> we're<00:02:59.900> in<00:02:59.990> a<00:03:00.050> really<00:03:00.320> bad

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
this flop comes we're in a really bad

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.050 
this flop comes we're in a really bad
spot<00:03:00.740> with<00:03:00.980> our<00:03:01.100> sevens<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.550> will<00:03:01.640> probably

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
spot with our sevens and will probably

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.230 
spot with our sevens and will probably
be<00:03:02.750> check<00:03:02.990> folding<00:03:03.440> because<00:03:03.650> NEC<00:03:04.430> bit<00:03:04.670> will

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.240 
be check folding because NEC bit will

commit us to the ute lemper since if we
had<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:08.690> called<00:03:08.900> preflop<00:03:09.350> and<00:03:09.410> he<00:03:09.620> called<00:03:09.860> on

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
had a called preflop and he called on

had a called preflop and he called on
the<00:03:10.040> player<00:03:10.310> behind<00:03:10.490> called<00:03:10.940> well<00:03:11.510> a<00:03:11.750> CE<00:03:12.170> bet

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
the player behind called well a CE bet

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.900 
the player behind called well a CE bet
would<00:03:12.470> be<00:03:12.530> virtually<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.100> size<00:03:13.340> of<00:03:13.459> his<00:03:13.580> stack

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
would be virtually the size of his stack

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.550 
would be virtually the size of his stack
because<00:03:14.270> the<00:03:14.390> block<00:03:14.570> pot<00:03:14.959> would<00:03:15.110> have<00:03:15.230> become

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
because the block pot would have become

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.550 
because the block pot would have become

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
so bloated so it was better to jam keep

jammer even though we were a little bit
deeper<00:03:23.180> with<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.480> information<00:03:24.019> we<00:03:24.110> had<00:03:24.320> it
