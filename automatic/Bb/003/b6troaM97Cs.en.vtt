00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
scope of this video but we'll take a

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.390 
scope of this video but we'll take a
quick<00:00:15.990> look<00:00:16.199> at<00:00:16.350> some<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.619> them<00:00:16.710> right<00:00:16.890> now<00:00:16.949> and

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
quick look at some of them right now and

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.000 
quick look at some of them right now and
how<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.119> can<00:00:18.300> change<00:00:18.359> them<00:00:18.840> if<00:00:19.050> we<00:00:19.289> select<00:00:19.710> the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
how we can change them if we select the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.130 
how we can change them if we select the
build<00:00:20.250> option<00:00:20.760> here<00:00:20.939> for<00:00:21.090> example<00:00:21.359> you'll<00:00:21.960> see

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
build option here for example you'll see

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.810 
build option here for example you'll see
it<00:00:22.230> gives<00:00:22.380> us<00:00:22.500> options<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:23.189> do<00:00:23.460> different

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
it gives us options to do different

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.220 
it gives us options to do different
things<00:00:23.850> such<00:00:24.240> as<00:00:24.390> build<00:00:24.630> with<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.900> publish

wizard open our output folder after
build<00:00:27.599> by<00:00:27.810> default<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:28.590> forth<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.429> go

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
build by default and so forth so go

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.460 
build by default and so forth so go
ahead<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.820> maybe<00:00:30.060> check<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.960> change<00:00:31.170> it

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470

can take my word for it and you can
actually<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:41.730> know<00:00:41.760> take<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> couple<00:00:42.360> minutes

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
actually you know take a couple minutes

actually you know take a couple minutes
go<00:00:42.870> through<00:00:43.110> these<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.410> experiment<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.280> try

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
go through these and experiment and try

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.250 
go through these and experiment and try
it<00:00:44.520> out<00:00:44.610> for<00:00:44.670> yourself<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.390> encourage<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.200> to

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
experiment with all these and see how

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.479

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
can see for example under the document

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.029 
can see for example under the document
setting<00:01:00.420> here<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.170> an<00:01:01.260> opportunity<00:01:01.920> to

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
setting here you have an opportunity to

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.219 
setting here you have an opportunity to
change<00:01:02.280> your<00:01:02.399> undo<00:01:02.910> levels<00:01:03.359> that's<00:01:03.840> an

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
change your undo levels that's an

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.070 
change your undo levels that's an
example<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:05.250> typical<00:01:05.900> requirement<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.049> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
example of a typical requirement that a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
example of a typical requirement that a
lot<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.260> people<00:01:07.590> would<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.860> have<00:01:08.040> a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
lot of people would like to have a

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.190 
lot of people would like to have a
higher<00:01:08.400> level<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.909> undo<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.900> they<00:01:10.049> can

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
higher level of undo so they can

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.960 
higher level of undo so they can
actually<00:01:10.350> experiment<00:01:11.040> with<00:01:11.250> some<00:01:11.490> changes

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
actually experiment with some changes

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.399 
actually experiment with some changes
and<00:01:12.150> know<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.420> they<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.630> back<00:01:12.900> out<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.290> them

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
and know that they can back out of them

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.320 
and know that they can back out of them
some<00:01:13.979> people<00:01:14.280> don't<00:01:14.460> worry<00:01:14.820> about<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.180> sort

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
some people don't worry about that sort

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.870 
some people don't worry about that sort
of<00:01:15.420> thing<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.630> we<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.710> set<00:01:16.890> by<00:01:17.100> default<00:01:17.549> to

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
of thing so we have it set by default to

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.999 
of thing so we have it set by default to
10<00:01:18.240> but<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.630> can<00:01:18.780> actually<00:01:18.930> change<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.740> I

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
10 but you can actually change that I

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.390 
10 but you can actually change that I
tend<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.210> set<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.259> up<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.470> as<00:01:22.740> high<00:01:22.890> as<00:01:22.920> 20

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
tend to set that up to as high as 20

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.550 
tend to set that up to as high as 20
personally<00:01:23.939> here<00:01:24.780> we've<00:01:24.900> got<00:01:25.020> an<00:01:25.170> autosave

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
personally here we've got an autosave

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.289 
personally here we've got an autosave
feature<00:01:25.619> for<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> document<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.150> is

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
feature for the document and this is

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.760 
feature for the document and this is
really<00:01:27.570> great<00:01:27.750> because<00:01:27.810> if<00:01:28.259> you're<00:01:28.409> like<00:01:28.530> me

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
you're paranoid about losing a bunch of

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.240 
you're paranoid about losing a bunch of
work<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.229> like<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.409> have<00:01:31.530> my<00:01:31.680> autosave

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250

enabled<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:32.820> every<00:01:33.030> 15<00:01:33.420> minutes<00:01:33.630> or<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.020> it

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
enabled so every 15 minutes or so it

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.380 
enabled so every 15 minutes or so it
saves<00:01:34.560> my<00:01:34.770> document<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.520> me<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.880> here<00:01:36.299> you've

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
got a purge level so how many documents

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.460 
got a purge level so how many documents
deep<00:01:38.549> do<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.880> want<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.570> keep

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
deep do you want that to keep

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.679 
deep do you want that to keep
auto-saving<00:01:41.009> we've<00:01:42.000> got<00:01:42.150> options<00:01:42.509> here<00:01:42.659> for

these are the default languages we can

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.399 
these are the default languages we can
go<00:01:46.890> ahead<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.159> add<00:01:47.369> different<00:01:47.579> ones<00:01:47.939> here

I left mine set to the default but you

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.959 
I left mine set to the default but you
can<00:01:56.040> change<00:01:56.189> yours

hard drive action it could be on a

network it could be on anything but in

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.369 
network it could be on anything but in
this<00:02:32.879> particular<00:02:33.360> case<00:02:33.569> we're<00:02:34.080> just<00:02:34.290> dealing

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
this particular case we're just dealing

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.710 
this particular case we're just dealing

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
with the defaults and again I I like to

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.030 
with the defaults and again I I like to
leave<00:02:36.840> them<00:02:36.989> set<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.349> defaults<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:37.830> just

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
leave them set to the defaults and just

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.680 
leave them set to the defaults and just
get<00:02:38.190> used<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.489> that<00:02:38.549> and<00:02:38.879> I<00:02:39.180> encourage<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.540> to

get used to that and I encourage you to

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.630 
get used to that and I encourage you to
do<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:39.989> at<00:02:40.170> first<00:02:40.200> use<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.160> defaults<00:02:41.580> and

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
do that at first use the defaults and

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.930 
do that at first use the defaults and
then<00:02:41.819> work<00:02:42.000> later<00:02:42.799> into<00:02:43.799> more<00:02:44.370> customized

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
then work later into more customized

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.720 
then work later into more customized
setups<00:02:45.810> here<00:02:46.410> we've<00:02:46.530> got<00:02:46.680> some<00:02:47.040> options<00:02:47.670> for

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
setups here we've got some options for

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.630 
setups here we've got some options for
the<00:02:47.849> script<00:02:48.180> editor<00:02:48.329> where<00:02:48.750> we<00:02:48.930> can<00:02:49.079> in<00:02:49.680> in<00:02:50.310> for

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
the script editor where we can in in for

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.100 
the script editor where we can in in for
example<00:02:50.880> in<00:02:51.060> our<00:02:51.120> scripting<00:02:51.510> editor<00:02:51.599> double

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
example in our scripting editor double

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.960 
example in our scripting editor double
click<00:02:52.319> opens<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.829> action<00:02:53.160> property<00:02:53.610> dialogue

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
click opens the action property dialogue

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.460 
click opens the action property dialogue
so<00:02:54.120> if<00:02:54.180> we<00:02:54.299> have<00:02:54.390> an<00:02:54.510> action<00:02:54.870> there<00:02:55.079> and<00:02:55.290> we

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
so if we have an action there and we

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.530 
so if we have an action there and we
double<00:02:55.769> click<00:02:55.799> on<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:57.060> select<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.510> word

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
double click on it to select a word

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.479 
double click on it to select a word
which<00:02:57.989> people<00:02:58.410> will<00:02:58.560> typically<00:02:58.920> get<00:02:59.129> used<00:02:59.340> to

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489
