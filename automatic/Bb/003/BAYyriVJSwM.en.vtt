the Philippines was really happy then we
moved<00:01:52.730> here<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.090> we<00:01:53.450> really<00:01:53.720> had<00:01:54.140> to<00:01:54.170> start

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
moved here and we really had to start

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.820 
moved here and we really had to start
from<00:01:54.710> scratch<00:01:55.000> I<00:01:56.000> think<00:01:56.510> one<00:01:57.350> of<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.590> things

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
you know the funny thing is I did not

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.990 
you know the funny thing is I did not
realize<00:02:37.070> that<00:02:37.100> you<00:02:37.430> started<00:02:37.790> out<00:02:37.850> in

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
realize that you started out in

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.490 
realize that you started out in
engineering<00:02:38.510> did<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:38.750> actually<00:02:38.990> start<00:02:39.230> out

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
engineering did you actually start out

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.670 
engineering did you actually start out
or<00:02:39.620> did<00:02:39.740> you<00:02:39.860> go<00:02:40.010> just<00:02:40.580> for<00:02:40.730> one<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:42.140> always

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
or did you go just for one I always

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.620 
or did you go just for one I always
wanted<00:02:43.130> to<00:02:43.190> be<00:02:43.370> a<00:02:43.400> doctor<00:02:43.610> growing<00:02:44.210> up<00:02:44.360> ever

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
wanted to be a doctor growing up ever

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.110 
wanted to be a doctor growing up ever
since<00:02:45.050> I<00:02:45.170> was<00:02:45.350> young<00:02:45.590> but<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:46.730> know<00:02:46.850> being

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
since I was young but you know being

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.470 
since I was young but you know being
poor<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:48.260> have<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.800> be<00:02:48.920> practical<00:02:49.550> and<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:50.150> I

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
poor you have to be practical and so I

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.320 
poor you have to be practical and so I
can<00:02:51.230> just<00:02:51.500> say<00:02:51.650> well<00:02:51.890> I'm<00:02:52.010> gonna<00:02:52.250> do<00:02:52.520> biology

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
can just say well I'm gonna do biology

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.350 
can just say well I'm gonna do biology
and<00:02:53.600> if<00:02:53.930> I<00:02:54.110> graduate<00:02:54.770> and<00:02:54.980> in<00:02:55.520> biology<00:02:55.700> what<00:02:56.239> am

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
and if I graduate and in biology what am

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.970 
and if I graduate and in biology what am
I<00:02:56.450> gonna<00:02:56.630> do<00:02:56.900> how<00:02:57.080> am<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:57.230> gonna<00:02:57.350> support<00:02:57.770> my

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
I gonna do how am I gonna support my

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.610 
I gonna do how am I gonna support my
family<00:02:58.270> so<00:02:59.270> I<00:02:59.630> said<00:02:59.900> I'm<00:03:00.140> gonna<00:03:00.350> do

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
family so I said I'm gonna do

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.550 
family so I said I'm gonna do
engineering<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.820> actually<00:03:02.690> I<00:03:02.750> wasn't<00:03:02.959> first

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
engineering and actually I wasn't first

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.890 
engineering and actually I wasn't first
an<00:03:03.800> electrical<00:03:04.430> engineering<00:03:04.910> major<00:03:05.180> at<00:03:05.420> UCSD

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
an electrical engineering major at UCSD

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.010 
an electrical engineering major at UCSD
and<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:07.310> did<00:03:07.580> all<00:03:07.820> of<00:03:07.850> the<00:03:08.090> physics<00:03:08.540> all<00:03:08.810> of

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
and so I did all of the physics all of

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.680 
and so I did all of the physics all of
the<00:03:09.140> matt'll<00:03:09.620> I<00:03:09.739> was<00:03:09.950> one<00:03:10.160> of<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.340> few<00:03:10.760> female

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
the matt'll I was one of the few female

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.140 
the matt'll I was one of the few female
students<00:03:12.470> in<00:03:12.530> engineering<00:03:12.739> at<00:03:13.400> UCSD<00:03:13.850> at<00:03:14.000> the

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
students in engineering at UCSD at the

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.229 
students in engineering at UCSD at the
time<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:15.260> aced<00:03:15.620> them<00:03:15.920> all<00:03:16.130> aced<00:03:16.850> all<00:03:17.030> the

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
time and I aced them all aced all the

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.210 
time and I aced them all aced all the
classes<00:03:17.660> and<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:17.840> said<00:03:18.290> okay<00:03:18.560> after<00:03:18.709> two<00:03:19.010> years

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
classes and I said okay after two years

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.310 
classes and I said okay after two years
of<00:03:19.340> engineering<00:03:19.670> said<00:03:20.060> I<00:03:20.239> think<00:03:20.720> I<00:03:20.810> will<00:03:21.140> have

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
of engineering said I think I will have

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.930 
of engineering said I think I will have
good<00:03:21.620> enough<00:03:21.890> grades<00:03:22.250> that<00:03:22.580> I<00:03:22.640> will

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
good enough grades that I will

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.760 
good enough grades that I will
absolutely<00:03:23.300> get<00:03:23.630> into<00:03:23.900> Medical<00:03:24.290> School

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
absolutely get into Medical School

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.310 
absolutely get into Medical School
so<00:03:24.890> that's<00:03:25.130> when<00:03:25.370> I<00:03:25.400> switch<00:03:25.790> my<00:03:25.820> major<00:03:26.060> okay<00:03:26.840> so

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
so that's when I switch my major okay so

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.130 
so that's when I switch my major okay so
then<00:03:27.500> I<00:03:27.650> switched<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:28.610> know<00:03:28.760> to<00:03:28.820> to<00:03:29.510> to

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
then I switched to you know to to to

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.340 
then I switched to you know to to to
biochemistry<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:32.090> then<00:03:32.450> apply<00:03:32.810> to<00:03:32.870> medical

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
biochemistry and then apply to medical

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.600 
biochemistry and then apply to medical
school<00:03:33.709> but<00:03:33.920> my<00:03:34.070> passion<00:03:34.340> was<00:03:34.820> medicine

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
school but my passion was medicine

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.150 
school but my passion was medicine
again<00:03:35.910> when<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:37.140> know<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:37.290> have<00:03:37.440> to<00:03:37.590> think<00:03:37.860> of

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
again when you know you have to think of

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.720 
again when you know you have to think of
financial<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.780> being<00:03:40.080> practical<00:03:40.710> that<00:03:41.280> I

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
financial and being practical that I

because you have a base you can fall

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
because sometimes it does fade unless

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.340 
because sometimes it does fade unless
you<00:04:19.230> know<00:04:19.320> dr.<00:04:19.620> test<00:04:20.390> and<00:04:21.390> you<00:04:21.840> have<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.079> good
