00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.379
 Welcome to the exercise film 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.509
 multiplication of rational numbers 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:15.639
 in the following we want to talk again 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.640
 look at three exercises from the practice area 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.980
 we start with the task 2 c where it 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.680
 is calculated and round to the second 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.390
 decimal place of course at this 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.580
 make something confusing because we have 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.380
 yes no decimals as you let 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.050
 Never want from the task 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.280
 confuse 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.649
 otherwise was important in the 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.149
 multiplication rational numbers that we 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.909
 of course different signs 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.280
 or right here 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:43.780
 we have minus x plus and we know 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.999
 if we have different signs 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:52.199
 have come again a negative 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:56.289
 Sign out in our case - 138 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.870
 In 1374 at task six it is said 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.300
 just calculated and we see 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.659
 have three factors and can now contact us 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.700
 because of the collota deep or 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:09.130
 associative law simply the 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.140
 Choose the order of multiplication 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.640
 that means we think about how it is 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.600
 most meaningful to each other 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.079
 multiply 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.520
 so it just goes in the head and 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.710
 Of course we have to do it too 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.719
 consider which sign at the end 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.430
 comes out we have here the +6 starts 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:30.189
 again by the plus sign in front of it 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.920
 and we have two negative factor 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:35.130
 12 3 if I have the two together 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:40.329
 multiply it means minus times minus 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:44.409
 - fa - gives plus and if i do that plus 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.939
 with the plus x turn on plus that 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.000
 means our result in any case 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:52.000
 positive I choose now for me as 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.119
 first six times in 12 here 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.869
 66 6 times 2 are 12 and so 72 and 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.710
 though - the plus x - gives - and then 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.869
 multiplied 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:09.050
 accordingly with minus 3 and come on 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.990
 216 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.470
 because task 9b says it completes the 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.650
 many factor that is we ask ourselves 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.770
 which number we multiply by -8 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.510
 to come on 56 one is definitely 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.280
 immediately clear because we have a plus here 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.700
 must our question mark in any case 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.490
 ever - be because - at minus results 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.590
 Finally, plus just on results to 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.610
 we would come through the eight 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.070
 of course, divide 2 56 available 8 and 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.560
 cam then develop accordingly 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.930
 further we have that I here again 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.290
 that means we have here 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:56.600
 just the seven already used - 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:59.630
 eight times seven results is not 56 because 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.540
 you see that was missing the sign 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.600
 said before and that's why it has to 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.790
 logically hot - 7 as here 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.160
 have shown 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.400
 So also I have a positive 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.239
 paying part here through a negative 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.270
 Of course there is a negative one again 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:20.209
 out because if I have both negative - 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.340
 under that i multiply that here 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.550
 it happens I come up accordingly 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.530
 a positive 56 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.030
 I hope the exercises from the exercise site 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.730
 are clear 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.140
 all others are similar to me 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.730
 I wish you much success 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.380
 should still ask 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.739
 please contact the online 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.739
 care, support
