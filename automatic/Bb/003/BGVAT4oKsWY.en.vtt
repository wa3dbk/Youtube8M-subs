00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 Martina actually has somehow 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.850
 times more stamp but of course 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.610
 However, our user says 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.380
 that helmet somehow looks well 77 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.259
 Sorry but the shirt says to the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.210
 eyes hurt 16 likes marcinowski since 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.650
 short tubes but that would have been preferable 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:24.020
 Scholli looks like three numbers 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:24.020
 big and deep but only recently 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.619
 sometimes you just want to annoy 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.269
 Hide things from his environment 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.009
 or there is a problem 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.390
 puts you hands on the eye sees 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.680
 you were nothing you put the things 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.780
 Leon does not hear anything anymore 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.239
 but at least a high one can do something 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.370
 do it with the new comfort 25 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.629
 from bose and welcome to one 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.629
 fresh complexion 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.370
 the qc 25 are next to one 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.500
 optimized design over the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.910
 predecessor a new noise canceling 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.890
 Technology built with the man 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.109
 at least on paper even better 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.520
 annoying ambient noise 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.680
 can filter out and thus you can 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.760
 even better your favorite music full 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.830
 enjoy booming 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.570
 but from the front right out of the box there 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.610
 next to the typical fireplaces but one 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.380
 sturdy transport bag one and a half meters 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.210
 long gold plated jack cable with 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.580
 microphones functional buttons on 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.439
 plane adapter and a battery for 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.210
 the noise canceling function of the seat 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.700
 the headphones are basically good and 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.770
 firm with 200 grams, they are not too 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.960
 heavy and the soft head height together 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.880
 allow with the fluffy earpads 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.420
 also several hours long comfortable 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.549
 carry 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.329
 whether on the way or at home from 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.979
 computer or tv theoretically too 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.380
 easy sport means possible but 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.060
 you just stay fabric respectively 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.009
 where materials used would be me 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.540
 I'm not sure if this will last 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.329
 with all the fluids at all 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.680
 tolerates much more decisive but is 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.890
 actually what about the 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.630
 Sound quality off yes there is a lot 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.159
 to tell in classic mode so 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.750
 without capitalized new canceling 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.399
 the headphones do not sound like and 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.439
 euro trinkets from a first class 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.090
 manufacturer and why the sound is so flat 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.130
 is probably only know the colleagues 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.840
 Bose remedy creates but there 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.000
 for example, in the case of spotify the manual 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.459
 you can now adjust the equalizer 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.319
 the active noise canceling has added 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.970
 To give the impression completely different headphones 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.190
 to have on the rÃ¼ 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.110
 benevolent better clearly defined 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.090
 listen and eat balanced as well 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.010
 at higher volumes are not enough 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.049
 and how does it work within less 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.879
 milliseconds is calculated by bose 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:30.190
 developed chip on the basis of all around 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.709
 attached microphones a so-called 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.230
 sound against sound signal which through 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.569
 180 degrees thrown against report 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.310
 Signals neutralized sounds funny 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.829
 but so should you on the way 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.360
 batteries music player times in the grass 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.829
 do not bother the noise 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.780
 Suppression also works without one 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.579
 connected device and not only 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.560
 practically in the plane to annoying 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:52.720
 grunt out but also too 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.060
 home primarily to be computer or 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.940
 in front of a too loud refrigerator or in the 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.190
 car as a passenger of course okay 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.989
 admittedly for the truly audiophile 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.640
 It is certainly not the most optimal 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.450
 Solution at Rheiner Sound alone 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.650
 through this the whole electronics 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.180
 is falsified 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.099
 but in the end you can say that it 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.840
 This is about hifi sound of the upper 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.150
 class acts for noise canceling 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.549
 you need a triple aaa battery 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.470
 juice after one day in a cut 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.239
 is going to work without noise canceling 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.530
 the headphones also without battery and 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.840
 Of course, then the term depends of course 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.400
 your music player from total 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.950
 can be said that buses mid and 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.569
 quiet comfort 25 an insane reference 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.519
 on the subject of noise canceling 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.470
 has the sound may still like here and there 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.489
 be screwed with this impression 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.799
 of course to a large extent 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.419
 subjective nature is about itself 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.760
 So you do not get to try it 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:41.470
 around but you can definitely verdi one 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.480
 Buy gift or buy headphones 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.190
 would like to shop with a good conscience 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.660
 go and what is your opinion on the subject 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.859
 I can personally find noise canceling 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.660
 very cool write your own 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.400
 Experiences opinion and comments 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.720
 I would be very happy and if he was there 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.069
 we are always thumbs up or 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.750
 check videos of us and is 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.030
 social media platforms and at the end 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.169
 Of course not to forget 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.849
 subscribe and not just one now 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:04.090
 possibility to subscribe but two 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.959
 that means you are in the end card and below 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.310
 the video 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.470
 and if you do that, he gets off 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.000
 us regularly the hottest stuff for 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.580
 theme 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.350
 technology and I want to see if it 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.330
 not only annoying with the headphones 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.620
 noises but also annoying votes 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.620
 can filter out of friends
