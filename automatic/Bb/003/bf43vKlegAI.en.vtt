you to pick a specific element so you
see<00:01:00.859> you<00:01:00.890> got<00:01:01.219> fire<00:01:01.550> water<00:01:02.030> earth<00:01:02.269> Thunder

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
see you got fire water earth Thunder

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.920 
see you got fire water earth Thunder
light<00:01:03.530> dark<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:04.309> then<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:05.030> mix<00:01:05.300> up<00:01:05.540> here<00:01:05.750> at

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
light dark and then the mix up here at

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.090 
light dark and then the mix up here at
the<00:01:06.050> bottom<00:01:06.230> of<00:01:06.500> all<00:01:06.650> of<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.890> elements<00:01:07.120> so<00:01:08.120> um

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
the bottom of all of the elements so um

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.890 
the bottom of all of the elements so um
whatever<00:01:10.100> unit<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:10.940> are<00:01:10.970> trying<00:01:11.330> to<00:01:11.420> level<00:01:11.810> up

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
whatever unit you are trying to level up

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.450 
whatever unit you are trying to level up
at<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.200> time<00:01:12.410> it<00:01:12.680> would<00:01:12.740> be<00:01:12.800> very<00:01:13.250> beneficial

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
at the time it would be very beneficial

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.420 
at the time it would be very beneficial
to<00:01:14.000> go<00:01:14.270> into<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:15.110> metal<00:01:15.350> parade<00:01:15.770> of<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.100> same

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
to go into the metal parade of the same

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.300 
to go into the metal parade of the same
element<00:01:16.970> of<00:01:17.060> that<00:01:17.210> unit<00:01:17.600> and<00:01:17.780> then<00:01:18.380> just<00:01:18.860> grind

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
element of that unit and then just grind

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.220 
element of that unit and then just grind
it<00:01:19.550> real<00:01:19.880> hard<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:20.390> try<00:01:20.510> to<00:01:20.570> get<00:01:20.810> as<00:01:20.900> many<00:01:21.080> as

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
it real hard and try to get as many as

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.800 
it real hard and try to get as many as
you<00:01:21.380> can<00:01:21.620> and<00:01:22.190> then<00:01:22.760> be<00:01:23.120> able<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.420> fuse<00:01:23.630> the

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
you can and then be able to fuse the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.140 
you can and then be able to fuse the
same<00:01:24.050> element<00:01:24.560> and<00:01:24.650> get<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.980> point<00:01:25.910> boost

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
same element and get the point boost

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.870 
same element and get the point boost
because<00:01:26.870> you<00:01:27.110> do<00:01:27.290> get<00:01:27.530> a<00:01:27.770> point<00:01:28.190> boost<00:01:28.460> if<00:01:28.730> you

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
because you do get a point boost if you

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.390 
because you do get a point boost if you
fuse<00:01:29.300> the<00:01:29.480> same<00:01:29.750> element<00:01:30.260> of<00:01:30.560> metal<00:01:31.070> units

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
fuse the same element of metal units

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.850 
fuse the same element of metal units
into<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.450> unit<00:01:32.870> if<00:01:33.080> they<00:01:33.290> both<00:01:33.500> have<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:33.830> same

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
into the unit if they both have the same

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.650 
into the unit if they both have the same
element<00:01:34.490> you<00:01:34.580> get<00:01:34.700> a<00:01:34.730> point<00:01:35.000> boost<00:01:35.270> for<00:01:35.480> that

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
element you get a point boost for that

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.820 
element you get a point boost for that
so<00:01:36.440> I'm<00:01:36.680> smart<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.460> do<00:01:37.610> that<00:01:37.640> I<00:01:38.650> personally<00:01:39.650> at

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
so I'm smart to do that I personally at

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.310 
so I'm smart to do that I personally at
the<00:01:40.070> moment<00:01:40.250> I'm<00:01:40.550> doing<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.240> dark<00:01:41.600> metal

them so you can get these three stars
that<00:02:04.970> have<00:02:05.090> been<00:02:05.270> at<00:02:05.360> least

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
that have been at least

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.499 
that have been at least
so<00:02:07.469> that's<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.399> main<00:02:08.580> reason<00:02:08.610> I'm<00:02:09.000> going<00:02:09.300> in

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
so that's the main reason I'm going in

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.369 
so that's the main reason I'm going in
here<00:02:09.989> into<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.530> dark<00:02:10.769> metal<00:02:10.979> free<00:02:12.379> so

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
here into the dark metal free so

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:15.350 
here into the dark metal free so
hopefully<00:02:13.769> I<00:02:13.830> can<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.730> order<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.060> evolve

hopefully I can you in order to evolve

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.390 
hopefully I can you in order to evolve
it<00:02:15.569> you<00:02:15.720> need<00:02:15.959> um<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:17.420> dark<00:02:18.420> or<00:02:18.989> metal<00:02:19.769> got<00:02:20.010> a
