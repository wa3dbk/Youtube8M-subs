I<00:03:19.489> can't<00:03:19.819> judge<00:03:20.090> him<00:03:20.329> because<00:03:20.780> I'm<00:03:20.930> obviously

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
I can't judge him because I'm obviously

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.729 
I can't judge him because I'm obviously
I<00:03:22.120> haven't<00:03:23.120> seen<00:03:23.389> his<00:03:23.629> work<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:24.139> could<00:03:24.590> be

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
I haven't seen his work I could be

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.110 
I haven't seen his work I could be
anywhere<00:03:25.040> I<00:03:25.489> mean<00:03:25.939> it's<00:03:26.150> much<00:03:26.540> older<00:03:26.720> than<00:03:27.019> and

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
anywhere I mean it's much older than and

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.740 
anywhere I mean it's much older than and
sounder<00:03:29.120> ones<00:03:29.349> some<00:03:30.349> of<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.590> new<00:03:31.129> ones<00:03:31.750> but

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
sounder ones some of the new ones but

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.199 
sounder ones some of the new ones but
all<00:03:33.019> of<00:03:33.169> the<00:03:33.290> newer<00:03:33.470> ones<00:03:34.269> but<00:03:35.269> I<00:03:35.540> think<00:03:37.209> the

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
all of the newer ones but I think the

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.530 
all of the newer ones but I think the
older<00:03:38.510> you<00:03:38.540> get<00:03:38.900> I<00:03:39.230> think<00:03:43.000> patient<00:03:44.000> it's<00:03:44.180> me<00:03:44.359> oh

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
I think it's because I'm going to make a

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.990 
I think it's because I'm going to make a
nice<00:03:49.669> Matt<00:03:50.150> Smith<00:03:50.480> it's<00:03:51.639> exactly<00:03:52.639> how<00:03:52.879> I
