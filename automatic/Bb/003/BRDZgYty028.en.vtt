your<00:01:16.970> spool<00:01:20.770> this<00:01:21.770> part<00:01:22.070> moves<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.399> lot<00:01:22.580> you

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
your spool this part moves a lot you

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.499 
your spool this part moves a lot you
want<00:01:23.299> to<00:01:23.390> make<00:01:23.509> sure<00:01:23.539> it's<00:01:23.750> well<00:01:23.899> lubricated

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
want to make sure it's well lubricated

want to make sure it's well lubricated
after<00:01:26.509> you've<00:01:26.630> done<00:01:26.750> that<00:01:27.009> take<00:01:28.009> the<00:01:28.610> real

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
after you've done that take the real

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.210 
after you've done that take the real
body<00:01:29.060> again<00:01:29.479> and<00:01:29.740> if<00:01:30.740> you<00:01:30.830> look<00:01:31.039> in<00:01:31.190> here

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
body again and if you look in here

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.940 
body again and if you look in here
you'll<00:01:31.640> see<00:01:31.880> there's<00:01:32.299> a<00:01:32.360> hole<00:01:32.570> you<00:01:33.560> also<00:01:33.710> want

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
you'll see there's a hole you also want

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.730 
you'll see there's a hole you also want
to<00:01:33.979> boil<00:01:34.159> up<00:01:34.340> that<00:01:34.520> hole<00:01:34.759> that<00:01:35.560> pivot<00:01:36.560> goes

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
to boil up that hole that pivot goes

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.469 
to boil up that hole that pivot goes
into<00:01:36.979> that<00:01:37.100> hole<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:39.580> you<00:01:40.580> also<00:01:41.030> want<00:01:41.300> to<00:01:41.330> make

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
into that hole and you also want to make

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.320 
into that hole and you also want to make
sure<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.720> hole<00:01:41.869> is<00:01:41.899> well<00:01:42.200> lubricated<00:01:42.380> too

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
sure the hole is well lubricated too

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.169 
sure the hole is well lubricated too
after<00:01:44.330> you've<00:01:44.600> done<00:01:44.690> that<00:01:44.750> I<00:01:45.369> can<00:01:46.369> feel<00:01:46.940> free

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
after you've done that I can feel free

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.059 
after you've done that I can feel free
to<00:01:47.240> grease<00:01:47.509> up<00:01:47.690> the<00:01:47.720> insides<00:01:48.170> of<00:01:48.289> here<00:01:48.500> but

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
to grease up the insides of here but

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:50.859 
to grease up the insides of here but
that's<00:01:49.369> not<00:01:49.640> really<00:01:49.850> a<00:01:49.880> necessary<00:01:50.149> thing<00:01:50.600> to

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
that's not really a necessary thing to

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.749 
that's not really a necessary thing to
do<00:01:51.020> there<00:01:51.530> is<00:01:51.679> some<00:01:51.920> friction<00:01:52.340> in<00:01:52.399> there<00:01:52.549> that

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
do there is some friction in there that

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.550 
do there is some friction in there that
grease<00:01:52.970> might<00:01:53.210> help<00:01:53.479> take<00:01:54.049> it<00:01:54.170> easy<00:01:54.319> but

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
grease might help take it easy but

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.460 
grease might help take it easy but
usually<00:01:54.979> I<00:01:55.009> just<00:01:55.069> use<00:01:55.280> grease<00:01:55.610> for<00:01:55.819> my<00:01:55.909> gears

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
usually I just use grease for my gears

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.109 
usually I just use grease for my gears
so<00:01:57.470> take<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.810> pivot<00:01:59.810> slide<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.770> back<00:02:00.890> in<00:02:01.119> and

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
so take the pivot slide it back in and

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.149 
so take the pivot slide it back in and
now<00:02:02.509> you<00:02:02.569> can<00:02:02.750> push<00:02:02.929> the<00:02:03.080> spool<00:02:03.319> back<00:02:03.530> any<00:02:03.890> real

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
now you can push the spool back any real

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.960 
now you can push the spool back any real
we're<00:02:04.459> done<00:02:04.610> with<00:02:04.759> that<00:02:06.700> it's<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.729> little

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
we're done with that it's a little

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.850 
we're done with that it's a little
easier<00:02:08.360> to<00:02:08.509> do<00:02:08.660> this<00:02:08.810> when<00:02:09.020> there's<00:02:09.229> no<00:02:09.619> line

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
easier to do this when there's no line

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.140 
easier to do this when there's no line
on<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.160> spool<00:02:10.399> otherwise<00:02:10.700> your<00:02:10.910> client

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
on the spool otherwise your client

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.520 
on the spool otherwise your client
doesn't<00:02:11.360> beat<00:02:11.450> off<00:02:11.629> to<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.840> side<00:02:12.050> like<00:02:12.080> mine

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
doesn't beat off to the side like mine

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.430 
doesn't beat off to the side like mine
just<00:02:12.680> did<00:02:13.000> if<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.090> find<00:02:14.330> that<00:02:14.510> it's<00:02:15.200> not

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
just did if you find that it's not

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.320 
just did if you find that it's not
pushing<00:02:15.680> in<00:02:15.950> all<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.190> way<00:02:16.340> you'll<00:02:17.090> want<00:02:17.270> to

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
pushing in all the way you'll want to

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.580 
pushing in all the way you'll want to
loosen<00:02:17.510> off<00:02:17.900> your<00:02:18.739> spool<00:02:19.040> tension<00:02:19.519> knob<00:02:19.790> here

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
loosen off your spool tension knob here

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.690 
loosen off your spool tension knob here
that<00:02:21.590> will<00:02:21.739> allow<00:02:21.890> this<00:02:22.069> to<00:02:22.220> slide<00:02:22.459> in<00:02:22.640> a

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
that will allow this to slide in a

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.460 
that will allow this to slide in a
little<00:02:22.730> further<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.510> it'll<00:02:23.900> make<00:02:23.989> it<00:02:24.140> easier

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
little further and it'll make it easier

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.589 
little further and it'll make it easier
for<00:02:24.709> you<00:02:24.950> get<00:02:25.099> you<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:25.700> get<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:25.940> side<00:02:26.150> plating

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
for you get you to get the side plating

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.589 
for you get you to get the side plating
back<00:02:26.750> on<00:02:27.019> but<00:02:27.800> before<00:02:28.099> you<00:02:28.190> do<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.519> take<00:02:29.450> your

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
back on but before you do that take your

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.180 
back on but before you do that take your
oil<00:02:29.629> again<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.370> oil<00:02:31.370> up<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:32.209> inside<00:02:32.780> of<00:02:33.260> the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
oil again and oil up the inside of the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.800 
oil again and oil up the inside of the
brakes<00:02:34.430> here<00:02:37.030> there's<00:02:38.030> a<00:02:38.090> lot<00:02:38.239> of<00:02:38.360> friction<00:02:38.510> in

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
brakes here there's a lot of friction in

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.180 
brakes here there's a lot of friction in
there<00:02:38.989> I'm<00:02:39.470> gonna<00:02:39.590> make<00:02:39.769> sure<00:02:39.890> it's<00:02:40.010> well

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
there I'm gonna make sure it's well

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.860 
there I'm gonna make sure it's well
lubricated<00:02:43.180> then<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.330> can<00:02:44.450> put<00:02:44.569> your<00:02:44.690> side

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
lubricated then you can put your side

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.979 
lubricated then you can put your side
plate<00:02:45.110> back<00:02:45.319> on<00:02:47.290> you<00:02:48.290> can<00:02:48.319> figure<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:48.709> out

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
plate back on you can figure it out

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.119 
plate back on you can figure it out
there<00:02:50.989> we<00:02:51.200> go<00:02:53.260> now<00:02:54.260> on<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.800> gears

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
there we go now on to the gears

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:01.270 
there we go now on to the gears
increasing<00:02:58.180> so<00:02:59.180> with<00:02:59.989> a<00:03:00.019> lot<00:03:00.230> of<00:03:00.260> reels<00:03:00.620> you'll

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
increasing so with a lot of reels you'll

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.949 
increasing so with a lot of reels you'll
have<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.610> take<00:03:01.790> off<00:03:01.940> this<00:03:02.180> side<00:03:02.450> plate<00:03:02.720> to<00:03:02.840> get

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
have to take off this side plate to get

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.610 
have to take off this side plate to get
to<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.200> gears<00:03:03.500> but<00:03:03.830> with<00:03:03.980> some<00:03:04.250> like<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.940> ORA

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
to the gears but with some like the ORA

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.770 
to the gears but with some like the ORA
you<00:03:06.620> can<00:03:06.950> actually<00:03:07.489> just<00:03:07.849> access<00:03:08.599> them

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
you can actually just access them

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.050 
you can actually just access them
through<00:03:08.810> this<00:03:09.080> compartment<00:03:09.680> here<00:03:09.920> so<00:03:10.849> if<00:03:10.969> you

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
through this compartment here so if you

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.129 
through this compartment here so if you
look<00:03:11.269> right<00:03:11.510> in<00:03:11.689> here

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:12.139 
look right in here

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.790 
look right in here
there's<00:03:12.799> a<00:03:12.889> little<00:03:13.189> screw<00:03:14.079> with

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
there's a little screw with

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.730 
there's a little screw with
a<00:03:15.860> little<00:03:16.760> lid<00:03:16.910> right<00:03:17.120> there<00:03:17.590> so<00:03:18.590> if<00:03:18.650> you

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
a little lid right there so if you

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.390 
a little lid right there so if you
loosen<00:03:19.100> off<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.460> screw<00:03:20.080> you<00:03:21.080> can<00:03:21.230> actually

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.750 

open<00:03:25.400> that<00:03:25.430> lid<00:03:26.830> when<00:03:27.830> you<00:03:27.920> open<00:03:28.220> up<00:03:28.280> that<00:03:28.340> lid

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
open that lid when you open up that lid

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.450 
open that lid when you open up that lid
and<00:03:29.380> look<00:03:30.380> inside<00:03:30.740> there<00:03:31.100> you<00:03:32.030> can<00:03:32.180> see<00:03:32.480> that

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
and look inside there you can see that

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.380 
and look inside there you can see that
there<00:03:34.460> the<00:03:35.000> gears<00:03:35.360> are<00:03:35.690> right<00:03:35.900> there<00:03:36.170> so<00:03:37.390> the

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
there the gears are right there so the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.960 
there the gears are right there so the
handle<00:03:38.720> gear<00:03:38.960> is<00:03:39.050> there<00:03:39.610> you<00:03:40.610> want<00:03:40.790> to<00:03:40.850> put<00:03:40.940> a

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
handle gear is there you want to put a

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.640 
handle gear is there you want to put a
little<00:03:41.210> dab<00:03:41.390> of<00:03:41.420> grease<00:03:41.660> in<00:03:41.930> there<00:03:42.080> give<00:03:42.470> it<00:03:42.560> a

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
little dab of grease in there give it a

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.460 
little dab of grease in there give it a
spin<00:03:43.210> maybe<00:03:44.210> give<00:03:44.540> it<00:03:44.570> another<00:03:44.810> little<00:03:45.110> dab<00:03:45.260> of

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
spin maybe give it another little dab of

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:54.910 
spin maybe give it another little dab of
grease<00:03:45.560> and<00:03:47.020> then<00:03:48.020> spin<00:03:48.350> it<00:03:48.470> again<00:03:53.770> after<00:03:54.770> that

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
grease and then spin it again after that

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.070 
grease and then spin it again after that
close<00:03:55.280> a<00:03:55.340> compartment<00:03:55.970> there's<00:03:56.690> one<00:03:56.900> more

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
close a compartment there's one more

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.260 
close a compartment there's one more
step<00:03:57.320> I<00:03:57.500> like<00:03:57.530> to<00:03:57.800> do<00:03:57.920> and<00:03:58.220> that's<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:59.090> worm

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
step I like to do and that's the worm

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.510 
step I like to do and that's the worm
here<00:03:59.980> so<00:04:00.980> if<00:04:01.070> you<00:04:01.190> look<00:04:01.430> down<00:04:02.210> below<00:04:02.740> here<00:04:03.740> this

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
here so if you look down below here this

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.040 
here so if you look down below here this
is<00:04:04.670> actually<00:04:05.060> hard<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:05.330> get<00:04:05.450> to<00:04:05.600> on<00:04:05.720> this<00:04:05.840> reel

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
is actually hard to get to on this reel

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.890 
is actually hard to get to on this reel
because<00:04:06.200> of<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.500> faceplate<00:04:07.300> but<00:04:08.300> you<00:04:08.720> can

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
because of the faceplate but you can

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.300 
because of the faceplate but you can
just<00:04:09.170> reach<00:04:09.800> through<00:04:10.130> there<00:04:10.430> right<00:04:12.310> below

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
just reach through there right below

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.580 
just reach through there right below
your<00:04:13.610> line<00:04:13.880> guide<00:04:14.240> down<00:04:15.050> on<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.260> bottom

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
your line guide down on the bottom

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.070 
your line guide down on the bottom
you'll<00:04:15.740> see<00:04:15.800> a<00:04:15.980> worm<00:04:16.880> gear<00:04:16.910> that<00:04:17.630> crisscross

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:18.080 
you'll see a worm gear that crisscross

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.710 
you'll see a worm gear that crisscross
is<00:04:18.320> back<00:04:18.530> and<00:04:18.739> forth<00:04:19.090> just<00:04:20.090> put<00:04:20.239> a<00:04:20.270> little<00:04:20.419> dab

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
is back and forth just put a little dab

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:27.159 
is back and forth just put a little dab
on<00:04:21.020> that<00:04:21.470> gear<00:04:25.480> you<00:04:26.480> don't<00:04:26.720> want<00:04:26.930> to<00:04:27.020> use

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
on that gear you don't want to use

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.470 
on that gear you don't want to use
grease<00:04:27.500> on<00:04:27.710> this<00:04:27.860> gear<00:04:28.130> if<00:04:28.700> you<00:04:28.880> put<00:04:29.060> grease<00:04:29.330> on

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
grease on this gear if you put grease on

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.240 
grease on this gear if you put grease on
the<00:04:29.600> gear<00:04:29.870> here<00:04:30.169> it's<00:04:30.350> gonna<00:04:30.500> gum<00:04:30.800> it<00:04:30.919> up<00:04:31.070> and

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
the gear here it's gonna gum it up and

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.310 
the gear here it's gonna gum it up and
it's<00:04:31.340> going<00:04:31.460> to<00:04:31.520> slow<00:04:31.760> down<00:04:31.910> your<00:04:32.090> reel<00:04:32.320> use

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
it's going to slow down your reel use

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.880 
it's going to slow down your reel use
oil<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:33.830> it'll<00:04:34.610> speed<00:04:34.850> it<00:04:34.970> up<00:04:37.360> after<00:04:38.360> that

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
oil and it'll speed it up after that

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.940 
oil and it'll speed it up after that
you're<00:04:39.890> done<00:04:39.919> ready<00:04:40.640> to<00:04:40.730> fish
