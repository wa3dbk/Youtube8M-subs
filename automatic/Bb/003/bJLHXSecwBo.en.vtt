00:00:59.219 --> 00:00:59.229 
of her information about her copic

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:01.020 
of her information about her copic
markers<00:00:59.589> and<00:00:59.889> color<00:01:00.069> combinations<00:01:00.819> and

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
markers and color combinations and

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.119 
markers and color combinations and
things<00:01:01.179> like<00:01:01.329> that<00:01:01.389> since<00:01:02.199> I<00:01:02.319> have<00:01:02.589> so<00:01:02.949> many

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
things like that since I have so many

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.600 
things like that since I have so many
sets<00:01:03.579> of<00:01:03.760> markers<00:01:04.239> it's<00:01:04.540> hard<00:01:04.839> for<00:01:04.900> me<00:01:05.080> to<00:01:05.610> keep

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
sets of markers it's hard for me to keep

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.060 
sets of markers it's hard for me to keep
track<00:01:06.790> of<00:01:06.850> what<00:01:07.210> I<00:01:07.240> have<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:08.020> what<00:01:08.229> colors<00:01:08.620> and

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
track of what I have and what colors and

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.890 
track of what I have and what colors and
then<00:01:09.280> also<00:01:09.490> what<00:01:10.030> colors<00:01:10.330> go<00:01:10.450> good<00:01:10.750> together

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
then also what colors go good together

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.170 
then also what colors go good together
so<00:01:11.620> I<00:01:11.650> need<00:01:12.100> something<00:01:12.490> like<00:01:12.610> this<00:01:12.760> to<00:01:12.940> kind<00:01:13.060> of

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
so I need something like this to kind of

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.160 
so I need something like this to kind of
keep<00:01:13.330> me<00:01:13.450> organized<00:01:13.960> and<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:14.890> keep<00:01:15.310> me<00:01:16.170> from

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
keep me organized and to keep me from

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.170 
keep me organized and to keep me from

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
obviously from buying duplicates and

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.820 
obviously from buying duplicates and
then<00:01:19.510> also<00:01:20.040> from<00:01:21.690> you<00:01:22.690> know<00:01:22.840> buying<00:01:23.380> things

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.240 
then i just wrote that on the top here
marvi<00:04:50.300> alcohol<00:04:50.720> markers<00:04:51.050> and<00:04:51.349> then<00:04:51.889> I've<00:04:52.220> got

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
marvi alcohol markers and then I've got

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.700 
marvi alcohol markers and then I've got
one<00:04:52.729> of<00:04:52.849> my<00:04:52.970> TDI<00:04:53.300> tags<00:04:53.630> here<00:04:53.900> and<00:04:54.199> it's

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
one of my TDI tags here and it's

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.860 
one of my TDI tags here and it's
actually<00:04:54.919> to<00:04:55.639> show<00:04:55.849> what<00:04:56.120> i<00:04:56.150> have<00:04:56.389> on<00:04:56.419> the<00:04:56.659> back

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
actually to show what i have on the back

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.110 
actually to show what i have on the back
page<00:04:57.169> here<00:04:57.500> and<00:04:57.650> I<00:04:58.099> just<00:04:58.370> have<00:04:58.550> miscellaneous

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
page here and I just have miscellaneous

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.330 
page here and I just have miscellaneous
alcohol<00:04:59.569> markers<00:04:59.930> written<00:05:00.710> on<00:05:00.800> the<00:05:00.889> back<00:05:01.039> and

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
alcohol markers written on the back and

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.339 
alcohol markers written on the back and
then<00:05:01.819> I<00:05:01.849> made<00:05:02.120> my<00:05:02.270> own<00:05:02.300> color<00:05:02.659> chart<00:05:02.990> for<00:05:03.199> those

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:03.349 
then I made my own color chart for those

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:05.620 
then I made my own color chart for those
so<00:05:03.919> these<00:05:04.069> are<00:05:04.130> like<00:05:04.460> my<00:05:04.610> big<00:05:04.819> markets<00:05:05.330> and

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
so these are like my big markets and

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.629 
so these are like my big markets and
then<00:05:05.810> also<00:05:06.020> my<00:05:06.380> touch<00:05:06.590> twin<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.250> then<00:05:07.340> I<00:05:07.370> have

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
then also my touch twin and then I have

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:10.749 
then also my touch twin and then I have
just<00:05:07.970> a<00:05:08.120> few<00:05:08.150> prismacolors<00:05:09.110> that<00:05:10.069> I<00:05:10.099> used<00:05:10.460> and

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:10.759 
just a few prismacolors that I used and

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.550 
just a few prismacolors that I used and
then<00:05:11.389> that's<00:05:11.599> all<00:05:11.719> I<00:05:11.750> have<00:05:11.990> in<00:05:12.110> here<00:05:12.139> right<00:05:12.409> now

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
then that's all I have in here right now

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.180 
then that's all I have in here right now
but<00:05:12.740> i<00:05:12.800> thought<00:05:13.039> that<00:05:13.219> i<00:05:13.280> would<00:05:13.400> put<00:05:13.819> like<00:05:14.060> um

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
but i thought that i would put like um

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.980 
but i thought that i would put like um
different<00:05:16.190> color<00:05:16.729> combinations<00:05:17.090> and<00:05:17.840> things

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
different color combinations and things

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.300 
different color combinations and things
like<00:05:18.139> that<00:05:18.199> i<00:05:18.349> went<00:05:18.530> ahead<00:05:18.620> and<00:05:18.770> i<00:05:18.860> glued<00:05:19.099> some

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
like that i went ahead and i glued some

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.430 
like that i went ahead and i glued some
of<00:05:19.430> these<00:05:19.490> pages<00:05:19.729> together<00:05:20.120> but<00:05:21.020> i<00:05:21.050> noticed

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
of these pages together but i noticed

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.860 
of these pages together but i noticed
that<00:05:21.500> my<00:05:21.680> gluestick<00:05:21.949> doesn't<00:05:22.610> really<00:05:22.870> doesn't

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
that my gluestick doesn't really doesn't

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.999 
that my gluestick doesn't really doesn't
hold<00:05:23.990> them<00:05:24.169> too<00:05:24.319> well<00:05:24.469> I<00:05:24.530> mean<00:05:24.710> it's<00:05:24.860> good

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:25.009 
hold them too well I mean it's good

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:26.409 
hold them too well I mean it's good
enough<00:05:25.219> but<00:05:25.520> I<00:05:25.759> mean<00:05:25.880> it<00:05:25.940> doesn't<00:05:26.180> hold<00:05:26.300> the

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
enough but I mean it doesn't hold the

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.270 
enough but I mean it doesn't hold the
pages<00:05:26.810> together<00:05:26.990> too<00:05:27.380> well<00:05:27.560> you<00:05:27.889> could<00:05:28.039> kill

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
pages together too well you could kill

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.920 
pages together too well you could kill
them<00:05:28.370> right<00:05:28.460> apart<00:05:28.669> but<00:05:29.060> that's<00:05:29.270> okay<00:05:29.539> too<00:05:29.599> I

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
them right apart but that's okay too I

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.779 
them right apart but that's okay too I
can<00:05:30.770> always<00:05:30.889> use<00:05:31.130> something<00:05:31.460> that's<00:05:31.490> a<00:05:31.699> little

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
can always use something that's a little

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.550 
can always use something that's a little
bit<00:05:31.940> stronger<00:05:32.240> later<00:05:32.569> and<00:05:32.840> I<00:05:33.110> haven't<00:05:33.380> done

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
bit stronger later and I haven't done

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.809 
bit stronger later and I haven't done
the<00:05:33.740> back<00:05:33.889> cover<00:05:34.099> yet<00:05:34.340> because<00:05:34.639> I<00:05:34.759> figured

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:34.819 
the back cover yet because I figured

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:36.640 
the back cover yet because I figured
well<00:05:35.180> that'll<00:05:35.449> come<00:05:35.630> in<00:05:35.659> time<00:05:35.779> when<00:05:36.380> I<00:05:36.409> had<00:05:36.620> a

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
well that'll come in time when I had a

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.170 
well that'll come in time when I had a
