00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
some of it it's just that at the time

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.310 
some of it it's just that at the time
when<00:01:53.970> movers<00:01:54.210> doing<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.750> can't<00:01:55.170> actually

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
when movers doing it I can't actually

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.560 
when movers doing it I can't actually
remember<00:01:55.530> because<00:01:56.040> we<00:01:56.159> was<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.790> lot<00:01:57.420> was

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570

remember because we was like a lot was
going<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.829> think<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.610> was<00:01:59.790> that<00:01:59.820> blue<00:02:00.540> this

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
going on I think it was that blue this

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.889 
going on I think it was that blue this
is<00:02:01.259> before<00:02:01.409> everyone<00:02:02.070> does<00:02:02.340> everything<00:02:02.899> blew

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
is before everyone does everything blew

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.139 
is before everyone does everything blew
it<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.140> always<00:02:04.469> move<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.920> blue<00:02:05.189> one<00:02:05.369> first<00:02:05.850> so

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
it you always move the blue one first so

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.010 
it you always move the blue one first so
blue<00:02:06.659> 20<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.530> everyone<00:02:08.489> else<00:02:08.660> moves<00:02:09.660> there's

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
blue 20 and everyone else moves there's

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.290 
blue 20 and everyone else moves there's
two<00:02:10.470> before<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:10.950> original<00:02:11.489> number

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
two before the original number

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.670 
two before the original number
so<00:02:12.990> if<00:02:13.610> /<00:02:14.610> purple<00:02:15.120> with<00:02:15.390> six<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:16.410> would<00:02:16.560> good

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
so if / purple with six it would good

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.450 
so if / purple with six it would good
for<00:02:17.070> if<00:02:17.460> your<00:02:17.730> loads<00:02:17.910> too<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.510> will<00:02:18.690> go<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.930> 0<00:02:19.650> if

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
for if your loads too it will go to 0 if

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.040 
for if your loads too it will go to 0 if
orange<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.270> 7<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.900> was<00:02:22.050> good<00:02:22.260> five<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:24.780> that's

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
orange is 7 it was good five and that's

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.770 
orange is 7 it was good five and that's
it<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.380> then<00:02:25.680> what<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.160> do<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:27.060> each<00:02:27.390> of

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
it and then what you do is you each of

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.000 
it and then what you do is you each of
you<00:02:27.900> starting<00:02:28.290> from<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.470> bottom<00:02:28.590> would<00:02:28.830> move

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
you starting from the bottom would move

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.320 
you starting from the bottom would move
up<00:02:29.220> until<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.820> got<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.030> your<00:02:30.180> original<00:02:30.330> number

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
up until you got to your original number

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.170 
up until you got to your original number
also<00:02:33.330> blue<00:02:33.870> controls<00:02:34.650> most<00:02:35.490> of<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.820> dials

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
also blue controls most of the dials

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.480 
also blue controls most of the dials
blue<00:02:36.930> controls<00:02:37.770> purple<00:02:38.700> orange<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:40.050> yellow<00:02:40.490> I

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
blue controls purple orange and yellow I

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.880 
blue controls purple orange and yellow I
think<00:02:41.930> I'm<00:02:42.930> not<00:02:43.110> actually<00:02:43.230> sure<00:02:43.410> about<00:02:43.710> that

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
think I'm not actually sure about that

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.700 
think I'm not actually sure about that
but<00:02:44.490> yeah<00:02:44.790> so<00:02:45.780> we<00:02:46.110> managed<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.410> go<00:02:46.560> with<00:02:46.650> the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
but yeah so we managed to go with the

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.340 
but yeah so we managed to go with the
dials<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.310> then<00:02:48.150> we<00:02:48.270> change<00:02:48.450> them<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.900> try<00:02:49.230> and

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
dials and then we change them to try and

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.610 
dials and then we change them to try and
change<00:02:49.500> my<00:02:49.800> purple<00:02:50.300> 129<00:02:51.300> to<00:02:51.780> see<00:02:51.960> if<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.350> would

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
change my purple 129 to see if it would

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.080 
change my purple 129 to see if it would
like<00:02:53.190> something<00:02:53.400> else<00:02:53.640> would<00:02:53.760> happen<00:02:53.910> but

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
like something else would happen but

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.720 
like something else would happen but
then<00:02:54.450> we<00:02:55.290> kind<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.590> got<00:02:55.710> confused<00:02:56.130> about<00:02:56.280> what

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
then we kind of got confused about what

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.210 
then we kind of got confused about what
Delta<00:02:57.090> move<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.720> how<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.320> do<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.770> and<00:02:58.890> how<00:02:59.160> to

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
Delta move and how to do it and how to

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.450 
Delta move and how to do it and how to
get<00:02:59.400> our<00:02:59.550> heads<00:02:59.730> around<00:02:59.820> it<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.450> we<00:03:00.780> just<00:03:01.460> kind

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
get our heads around it so we just kind

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:09.350 
get our heads around it so we just kind
of<00:03:02.520> failed<00:03:02.820> after<00:03:03.240> this<00:03:04.280> yeah<00:03:06.800> is<00:03:07.940> if<00:03:08.940> anyone

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
of failed after this yeah is if anyone

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.450 
of failed after this yeah is if anyone
has<00:03:09.510> got<00:03:09.720> any<00:03:10.020> theories<00:03:10.500> whatsoever<00:03:11.190> because

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
has got any theories whatsoever because

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.880 
has got any theories whatsoever because
this<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:11.850> this<00:03:12.420> is<00:03:12.570> co-op<00:03:13.020> mode<00:03:13.290> by<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.710> way

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
this is this is co-op mode by the way

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.460 
this is this is co-op mode by the way
not<00:03:14.250> solo<00:03:14.760> solo<00:03:15.630> mode<00:03:15.810> you<00:03:15.990> pull<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.290> leaves

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
not solo solo mode you pull the leaves

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.800 
not solo solo mode you pull the leaves
in<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.709> shin<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.190> ship<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.670> get<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.600> green

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
in the shin the ship to get the green

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.580 
in the shin the ship to get the green
light<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.550> Morse<00:03:20.760> code<00:03:21.060> thing<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.840> co-op

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
light and the Morse code thing a co-op

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.760 
light and the Morse code thing a co-op
mode<00:03:22.890> is<00:03:23.870> definitely<00:03:24.870> totally<00:03:25.260> different<00:03:25.620> and

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
mode is definitely totally different and

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.070 
mode is definitely totally different and
it's<00:03:25.890> nothing<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.370> do<00:03:26.580> with<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.820> cave<00:03:27.060> by<00:03:27.420> the

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
it's nothing to do with the cave by the

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.740 
it's nothing to do with the cave by the
way<00:03:28.290> there's<00:03:28.830> not<00:03:29.370> there<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.970> cave<00:03:30.239> is<00:03:30.510> I've

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
way there's not there the cave is I've

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.699 
way there's not there the cave is I've
there's<00:03:31.350> like<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.500> hoax<00:03:33.110> so<00:03:34.110> we<00:03:34.290> fought<00:03:34.530> that

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
there's like a hoax so we fought that

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.080 
there's like a hoax so we fought that
the<00:03:34.830> dials<00:03:35.130> inside<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.489> lighthouse<00:03:35.700> would

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
the dials inside the lighthouse would

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.900 
the dials inside the lighthouse would
make<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.510> green<00:03:36.720> light<00:03:36.930> come<00:03:37.489> so<00:03:38.489> we<00:03:38.610> decided

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
make the green light come so we decided

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.780 
make the green light come so we decided
to<00:03:39.060> try<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.360> do<00:03:39.450> them<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:40.310> nothing<00:03:41.310> happened

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
to try and do them and nothing happened

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.240 
to try and do them and nothing happened
we<00:03:42.780> didn't<00:03:43.020> really<00:03:43.170> get<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:43.470> try<00:03:43.680> out<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:44.010> for

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
we didn't really get to try out the for

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.910 
we didn't really get to try out the for
corns<00:03:44.670> or<00:03:44.850> the<00:03:45.480> sound<00:03:46.110> effect<00:03:46.470> mushrooms

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
corns or the sound effect mushrooms

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.070 
corns or the sound effect mushrooms
wherever<00:03:47.340> they<00:03:47.489> are<00:03:47.540> we<00:03:48.540> didn't<00:03:48.720> get<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.930> try

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
wherever they are we didn't get to try

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.990 
wherever they are we didn't get to try
them<00:03:49.290> out<00:03:50.239> but<00:03:51.560> we<00:03:52.560> did<00:03:52.739> try<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.040> ship's<00:03:53.430> leave

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
them out but we did try the ship's leave

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.729 
them out but we did try the ship's leave
as<00:03:54.300> well<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.930> dials<00:03:55.230> are<00:03:55.350> in<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.530> right<00:03:55.680> place

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
as well the dials are in the right place

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.030 
as well the dials are in the right place
and<00:03:56.400> nothing<00:03:57.150> happened<00:03:57.540> so<00:03:58.410> if<00:03:58.620> anyone<00:03:59.010> has

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
and nothing happened so if anyone has

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.640 
and nothing happened so if anyone has
any<00:03:59.280> more<00:03:59.670> theories<00:04:00.000> if<00:04:00.480> you<00:04:00.690> could<00:04:00.930> tell<00:04:01.410> me

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
any more theories if you could tell me

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.699 
any more theories if you could tell me
then<00:04:02.310> that'd<00:04:02.550> be<00:04:02.790> great<00:04:03.350> this<00:04:04.350> didn't<00:04:04.590> take

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
then that'd be great this didn't take

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.750 
then that'd be great this didn't take
long<00:04:04.830> as<00:04:04.980> you<00:04:05.130> see<00:04:05.340> we<00:04:05.640> got<00:04:05.670> around<00:04:06.120> nine<00:04:06.390> and

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
long as you see we got around nine and

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.210 
long as you see we got around nine and
we<00:04:08.760> tried<00:04:09.000> out<00:04:09.209> then<00:04:09.680> we<00:04:10.680> was<00:04:10.800> actually<00:04:10.920> lucky

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
we tried out then we was actually lucky

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.110 
we tried out then we was actually lucky
enough<00:04:11.580> to<00:04:11.670> get<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:11.910> ray<00:04:12.120> guns<00:04:12.390> in<00:04:12.630> that<00:04:12.810> time

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
enough to get to ray guns in that time

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.570
