00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
my c3 could go a 5 so I start with not

Indian<00:00:28.980> kind<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.730> setup<00:00:30.289> which<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.320> not

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
Indian kind of setup which is not

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.650 
Indian kind of setup which is not
terrible<00:00:32.070> it's<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.340> little<00:00:32.579> passive<00:00:33.090> why<00:00:33.510> does

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
terrible it's a little passive why does

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.290 
terrible it's a little passive why does
a<00:00:33.690> couple<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.399> decent<00:00:35.399> ways<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.850> deal<00:00:36.059> with<00:00:36.090> it

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
a couple of decent ways to deal with it

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.299 
a couple of decent ways to deal with it
I've<00:00:36.630> never<00:00:36.840> studied<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:38.070> much

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
I've never studied it in that much

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.119 
I've never studied it in that much
detail<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:38.969> general<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.360> think<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:40.129> setups

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
detail in general I think that setups

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.880 
detail in general I think that setups
putting<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.670> bishop<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.090> Chi<00:00:42.559> 777<00:00:43.559> are<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.710> bit

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
putting the bishop on Chi 777 are a bit

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.889 
putting the bishop on Chi 777 are a bit
more<00:00:44.070> challenging<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.390> I'll<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.660> make

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
more challenging so I'll just make

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.020 
more challenging so I'll just make
useful<00:00:46.200> moves<00:00:46.649> or<00:00:46.950> half<00:00:47.910> useful<00:00:48.420> moves<00:00:48.629> a

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
useful moves or half useful moves a

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.920 
useful moves or half useful moves a
trade<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.239> put<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> bishop<00:00:51.840> on<00:00:51.960> e3<00:00:53.690> he<00:00:54.690> plays<00:00:54.899> a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
trade to put the bishop on e3 he plays a

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.900 
trade to put the bishop on e3 he plays a
setup<00:00:55.260> which<00:00:55.500> I'm<00:00:55.680> sure<00:00:55.860> he's<00:00:55.980> played<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.699> it

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
setup which I'm sure he's played in it

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.580 
setup which I'm sure he's played in it
bazillion<00:00:57.539> blitz<00:00:57.780> games<00:00:57.989> already<00:00:58.320> he's

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
bazillion blitz games already he's

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.979 
bazillion blitz games already he's
making<00:00:58.949> his<00:00:59.070> moves<00:00:59.280> very<00:00:59.460> quickly<00:00:59.780> which<00:01:00.780> I

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
making his moves very quickly which I

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.130 
making his moves very quickly which I
can't<00:01:01.379> blame<00:01:01.590> him<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.239> will<00:01:03.750> try<00:01:04.110> to

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
can't blame him for and I will try to

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.890 
can't blame him for and I will try to
play<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:05.040> classically<00:01:05.790> close<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.330> centre<00:01:06.720> in

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
play it classically close the centre in

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.990 
play it classically close the centre in
general<00:01:07.350> I've<00:01:07.560> never<00:01:07.830> been<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> big<00:01:08.369> fan<00:01:08.760> of

followed by b5 or night to c5 might be a
little<00:01:22.049> more<00:01:22.170> challenging<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:22.770> he<00:01:22.979> goes<00:01:23.159> c5

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670

covered<00:04:10.470> I<00:04:10.590> think<00:04:10.889> h4<00:04:11.280> is<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.430> decent<00:04:11.760> move<00:04:12.120> I

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
covered I think h4 is a decent move I

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.180 
covered I think h4 is a decent move I
can't<00:04:12.569> see<00:04:12.660> him<00:04:12.870> activating<00:04:13.500> his<00:04:13.650> queen<00:04:13.980> in

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
can't see him activating his queen in

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.069 
can't see him activating his queen in
time<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.699> hurt<00:04:14.940> me<00:04:15.120> and<00:04:15.359> the<00:04:15.569> knight<00:04:15.780> can't

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
time to hurt me and the knight can't

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.930 
time to hurt me and the knight can't
move<00:04:16.260> because<00:04:16.500> it<00:04:16.829> has<00:04:16.979> to<00:04:17.130> cover<00:04:17.340> that<00:04:17.579> square

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
move because it has to cover that square

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.240 
move because it has to cover that square
which<00:04:18.299> I<00:04:18.449> thought<00:04:18.660> was<00:04:18.840> matin<00:04:19.229> one<00:04:19.440> turns<00:04:20.039> out

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
which I thought was matin one turns out

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.620 
which I thought was matin one turns out
it's<00:04:20.489> not<00:04:22.159> what<00:04:23.159> did<00:04:23.280> he<00:04:23.340> play<00:04:23.550> Queen<00:04:23.820> a5<00:04:24.210> what

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
it's not what did he play Queen a5 what

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.510 
it's not what did he play Queen a5 what
kind<00:04:24.810> of<00:04:24.840> move<00:04:24.990> is<00:04:25.020> that<00:04:25.140> I<00:04:25.289> can<00:04:25.500> take<00:04:25.530> it

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
kind of move is that I can take it

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.210 
kind of move is that I can take it
might<00:04:27.479> have<00:04:27.599> been<00:04:27.660> last<00:04:28.229> ditch<00:04:28.500> effort<00:04:28.889> if<00:04:29.099> I

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
might have been last ditch effort if I

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.089 
might have been last ditch effort if I
pre<00:04:29.550> moved<00:04:29.789> H<00:04:30.000> takes<00:04:30.300> g5<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:31.020> did<00:04:31.199> no<00:04:31.349> such<00:04:31.560> thing

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
pre moved H takes g5 I did no such thing

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.219
