 [Music] 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:22.990
 look at that morning something is wrong 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:24.580
 no hippie star there you do not look 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.310
 to go very well what's going on 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.050
 I do not know about friends I believe 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.150
 that they have something wrong with my 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.180
 motor they do not work very much anymore 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.630
 well ah no you can not ride with 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:41.620
 a case engine if that big novel near 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:46.350
 rome that happens to be equal I bet 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.489
 she knows how to fix this wrong here 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.559
 hello everyone what's going on 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.960
 goes on there is something wrong with the 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.050
 stars engine then I'll take a look 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.050
 look 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.340
 hello gaby is what it's normal 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.890
 all this stirs up here oh yes it's 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.750
 normal these are your pistons a piston 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.170
 it's a piece of shiny metal that 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.780
 looks like that he's bringing in some 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.009
 gasoline and air in the engine 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.110
 then there was a spark and a boom 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:18.310
 it produces enough power for 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.830
 you can ride 10 months gaby what is it 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.009
 which is wrong with my engine yet 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:28.260
 star the grave author is supposed to have six 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:34.470
 pistons but now you only have five 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:36.750
 you miss one of the pistons he had to 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.970
 to fall astray guide speaks and 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.970
 now I hope said 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:51.200
 gold it's really laughing poor star there and 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.060
 I know how we can find the 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.620
 piston stahl activation of the visor 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.340
 thanks to her I visualize things that 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:05.330
 no one can see looks a little good 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.430
 you have to look for this piston it has to be 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:12.020
 ready for this swamp 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:16.880
 you see the piston yes 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.580
 here it is it is embedded in the mud it 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.110
 just go there and report to me and 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.330
 roofs and blaise go get the 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.850
 piston me I stayed with sarlat you 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.310
 heard star there we will bring back your 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.820
 pistons and then my internship will be 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.800
 like before 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.310
 that's for sure once we have 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.370
 recovered this piston which will be like new 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.290
 not if I get it back first you 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.739
 recover they can all yes that's it 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.690
 pike 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.190
 if it was me who found that the piston 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.930
 will give more power to my 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.070
 motor enough to turn me into 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.360
 best monster machine from all over the world 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.830
 in fact I do not really know if it's 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.830
 like that it does not work it's over 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.130
