three and four and sometimes when we do

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.460 
three and four and sometimes when we do
circles<00:02:19.580> that<00:02:20.090> we<00:02:20.299> do<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.840> little<00:02:21.319> bit

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
circles that we do a little bit

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.440 
circles that we do a little bit
correction<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.430> one<00:02:22.790> with<00:02:22.940> your<00:02:23.060> hands<00:02:23.239> come

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
correction and one with your hands come

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.430 
correction and one with your hands come
up<00:02:23.629> from<00:02:24.380> back<00:02:24.650> goes<00:02:24.950> up<00:02:25.220> kind<00:02:26.150> of<00:02:26.299> go<00:02:26.480> down<00:02:26.840> and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
up from back goes up kind of go down and

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.640 
up from back goes up kind of go down and
your<00:02:27.709> correction<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.730> up<00:02:29.420> down<00:02:29.930> correction

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
your correction and up down correction

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.120 
your correction and up down correction
so<00:02:30.829> one<00:02:31.160> two<00:02:31.940> three<00:02:32.750> four<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.739> shoulders
