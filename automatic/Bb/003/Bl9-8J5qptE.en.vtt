00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.670
 hello that such friends greet you chrono 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.619
 again in another video and then today 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.840
 let's talk about how to win a 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.300
 Ranked match on this occasion of 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.210
 background I bring you then a game 3 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.670
 against 5 a round on the map of the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.830
 jail then here we are playing 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.140
 children of the team then abandoned good 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.110
 they left 2 and we stayed together with 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.960
 anne and another guy we stayed together with 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.170
 anne trocha batasunos playing alone but 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.940
 trying to get the game and then 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.070
 the first advice we should give 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.980
 to win a ranked match in these 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.920
 conditions is practically the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.870
 communication helps many see how 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.120
 is playing all your equipment in this 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.670
 occasion would be only the other guy 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.610
 because we did not know him and we were not 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.399
 communicator fortunately the guy 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.200
 I knew what was being played and how 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.140
 we commented on the last video 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.229
 the difference between fast games and 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.240
 Ranked matches and then this one is 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.200
 an even game you have to know what 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.079
 do not there 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.289
 it is expected that this second point will not 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.329
 despair this should not be the case and 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:33.329
 it did not happen we passed them the equipment 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.850
 Otherwise they began to despair were 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.880
 alone and that was the key to winning 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.759
 have a cool head is very important 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.369
 keep your head very cold and from 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.310
 making a decision based on something is not 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.110
 not make a decision to take nothing 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.819
 more good here as I said in the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.009
 communication know where your are 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:56.220
 comrades we help a lot that also 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.319
 with the group that brings the control to 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.720
 go back to your classmates so that 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.720
 know where they are 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.130
 here I make a bad shot I despair a 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.489
 little bit 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.619
 but fortunately my friend was 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.390
 very good for the return and then this 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.370
 It also helps that your team 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.670
 also know how to play 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.280
 well here I bring you a play where 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.230
 I communicate with gun 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.660
 This game is enough for me 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.870
 coverage and then I managed to kill him 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.390
 and it helps a lot also that was not going to 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.560
 continue after seeing someone because you are 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.410
 playing by teams or yes 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.400
 competitive for saying what you help yourself 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.000
 and project and I'm covering this area 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.160
 it goes to the other side and then 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.340
 Here I ask you to cover me also for 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.410
 grab the world 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.780
 because everything is communication, not friends 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.080
 you have to communicate you have to know 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.760
 communicating well is paramount is good 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.319
 here I'm covering the area before 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.210
 on the other side and the other guy is 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.600
 discovering the other side 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:07.840
 It is very important to cover the areas 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.370
 know the map for example for example 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.840
 you see that this map can be requested 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.490
 on two sides where the pomegranates are 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.320
 where is this side of the hook 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.740
 we stay here because it's the 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.880
 stronger weapon covering areas 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.310
 communicating 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.280
 if in any case someone dies that says or 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.860
 so here I did not notice that I was in a 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.870
 proposition I believe because it is fear of 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.180
 bishop if you leave and leave your position 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.060
 and does not warn you can enter someone by 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.760
 there and then kill them all for the 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.750
 back and the game ended here like 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.090
 I become desperate 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.360
 you have to be congruent in what weapon 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.700
 you have and where your enemy is located 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.660
 but well I do not despair I still have 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.970
 another bullet 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.850
 and I 'm going from one side to 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.140
 another one here we know that through this window 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.450
 you can shoot something many here so 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.060
 opted to use the barrel gun 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.220
 short good another primordial thing too 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.200
 is to mark your enemies locate them where 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.830
 They are for your friends to know 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.980
 well the location and the more 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.080
 more more to an idea and he shot him with the 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.640
 vision because then if I go with a 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.980
 Ax of risk of being lowered from 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.660
 up and then I stay the same covering 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.530
 again the area to 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:26.980
 then another move where it is achieved 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.220
 put one goes straight to kill me but then 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.980
 they warn me and I'm already something 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.530
 prepared and well fortunately this 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.300
 fear friends lower it again the guy 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.980
 with the return another important thing that 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.090
 can you do 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:44.460
 is this see the table 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.130
 it's not to see how much you're taking deaths or 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.960
 something else is practically to know 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.050
 how many of the opposite team are alive 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.320
 at the moment that helps you a lot to take 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.380
 this decisions together with your team to 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.630
 know what to do if they go about someone 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.360
 well here we are still waiting for 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:06.719
 what we are changing a bit 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:10.349
 and they must also use the gun 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:11.350
 of short cannon those magical and nobody liza 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.720
 and that 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.810
 it's quite quite important with 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.480
 bojan you stay in your rifle 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.300
 good another important thing is also 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.040
 listen to enemy forces because 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.790
 warns you that they have already switched sides 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.280
 where the players are born and could you 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.870
 you can move to another side or surround 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.290
 other side because sometimes I surround a 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.290
 enemy 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.030
 well here they told me that we 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.850
 we are moving then I'm going after 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.380
 they like joel to see anyway I leave 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.320
 my grenade stuck in case they want me 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.230
 get in the back 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.730
 good as we are because we only 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.730
 the five already lifeless 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:02.629
 and then here they tell me that we have two 

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:05.050
 he tried to make a good shot the truth 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:08.759
 but I fail a little 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.759
 but then do not despair 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.400
 in exchange, another one and therefore I'm going to lower it and 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.660
 the other 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.300
 they will raise the votes 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.280
 good 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.900
 here goes this and leaves his grenades 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.099
 stuck you have to be careful with the 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:32.120
 grenade can sometimes be from 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:32.120
 fragmentation and it was worth the thing 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.960
 well, we're going after the team but it's not 

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:47.290
 you have to go also in other 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.530
 situations we can afford to 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:52.420
 go after them here in ball so 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.700
 we prefer to remain calm 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.760
 because we already took the game after 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:01.060
 we're going to lose it at the last moment 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:03.990
 here it kills in the cut button and already we 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.990
 we are also lifeless 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:10.820
 Well, what do we do here, they kill something else 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:13.500
 important is also if you're dead 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.000
 inform all your friends where they are 

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.700
 the enemies for example here tell me 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.870
 where is I go for him and well what 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.640
 killed 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.830
 here kills in enemy another are 

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:26.040
 clipped that we stayed the bot the 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:29.060
 bots and me here in the duel in yesterday and then 

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:32.580
 and what you should do also mock 

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:35.580
 after a cropped after that 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.980
 be five it is advisable to make fun of you 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.450
 you do not do it again in your life 

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.590
 well that's all friends I hope you 

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:43.350
 liked the video 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:47.360
 remember lines share the likes 

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:47.360
 help a lot then see you 

00:07:56.949 --> 00:07:59.949
 do not
