like once once more twice more I don't

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.120 
like once once more twice more I don't
know<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.180> don't<00:01:06.810> think<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.680> works

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
know I just don't think that it works

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.840 
know I just don't think that it works
like<00:01:11.180> it<00:01:12.180> says<00:01:12.420> high<00:01:12.600> potency<00:01:13.520> but<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.580> just

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
like it says high potency but I just

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.600 
like it says high potency but I just
don't<00:01:15.060> believe<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.509> works<00:01:15.950> I'm<00:01:16.950> gonna<00:01:17.189> give<00:01:17.460> it

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
don't believe it works I'm gonna give it

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.410 
don't believe it works I'm gonna give it
I<00:01:17.850> mean<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.240> guess<00:01:18.479> because<00:01:18.689> I'm<00:01:19.110> stressed<00:01:19.560> and

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.700 

moisture<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:27.110> proper<00:01:28.110> hair<00:01:28.320> care<00:01:28.560> regimen

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
moisture and a proper hair care regimen

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:41.030 
moisture and a proper hair care regimen
is<00:01:29.450> also<00:01:35.090> also<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> part<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:38.869> helping<00:01:40.040> helping

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
is also also a part of helping helping

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.870 
is also also a part of helping helping
it<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.310> guess<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.640> would<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.360> believe<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.899> just

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
it I guess I would just believe it just

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.920 
it I guess I would just believe it just
it<00:01:44.880> doesn't<00:01:45.060> need<00:01:45.270> assistance

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
it doesn't need assistance

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.530 
it doesn't need assistance
I<00:01:45.990> mean<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.350> biotin<00:01:48.140> it's<00:01:49.140> supposed<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.740> I

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
I mean it's biotin it's supposed to I

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.639 
I mean it's biotin it's supposed to I
also<00:01:51.540> take<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.990> with<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.829> multivitamin<00:01:54.649> so

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
also take this with a multivitamin so

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:04.230 
also take this with a multivitamin so
you<00:01:56.549> know<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:58.610> multi-item<00:01:59.610> of<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.210> multivitamin

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:19.560 

with<00:02:08.380> with<00:02:14.110> calcium<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.290> vitamin<00:02:15.680> B<00:02:15.860> I<00:02:17.440> guess

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
with with calcium and vitamin B I guess

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:24.160 
with with calcium and vitamin B I guess
it's<00:02:20.570> because<00:02:20.750> I'm<00:02:21.140> taking<00:02:22.540> my<00:02:23.540> daughter<00:02:23.810> over

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
it's because I'm taking my daughter over

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:42.430 
it's because I'm taking my daughter over
there

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
she's a bit cranky but I just don't

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.759 
she's a bit cranky but I just don't
think<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.940> works

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.449
