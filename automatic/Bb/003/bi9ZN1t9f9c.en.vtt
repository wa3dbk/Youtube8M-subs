00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:45.299 
any excess pressure out right now we

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:49.460 
any excess pressure out right now we
haven't<00:00:45.449> got<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:46.290> me<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:48.960> tool<00:00:49.229> for

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
removing the fuel filler so it just

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.049 
removing the fuel filler so it just
spins<00:00:51.869> on<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.739> see<00:00:52.920> here's<00:00:53.159> the<00:00:53.220> new<00:00:53.909> one

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
spins on you can see here's the new one

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.460 
spins on you can see here's the new one
we've<00:00:54.210> got<00:00:54.239> there's<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.720> thread<00:00:54.989> there<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.440> a

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
we've got there's a thread there and a

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.740 
we've got there's a thread there and a
rubber<00:00:55.650> so<00:00:56.250> sometimes<00:00:56.790> you'll<00:00:57.449> be<00:00:57.600> lucky

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
rubber so sometimes you'll be lucky

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.240 
rubber so sometimes you'll be lucky
because<00:00:58.080> they<00:00:58.199> shouldn't<00:00:58.409> be<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.589> tight<00:00:58.979> and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
because they shouldn't be that tight and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.579 
because they shouldn't be that tight and
you<00:00:59.760> can<00:01:00.000> whip<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.659> off<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.439> bit

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
you can whip it off if it's a bit

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.950 
you can whip it off if it's a bit
tighter<00:01:01.890> I've<00:01:02.189> got<00:01:02.339> an<00:01:02.430> old<00:01:02.519> trick<00:01:02.939> here<00:01:03.269> I've

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
attempt to catch any diesel that spills

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.620 
attempt to catch any diesel that spills
out<00:01:18.530> all<00:01:19.530> right<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:19.890> I'm<00:01:20.040> gonna<00:01:20.480> grip<00:01:21.480> that

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
out all right so I'm gonna grip that

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.720 
out all right so I'm gonna grip that
together<00:01:21.960> I'm<00:01:22.110> gonna<00:01:22.230> use<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.620> mop<00:01:22.830> does

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
together I'm gonna use this mop does

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.600 
together I'm gonna use this mop does
that<00:01:23.910> apply<00:01:24.150> there<00:01:24.660> I<00:01:25.190> squeezed<00:01:26.190> out<00:01:26.310> together

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
that apply there I squeezed out together

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.740 
that apply there I squeezed out together
as<00:01:26.790> best<00:01:26.940> I<00:01:27.180> can

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
as best I can

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.240 
as best I can
okay<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.430> then<00:01:29.640> I'm<00:01:30.090> gonna<00:01:30.330> over<00:01:30.540> go<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.250> twist

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
okay and then I'm gonna over go it twist

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.680 
okay and then I'm gonna over go it twist
in<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:33.350> get<00:01:34.350> an<00:01:34.409> exit<00:01:36.020> come<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:38.390> there<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.540> go

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
in it get an exit come on there we go

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.639 
in it get an exit come on there we go
that's<00:01:39.990> got<00:01:40.200> it

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.779 

right<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.219> take<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.729> off<00:01:45.000> now<00:01:46.549> bail<00:01:47.549> out

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
right and I take that off now bail out

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.190 
right and I take that off now bail out
the<00:01:47.909> way<00:01:48.000> obviously<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.390> belts<00:01:48.719> got<00:01:48.929> a<00:01:48.960> high

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the way obviously the belts got a high

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.270 
the way obviously the belts got a high
friction<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.579> it's<00:01:50.729> ideal<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:52.070> whippin<00:01:53.070> those

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
friction so it's ideal for whippin those

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.690 
friction so it's ideal for whippin those
off<00:01:53.549> right<00:01:53.820> now

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
off right now

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.520 
off right now
okay<00:01:56.929> so<00:01:58.789> I'm<00:01:59.789> expecting<00:02:00.420> some<00:02:00.959> diesel<00:02:01.409> to

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
okay so I'm expecting some diesel to

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.889 
okay so I'm expecting some diesel to
spill<00:02:01.799> out<00:02:01.920> here<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:03.450> looks<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:03.719> we're

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
spill out here it looks like we're

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:14.210 
spill out here it looks like we're
fairly<00:02:04.110> lucky<00:02:08.450> okay<00:02:10.610> so<00:02:12.890> that's<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.069> old

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
fairly lucky okay so that's the old

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.150 
fairly lucky okay so that's the old
filter<00:02:14.849> there<00:02:15.060> oh<00:02:18.170> okay<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.650> that's<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:20.040> old

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
filter there oh okay so that's the old

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.860 
filter there oh okay so that's the old
filter<00:02:20.579> that<00:02:20.910> we<00:02:21.140> we<00:02:22.140> can<00:02:22.349> probably<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.220> load<00:02:23.370> of

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
filter that we we can probably a load of

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.330 
filter that we we can probably a load of
rubbish<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.349> filtered<00:02:25.829> out<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.010> there

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
rubbish that is filtered out in there

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.759 
rubbish that is filtered out in there
don't<00:02:26.880> reuse<00:02:27.120> be<00:02:27.630> tempted<00:02:28.049> to<00:02:28.079> reuse<00:02:28.500> that

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
don't reuse be tempted to reuse that

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.470 
don't reuse be tempted to reuse that
these<00:02:29.610> all<00:02:29.849> cause<00:02:29.940> it's<00:02:30.060> obviously<00:02:30.299> going<00:02:30.420> to

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
these all cause it's obviously going to

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.600 
these all cause it's obviously going to
have<00:02:30.569> some<00:02:30.840> other<00:02:30.930> rubbish<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.040> can<00:02:32.220> see<00:02:32.430> in

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
have some other rubbish you can see in

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.780 
have some other rubbish you can see in
there<00:02:32.819> this<00:02:33.000> come<00:02:33.840> out<00:02:33.959> of<00:02:34.079> the<00:02:34.170> tank<00:02:34.470> right

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
there this come out of the tank right

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.479 
there this come out of the tank right
dispose<00:02:35.790> of<00:02:35.819> that<00:02:36.180> responsibly<00:02:39.680> right<00:02:40.680> um

here's<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.030> new<00:02:42.239> filter<00:02:42.980> um<00:02:44.959> so<00:02:45.959> we're<00:02:46.079> going

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
here's the new filter um so we're going

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.789 
here's the new filter um so we're going
to<00:02:46.260> spin<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.680> on<00:02:48.260> now<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.319> problem<00:02:49.680> with

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
to spin that on now the problem with

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.069 
to spin that on now the problem with
changing<00:02:50.489> diesel<00:02:50.850> filters<00:02:51.299> as<00:02:51.540> I'm<00:02:51.720> sure<00:02:51.959> I'm

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
changing diesel filters as I'm sure I'm

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.000 
changing diesel filters as I'm sure I'm
about<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.440> find<00:02:52.620> out<00:02:52.889> is<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.389> U<00:02:55.380> vector

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
about to find out is that the U vector

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.160 
about to find out is that the U vector
II<00:02:56.190> induce<00:02:56.700> introduced<00:02:57.359> a<00:02:57.450> lot<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.660> air<00:02:57.840> into

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
II induce introduced a lot of air into

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.770 
II induce introduced a lot of air into
your<00:02:58.200> fuel<00:02:58.530> system<00:02:58.769> because<00:02:59.609> this<00:02:59.850> canister

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
your fuel system because this canister

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.830 
your fuel system because this canister
we're<00:03:01.079> putting<00:03:01.350> on<00:03:01.500> is<00:03:01.680> is<00:03:01.889> empty<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:03.660> the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
we're putting on is is empty so the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.559 
we're putting on is is empty so the
trick<00:03:04.109> is<00:03:04.139> you've<00:03:04.709> got<00:03:04.829> to<00:03:04.920> bleed<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.430> which<00:03:06.329> is

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
trick is you've got to bleed it which is

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.210 
trick is you've got to bleed it which is
why<00:03:07.370> they've<00:03:08.370> given<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.819> this<00:03:08.970> little<00:03:10.220> all

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
why they've given you this little all

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.440 
why they've given you this little all
right<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:11.459> don't<00:03:11.549> want<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.760> do<00:03:11.849> that<00:03:11.970> ultra

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
right you don't want to do that ultra

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.569 
right you don't want to do that ultra
tight<00:03:12.630> cuz<00:03:12.900> you've<00:03:13.019> got<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.319> rubber<00:03:13.579> you've

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
tight cuz you've got the rubber you've

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.610 
tight cuz you've got the rubber you've
got<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.849> rubber<00:03:15.030> thing<00:03:15.389> the<00:03:15.959> rubber<00:03:16.170> seals<00:03:16.470> at

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
got the rubber thing the rubber seals at

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.309 
got the rubber thing the rubber seals at
the<00:03:16.709> top<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:17.250> right<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.720> we've<00:03:18.840> got<00:03:19.019> that<00:03:19.170> we've

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
the top so right so we've got that we've

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.680 
the top so right so we've got that we've
loosened<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:19.859> now<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.880> books<00:03:21.090> telling<00:03:21.540> me

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
loosened that now the books telling me

loosened that now the books telling me
that<00:03:22.620> this<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:23.099> the<00:03:23.310> lift<00:03:23.549> pump<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:23.940> I've<00:03:24.000> taken

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
that this is the lift pump so I've taken

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.449 
that this is the lift pump so I've taken
the<00:03:24.419> front<00:03:25.169> off<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.530> air<00:03:25.620> cleaner<00:03:25.950> here<00:03:26.220> just

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
the front off the air cleaner here just

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.729 
the front off the air cleaner here just
so<00:03:26.549> we<00:03:26.639> can<00:03:26.760> make<00:03:27.049> expose<00:03:28.049> what<00:03:28.319> you<00:03:28.380> can<00:03:28.530> see

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
so we can make expose what you can see

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.839 
so we can make expose what you can see
under<00:03:29.010> here<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.579> a<00:03:30.389> little<00:03:30.690> red<00:03:31.160> now<00:03:32.160> we<00:03:32.639> just

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
under here is a little red now we just

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.159 
under here is a little red now we just
have<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.150> turn<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:33.480> engine<00:03:33.599> a<00:03:33.810> bit<00:03:33.900> cuz<00:03:34.049> it

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
have to turn the engine a bit cuz it

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:35.569 
have to turn the engine a bit cuz it
didn't<00:03:34.410> feel<00:03:34.590> like<00:03:34.650> when<00:03:34.950> we<00:03:35.069> were<00:03:35.160> pressing

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
didn't feel like when we were pressing

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.819 
didn't feel like when we were pressing
on<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.819> was<00:03:36.000> doing<00:03:36.359> very<00:03:37.079> much<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.620> may<00:03:37.769> be

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
on it was doing very much and it may be

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.349 
on it was doing very much and it may be
to<00:03:38.130> do<00:03:38.250> with<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.430> position<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:38.819> the<00:03:38.910> cam<00:03:39.120> so

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
to do with the position of the cam so

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.240 
to do with the position of the cam so
we've<00:03:39.480> just<00:03:39.690> given<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:40.019> engine<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.349> quick<00:03:40.709> turn

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
we've just given the engine a quick turn

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.309 
we've just given the engine a quick turn
but<00:03:41.549> without<00:03:41.730> starting<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.359> and<00:03:42.750> now<00:03:43.109> we've

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
but without starting it and now we've

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.409 
but without starting it and now we've
got<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.530> bit<00:03:43.709> of<00:03:43.829> spring<00:03:44.609> pressure<00:03:44.880> there<00:03:45.180> now

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
got a bit of spring pressure there now

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:48.460 
got a bit of spring pressure there now
and<00:03:45.780> now<00:03:46.560> what<00:03:46.739> we<00:03:46.829> should<00:03:46.889> start<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.489> see<00:03:47.519> is

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
and now what we should start to see is

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.319 
and now what we should start to see is
you<00:03:49.470> can<00:03:49.650> hit<00:03:49.829> a<00:03:49.859> tee<00:03:49.979> here<00:03:50.370> let's<00:03:50.609> I'm<00:03:51.030> quiet

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
you can hit a tee here let's I'm quiet

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.430 
you can hit a tee here let's I'm quiet
on<00:03:51.449> the<00:03:51.540> video<00:03:51.750> let's<00:03:51.930> have<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.049> listen<00:03:52.169> if<00:03:52.350> we

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
on the video let's have a listen if we

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.270 
on the video let's have a listen if we
can<00:03:52.560> hear<00:03:52.709> it

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.540 

we<00:03:57.280> can<00:03:57.459> hear<00:03:57.580> these<00:03:57.790> or<00:03:58.000> coming<00:03:58.330> into<00:03:58.480> that

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
we can hear these or coming into that

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.460 
we can hear these or coming into that
I'm<00:04:00.550> expecting<00:04:01.150> some<00:04:01.330> diesel<00:04:01.750> to<00:04:01.900> squirt<00:04:02.290> out

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
I'm expecting some diesel to squirt out

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.220 
I'm expecting some diesel to squirt out
that<00:04:02.740> top<00:04:03.569> any<00:04:04.569> second

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
that top any second

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.080 
that top any second
now<00:04:05.860> you<00:04:05.920> could<00:04:06.160> do<00:04:06.280> this<00:04:06.459> by<00:04:06.610> just<00:04:06.640> turning

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
now you could do this by just turning

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.690 
now you could do this by just turning
the<00:04:07.330> engine<00:04:07.420> over<00:04:07.660> and<00:04:07.930> start<00:04:08.230> on<00:04:09.069> the<00:04:09.400> start

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
the engine over and start on the start

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.130 
the engine over and start on the start
and<00:04:09.819> I<00:04:09.910> or<00:04:10.060> it<00:04:10.150> might<00:04:10.330> not<00:04:10.360> start<00:04:10.810> because<00:04:11.050> you

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
and I or it might not start because you

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.860 
and I or it might not start because you
got<00:04:11.260> no<00:04:11.290> diesel<00:04:12.360> but<00:04:13.360> it<00:04:13.450> would<00:04:13.569> wear<00:04:13.750> your

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
got no diesel but it would wear your

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.720 
got no diesel but it would wear your
battery<00:04:14.290> down<00:04:14.440> and<00:04:14.650> you<00:04:14.709> start<00:04:14.950> mater<00:04:17.609> and<00:04:18.609> you

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
battery down and you start mater and you

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.979 
battery down and you start mater and you
would<00:04:18.850> have<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:19.090> do<00:04:19.239> this<00:04:19.359> if<00:04:19.540> you<00:04:19.630> run<00:04:19.810> out<00:04:19.959> of

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
would have to do this if you run out of

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.230 
would have to do this if you run out of
diesel<00:04:20.290> as<00:04:20.590> well<00:04:20.769> and<00:04:20.950> you<00:04:21.040> refill<00:04:21.549> you'll

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
diesel as well and you refill you'll

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.050 
diesel as well and you refill you'll
have<00:04:22.419> to<00:04:22.600> undo<00:04:22.990> this<00:04:23.200> and<00:04:23.650> pump<00:04:24.520> this<00:04:24.700> so<00:04:24.910> this

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
have to undo this and pump this so this

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.300 
have to undo this and pump this so this
might<00:04:25.270> be<00:04:25.300> a<00:04:25.510> useful<00:04:26.200> trick<00:04:26.680> if<00:04:26.890> you<00:04:26.919> need<00:04:27.160> to

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.920 

now<00:05:09.460> a<00:05:09.490> bit<00:05:09.760> worried<00:05:10.030> I've<00:05:10.120> got<00:05:10.270> a<00:05:10.300> washer<00:05:10.720> left

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930

over<00:05:11.169> we're<00:05:11.410> doing<00:05:11.620> that<00:05:11.740> should<00:05:11.979> have<00:05:12.070> gone<00:05:12.190> I

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
over we're doing that should have gone I

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.130 
over we're doing that should have gone I
think<00:05:14.530> that<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:14.979> wash<00:05:15.160> area<00:05:15.430> is<00:05:15.970> if<00:05:16.780> you<00:05:16.930> want

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
think that the wash area is if you want

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.040 
think that the wash area is if you want
to<00:05:17.260> replace<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:17.890> banjo<00:05:18.490> washer<00:05:19.030> under<00:05:19.840> here

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
to replace the banjo washer under here

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.040
