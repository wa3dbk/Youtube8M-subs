00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:03.769 

I'd<00:00:02.190> like<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.580> cover<00:00:02.759> two<00:00:03.060> issues<00:00:03.449> in<00:00:03.480> this

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:03.779 
I'd like to cover two issues in this

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.100 
I'd like to cover two issues in this
video<00:00:04.520> the<00:00:05.520> first<00:00:05.790> issue<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.420> angle<00:00:06.990> of

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:07.110 
video the first issue is the angle of

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.100 
video the first issue is the angle of
the<00:00:07.230> seat<00:00:07.790> you'll<00:00:08.790> note<00:00:09.030> from<00:00:09.240> my<00:00:09.420> first<00:00:09.720> video

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
the seat you'll note from my first video

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.520 
the seat you'll note from my first video
that<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.830> made<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.309> seat<00:00:11.550> horizontal<00:00:12.440> when<00:00:13.440> the

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
that I made the seat horizontal when the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.830 
that I made the seat horizontal when the
chair<00:00:13.800> is<00:00:13.980> freestanding

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
chair is freestanding

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.980 
chair is freestanding
this<00:00:15.840> was<00:00:16.139> incorrect<00:00:17.090> the<00:00:18.090> seat<00:00:18.390> needs<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.869> be

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
this was incorrect the seat needs to be

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.050 
this was incorrect the seat needs to be
angled<00:00:19.260> back<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.400> when<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.640> sit<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.029> it

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
angled back so that when you sit on it

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.269 
angled back so that when you sit on it
it<00:00:21.300> rocks<00:00:21.930> forward<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> horizontal

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
it rocks forward to a horizontal

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.689 
it rocks forward to a horizontal
position<00:00:24.740> the<00:00:25.740> second<00:00:26.130> thing<00:00:26.310> I'm<00:00:26.430> going<00:00:26.609> to

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
position the second thing I'm going to

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.179 
position the second thing I'm going to
cover<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.240> how<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.660> drill<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> hole<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.890> has<00:00:29.070> an

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
cover is how to drill a hole that has an

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.880 
cover is how to drill a hole that has an
angle<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.670> two<00:00:29.910> planes<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:31.170> can<00:00:31.320> see<00:00:31.560> here

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
angle on two planes you can see here

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.119 
angle on two planes you can see here
that<00:00:32.039> the<00:00:32.219> leg<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.579> angled<00:00:32.940> forward<00:00:33.239> and

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
that the leg is angled forward and

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.209 
that the leg is angled forward and
outwards<00:00:36.170> cut<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.350> leg<00:00:37.530> longer<00:00:37.979> than<00:00:38.129> you

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
outwards cut the leg longer than you

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.899 
outwards cut the leg longer than you
need<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.670> then<00:00:39.089> mark<00:00:39.389> the<00:00:39.690> center<00:00:40.190> I'm<00:00:41.190> using

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:41.909 
need and then mark the center I'm using

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:44.090 
need and then mark the center I'm using
half<00:00:42.210> inch<00:00:42.449> dowel<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.049> join<00:00:43.289> the<00:00:43.440> leg<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:44.069> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
half inch dowel to join the leg to the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.390 
half inch dowel to join the leg to the
seat

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.630 

I'm<00:00:50.400> using<00:00:50.700> 15<00:00:51.240> degree<00:00:51.600> angles<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.140> my<00:00:52.260> chair

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
I'm using 15 degree angles in my chair

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.240 
I'm using 15 degree angles in my chair
so<00:00:53.640> I've<00:00:53.760> set<00:00:54.000> my<00:00:54.180> sword<00:00:54.480> 15<00:00:55.020> degrees<00:00:55.380> and<00:00:55.650> then

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
so I've set my sword 15 degrees and then

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.480 
so I've set my sword 15 degrees and then
set<00:00:56.550> my<00:00:56.730> protractor<00:00:57.060> to<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> same<00:00:57.810> angle<00:00:58.490> mark

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
set my protractor to the same angle mark

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.380 
set my protractor to the same angle mark
the<00:00:59.700> angle<00:01:00.590> then<00:01:01.590> cut<00:01:01.890> along<00:01:02.130> this<00:01:02.370> 15<00:01:03.090> degree

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
the angle then cut along this 15 degree

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.930 
the angle then cut along this 15 degree
angle<00:01:03.420> with<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.230> 15<00:01:04.620> degree<00:01:05.010> angle<00:01:05.190> of<00:01:05.730> the

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
angle with the 15 degree angle of the

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.830 
angle with the 15 degree angle of the
saw<00:01:06.800> you<00:01:07.800> end<00:01:07.980> up<00:01:08.130> with<00:01:08.340> 15<00:01:08.730> degrees<00:01:09.120> on<00:01:09.360> two

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
saw you end up with 15 degrees on two

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.720 
saw you end up with 15 degrees on two
planes<00:01:12.800> because<00:01:13.800> I'm<00:01:14.010> not<00:01:14.160> smart<00:01:14.490> enough<00:01:14.550> to

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
planes because I'm not smart enough to

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.490 
planes because I'm not smart enough to
work<00:01:14.970> out<00:01:15.150> what<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.360> angle<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.990> diagonal

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
work out what the angle of the diagonal

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.210 
work out what the angle of the diagonal
edges

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
edges

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.240 
edges
I<00:01:17.250> made<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> jig<00:01:18.540> using<00:01:19.410> similar<00:01:19.770> pieces<00:01:20.130> of

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
I made a jig using similar pieces of

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.580 
I made a jig using similar pieces of
wood<00:01:20.570> you<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.720> see<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.110> I've<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.350> glued

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
wood you can see that I've just glued

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.670 
wood you can see that I've just glued
them<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.040> board<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:25.860> diagonal

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
them on to the board on the diagonal

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.760 
them on to the board on the diagonal
along<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.770> lines<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:30.110> then<00:01:31.110> put<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> piece<00:01:31.590> at

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
along the lines and then put a piece at

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.490 
along the lines and then put a piece at
the<00:01:31.800> end<00:01:33.080> to<00:01:34.080> rest<00:01:34.320> my<00:01:34.530> piece<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:35.010> when<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.250> drill

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
the end to rest my piece on when I drill

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.920 
the end to rest my piece on when I drill
align<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.680> jig<00:01:37.890> perpendicular<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.720> drill

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
align the jig perpendicular to the drill

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.469 
align the jig perpendicular to the drill
press<00:01:40.250> it's<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.369> good<00:01:41.550> idea<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.880> start<00:01:42.270> with<00:01:42.360> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
press it's a good idea to start with a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.620 
press it's a good idea to start with a
piece<00:01:42.660> of<00:01:42.720> scrap<00:01:43.880> to<00:01:44.880> make<00:01:45.030> sure<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.390> get<00:01:45.509> it

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
piece of scrap to make sure you get it

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.420 
piece of scrap to make sure you get it
right<00:01:45.660> this<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.770> how<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.950> want<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.369> leg<00:01:47.580> to<00:01:47.729> set

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
right this is how I want the leg to set

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.550 
right this is how I want the leg to set
so<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.580> has<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> 15<00:01:51.180> degree<00:01:51.540> angle<00:01:51.570> forwards<00:01:52.350> and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
so it has a 15 degree angle forwards and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.180 
so it has a 15 degree angle forwards and
a<00:01:53.100> 15<00:01:53.490> degree<00:01:53.850> angle<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> left<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:56.100> can

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
a 15 degree angle to the left you can

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.859 
a 15 degree angle to the left you can
see<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.610> I've<00:01:56.729> got<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.940> line<00:01:57.240> along<00:01:57.720> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
see that I've got a line along the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.490 
see that I've got a line along the
diagonal<00:01:59.899> so<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:00.929> place<00:02:01.259> my<00:02:01.500> piece<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:02.039> my<00:02:02.759> jig

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
diagonal so I place my piece on my jig

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.440 
diagonal so I place my piece on my jig
aligning<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.619> diagonal<00:02:05.009> line<00:02:05.220> with<00:02:06.030> my<00:02:06.210> jig

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
aligning that diagonal line with my jig

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:15.080 
aligning that diagonal line with my jig
line<00:02:11.990> with<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.110> pattern<00:02:13.440> line<00:02:13.680> lined<00:02:14.640> up<00:02:14.880> with

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
line with the pattern line lined up with

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.220 
line with the pattern line lined up with
the<00:02:15.180> jig<00:02:15.390> line<00:02:15.569> I<00:02:15.840> can<00:02:16.590> then<00:02:17.090> drill<00:02:18.090> my<00:02:18.300> hole

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.800 

with<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.349> hole<00:02:23.530> drilled<00:02:23.739> I<00:02:24.129> can<00:02:24.849> now<00:02:25.000> test<00:02:25.330> to

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
with the hole drilled I can now test to

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.570 
with the hole drilled I can now test to
see<00:02:26.019> whether<00:02:26.230> I've<00:02:26.440> got<00:02:26.650> everything<00:02:26.890> correct

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.320 

it's<00:02:30.580> looking<00:02:30.940> good

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
it's looking good

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.000 
it's looking good
there's<00:02:32.200> my<00:02:32.440> left-hand<00:02:32.709> angle<00:02:33.190> and<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.950> angle

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
there's my left-hand angle and the angle

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.030 
there's my left-hand angle and the angle
to<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.430> front<00:02:37.049> now<00:02:38.049> that<00:02:38.200> I've<00:02:38.290> proved<00:02:38.620> my<00:02:38.769> jig

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
to the front now that I've proved my jig

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.400 
to the front now that I've proved my jig
is<00:02:39.160> okay<00:02:39.549> I<00:02:39.760> can<00:02:40.330> drill<00:02:40.599> all<00:02:40.750> the<00:02:40.870> other<00:02:41.019> angles

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
is okay I can drill all the other angles

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.699 
is okay I can drill all the other angles
and<00:02:41.970> eventually<00:02:42.970> end<00:02:43.180> up<00:02:43.959> with<00:02:44.019> a<00:02:44.230> perfect

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
and eventually end up with a perfect

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.489 
and eventually end up with a perfect
little<00:02:44.860> rocking<00:02:45.250> chair
