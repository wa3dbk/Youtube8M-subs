00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.070
 I'm just going to try one every week 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.840
 to upload a new cleo no 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.100

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.780

 just everything can go for you 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.970
 but start today 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.920
 with very first question and very first 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.880
 question is loesje cheese that question is real 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.250
 just very easy to answer 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.899
 because I eat about average I think 3 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.280
 cheese sandwiches every day as every morning 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.899
 I wake up anyway taking a one 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.259
 sandwich and match because I really love the 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.759
 morning 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.170
 I'm really just not a morning person 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.549
 when I wake up and then sleep anyway 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.229
 we are all eyes are half closed 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.970
 I see nothing at all grow job and me 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.500
 I go to my one sham sandwich 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.330
 school and then at school I wake up 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.200
 then I usually eat 2 or 3 cheese sandwiches 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.430
 at school 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.750
 and then of course I am leaving school 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.640
 I eat vegetables and 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.959
 potatoes and then in a front I go to bed 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.000
 I usually go for another sandwich 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.680
 cheese so on average think 3 cheese sandwiches 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.280
 per day for the person who wanted it 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.780
 know 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.310
 next question is why are you talking like that 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.750
 quickly and that question is very easy to 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.190
 answers because I talk so fast because 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.840
 at first just my style prevent it 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.610
 is food and secondly I think so 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.140
 also because channel to listen to 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.580
 because of course I can provide more information 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.319
 processing in a shorter time, another 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.819
 always come and tell their story 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.319
 takes 20 minutes long have me lasts 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.340
 just for five minutes and have 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.989
 just told the whole story 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.549
 most still information besides also tells 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.230
 so i think it is chilling to be like that 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.489
 come tt I also just think chill 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.959
 there to listen to because if I have one 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.510
 live commentary I can do just 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.370
 ok 88888 may of course with death 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.209
 and then i'm dead and elshout 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.810
 okay now someone is behind me I am 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.610
 death 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.470
 So I find myself very oval 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.150
 next question is what was your goal then 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.680
 You started with YouTube and I just had it on 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.420
 start lives very quickly say my 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.829
 goal with youtube was really just the 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.660
 reach a thousand subscribers and whole 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.130
 give many people tips to get better 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.750
 be in call of duty and it's me now 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.790
 just luck than I have now, of course, 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.780
 the 10,000 subscribers identical so high there 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.769
 gone over it 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.030
 and you could do it all because of you 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.040
 you can start i read it then 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.480
 thank you anyway that was 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.100
 so basically just very simple mine 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.450
 purpose when i started with youtube 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.950
 do you use a mother check is the 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.700
 next question in use don't bon it 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.859
 controller 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.959
 if you had seen my video where I had the 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.340
 fps freaks to put a check then 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.930
 you will just have to be completely different or 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.670
 that it is pink and that we have a fps 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.019
 free able to knuckle my rights 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.130
 i just better one and it works 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.639
 you just really didn't like that video 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.840
 have seen 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.709
 I will also include it in the 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.760
 description put the small 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.350
 controllership 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.359
 next question is how does your family look 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.470
 situation at home and my family situation 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.940
 probably looks just normal 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.440
 father and mother just live 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.030
 both at home are not divorced or anything 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.310
 i have another twin brother who are 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.810
 all 221 if I'm right and that 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.400
 players also call of duty that are two 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.630
 times f-block for his name two 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.010
 different redbox is like mine 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.480
 twin brother all very difficult 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.380
 but are therefore both 21 one 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.639
 twin brother 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.769
 and i also have a sister who 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:05.880
 is 24 if I am right and he lives 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.319
 who is no longer at home who lives somewhere 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.120
 otherwise and you just have your own 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.079
 house that you are still renovating 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.000
 so i probably just have one 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.290
 normal family situation and ruffles 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.790
 will also be out in a few years 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.930
 go home and then I'm just alone 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.609
 still at home with my parents 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.039
 next question is you left or right 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.810
 and I found left-handed person 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.490
 Question is how did you become so good at it 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.599
 call of duty and that question is real 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.190
 probably one of the easiest 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:28.440
 ask to answer because 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.210
 a certain answer and that is 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.500
 exercise if you call him often enough or 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.880
 Duty plays then you learn all the spots 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.230
 where you can stand you learn all 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.180
 spots value and emmys can go on 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.680
 tension army everything from the game itself 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.880
 you know a lot about the game and then 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.440
 so you can easily do very well 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.400
 you can get scores very easily 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.750
 good for the and then you can quite 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.400
 easy simply pick place game 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.710
 for the question can chicken is fried 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.900
 chicken burger king or the mac and die 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.070
 question is difficult to answer because 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.810
 I have never fried both can chicken 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.640
 chicken eaten and just never with 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.170
 so the burger king ate the answer 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.970
 must be the mac because I already have it 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.680
 my second has never tasted the 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.550
 question is what is your dog and my dogs' name 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.200
 they are called 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.400
 Luna Dies van so only my sister is that 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.140
 so no longer lives here so when he 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.520
 sometimes for a little while at home and my other 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.450
 dog that is called linda and that is here 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.160
 Always order a cap that you have 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.840
 probably seen 10,000 times in 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.670
 a FaceCam you could after just good 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.750
 watch out for cider walking around for a while 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.100
 they lie on my bed Us 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.480
 partying off the bed she goes at the door 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.050
 are discharging back on the must 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.060
 be smelling 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.650
 they have bad weather but to snooping 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.300
 I see that the gp3 is almost finished 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.010
 it is a color much white with sit now 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.310
 once on a 29 cursor me and someone in it 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.780
 my team
