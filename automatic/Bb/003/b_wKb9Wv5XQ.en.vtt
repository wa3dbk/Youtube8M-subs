00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659 

the<00:00:00.269> intro<00:00:00.599> screen<00:00:00.810> and<00:00:01.439> what<00:00:02.159> you'll<00:00:02.340> see<00:00:02.550> is

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
the intro screen and what you'll see is

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.100 
the intro screen and what you'll see is
actually<00:00:02.820> a<00:00:03.060> little<00:00:03.240> bit<00:00:03.360> embarrassing

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
actually a little bit embarrassing

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.769 
actually a little bit embarrassing
because<00:00:04.440> it's<00:00:04.650> pretty<00:00:04.859> primitive<00:00:05.480> so<00:00:06.480> we

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
because it's pretty primitive so we

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.169 
because it's pretty primitive so we
started<00:00:07.200> with<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.470> Starcraft<00:00:07.950> 1<00:00:08.370> units<00:00:08.849> we

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
started with the Starcraft 1 units we

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.930 
started with the Starcraft 1 units we
didn't<00:00:09.420> have<00:00:09.540> any<00:00:09.719> new<00:00:09.960> units<00:00:10.460> this<00:00:11.460> was<00:00:11.700> the

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
didn't have any new units this was the

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.570 
didn't have any new units this was the
early<00:00:12.420> versions<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.960> models<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:14.400> are

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
early versions of models that you are

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.670 
early versions of models that you are
obviously<00:00:14.880> needed<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.780> bit<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:15.960> alignment

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
obviously needed a bit of alignment

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.349 
obviously needed a bit of alignment
alignment<00:00:17.070> work<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.699> actually<00:00:17.910> get<00:00:18.240> it

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
alignment work to actually get it

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.080 
alignment work to actually get it
properly<00:00:18.570> working<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.760> we<00:00:20.760> didn't<00:00:20.939> have<00:00:21.029> a

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
properly working and we didn't have a

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.000 
properly working and we didn't have a
sound<00:00:21.420> engine<00:00:21.779> yet<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.199> no<00:00:22.500> sound<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.949> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
sound engine yet so no sound in the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.490 
sound engine yet so no sound in the
video<00:00:23.269> so<00:00:24.269> all<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:24.750> did<00:00:24.900> at<00:00:25.050> that<00:00:25.109> point<00:00:25.230> was

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
video so all we did at that point was

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.560 
video so all we did at that point was
just<00:00:25.590> getting<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> old<00:00:26.400> Starcraft<00:00:27.090> 1<00:00:27.269> stuff

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
just getting the old Starcraft 1 stuff

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.540 
just getting the old Starcraft 1 stuff
actually<00:00:27.900> working<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.800> explosions<00:00:29.400> were

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
actually working and the explosions were

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.940 
actually working and the explosions were
absolutely<00:00:30.090> awesome<00:00:33.559> so<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:34.620> he<00:00:34.710> more<00:00:34.920> than

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
absolutely awesome so if he more than

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.450 
absolutely awesome so if he more than
turn<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.610> off<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:36.120> was<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.540> year<00:00:36.809> later<00:00:37.460> 2006

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
turn it off that was a year later 2006

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.850 
turn it off that was a year later 2006
so<00:00:39.149> now<00:00:39.300> we<00:00:39.360> actually<00:00:39.780> put<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.050> some<00:00:40.079> something

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
so now we actually put in some something

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.770 
so now we actually put in some something
I<00:00:40.950> would<00:00:41.100> look<00:00:41.280> more<00:00:41.489> like<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.790> genuine<00:00:42.329> model

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
I would look more like a genuine model

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.709 
I would look more like a genuine model
of<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.020> game<00:00:43.370> we<00:00:44.370> had<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> clear<00:00:44.969> system<00:00:45.239> that

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
of the game we had a clear system that

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.590 
of the game we had a clear system that
was<00:00:45.840> put<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.260> some<00:00:46.829> basic<00:00:47.100> lighting<00:00:47.550> we<00:00:48.450> were

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
was put in some basic lighting we were

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.360 
was put in some basic lighting we were
kind<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.899> experimenting<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.950> terrans

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
kind of experimenting with the terrans

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.110 
kind of experimenting with the terrans
at<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.700> point<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:52.129> think<00:00:54.739> putting<00:00:55.739> some<00:00:56.250> new

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
at this point I think putting some new

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.220 
at this point I think putting some new
units<00:00:57.600> we're<00:00:58.320> gonna<00:00:58.469> see<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.949> few<00:00:59.160> minutes

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
units we're gonna see in a few minutes

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.959 
units we're gonna see in a few minutes
yeah<00:01:01.230> it's<00:01:01.440> not<00:01:01.590> there<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:02.010> we<00:01:02.550> put<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:02.879> the

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
yeah it's not there but we put in the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:12.480 
yeah it's not there but we put in the
particle<00:01:03.300> systems<00:01:03.930> which

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.300 

and<00:01:14.050> then<00:01:15.050> this<00:01:15.230> was<00:01:15.380> a<00:01:15.410> couple<00:01:15.620> months<00:01:15.890> later

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
and then this was a couple months later

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.700 
and then this was a couple months later
so<00:01:17.090> this<00:01:17.540> is<00:01:17.690> when<00:01:17.840> we<00:01:17.990> actually<00:01:18.140> started

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
so this is when we actually started

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.440 
so this is when we actually started
putting<00:01:18.830> in<00:01:19.130> new<00:01:19.370> units<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:20.090> some<00:01:20.270> of<00:01:20.390> the

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
putting in new units and some of the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.940 
putting in new units and some of the
young<00:01:20.600> units<00:01:21.170> you'll<00:01:21.350> see<00:01:21.560> today<00:01:21.710> have

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
young units you'll see today have

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.000 
young units you'll see today have
actually<00:01:22.310> been<00:01:22.730> either<00:01:23.540> everly<00:01:24.140> modified<00:01:24.740> or

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
actually been either everly modified or

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.890 
actually been either everly modified or
they're<00:01:25.400> actually<00:01:25.550> gone<00:01:25.940> from<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.300> game<00:01:26.450> so

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
they're actually gone from the game so

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.750 
they're actually gone from the game so
there's<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:27.440> Guardian<00:01:27.950> in<00:01:28.130> there<00:01:28.340> there's

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
there's the Guardian in there there's

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.660 
there's the Guardian in there there's
the<00:01:28.970> Cobra<00:01:29.450> that<00:01:29.690> has<00:01:29.810> changed<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:31.010> Thor<00:01:31.280> was

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
the Cobra that has changed the Thor was

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.260 
the Cobra that has changed the Thor was
much<00:01:32.060> bigger<00:01:32.330> back<00:01:32.780> then<00:01:33.250> so<00:01:34.250> we<00:01:34.760> put<00:01:34.970> in<00:01:35.060> some

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
much bigger back then so we put in some

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.030 
much bigger back then so we put in some
special<00:01:35.660> effects<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:36.230> some<00:01:36.440> beams<00:01:36.620> of<00:01:36.860> that

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
special effects and some beams of that

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.160 
special effects and some beams of that
burn<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:37.910> the<00:01:38.060> explosions<00:01:38.570> were<00:01:38.750> actually<00:01:39.140> a

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
burn and the explosions were actually a

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.780 
burn and the explosions were actually a
little<00:01:39.410> bit<00:01:39.590> improved<00:01:41.530> at<00:01:42.530> that<00:01:42.770> point<00:01:43.010> where

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
little bit improved at that point where

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.430 
little bit improved at that point where
were<00:01:44.000> we<00:01:44.180> I<00:01:44.210> think<00:01:44.360> oh<00:01:44.780> yeah<00:01:44.990> we<00:01:45.230> started

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
were we I think oh yeah we started

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.610 
were we I think oh yeah we started
working<00:01:45.800> on<00:01:45.980> the<00:01:46.130> Protoss<00:01:47.410> version<00:01:48.410> of<00:01:48.560> the

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
working on the Protoss version of the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.320 
working on the Protoss version of the
pylon<00:01:50.890> we<00:01:51.890> had<00:01:52.040> our<00:01:52.190> first<00:01:52.430> experiments<00:01:53.180> you

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
pylon we had our first experiments you

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.060 
pylon we had our first experiments you
can<00:01:53.360> see<00:01:53.720> some<00:01:53.930> dragoons<00:01:54.350> that<00:01:54.650> were<00:01:54.770> still<00:01:55.010> in

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
can see some dragoons that were still in

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.880 
can see some dragoons that were still in
the<00:01:55.220> game<00:01:55.370> back<00:01:55.640> then<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.780> purifier<00:01:57.350> which<00:01:57.740> is

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
the game back then the purifier which is

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.620 
the game back then the purifier which is
one<00:01:58.070> of<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.220> units<00:01:58.580> that<00:01:58.670> we<00:01:58.880> subsequently

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
one of the units that we subsequently

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.980 
one of the units that we subsequently
killed<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:01.280> this<00:02:01.520> is<00:02:01.700> what<00:02:01.910> creep<00:02:02.480> looks<00:02:02.780> like

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
killed and this is what creep looks like

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.720 
killed and this is what creep looks like
when<00:02:03.200> you<00:02:03.320> put<00:02:03.500> a<00:02:03.530> bunch<00:02:03.710> of<00:02:03.920> programmers<00:02:04.340> in<00:02:04.670> a

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
when you put a bunch of programmers in a

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.550 
when you put a bunch of programmers in a
room<00:02:04.910> without<00:02:05.090> an<00:02:05.330> artist<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.900> actually<00:02:06.290> give

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
room without an artist to actually give

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.419 
room without an artist to actually give
them<00:02:06.710> direction<00:02:08.890> but<00:02:09.890> we<00:02:10.040> had<00:02:10.160> our<00:02:10.190> first

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
them direction but we had our first

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.060 
them direction but we had our first
version<00:02:10.880> of<00:02:10.940> the<00:02:11.030> Creed<00:02:11.500> at<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.530> prototype

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
version of the Creed at a prototype

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.340 
version of the Creed at a prototype
stage<00:02:13.370> at<00:02:13.610> this<00:02:13.730> point<00:02:15.760> moving<00:02:16.760> on<00:02:17.200> 2006<00:02:18.200> in

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
stage at this point moving on 2006 in

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.080 
stage at this point moving on 2006 in
October<00:02:18.800> this<00:02:18.950> is<00:02:19.100> one<00:02:19.280> put<00:02:19.459> we<00:02:19.700> put<00:02:19.730> in<00:02:20.000> the

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
October this is one put we put in the

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.480 
October this is one put we put in the
glow<00:02:20.330> Tech<00:02:20.660> in<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.080> game<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:22.280> high

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
glow Tech in the game and the high

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.449 
glow Tech in the game and the high
dynamic<00:02:23.030> range<00:02:23.180> colors<00:02:23.780> so<00:02:24.590> we<00:02:25.100> started

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
dynamic range colors so we started

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.340 
dynamic range colors so we started
putting<00:02:25.610> themes<00:02:26.030> as<00:02:26.360> well<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:26.750> all<00:02:26.930> sorts<00:02:27.260> of

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
putting themes as well and all sorts of

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.960 
putting themes as well and all sorts of
cool<00:02:27.650> effects

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.490 

what<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.090> see<00:02:33.270> here<00:02:33.300> is<00:02:33.690> actually<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.260> old

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
what you see here is actually the old

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.770 
what you see here is actually the old
Archon<00:02:34.950> which<00:02:35.160> was<00:02:35.370> much<00:02:35.640> bigger<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.360> you

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
Archon which was much bigger and you

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.660 
Archon which was much bigger and you
could<00:02:36.930> actually<00:02:37.080> spawn<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.770> by<00:02:37.920> just<00:02:38.190> merging

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
could actually spawn it by just merging

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.260 
could actually spawn it by just merging
three

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
three

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.570 
three
Templars<00:02:39.780> together<00:02:40.140> this<00:02:40.890> mechanically

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
Templars together this mechanically

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:49.670 
Templars together this mechanically
subsequently<00:02:42.150> changed<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:49.200> this<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.560> an

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
subsequently changed so this is an

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.590 
subsequently changed so this is an
actual<00:02:50.010> much<00:02:50.310> closer<00:02:50.700> version<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.360> creep

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
actual much closer version the creep

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.480 
actual much closer version the creep
that<00:02:51.810> we<00:02:51.930> actually<00:02:52.140> put<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.590> later<00:02:52.800> if<00:02:53.190> you

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
that we actually put in later if you

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.710 
that we actually put in later if you
look<00:02:53.640> in<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.850> video<00:02:53.970> you'll<00:02:54.330> see<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.630> was

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
look in the video you'll see it was

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.110 
look in the video you'll see it was
actually<00:02:55.140> reflective<00:02:55.860> this<00:02:56.550> is<00:02:56.700> something<00:02:57.030> we

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
actually reflective this is something we

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.050 
actually reflective this is something we
subset<00:02:57.570> we<00:02:57.990> changed<00:02:58.440> afterwards<00:02:58.910> because<00:02:59.910> it

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
subset we changed afterwards because it

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.580 
subset we changed afterwards because it
was<00:03:00.180> kind<00:03:00.360> of<00:03:00.450> slow<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.959> creep<00:03:01.140> was<00:03:01.350> pretty

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
was kind of slow the creep was pretty

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.320 
was kind of slow the creep was pretty
slow<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.280> was<00:03:02.400> kind<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.640> distracting<00:03:03.180> to

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
slow and it was kind of distracting to

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.690 
slow and it was kind of distracting to
actually<00:03:03.660> see<00:03:03.930> poised<00:03:04.800> to<00:03:05.040> say<00:03:05.190> mute<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.610> on

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
actually see poised to say mute it on

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.390 
actually see poised to say mute it on
the<00:03:05.940> same<00:03:06.150> screen<00:03:06.740> but<00:03:07.740> at<00:03:07.830> that<00:03:07.950> point<00:03:08.160> we<00:03:08.370> are

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
the same screen but at that point we are

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.460 
the same screen but at that point we are
we<00:03:08.790> had<00:03:08.910> really<00:03:09.270> started<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.870> dial<00:03:10.110> down<00:03:10.410> the

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
we had really started to dial down the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.370 
we had really started to dial down the
look<00:03:10.800> of<00:03:11.220> this<00:03:11.520> ERG<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.480> theorem<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:12.989> the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
look of this ERG and the theorem and the

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.500 
look of this ERG and the theorem and the
protoss<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:14.100> actually<00:03:14.760> getting<00:03:15.120> something

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
protoss and actually getting something

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.300 
protoss and actually getting something
that<00:03:15.780> looks<00:03:16.020> a<00:03:16.170> lot<00:03:16.290> closer<00:03:16.590> to<00:03:16.890> what<00:03:16.980> we<00:03:17.130> have

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
that looks a lot closer to what we have

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.800 
that looks a lot closer to what we have
today<00:03:18.830> as<00:03:19.830> does<00:03:20.580> anybody<00:03:20.760> remember<00:03:21.180> seeing

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
today as does anybody remember seeing

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.830 
today as does anybody remember seeing
the<00:03:22.170> announcement<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:23.040> Starcraft<00:03:23.550> 2<00:03:23.640> in<00:03:24.420> Korea

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
the announcement of Starcraft 2 in Korea

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.250 
the announcement of Starcraft 2 in Korea
like<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.440> early<00:03:25.800> videos<00:03:26.540> this<00:03:27.540> is<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:28.080> bill

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
like the early videos this is the bill

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.460 
like the early videos this is the bill
that<00:03:28.530> we<00:03:28.620> use<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.250> this<00:03:29.700> was<00:03:30.140> this<00:03:31.140> was<00:03:31.380> the

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
that we use and this was this was the

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.770 
that we use and this was this was the
first<00:03:31.680> time<00:03:31.890> we<00:03:32.100> showed<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.520> public<00:03:32.940> wizard

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
first time we showed it to public wizard

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.570 
first time we showed it to public wizard
actually<00:03:34.140> shipped<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.590> whole<00:03:34.800> team<00:03:35.070> to<00:03:35.310> Korea

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
actually shipped the whole team to Korea

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.420 
actually shipped the whole team to Korea
and<00:03:35.910> they<00:03:36.690> we<00:03:37.019> had<00:03:37.200> this<00:03:37.350> huge<00:03:37.650> statement<00:03:38.070> to

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
and they we had this huge statement to

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.940 
and they we had this huge statement to
actually<00:03:38.760> see<00:03:39.030> how<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.470> people<00:03:40.650> would

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
actually see how the people would

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.440 
actually see how the people would
receive<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.459> game<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:41.850> was<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.150> most

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
receive the game it was the most

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.220 
receive the game it was the most
exciting<00:03:42.810> moment<00:03:43.370> my<00:03:44.370> life<00:03:44.580> really<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:46.019> is

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
exciting moment my life really this is

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.789 
exciting moment my life really this is
July<00:03:46.670> 2007<00:03:47.670> we<00:03:48.090> put<00:03:48.269> in<00:03:48.390> foliage<00:03:48.870> on<00:03:49.260> the

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
July 2007 we put in foliage on the

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.320 
July 2007 we put in foliage on the
terrain<00:03:50.040> as<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:50.430> can<00:03:50.610> see<00:03:50.820> so<00:03:51.090> we<00:03:51.209> were

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
terrain as you can see so we were

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.360 
terrain as you can see so we were
starting<00:03:51.720> to<00:03:51.840> really<00:03:51.989> polish<00:03:52.650> off<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.160> maps

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
starting to really polish off the maps

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.210 
starting to really polish off the maps
and<00:03:53.760> actually<00:03:54.030> give<00:03:54.239> them<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:54.959> more<00:03:55.470> finished

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
and actually give them a more finished

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.820 
and actually give them a more finished
look<00:03:56.700> this<00:03:57.299> one<00:03:57.570> we<00:03:57.900> put<00:03:58.110> in<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.410> line<00:03:58.650> of

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
look this one we put in the line of

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.650 
look this one we put in the line of
sight<00:03:59.010> blockers<00:03:59.549> the<00:04:00.090> first<00:04:00.360> time<00:04:00.540> we

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
sight blockers the first time we

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:07.640 
sight blockers the first time we
experimented<00:04:01.230> with<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:01.739> mechanic<00:04:04.910> and<00:04:06.650> then

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
experimented with that mechanic and then

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.479 
experimented with that mechanic and then
a<00:04:08.070> few<00:04:08.489> months<00:04:08.640> later<00:04:08.820> October<00:04:09.709> 2007<00:04:10.709> we<00:04:11.250> put

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
a few months later October 2007 we put

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.370 
a few months later October 2007 we put
in<00:04:11.610> scorch<00:04:12.030> marks<00:04:12.480> underneath<00:04:12.750> buildings

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
in scorch marks underneath buildings

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.890 
in scorch marks underneath buildings
kind<00:04:13.980> of<00:04:14.100> little<00:04:14.400> polished<00:04:14.970> items<00:04:15.360> to<00:04:15.570> really

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
kind of little polished items to really

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.320 
kind of little polished items to really
kind<00:04:16.140> of<00:04:16.290> anchor<00:04:17.100> buildings<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.030> Train

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
kind of anchor buildings to the Train

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.080 
kind of anchor buildings to the Train
and<00:04:18.359> actually<00:04:18.959> give<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.769> final<00:04:20.220> work<00:04:20.850> for

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
and actually give the final work for

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.510 
and actually give the final work for
buildings<00:04:22.100> so<00:04:23.100> at<00:04:23.280> that<00:04:23.400> point<00:04:23.610> we<00:04:23.940> were

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
buildings so at that point we were

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.250 
buildings so at that point we were
quite<00:04:25.520> close<00:04:26.000> to<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.390> work<00:04:26.600> of<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:26.870> game<00:04:27.080> that

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
quite close to the work of the game that

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.190 
quite close to the work of the game that
we<00:04:27.380> have<00:04:27.560> today<00:04:27.710> but<00:04:27.890> this<00:04:28.190> was<00:04:28.870> 2007<00:04:29.870> so

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
we have today but this was 2007 so

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.480 
we have today but this was 2007 so
you're<00:04:30.350> probably<00:04:30.500> wondering<00:04:31.040> what<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.340> hell

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
you're probably wondering what the hell

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.280

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
appeased I've been doing in just three

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.600 
appeased I've been doing in just three
years<00:04:33.560> between<00:04:33.830> shipping

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
years between shipping
