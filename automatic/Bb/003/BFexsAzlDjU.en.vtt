00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hello believe it or not but 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.000
 I broke down and bought the same figure for the new 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.190
 turtles for the film why I did it 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.320
 because I generally love figurines 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.310
 the turtle does not have a lot of different figures 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.730
 lego from old material 2003 and 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.189
 very old from our childhood and from 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.380
 Okinawan metal in general why would 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.240
 no besides their so quickly demolished slept 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.150
 that I decided to still touch and and 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.990
 see why people can 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.260
 like 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.610
 figurine of the same company flames I'm on 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.890
 really wanted one of the standard 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.230
 there were no slides in the store 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.500
 really demolished all the schools were 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.020
 only turnips that were not at all with 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.760
 as you see here 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:52.500
 normal street here in the store was 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.890
 just a terrible slant and straight horror what 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.230
 just a nightmare just tin 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.899
 I do not know maybe in another plant them 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.129
 make and quality probably these figures 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.510
 so good as in this picture 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.140
 the fate of everything but still the figure is me 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.700
 I liked it and the test I was from the skull 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.860
 standard was not as you see it 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.700
 there are no figures at all anymore 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.860
 than eight 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.720
 I don't even know what else there really is 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.580
 dealing with villains is pretty meagerly accurate 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.659
 as well as in the film there was practically no 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.210
 so here, only here it is impossible and the shredder 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.869
 roads ahead early russian what 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:34.590
 wonderful regatta tunic ladian flames 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:36.960
 this is absolutely strange to me 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.869
 really like character design from 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.350
 new movie design turtles and shredder 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.689
 from the printer and and right i'm not against anything 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.880
 I have no prejudices against them 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.740
 has so let's not talk about it 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:55.470
 About a figure rating 4 + is even less than at 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.960
 film is still a baby commission 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.250
 these turtles I don't know yes it's weird 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.250
 let's open 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.060
 so here is another piece of plastic 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.080
 huge and all simurg hold on 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:22.300
 let's eat it first 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.300
 things otherwise they probably dad fall 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:39.170
 scarf scarf seal with tape come off 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:43.810
 Well, let's eat there myself turtle 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:48.920
 tied ordered by wire 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:51.440
 transparent thing here so far 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.100
 pull out especially if in front of you 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.480
 camera I can't see anything normally 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:05.470
 go for half a year probably 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:10.910
 come on come on come on me a figure 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.920
 so then they have a huge shell 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.660
 as far as you remember therefore pushing 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.600
 a turtle hill but it's normal 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.640
 turtles really huge shell i 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.620
 I have nothing against it 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:28.130
 removed or cloak important for me 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:30.050
 question of the millennium I don't know don't know 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.910
 removed or cloak but it seems to me not 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.850
 has watched because there inside 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.800
 but not quite naked but hired 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.380
 nothing is drawn it is just green and 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.720
 all is nothing by the way 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.060
 coasters more precisely 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.769
 stand holes if you have any 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.680
 coasters can put this figure 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:53.340
 great and so see what's here 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.209
 gesticulation articulation not say so 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.099
 arm 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:01.310
 spin in a circle and also have 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:06.090
 a small hinge that allows them 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:10.099
 walk more in the side of the head too 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:15.060
 spinning there you can even pull out 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:16.859
 the end of his bandanas but really why 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.380
 you do not know all of the same 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.970
 quality rubber as a figurine plan 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.090
 the deck of the Russian cartoon series 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.070
 actually looks pretty nice 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.530
 pretty cool sorry here especially 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:32.099
 nothing to watch there is a ball is not smooth foot 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.050
 but all this makes little sense you have when 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:37.530
 such a figure in a huge cloak 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.280
 what do you do with it abundantly want to 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.070
 really 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.770
 figures normal in turtles without a raincoat 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.130
 don't he pass on look i can't sing 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.139
 like that do kick to the movie 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.449
 just on this example is normal 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:54.419
 figure not look sorry what is not 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:57.270
 got only such hands to him too 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:00.360
 don't particularly gun a weapon in this set 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:03.240
 no, naturally, naturally now we 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.880
 We will look at how the stencil looks 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.330
 By the way the figure is called a slave spy I 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.789
 told you look like a trophy in this 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.460
 all human clothes will be now 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:19.500
 put all those rubber things on him 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:22.099
 shah oh it seems a scarf too i'm too 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:27.199
 one step so 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:32.939
 This is how it looks like ochechki. 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:35.310
 I am wearing a hat that's acting up and 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:38.210
 Well, it's really great 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:41.150
 it turns out not to recognize him at all 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.659
 almost nothing is visible so the pieces 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:47.039
 literally feet 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:49.110
 pieces of bandage kenasy stick up and nothing 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.120
 I would see this straight on the street 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.699
 and generally nothing strange would have thought 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.870
 ordinary guy every other palm so 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:06:00.210
 looks like with such humps as if 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.370
 they have a manhole attached to his back 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.229
 In general, write in the comments that 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.500
 think about the new figures for sure 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:09.569
 Some of you bought, I probably still 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.900
 buy a pair of pieces if you don't mind 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:14.639
 talk about on your channel can 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.680
 be there will be something interesting joints 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:20.490
 look hands and legs hope everything 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:23.310
 hidden behind a cloak and a figurine figure in 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.990
 principle is not particularly so in order to 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.360
 change its position in order to 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.930
 wear a scarf and hat on her glasses and just 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.169
 to put 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:33.569
 and rejoice because well cool 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.430
 cool you registers so the suit 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:38.490
 I have everything for today 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.379
 write a small video about the figure 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.860
 what do you think about these videos i love 

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:46.379
 shoot and you probably 9 look in 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:49.650
 Generally write to new meetings bye 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:51.389
 here are these five figures actually 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.699
 It looks great and I am very 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:57.779
 I like to decide to collect all the figures 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:07:02.000
 this series bought aypril also but 

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:02.000
 april did not work out very much despite the fact that
