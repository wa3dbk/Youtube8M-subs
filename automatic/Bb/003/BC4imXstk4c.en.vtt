curtain like I explained earlier and we
also<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.439> high-speed<00:01:37.770> sync<00:01:38.340> now<00:01:39.150> when

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
also have high-speed sync now when

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.730 
also have high-speed sync now when
you're<00:01:39.479> dealing<00:01:39.600> with<00:01:39.780> flash<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.320> have<00:01:40.560> a

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
sync speed limit which is the match to

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.240 
sync speed limit which is the match to
speed<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.290> use<00:01:43.590> when<00:01:43.829> shooting<00:01:44.009> with

high-speed<00:01:54.360> sync<00:01:54.689> allows<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.470> go<00:01:55.590> beyond

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
high-speed sync allows you to go beyond

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.429 
high-speed sync allows you to go beyond
that<00:01:56.280> okay<00:01:57.350> without<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:59.630> getting<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.899> second

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
fashion what the flash has to do is

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.530 
fashion what the flash has to do is
actually<00:03:02.480> pulse<00:03:03.019> burst<00:03:04.030> now<00:03:05.030> without<00:03:05.359> having

actually pulse burst now without having

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.080 
actually pulse burst now without having
to<00:03:05.840> pulse<00:03:06.109> multiple<00:03:06.620> times<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:07.220> cannot<00:03:07.819> do

to pulse multiple times it cannot do

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.059 
to pulse multiple times it cannot do
that<00:03:08.239> on<00:03:08.299> full<00:03:08.720> power<00:03:08.900> because<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.680> has<00:03:09.890> to

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
that on full power because it has to

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.009 
that on full power because it has to
recycle<00:03:10.549> recharge<00:03:11.239> before<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:11.690> can<00:03:11.810> fire

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
recycle recharge before it can fire

so<00:03:12.980> high-speed<00:03:13.910> sync<00:03:14.269> kills<00:03:14.629> a<00:03:14.870> lot<00:03:15.230> of<00:03:15.410> power

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
so high-speed sync kills a lot of power

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.180 
so high-speed sync kills a lot of power
I<00:03:15.920> personally<00:03:16.819> rarely<00:03:17.630> use<00:03:17.840> it<00:03:18.019> and<00:03:18.230> because

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
I personally rarely use it and because

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.740 
I personally rarely use it and because
it<00:03:19.280> really<00:03:19.549> limits<00:03:19.849> you<00:03:19.970> have<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.329> work<00:03:20.480> really

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
it really limits you have to work really

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.569 
it really limits you have to work really

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
likes of the 30 d4 City had this I'm not

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.390 
likes of the 30 d4 City had this I'm not
sure<00:05:48.420> but<00:05:49.230> normally<00:05:49.740> when<00:05:49.890> you<00:05:50.010> go<00:05:50.130> into<00:05:50.280> the

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.960 
custom function settings on this flash
it<00:05:52.500> just<00:05:52.740> gives<00:05:52.890> you<00:05:52.950> a<00:05:53.010> lot<00:05:53.190> of<00:05:53.310> number<00:05:53.610> values

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
it just gives you a lot of number values

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.370 
it just gives you a lot of number values
and<00:05:54.120> doesn't<00:05:54.390> really<00:05:54.510> explain<00:05:54.780> what<00:05:55.260> they

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
and doesn't really explain what they

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.840 
and doesn't really explain what they
correlate<00:05:55.830> to<00:05:55.980> and<00:05:56.130> which<00:05:56.280> options<00:05:56.670> they<00:05:56.820> are

correlate to and which options they are

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.930 
correlate to and which options they are
doing<00:05:57.180> is<00:05:57.930> either<00:05:58.230> custom<00:05:58.680> function<00:05:58.980> one<00:05:59.220> with

doing is either custom function one with

doing is either custom function one with
a<00:05:59.970> zero<00:06:00.270> for<00:06:00.540> often<00:06:00.690> a<00:06:00.930> one<00:06:01.140> for<00:06:01.350> arm<00:06:01.500> and<00:06:01.740> your

a zero for often a one for arm and your

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.700 
a zero for often a one for arm and your
hair<00:06:02.220> okay<00:06:02.580> you<00:06:03.180> need<00:06:03.300> the<00:06:03.480> manual<00:06:03.870> so<00:06:04.470> at

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
hair okay you need the manual so at

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.650 
hair okay you need the manual so at
least<00:06:04.890> with<00:06:05.130> this<00:06:05.370> with<00:06:05.700> the<00:06:05.880> flash<00:06:06.120> connected

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
least with this with the flash connected

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.930 
least with this with the flash connected
you<00:06:06.780> can<00:06:06.960> now<00:06:07.080> visually<00:06:07.680> see<00:06:07.920> what<00:06:08.730> these

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
you can now visually see what these

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.810 
you can now visually see what these
custom<00:06:09.360> functions<00:06:09.810> are<00:06:10.310> and<00:06:11.310> this<00:06:11.460> is<00:06:11.610> why<00:06:11.760> you

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 
custom functions are and this is why you

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.530 
custom functions are and this is why you
see<00:06:12.120> the<00:06:12.270> CF<00:06:12.780> n<00:06:13.020> symbol<00:06:13.920> on<00:06:14.130> my<00:06:14.550> speed<00:06:15.360> right

low-light<00:06:45.389> so<00:06:45.720> you<00:06:45.780> can<00:06:45.960> set<00:06:46.230> these<00:06:46.410> custom

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
low-light so you can set these custom

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.700 
low-light so you can set these custom
functions<00:06:47.040> and<00:06:47.720> according<00:06:48.720> to<00:06:48.930> what<00:06:49.380> custom

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
and set on your speed lights like I say

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.420 
and set on your speed lights like I say
these<00:06:55.200> will<00:06:55.440> differ<00:06:55.680> depending<00:06:55.830> on<00:06:56.280> what

these will differ depending on what
speed<00:06:56.700> light<00:06:56.880> you<00:06:57.060> use<00:06:57.680> okay<00:07:00.260> so<00:07:01.260> we<00:07:01.380> can<00:07:01.500> clear

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800
