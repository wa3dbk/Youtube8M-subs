better<00:01:22.070> than<00:01:22.850> what<00:01:23.090> they<00:01:23.240> have<00:01:23.450> already

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
better than what they have already

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.570 
better than what they have already

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
because that's just boring if they make

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.030

it<00:01:25.790> like<00:01:26.090> a<00:01:26.119> zombie<00:01:26.690> mode<00:01:26.930> and<00:01:27.200> they<00:01:27.590> make<00:01:27.830> the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
it like a zombie mode and they make the

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.000 
it like a zombie mode and they make the
make<00:01:28.490> it<00:01:28.640> better<00:01:29.270> because<00:01:30.110> this<00:01:30.350> really<00:01:30.860> looks

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
make it better because this really looks

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.399

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.429 
like a big map there's multiple
locations<00:01:51.680> multiple<00:01:52.310> houses<00:01:52.490> and<00:01:53.080> it<00:01:54.080> looks<00:01:54.320> a

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
locations multiple houses and it looks a

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:55.810 
locations multiple houses and it looks a
lot<00:01:54.619> it<00:01:54.770> looks<00:01:54.799> slightly<00:01:55.220> different<00:01:55.790> than

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
lot it looks slightly different than

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.600 
lot it looks slightly different than
extinction<00:01:56.540> was<00:01:56.930> from<00:01:57.920> this<00:01:58.070> from<00:01:58.460> these

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
extinction was from this from these

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.399 
extinction was from this from these
images<00:01:59.090> and<00:01:59.299> from<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.570> trailer<00:01:59.960> but<00:02:00.200> I'm

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
images and from the trailer but I'm

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.200 
images and from the trailer but I'm
assuming<00:02:00.860> that's<00:02:01.280> just<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.700> trailer<00:02:02.090> and

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
assuming that's just the trailer and

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.340 
assuming that's just the trailer and
it's<00:02:02.299> going<00:02:02.420> to<00:02:02.479> look<00:02:02.689> the<00:02:02.840> same<00:02:03.080> but

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
it's going to look the same but

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.260 
it's going to look the same but
hopefully<00:02:04.100> it's<00:02:04.250> something<00:02:04.400> really<00:02:04.880> cool<00:02:05.060> and

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
hopefully it's something really cool and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.700 
hopefully it's something really cool and
hopefully<00:02:05.540> it's<00:02:05.659> something<00:02:05.810> that<00:02:06.500> could

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
hopefully it's something that could

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.499 
hopefully it's something that could
almost<00:02:06.920> compete<00:02:07.369> with<00:02:07.549> zombies<00:02:07.970> but<00:02:08.149> this<00:02:08.329> was

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
almost compete with zombies but this was

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.460 
almost compete with zombies but this was
the<00:02:08.599> teaser<00:02:08.810> hopefully<00:02:09.200> we'll<00:02:09.319> get<00:02:09.409> more

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470

looking<00:02:19.459> into<00:02:19.730> this<00:02:19.849> I<00:02:20.090> actually<00:02:20.239> think<00:02:20.660> that

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
looking into this I actually think that

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.230 
looking into this I actually think that
there<00:02:21.050> is<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.170> possibility<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:21.890> this

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
there is a possibility that this

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.600 
there is a possibility that this
is<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.390> new<00:02:22.540> multiplayer<00:02:23.260> game<00:02:23.740> mode<00:02:24.040> perhaps

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
is a new multiplayer game mode perhaps

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.730 
is a new multiplayer game mode perhaps
on<00:02:24.850> one<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.090> new<00:02:25.210> maps<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:26.140> looks<00:02:26.410> like<00:02:26.470> one

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
on one of the new maps it looks like one

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.290 
on one of the new maps it looks like one
of<00:02:26.770> them<00:02:26.890> forgetting<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.670> name<00:02:27.790> like<00:02:28.030> fog

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
of them forgetting the name like fog

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.190 
of them forgetting the name like fog
maybe<00:02:28.570> I<00:02:28.660> mean<00:02:29.440> there's<00:02:29.590> fog<00:02:29.860> around<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:31.630> sort

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
maybe I mean there's fog around it sort

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.750 
maybe I mean there's fog around it sort
of<00:02:32.290> looks<00:02:32.500> like<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.710> multiplayer<00:02:33.310> map<00:02:33.580> and

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
of looks like a multiplayer map and

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.370 
of looks like a multiplayer map and
maybe<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:34.000> new<00:02:34.210> game<00:02:34.450> mode<00:02:34.660> I'm<00:02:34.810> hearing<00:02:35.110> people

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
maybe a new game mode I'm hearing people

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.160 
maybe a new game mode I'm hearing people
saying<00:02:35.680> sort<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:35.980> like<00:02:36.160> Mike<00:02:36.430> Myers<00:02:36.730> an<00:02:37.180> actual

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
saying sort of like Mike Myers an actual

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.750 
saying sort of like Mike Myers an actual
game<00:02:38.380> mode<00:02:38.560> of<00:02:38.710> Michael<00:02:39.040> Myers<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.580> would<00:02:39.670> be

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
game mode of Michael Myers that would be

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.660 
game mode of Michael Myers that would be
fantastic<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:41.680> would<00:02:41.770> be<00:02:41.830> fun<00:02:42.010> even<00:02:42.460> if<00:02:42.550> it's

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
fantastic that would be fun even if it's

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.820 
fantastic that would be fun even if it's
not<00:02:42.790> extinction<00:02:43.330> this<00:02:43.960> kind<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.410> looks<00:02:44.470> like<00:02:44.710> a

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
not extinction this kind of looks like a

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.200 
not extinction this kind of looks like a
cool<00:02:45.100> idea<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.700> could<00:02:45.880> be<00:02:46.000> like<00:02:46.180> a

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
cool idea it could be like a

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.060 
cool idea it could be like a
hide-and-seek<00:02:46.630> thing<00:02:47.290> have<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:47.560> seen<00:02:47.920> people

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
hide-and-seek thing have you seen people

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.380 
hide-and-seek thing have you seen people
talking<00:02:48.430> about<00:02:48.580> that<00:02:48.730> but<00:02:48.880> I<00:02:48.910> just<00:02:49.120> wanted<00:02:49.330> to

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
talking about that but I just wanted to

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.060 
talking about that but I just wanted to
throw<00:02:49.540> out<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.900> extinction<00:02:50.410> thing<00:02:50.560> first<00:02:50.830> and

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
throw out the extinction thing first and

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.890

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
then talk about this sort of as an

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.870
