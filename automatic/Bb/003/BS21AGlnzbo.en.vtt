Hello friends, subscribers of my channel! In their past videos

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.130
I have often mentioned transparent and opaque paint

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.880
And the viewers have a question about this

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.710
to which I will answer you now.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.970
First, let's understand what is covering and transparent paint.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.140
and what is the difference between them? All acrylic paints are produced

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.730
in 2 main bases. In the first tank is

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.980
covering base. It often has a thick sour cream.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.829
In the second tank there is

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.829
a transparent, glazing base. It has a liquid substance,

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.129
similar to milk jelly. Now I will show you

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.170
on a sheet of cardboard covering ability of these paints.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.240
The first will apply a transparent paint. As you can see,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.399
the bottom color of the cardboard shines through it. It is used

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.950
for tinting dark colors and does not require a large amount of toner.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.380
Therefore, this base is good for glaze.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.170
Next, apply a covering paint. It is used for tinting

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.130
light shades, because white,

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.369
present in its composition absorbs the color of the toner. It is impossible

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.720
to make glaze. If we mix these two bases,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.020
we get a translucent paint. Its covering properties

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.329
will depend on the proportion in which you mix them.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.970
Lessirous coatings are

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.049
translucent and transparent paints. Applying that,

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.380
you do not hide the bottom color, but rather, change it,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.159
get additional rich color shades.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.729
The covering paints applied with a thin layer on any

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.440
surface make it completely invisible.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.569
This is their difference! Now I will tell you how

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.260
these colors are tinted. We will select the color to the ceramic

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.080
mosaic. Concentrated toners

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.330
are purchased from the decorative coatings shop.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.020
They can be stored in small pipette bottles

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.970
or in plastic jars with lids tightly closed.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.819
Tip: when buying toner, ask the seller not to add

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.120
white to the color, because This leads to a higher cost of the material

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.590
and to a light color. You will be enough white, contained

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.599
in acrylic paints. To begin with, let's take 3 colors

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:05.790
of toner: umber, red-brown and ocher.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.840
Then pour the transparent paint in a plastic jar.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.959
Next, add a little covering paint with a palette knife.

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.709
In the next step, mix

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.440
everything thoroughly. Using a pipette,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.580
we take umber concentrate, drip a few drops into the paint

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.150
and begin to mix. Along the way, add a few more drops

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.310
until we get the shade we need.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.190
Toner can also be taken with a palette knife. Gradually add

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.019
ocher to the paint, red-brown concentrate

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.400
and continue to mix everything well.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.480
Now we will paint on a piece of paper next to the mosaic

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.670
and see the resulting color. If we do not fall into it,

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.170
then add some more toner. And if you

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.260
get a dark shade, you can add covering paint

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.640
Attention - when tinting should be borne

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.940
in mind that when drying acrylic, it darkens

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.740
by one or two tones. Check the color on a piece

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.840
of paper again. If it fits, then finish the tinting.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.639
So I made all the colors

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.720
for the ceramic mosaic that you

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.960
see on your screen. Now the most important thing!

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.400
The paint must be closed with a cap and a marker. Write

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.650
all the codes for the toners that were used.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.110
If you need to repeat the color, then you will do

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.810
it easily with your notes. As a result,

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.490
we can use the prepared paint in our work.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.110
At this, my master class came to an end.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.050
If you have any questions, write them in the comments.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.110
