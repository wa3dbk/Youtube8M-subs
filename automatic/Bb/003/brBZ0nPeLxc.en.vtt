00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
but I'll get back with details on those

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.600 
but I'll get back with details on those
this<00:03:29.140> is<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:29.320> screen<00:03:29.620> shot<00:03:29.650> is<00:03:29.860> also<00:03:30.160> another

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
this is a screen shot is also another

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.400 
this is a screen shot is also another
one<00:03:30.850> I'm<00:03:31.000> not<00:03:31.239> sure<00:03:31.360> if<00:03:31.450> this<00:03:31.570> is<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.780> hospital

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
one I'm not sure if this is a hospital

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.990 
one I'm not sure if this is a hospital
it<00:03:32.590> kind<00:03:32.830> of<00:03:32.920> looks<00:03:33.160> like<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.519> because<00:03:33.730> I<00:03:33.790> can

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
it kind of looks like it because I can

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.240 
it kind of looks like it because I can
see<00:03:34.209> an<00:03:34.330> emergency<00:03:34.930> exit<00:03:35.110> down<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.830> hallway

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
but the flashlight and just the ambience

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.660 
but the flashlight and just the ambience
of<00:03:38.650> this<00:03:38.799> game<00:03:39.010> is<00:03:39.220> ridiculous

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
of this game is ridiculous

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.150

other screenshots the ones that look
more<00:04:52.160> blurry<00:04:52.610> because<00:04:53.240> it<00:04:53.360> gives<00:04:53.720> more<00:04:54.200> of<00:04:54.260> a

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
more blurry because it gives more of a

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.200 
more blurry because it gives more of a
scary<00:04:54.800> ambience<00:04:55.340> to<00:04:55.460> the<00:04:55.580> game<00:04:55.760> and<00:04:56.000> it<00:04:56.060> just
