00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
have caught the SS by 1830 see here it's

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.859 
have caught the SS by 1830 see here it's
pretty<00:00:19.080> much<00:00:19.260> identical<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.359> time<00:00:21.359> on<00:00:21.600> X

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869

look like there's a CD inside and we
 appear<00:02:24.090> very<00:02:25.090> bare<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.680> is<00:02:27.100> all

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.650 

so<00:03:20.720> there<00:03:21.050> we<00:03:21.200> have<00:03:21.230> it

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
so there we have it

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.180 
so there we have it
let's<00:03:23.660> check<00:03:24.050> the<00:03:24.200> battery<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:24.770> massive

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
let's check the battery a massive

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.580 
let's check the battery a massive
capacity<00:03:26.290> so<00:03:27.290> Barry<00:03:28.069> is<00:03:28.310> 5,800<00:03:29.300> milliamp<00:03:29.959> c-23

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
capacity so Barry is 5,800 milliamp c-23

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.140 
capacity so Barry is 5,800 milliamp c-23
what<00:03:31.370> our<00:03:31.610> ten<00:03:32.150> point<00:03:32.390> nine<00:03:32.420> volts<00:03:32.569> slit

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
what our ten point nine volts slit

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:41.229 
what our ten point nine volts slit
that's<00:03:35.150> high<00:03:35.450> capacity<00:03:36.020> than<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:38.200> last<00:03:40.239> what

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
that's high capacity than the last what

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.940 
that's high capacity than the last what
will<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:41.510> use<00:03:41.540> of<00:03:42.349> these<00:03:42.590> the
