00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
goes off so let's just start building

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.820 
goes off so let's just start building
this<00:00:15.330> really<00:00:15.540> quickly<00:00:15.750> cuz<00:00:16.020> it's<00:00:16.170> very<00:00:16.230> simple

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
this really quickly cuz it's very simple

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.890 
this really quickly cuz it's very simple
to<00:00:16.920> build<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.550> what<00:00:17.760> we're<00:00:17.850> gonna<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.330> 4<00:00:18.750> by<00:00:18.869> 4

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
to build so what we're gonna is a 4 by 4

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.380 
to build so what we're gonna is a 4 by 4
spacing<00:00:19.680> we're<00:00:20.609> gonna<00:00:20.699> put<00:00:20.910> two<00:00:21.060> blocks<00:00:21.270> down

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
spacing we're gonna put two blocks down

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.710 
spacing we're gonna put two blocks down
in<00:00:21.689> front<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.580> blocked<00:00:23.580> over<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.180> side<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
in front I blocked over to the side and

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.970 
in front I blocked over to the side and
then<00:00:25.050> we're<00:00:25.140> gonna<00:00:25.260> come<00:00:25.410> over<00:00:25.439> from<00:00:25.859> this

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
then we're gonna come over from this

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.050 
then we're gonna come over from this
block<00:00:26.160> over<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.400> side<00:00:26.550> come<00:00:26.699> up<00:00:26.820> two<00:00:26.939> blocks

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
it I like to just keep it right next to

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.620 
it I like to just keep it right next to
it<00:02:00.340> consists<00:02:00.670> of<00:02:00.760> all<00:02:00.850> I'm<00:02:00.940> using<00:02:01.060> it<00:02:01.330> for<00:02:01.360> is

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
it consists of all I'm using it for is

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.540 
it consists of all I'm using it for is
the<00:02:01.780> TVs<00:02:02.110> you<00:02:02.710> can<00:02:02.860> use<00:02:02.980> this<00:02:03.100> silent<00:02:03.460> T

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
the TVs you can use this silent T

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.400 
the TVs you can use this silent T
flip-flop<00:02:03.760> for<00:02:04.210> anything<00:02:04.540> you<00:02:05.020> don't<00:02:05.110> have<00:02:05.320> to

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
flip-flop for anything you don't have to

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.890 
flip-flop for anything you don't have to
use<00:02:05.500> it<00:02:05.530> for<00:02:05.740> TV<00:02:05.860> but<00:02:06.430> so<00:02:06.700> now<00:02:07.360> where<00:02:07.660> is<00:02:07.780> our

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
use it for TV but so now where is our

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.600 
use it for TV but so now where is our
input<00:02:08.380> block<00:02:08.560> this<00:02:08.860> is<00:02:08.920> our<00:02:09.190> input<00:02:09.310> block

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
input block this is our input block

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.720 
input block this is our input block
right<00:02:09.910> here<00:02:12.030> right<00:02:13.030> here<00:02:13.360> is<00:02:13.480> our<00:02:13.630> input<00:02:13.780> block

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
right here right here is our input block

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.449 
right here right here is our input block
so<00:02:15.730> if<00:02:15.820> I<00:02:15.880> put<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.120> button<00:02:16.390> here<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.830> torch<00:02:18.100> will

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
so if I put a button here the torch will

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.270 
so if I put a button here the torch will
turn<00:02:18.670> off<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:20.200> sternum<00:02:20.560> off<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.770> lamps<00:02:21.100> and

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
turn off the sternum off the lamps and

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.300 
turn off the sternum off the lamps and
if<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.150> click<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.510> again<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:23.680> lamps<00:02:23.980> will<00:02:24.130> come

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
if I click it again the lamps will come

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.940 
if I click it again the lamps will come
on<00:02:25.050> so<00:02:26.050> now<00:02:26.200> all<00:02:26.350> we<00:02:26.410> have<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.560> do<00:02:26.709> is<00:02:26.800> put<00:02:26.920> a

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
on so now all we have to do is put a

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.940 
on so now all we have to do is put a
repeater<00:02:27.340> going<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.820> this<00:02:27.940> block<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:29.230> we<00:02:29.800> can

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
repeater going to this block and we can

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.150 
repeater going to this block and we can
bring<00:02:30.100> it<00:02:30.220> wherever<00:02:30.340> we<00:02:30.520> want<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.890> I'm<00:02:32.950> just

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
bring it wherever we want so I'm just
