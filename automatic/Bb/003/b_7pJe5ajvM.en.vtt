just<00:04:43.910> not<00:04:44.420> true<00:04:45.790> do<00:04:46.790> you<00:04:46.940> need<00:04:47.090> more<00:04:47.300> evidence

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
just not true do you need more evidence

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.420 
just not true do you need more evidence
commercial<00:04:48.260> dog<00:04:48.380> food<00:04:48.620> is<00:04:48.800> cutting<00:04:49.190> the<00:04:49.250> lives

okay<00:04:51.320> then<00:04:51.500> what<00:04:52.160> do<00:04:52.310> you<00:04:52.370> think<00:04:52.790> is<00:04:52.970> the

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
okay then what do you think is the

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.220 
okay then what do you think is the
average<00:04:53.480> lifespan<00:04:53.870> of<00:04:54.139> a<00:04:54.380> dog<00:04:54.590> in<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:54.830> US<00:04:56.230> I'll

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
average lifespan of a dog in the US I'll

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.310 
average lifespan of a dog in the US I'll
tell<00:04:57.560> you<00:04:57.680> it's<00:04:57.920> 11<00:04:58.370> years<00:04:58.639> okay<00:04:59.570> then<00:04:59.900> what<00:05:00.200> do

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
tell you it's 11 years okay then what do

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.710 
tell you it's 11 years okay then what do
you<00:05:00.350> think<00:05:00.650> is<00:05:00.830> the<00:05:00.889> potential<00:05:01.460> lifespan<00:05:02.450> of<00:05:02.480> a

the<00:05:36.830> answer<00:05:37.250> is<00:05:37.640> obvious<00:05:38.410> its<00:05:39.410> food<00:05:39.940> food<00:05:40.940> is
