00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
you could make these with two holes

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.000 
you could make these with two holes
either<00:03:00.510> end<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:01.019> start<00:03:01.320> off<00:03:01.500> with<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.860> just

either end to start off with and just
put<00:03:02.160> little<00:03:02.280> covers<00:03:02.730> on<00:03:02.880> them<00:03:03.019> but<00:03:04.019> anyway

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
put little covers on them but anyway

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.990 
put little covers on them but anyway
it's<00:03:04.560> not<00:03:04.709> too<00:03:04.860> hard<00:03:05.100> to<00:03:05.190> drill<00:03:05.430> holes<00:03:05.610> in<00:03:05.850> them

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
it's not too hard to drill holes in them

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.820 
it's not too hard to drill holes in them
so<00:03:07.190> that's<00:03:08.190> where<00:03:08.370> I'm<00:03:08.459> up<00:03:08.610> two<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.910> those<00:03:09.830> I'm

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
so that's where I'm up two of those I'm

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:17.030 
so that's where I'm up two of those I'm
waiting<00:03:11.250> on<00:03:11.340> some<00:03:11.400> oil<00:03:12.269> cup<00:03:14.000> magnetic<00:03:16.040> circuit

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
waiting on some oil cup magnetic circuit

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.289 
waiting on some oil cup magnetic circuit
breakers<00:03:17.430> I'm<00:03:17.580> going<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.760> be<00:03:17.880> testing

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
breakers I'm going to be testing

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.890 
breakers I'm going to be testing
underneath<00:03:18.690> these

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:30.290 

hopefully<00:03:25.950> whiskey's<00:03:26.950> right<00:03:28.020> damn<00:03:29.020> cult

I'm tingle bumpy no ok now get this all

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.710 
I'm tingle bumpy no ok now get this all
done<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:56.520> this<00:03:57.520> part<00:03:57.790> all<00:03:57.970> back<00:03:58.180> up<00:03:58.360> and<00:03:58.570> going

done and this part all back up and going

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.260 
done and this part all back up and going
again<00:03:59.580> they're<00:04:00.580> not<00:04:00.730> going<00:04:00.880> to<00:04:00.940> concentrate

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
again they're not going to concentrate

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.340 
again they're not going to concentrate
on<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.810> turbine<00:04:02.640> now<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.730> turbine

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
on the turbine now the turbine

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.960 
on the turbine now the turbine
controller<00:04:05.350> is<00:04:06.190> all<00:04:06.400> going<00:04:06.550> to<00:04:06.610> go<00:04:06.760> in<00:04:06.880> that

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
controller is all going to go in that

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.720 
controller is all going to go in that
piece<00:04:07.240> of<00:04:07.390> wall<00:04:07.510> right<00:04:07.780> there<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:09.250> Clipper

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
piece of wall right there the Clipper

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.410 
piece of wall right there the Clipper
and<00:04:09.760> all<00:04:10.270> that<00:04:14.520> so<00:04:15.520> as<00:04:15.580> you<00:04:15.730> can<00:04:15.850> see<00:04:15.910> with<00:04:16.299> this

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
and all that so as you can see with this

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.250 
and all that so as you can see with this
wind<00:04:16.720> here

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
wind here

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.449 
wind here
I<00:04:17.290> mean<00:04:18.250> I'd<00:04:18.430> easily<00:04:19.320> be<00:04:20.320> covering<00:04:20.769> my<00:04:20.950> usage

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
I mean I'd easily be covering my usage

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.130 
I mean I'd easily be covering my usage
and<00:04:21.640> everything<00:04:22.060> today<00:04:22.210> with<00:04:22.540> this<00:04:22.690> wind<00:04:22.960> and

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
and everything today with this wind and

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.810 
and everything today with this wind and
that<00:04:23.260> turbine<00:04:24.960> anyway<00:04:25.960> there's<00:04:26.200> a<00:04:26.260> an<00:04:27.070> update

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
that turbine anyway there's a an update

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.310 
that turbine anyway there's a an update
on<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.120> shadow<00:04:28.390> I<00:04:28.480> think<00:04:28.690> it's<00:04:28.840> looking<00:04:28.990> quite

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
on the shadow I think it's looking quite

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.600 
on the shadow I think it's looking quite
nice<00:04:29.820> very<00:04:30.820> neat<00:04:31.120> and<00:04:31.150> tidy<00:04:31.360> a<00:04:32.190> lot<00:04:33.190> different

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
nice very neat and tidy a lot different

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.990 
nice very neat and tidy a lot different
than<00:04:33.940> what<00:04:34.150> it<00:04:34.300> used<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:35.800> look<00:04:35.830> like<00:04:38.820> go<00:04:39.820> back

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
than what it used to look like go back

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.880 
than what it used to look like go back
to<00:04:40.060> me<00:04:40.330> selling<00:04:40.780> me<00:04:41.020> all<00:04:41.169> the<00:04:41.290> videos<00:04:41.650> and

I'm looking forward to giving those

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.140 
I'm looking forward to giving those
inverters<00:04:52.419> a<00:04:52.450> damn<00:04:52.720> good<00:04:52.930> test<00:04:53.760> what<00:04:54.760> I've<00:04:54.910> got
