strength we're gonna do a multi-part

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.430 
strength we're gonna do a multi-part
series<00:00:05.339> on<00:00:05.940> some<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.049> posterior<00:00:07.290> chain

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
series on some of the posterior chain

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.259 
series on some of the posterior chain
exercises<00:00:07.740> we<00:00:08.309> use<00:00:08.519> here<00:00:08.820> today<00:00:09.059> I'm<00:00:09.120> going<00:00:09.210> to

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
exercises we use here today I'm going to

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.430 
exercises we use here today I'm going to
start<00:00:09.480> off<00:00:09.630> with<00:00:09.809> some<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.170> bilateral

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
start off with some of the bilateral

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.950 
start off with some of the bilateral
movements<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.070> we<00:00:11.190> use<00:00:11.389> for<00:00:12.389> our<00:00:12.420> posterior

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
movements that we use for our posterior

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.270 
movements that we use for our posterior
chain<00:00:13.139> work<00:00:13.349> so<00:00:13.920> these<00:00:14.009> are<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.250> couple

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
chain work so these are a couple

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.660 
chain work so these are a couple
exercises<00:00:15.030> we<00:00:15.150> use<00:00:15.330> for<00:00:15.630> knee<00:00:15.719> flexion<00:00:16.670> one's

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
exercises we use for knee flexion one's

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.460 
exercises we use for knee flexion one's
gonna<00:00:17.910> be<00:00:18.060> an<00:00:18.240> open<00:00:18.420> kinetic<00:00:18.779> chain<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
gonna be an open kinetic chain and the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.660 
gonna be an open kinetic chain and the
other<00:00:19.500> one's<00:00:19.770> gonna<00:00:19.859> be<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.070> closed<00:00:20.279> kinetic

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
other one's gonna be a closed kinetic

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.910 
other one's gonna be a closed kinetic
chain<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.570> reason<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.080> use<00:00:22.350> those<00:00:22.859> as

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
chain and the reason we use those as

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.650 
chain and the reason we use those as
because<00:00:23.310> we<00:00:23.430> varied<00:00:23.789> it's<00:00:23.939> good<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.269> Barre<00:00:24.480> up

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
because we varied it's good to Barre up

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.810 
because we varied it's good to Barre up

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
this is another exercise we use for knee

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.539 
this is another exercise we use for knee
flexion<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.560> if<00:02:02.770> you<00:02:02.859> have<00:02:02.979> access<00:02:03.340> to<00:02:03.369> a

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
flexion so if you have access to a

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.550 
flexion so if you have access to a
machine<00:02:03.729> like<00:02:04.060> this<00:02:04.210> it's<00:02:04.689> a<00:02:04.899> it's<00:02:04.929> a<00:02:05.259> good<00:02:05.380> one

machine like this it's a it's a good one
to<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.850> use<00:02:07.210> for<00:02:07.359> knee<00:02:07.479> flexion<00:02:07.719> so<00:02:07.990> in<00:02:08.110> this

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
to to use for knee flexion so in this

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.259 
to to use for knee flexion so in this
one<00:02:08.440> your<00:02:09.160> knees<00:02:09.310> gonna<00:02:09.550> be<00:02:09.640> fixed<00:02:10.030> and<00:02:10.179> the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
one your knees gonna be fixed and the

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.729 
one your knees gonna be fixed and the
loads<00:02:10.539> going<00:02:10.599> to<00:02:10.720> be<00:02:10.899> at<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.560> distal<00:02:11.920> end<00:02:12.129> of

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.300 
all right so eccentric glute-ham raise
your<00:02:19.000> ankles<00:02:19.360> fix<00:02:19.599> and<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.890> low<00:02:21.010> is<00:02:21.069> going<00:02:21.250> to

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
your ankles fix and the low is going to

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.839 
your ankles fix and the low is going to
be<00:02:21.459> at<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:22.060> proximal<00:02:22.510> end<00:02:22.720> of<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.580> lower<00:02:24.580> leg

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
be at the proximal end of the lower leg

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.059 
be at the proximal end of the lower leg
this<00:02:25.420> one<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.910> hamstring<00:02:28.239> curl<00:02:28.830> okay<00:02:29.830> but<00:02:30.040> a

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
this one is a hamstring curl okay but a

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.729 
this one is a hamstring curl okay but a
couple<00:02:30.280> ways<00:02:30.519> to<00:02:30.819> kind<00:02:31.030> of<00:02:31.180> vary<00:02:31.780> this<00:02:32.019> up<00:02:32.290> is

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
couple ways to kind of vary this up is

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.750 
couple ways to kind of vary this up is
to<00:02:33.040> vary<00:02:33.280> your<00:02:33.370> foot<00:02:34.030> position<00:02:35.610> alright<00:02:36.610> so

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
to vary your foot position alright so

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.460 
to vary your foot position alright so
you<00:02:36.819> could<00:02:37.000> have<00:02:37.150> your<00:02:37.329> foot<00:02:37.630> pointed<00:02:38.349> away

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
you could have your foot pointed away

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.059 
you could have your foot pointed away
from<00:02:38.590> you

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
from you

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.440 
from you
so<00:02:39.400> plantar<00:02:40.000> flex<00:02:41.459> neutral<00:02:42.459> or<00:02:42.640> Dorsey<00:02:43.239> flex

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
so plantar flex neutral or Dorsey flex

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.509 
so plantar flex neutral or Dorsey flex
and<00:02:44.319> then<00:02:44.560> you<00:02:44.650> can<00:02:44.769> also<00:02:44.920> have<00:02:45.160> your<00:02:45.190> foot

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
and then you can also have your foot

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.420 
and then you can also have your foot
either<00:02:45.700> rotated<00:02:46.299> in<00:02:46.709> neutral<00:02:47.709> or<00:02:47.920> rotate<00:02:48.340> it

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
either rotated in neutral or rotate it

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.229 
either rotated in neutral or rotate it
out<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:49.660> three<00:02:50.440> different<00:02:50.620> positions<00:02:50.920> of<00:02:51.370> the

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
out so three different positions of the

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.509 
out so three different positions of the
foot<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:53.110> can<00:02:53.230> really<00:02:53.440> have<00:02:53.590> some<00:02:53.620> very<00:02:54.370> the

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
foot you can really have some very the

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.309 
foot you can really have some very the
combination<00:02:55.090> of<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.510> foot<00:02:55.690> position<00:02:56.079> to

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
combination of the foot position to

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.080 
combination of the foot position to
challenge<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.920> hamstrings<00:02:57.549> in<00:02:57.700> a<00:02:57.790> different

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
challenge the hamstrings in a different

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.240 
challenge the hamstrings in a different
way<00:02:58.180> two<00:02:58.720> exercises<00:02:59.200> that<00:02:59.829> I'm<00:02:59.920> going<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.099> show

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
way two exercises that I'm going to show

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.390 
way two exercises that I'm going to show
you<00:03:00.310> are<00:03:00.760> for<00:03:01.329> hip<00:03:01.510> extension<00:03:02.130> so<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.250> last

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
you are for hip extension so the last

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.220 
you are for hip extension so the last
two<00:03:03.609> I<00:03:03.880> showed<00:03:04.180> you<00:03:04.359> four<00:03:04.540> for<00:03:04.870> knee<00:03:04.989> flexion

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
two I showed you four for knee flexion

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.949 
two I showed you four for knee flexion
the<00:03:05.530> hip<00:03:06.489> extent<00:03:06.850> these<00:03:07.060> these<00:03:07.389> two<00:03:07.600> movements

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
the hip extent these these two movements

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.660 
the hip extent these these two movements
for<00:03:08.049> hip<00:03:08.170> extension<00:03:08.680> are<00:03:08.889> much<00:03:09.100> more<00:03:09.250> popular

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
for hip extension are much more popular

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.550 
for hip extension are much more popular
for<00:03:09.819> weight<00:03:10.000> lifting<00:03:10.329> because<00:03:11.200> you<00:03:11.410> don't

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
for weight lifting because you don't

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.530 
for weight lifting because you don't
really<00:03:11.709> need<00:03:11.980> knee<00:03:12.790> flexion<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.329> weight

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
really need knee flexion and weight

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.690 
really need knee flexion and weight
lifting<00:03:13.870> but<00:03:14.440> as<00:03:14.709> far<00:03:14.920> as<00:03:14.950> athletics<00:03:15.489> goes

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
lifting but as far as athletics goes

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.300 
lifting but as far as athletics goes
it's<00:03:16.540> good<00:03:16.690> to<00:03:16.750> use<00:03:16.870> new<00:03:17.079> flexion<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:17.650> hip

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
it's good to use new flexion and hip

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.470 
it's good to use new flexion and hip
extension<00:03:18.819> order<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.120> challenge<00:03:19.299> the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
extension order to challenge the

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.830 
extension order to challenge the
hamstrings<00:03:20.160> so<00:03:21.160> these<00:03:21.340> two<00:03:21.519> exercises<00:03:21.840> are

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
hamstrings so these two exercises are

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.440 
hamstrings so these two exercises are
going<00:03:23.049> to<00:03:23.109> be<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.380> reverse<00:03:23.500> Hyper's<00:03:24.099> and<00:03:24.450> the

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
going to be the reverse Hyper's and the

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.509 
going to be the reverse Hyper's and the
back<00:03:25.599> extension<00:03:26.170> all<00:03:26.560> right<00:03:26.709> this<00:03:27.160> reverse

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
back extension all right this reverse

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.400 
back extension all right this reverse
hyper<00:03:28.180> machine<00:03:28.540> it's<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.840> very<00:03:29.019> rare<00:03:29.230> machine

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
hyper machine it's a very rare machine

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.710 
hyper machine it's a very rare machine
to<00:03:29.799> see<00:03:29.950> in<00:03:30.099> gyms<00:03:30.340> but<00:03:30.940> if<00:03:31.090> you<00:03:31.180> have<00:03:31.329> access<00:03:31.690> to

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
to see in gyms but if you have access to

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.870 
to see in gyms but if you have access to
one<00:03:31.989> it's<00:03:32.470> an<00:03:32.590> extremely<00:03:32.919> invaluable<00:03:33.340> machine

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
one it's an extremely invaluable machine

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.979 
one it's an extremely invaluable machine
so<00:03:34.480> that<00:03:35.079> would<00:03:35.200> be<00:03:35.290> a<00:03:35.319> good<00:03:35.530> one<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.980> have<00:03:36.989> in

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
so that would be a good one to have in

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.229 
so that would be a good one to have in
your<00:03:38.200> gym<00:03:38.349> so<00:03:38.980> the<00:03:39.340> difference<00:03:39.669> between<00:03:39.819> the

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
your gym so the difference between the

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.420 
your gym so the difference between the
two<00:03:40.419> right<00:03:41.349> there's<00:03:41.650> they're<00:03:41.859> both<00:03:42.040> for<00:03:42.310> hip

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
two right there's they're both for hip

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.309 
two right there's they're both for hip
extension<00:03:42.970> but<00:03:43.239> in<00:03:43.359> this<00:03:43.480> one<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.930> torso<00:03:44.260> is

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
extension but in this one the torso is

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.720 
extension but in this one the torso is
going<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:44.500> be<00:03:44.620> fixed<00:03:44.980> and<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.340> legs<00:03:45.579> are

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
going to be fixed and the legs are

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.839 
going to be fixed and the legs are
moving<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:46.180> back<00:03:47.079> extension<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:48.250> lower<00:03:48.579> body

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
moving and back extension the lower body

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.370 
moving and back extension the lower body
is<00:03:48.970> going<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.180> be<00:03:49.269> fixed<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.900> torso<00:03:50.260> is

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
is going to be fixed and the torso is

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.190 
is going to be fixed and the torso is
moving<00:03:50.709> so<00:03:50.919> that's<00:03:51.069> you<00:03:52.000> know<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.269> example<00:03:52.900> of

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
moving so that's you know the example of

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.960 
moving so that's you know the example of
a<00:03:53.290> open<00:03:54.010> kinetic<00:03:54.280> chain<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.730> a<00:03:54.790> closed

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
a open kinetic chain and a closed

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.479 
a open kinetic chain and a closed
kinetic<00:03:55.329> chain<00:03:55.359> two<00:03:55.900> ways<00:03:56.139> two<00:03:56.889> different

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
kinetic chain two ways two different

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.050 
kinetic chain two ways two different
ways<00:03:57.639> to<00:03:58.239> load<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:59.470> posterior<00:03:59.919> chain<00:04:00.130> and<00:04:00.880> so

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
ways to load the posterior chain and so

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.879 
ways to load the posterior chain and so
in<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.599> next<00:04:01.720> few<00:04:01.870> Clips<00:04:02.169> we're<00:04:02.470> going<00:04:02.709> to

some<00:04:03.580> examples<00:04:04.030> of<00:04:04.269> these<00:04:05.019> two<00:04:05.200> movements

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
some examples of these two movements
