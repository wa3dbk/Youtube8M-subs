00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
information hopefully some examples of

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.250 
information hopefully some examples of
that<00:00:37.460> approach<00:00:38.300> to<00:00:38.330> playing<00:00:38.690> that<00:00:38.900> I<00:00:38.930> was<00:00:39.110> just

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
that approach to playing that I was just

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.680 
that approach to playing that I was just
think<00:00:39.770> about<00:00:39.890> this<00:00:40.190> is<00:00:40.460> that<00:00:40.700> playing

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
think about this is that playing

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.000 
think about this is that playing
melodies<00:00:42.200> with<00:00:42.739> chord<00:00:43.130> Allah<00:00:43.370> comes<00:00:43.700> on<00:00:45.010> to

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
melodies with chord Allah comes on to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.520 
melodies with chord Allah comes on to
note<00:00:46.220> chords<00:00:46.790> just<00:00:47.150> little<00:00:47.720> brief<00:00:48.020> chords

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
note chords just little brief chords

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
note chords just little brief chords
that<00:00:49.400> are<00:00:49.870> essentially<00:00:50.870> the<00:00:51.769> three<00:00:52.190> and<00:00:52.430> the

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
that are essentially the three and the

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.119 
that are essentially the three and the
seven<00:00:52.970> of<00:00:53.390> a<00:00:53.720> particular<00:00:54.290> chord<00:00:54.620> of<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.830> court

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
seven of a particular chord of the court

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:56.890 
seven of a particular chord of the court
I<00:00:55.220> call<00:00:55.400> them<00:00:55.580> essence<00:00:56.000> chords<00:00:56.480> by<00:00:56.660> the<00:00:56.720> way

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
I call them essence chords by the way

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.720 
I call them essence chords by the way
because<00:00:57.199> that<00:00:57.410> to<00:00:57.980> me<00:00:58.010> they<00:00:58.250> sound<00:00:58.489> like<00:00:58.519> the

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
because that to me they sound like the

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.470 
because that to me they sound like the
essence<00:00:59.030> of<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.269> chord<00:01:04.120> they<00:01:05.120> are<00:01:05.269> useful

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
essence of the chord they are useful

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.390 
essence of the chord they are useful
here<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:06.230> many<00:01:06.440> of<00:01:06.560> you<00:01:06.710> already<00:01:06.890> know<00:01:07.100> them

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
here and many of you already know them

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.270 
here and many of you already know them
there<00:01:07.640> I<00:01:07.670> would<00:01:07.970> imagine<00:01:08.530> but<00:01:09.530> the<00:01:09.950> you're

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
there I would imagine but the you're

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.130 
there I would imagine but the you're
limited<00:01:10.700> in<00:01:10.790> terms<00:01:11.000> of<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.390> number<00:01:11.659> of<00:01:11.690> melody

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
limited in terms of the number of melody

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.200 
limited in terms of the number of melody
notes<00:01:12.350> that<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.680> have<00:01:12.830> access<00:01:13.250> to<00:01:13.280> when

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
notes that you have access to when

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.719 
notes that you have access to when
you're<00:01:14.360> playing<00:01:14.600> on<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:14.810> D<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:15.260> g<00:01:15.530> string<00:01:15.979> but

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
you're playing on the D and g string but

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.350 
you're playing on the D and g string but
if<00:01:16.850> you<00:01:16.970> move<00:01:17.180> five<00:01:18.170> frets<00:01:18.680> up<00:01:18.979> and<00:01:19.550> one<00:01:19.940> set<00:01:20.240> of

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
if you move five frets up and one set of

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.640 
if you move five frets up and one set of
strings<00:01:20.659> down<00:01:21.070> to<00:01:22.070> get<00:01:22.280> your<00:01:22.540> chords<00:01:23.540> here<00:01:23.960> G

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
strings down to get your chords here G

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.370 
strings down to get your chords here G
major<00:01:24.830> 7<00:01:25.070> a<00:01:25.810> minor

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.340 

then<00:01:32.280> above<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:33.539> have<00:01:33.570> one<00:01:33.840> more<00:01:34.020> string

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
then above we have one more string

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.319 
then above we have one more string
really<00:01:34.710> above<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.219> so<00:01:35.399> we<00:01:35.490> can<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.700> three

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
really above that so we can have three

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.830 
really above that so we can have three
strings<00:01:37.259> worth<00:01:37.469> of<00:01:37.680> melody<00:01:38.100> notes<00:01:38.840> which

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
strings worth of melody notes which

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.859 
strings worth of melody notes which
gives<00:01:40.110> us<00:01:40.259> about<00:01:40.409> another<00:01:41.240> maybe<00:01:42.240> fifth<00:01:42.630> or

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
gives us about another maybe fifth or

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.230 
gives us about another maybe fifth or
more<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.590> reimagine<00:01:44.280> there's<00:01:44.429> a<00:01:44.520> soloist<00:01:44.939> and

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
more of reimagine there's a soloist and

I<00:02:07.869> can<00:02:08.869> go<00:02:08.990> about<00:02:09.170> up<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.679> root<00:02:09.890> octave<00:02:10.700> and

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
I can go about up to the root octave and

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.000 
I can go about up to the root octave and
have<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.000> higher<00:02:14.500> I'm<00:02:15.500> gonna<00:02:15.650> have<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:15.860> change

have a higher I'm gonna have to change
my<00:02:16.130> finger<00:02:16.550> eight<00:02:19.840> similarly<00:02:20.840> from<00:02:21.140> the

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
my finger eight similarly from the

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:28.630 
my finger eight similarly from the
fourth<00:02:21.620> degree<00:02:21.890> of<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.310> two<00:02:22.489> core<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:28.430> he<00:02:28.489> can

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
fourth degree of the two core and he can

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.940 
fourth degree of the two core and he can
maybe<00:02:28.760> even<00:02:29.150> go<00:02:29.239> to<00:02:29.300> here

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
maybe even go to here

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.990 
maybe even go to here
and<00:02:31.040> then<00:02:32.030> on<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.270> five<00:02:32.480> chord<00:02:33.459> we<00:02:34.459> can<00:02:34.640> start

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
and then on the five chord we can start

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.910 
and then on the five chord we can start
say<00:02:35.360> maybe<00:02:35.720> from<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.110> root<00:02:38.530> myself<00:02:39.530> for<00:02:39.739> now<00:02:39.890> I

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
say maybe from the root myself for now I

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.580 
say maybe from the root myself for now I
just<00:02:40.130> like<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.670> spend<00:02:40.910> a<00:02:41.000> little<00:02:41.540> it'll<00:02:41.720> send
