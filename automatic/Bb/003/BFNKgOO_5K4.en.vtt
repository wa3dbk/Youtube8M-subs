that<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.700> wasn't<00:01:20.970> quite<00:01:21.330> big<00:01:21.659> enough<00:01:21.689> to

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
that it just wasn't quite big enough to

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.450 
that it just wasn't quite big enough to
stuff<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:24.020> computer<00:01:25.070> motherboard<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.250> mean

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
stuff a computer motherboard and I mean

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.499 
stuff a computer motherboard and I mean
I<00:01:26.520> could<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.150> would<00:01:27.330> have<00:01:27.420> been

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
I could have but it would have been

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.910 
I could have but it would have been
pretty<00:01:27.659> tight<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.320> actually<00:01:28.530> found<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
pretty tight so I actually found the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.620 
pretty tight so I actually found the
best<00:01:29.159> thing<00:01:29.340> was<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:30.090> stick<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> tower

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
best thing was just stick the tower

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.530 
best thing was just stick the tower
behind<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.729> good<00:01:32.729> thing<00:01:32.850> about<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.180> i<00:01:33.420> can

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
behind it good thing about that is i can

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.940 
behind it good thing about that is i can
pretty<00:01:33.900> much<00:01:33.960> easily<00:01:34.229> switch<00:01:34.619> out<00:01:34.770> that

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
pretty much easily switch out that

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.359 
pretty much easily switch out that
system<00:01:35.310> down<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.520> road<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:35.909> i<00:01:36.000> want<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:37.369> use

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
system down the road if i want to use

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.910 
system down the road if i want to use
the<00:01:38.579> hyperspin<00:01:39.000> front<00:01:39.360> end<00:01:39.740> currently<00:01:40.740> just

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
the hyperspin front end currently just

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.929 
the hyperspin front end currently just
running<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:42.530> virtual<00:01:43.530> pinball<00:01:43.920> tables<00:01:44.369> about

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
running a virtual pinball tables about

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.520 
running a virtual pinball tables about
one<00:01:45.149> hundred<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.420> fifteen<00:01:45.899> hundred<00:01:46.170> sixteen

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
one hundred and fifteen hundred sixteen

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.969 
one hundred and fifteen hundred sixteen
max<00:01:46.710> 116<00:01:47.869> so<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.170> mean<00:01:49.500> software<00:01:50.100> wise<00:01:51.979> that's

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
max 116 so I mean software wise that's

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.830 
max 116 so I mean software wise that's
what<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.250> running<00:01:53.640> pretty<00:01:53.909> much<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
what it's running pretty much the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.950 
what it's running pretty much the
standard<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.320> suppose<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.840> they're<00:01:57.840> not

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
standard I suppose but the they're not

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.240 
standard I suppose but the they're not
pretty<00:01:58.110> sweet<00:01:58.579> on<00:01:59.579> the<00:02:00.030> inside<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.439> tried<00:02:02.159> to

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
pretty sweet on the inside is I tried to

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.920 
pretty sweet on the inside is I tried to
make<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.549> as<00:02:02.729> affordable<00:02:03.119> as<00:02:03.180> possible<00:02:03.270> so

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
make this as affordable as possible so

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.730 
make this as affordable as possible so
instead<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.710> using

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
instead of using

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.330 
instead of using
am<00:02:05.920> I<00:02:07.200> came<00:02:08.200> camping<00:02:08.709> with<00:02:08.950> those<00:02:09.039> are<00:02:09.160> called

now the keyboard emulation boards I pack
ibly<00:02:13.030> or<00:02:13.209> something<00:02:13.420> like<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.540> anyone<00:02:14.530> i

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.199 
ibly or something like that anyone i
just<00:02:14.800> decided<00:02:15.310> not<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.640> go<00:02:15.760> with<00:02:15.790> that<00:02:15.970> route

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
just decided not to go with that route

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.780 
just decided not to go with that route
instead<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.750> went<00:02:16.959> with<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:18.150> little<00:02:19.150> USB<00:02:20.790> a

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
instead I went with a little USB a

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.360 
instead I went with a little USB a
little<00:02:22.630> USB<00:02:22.900> gamepad<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.530> just<00:02:24.010> hack<00:02:24.190> the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
little USB gamepad and just hack the

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.100 
little USB gamepad and just hack the
gamepad<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:24.849> then<00:02:25.180> used<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.599> piece<00:02:26.080> of

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
gamepad and then used a piece of

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.580 
gamepad and then used a piece of
software<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.709> emulate<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.220> joy<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:28.090> keyboard

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
software to emulate the joy to keyboard

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.530 
software to emulate the joy to keyboard
kind<00:02:29.590> of<00:02:29.709> thing<00:02:29.860> emulation<00:02:30.519> everything<00:02:31.390> works

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
kind of thing emulation everything works

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.640 
kind of thing emulation everything works
out<00:02:31.690> great<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:33.550> got<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.730> starch<00:02:34.380> credit<00:02:35.380> button

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
out great you got a starch credit button

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.949 
out great you got a starch credit button
start<00:02:35.950> button<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.459> exit<00:02:37.300> button<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.599> exit<00:02:37.900> out

plan on switching is out for something a

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.470 
plan on switching is out for something a
little<00:02:41.170> more<00:02:41.880> appealing<00:02:42.880> instead<00:02:43.330> of<00:02:43.390> just

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
little more appealing instead of just

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.850 
little more appealing instead of just
the<00:02:43.600> generic<00:02:43.750> blues<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.350> just<00:02:44.500> happen<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:44.769> have

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
the generic blues I just happen to have

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.520 
the generic blues I just happen to have
those<00:02:45.100> on<00:02:45.220> hand<00:02:45.459> as<00:02:45.670> some<00:02:45.819> spares<00:02:46.440> from<00:02:47.440> a

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
those on hand as some spares from a

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.470 
those on hand as some spares from a
cabinet<00:02:47.890> I<00:02:47.920> worked<00:02:48.100> on<00:02:48.280> that's<00:02:49.000> pretty<00:02:49.420> much

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
cabinet I worked on that's pretty much

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.729 
cabinet I worked on that's pretty much
why<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.720> have<00:02:49.930> glue<00:02:50.080> all<00:02:50.260> around<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.590> house

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
why I have glue all around the house

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.170 
why I have glue all around the house
here<00:02:51.069> but<00:02:51.989> we're<00:02:52.989> all<00:02:53.110> around<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.440> system<00:02:54.180> so

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
here but we're all around the system so

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.370 
here but we're all around the system so
I<00:02:55.209> think<00:02:55.299> what<00:02:55.510> else<00:02:55.600> I<00:02:55.720> did<00:02:55.840> on<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.049> inside

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
I think what else I did on the inside

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.820 
I think what else I did on the inside
it's<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:57.670> little<00:02:58.120> different<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:59.620> stick<00:02:59.769> your

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
it's a little different you stick your

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.930 
it's a little different you stick your
hand<00:03:00.010> right<00:03:00.160> underneath<00:03:00.280> here<00:03:00.700> there's<00:03:00.880> a

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
hand right underneath here there's a

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.210 
hand right underneath here there's a
knob<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:01.330> sticks<00:03:01.569> down<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.769> that<00:03:02.860> controls

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
knob it sticks down and that controls

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.820 
knob it sticks down and that controls
your<00:03:03.250> audio<00:03:06.450> I'm<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.599> fan<00:03:07.810> of<00:03:07.840> controllable

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
your audio I'm a fan of controllable

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.710 
your audio I'm a fan of controllable
audio<00:03:09.130> just<00:03:09.459> because<00:03:09.760> when<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.299> comes<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:10.540> main

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
audio just because when it comes to main

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.870

or<00:03:10.989> anything<00:03:11.200> like<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.350> sometimes<00:03:12.100> some

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
or anything like that sometimes some

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.069 
or anything like that sometimes some
things<00:03:12.910> were<00:03:13.209> louder<00:03:13.390> than<00:03:13.600> others<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:13.870> you

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
things were louder than others and you

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.349 
things were louder than others and you
need<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.320> turn<00:03:14.470> them<00:03:14.620> up<00:03:15.030> basically<00:03:16.030> just<00:03:16.239> took

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
need to turn them up basically just took

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.500 
need to turn them up basically just took
an<00:03:16.480> old<00:03:17.310> compaq<00:03:18.310> or<00:03:18.579> something<00:03:19.329> like<00:03:19.450> that
