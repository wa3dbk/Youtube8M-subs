00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.450
 in the channel comments of a channel 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.429
 to be found under the rubric discussion 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.349
 Many people keep coming back 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.040
 very interesting links and hints 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.049
 given 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.480
 In this case, it's about undersea 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.730
 creatures that are unknown 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.000
 a few months ago , you already are 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.760
 a film about the part fictional 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.010
 Documentation called buddy found it works 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.760
 here around humanoid life forms in the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.410
 deep sea as I said a part fictional 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.420
 Documentation was that there is now 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.300
 to share news on the topic and 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.710
 these hints are from balu and 1 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.629
 Thanks a lot for this 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.390
 These references were as I said in the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.190
 channel comments of a channel posted 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.559
 the links are in the video 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.660
 description here is also a 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.239
 link to a video where you have a lot 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.390
 marvel at strange creatures 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.590
 and have a self-taught and self-taught 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.140
 of course only limited 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.449
 possibility so what to judge this 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.940
 tubular creatures without special 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.559
 Structure is also very similar to what 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.210
 is known and here it is the same 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.400
 several ways to explain yourself 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.340
 what this creature is about 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.369
 So could the habit of hers 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.680
 spawning in hose shape like 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.130
 this diver represents these 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.840
 certainly up to two meters long there 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.670
 especially in the deep sea 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.560
 It would be quite home 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.740
 conceivable that there are such 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.360
 Deposits are now seeing this 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.799
 creatures in the video though 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.799
 not at all like one 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.470
 collection of octopus 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.360
 So it has to be something else 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.909
 For example, it could be a 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.649
 Collection of single-celled act the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.909
 definitely to such colonies 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.250
 can arrange 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.530
 the size comparison with this diver 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.869
 which can be seen in the picture shows which 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.950
 gigantic proportions of these creatures 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.710
 can accept 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.659
 and it gets much bigger and that 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.310
 shows this picture very clearly where 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.430
 diver to push his joke 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.060
 maintains with the unsuspecting creatures 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.770
 the deep or how 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.479
 these divers here those 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.509
 tubular single colonies 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.849
 abuse as stole or scarf or 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.849
 again below to see as 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:18.700
 Ganzkörperkondom whether it is at this 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:21.849
 creatures what in the video to recognize it around 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.920
 such a site or once may be 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.170
 Of course you can act badly 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.180
 say you can just try something 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.580
 to find comparable even if it 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.410
 to any organ similar 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.970
 bulging comes or so could 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.340
 it is still a single colony 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.900
 be there is something also available at the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.850
 So they form near the 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.370
 sea ​​surface 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.530
 The situation is different with humanoids 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.390
 life forms allegedly in the 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.040
 to stop deep sea like here to 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.790
 example of the time fictional 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.290
 documentation more with bodycount 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.910
 was presented 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.650
 something would have to be proven and that 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.630
 could definitely be the case with this 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.500
 shot of an underwater robot 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:05.470
 the way on behalf of a oil company 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.470
 a platform examined in 530 meters 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.350
 depth came here to recordings where one 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.600
 subscribed to fish that are deep 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.180
 not reach the conventional boats 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.420
 because the pressure is too high 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.579
 already mentioned is the rtv 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.130
 and a bit fictional 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.019
 documentation and if there is any part 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.420
 fictional on it because it is always 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.760
 very difficult to say what now 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.090
 truth or reality 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.190
 comes close and what is invented example 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.989
 a scene this film is showed because 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.900
 these cave paintings to the 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.370
 that should already suggest 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.709
 early humans had contact 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.489
 with these humanoid life forms 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.859
 the deep sea 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.290
 to find evidence that this is 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:52.480
 around real cave drawings from one 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.310
 presto rische zeit acts me 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.470
 so far not succeeded and therefore take 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.910
 I guess it's a fiction 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.650
 However, it must also be noted 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.260
 that there are so many myths 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.709
 and say of some creatures 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.299
 there is always new species from the sea 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.670
 dealt with the documentation 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.830
 a professional 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.120
 Eighth of a film company in order 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.849
 given production 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.410
 Of course, actors were engaged around 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.269
 to occupy the main roles 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.370
 of course that gave the impression that 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.800
 everything fictional in this 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.790
 documentation 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.110
 However, there is this doctor 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.310
 robertson here from the 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.280
 main actor andre weidemann 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.770
 actually doctor was presented 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.260
 watson was the remnant of 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.540
 examine this humanoid creature 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.540
 could and still further findings to 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.240
 the topic could then be researched 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.910
 he very sanctioned flew from the university 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.130
 where he worked and his website 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.960
 was blocked and so on this 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.030
 I ask the story of the movie 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.729
 which I took out 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.220
 marine biologist dr robertson is here 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.310
 to see in this tv show and me 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.500
 please check out this worldstar hip hop point 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.510
 compact to think that is from the one 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.970
 who had uploaded the video that he 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.220
 subsequently it made in this tv 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.100
 broadcast sits next to dr robertson's 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.750
 geologist thorsten schmidt had this 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.080
 the order of the Icelandic government 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.600
 in the sea ​​between Iceland and Greenland 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.780
 to search for living things there 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.260
 drilling for oil and oil soon 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.960
 become a gas company 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.900
 that's why he has doctor watson too 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.479
 yourself as a marine biologist in one 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.760
 common submarine drove the two 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.979
 now this area off there and doctor 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.020
 Bitzen used this opportunity for one 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.580
 to send out a certain sound 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.770
 who is suspected of this 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.360
 humanoid life forms themselves 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.090
 to have been brought forth 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.600
 This little pattern was called a blog 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.919
 and there are some of these 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.200
 inexplicable sounds from the deep sea 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.860
 you can all listen to them 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.900
 are also from the no ä 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.450
 US Department of the Sea and are in the frame 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.790
 of the vans program 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.710
 I can vouch for that 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.610
 time of the film's broadcast more 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.930
 This block did not find medium as icex 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.780
 was presented 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.700
 so should shake as ice 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.500
 this noise will be sent out by 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.260
 the two scientists in the 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.480
 teaser courses might be around 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.090
 then just to attract those beings and 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.830
 actually it came to the contact that 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.510
 please refer to the video 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.690
 even if you do not understand the language 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.040
 so are the pictures then reasonably 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.380
 impressive in this tv show 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.830
 dr robertson became one more 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.960
 another incident questioned it was about here 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.910
 a night exercise and one 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.580
 Exercise where then luck was once 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:48.030
 went overboard and this now searched 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:50.460
 Cameras will record this process 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.530
 on to a maneuver review 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.870
 then to be able to do this 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.360
 Then a creature emerges 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:00.780
 and the officer is sure that it 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.060
 a lake and would be dr robertson countered 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.160
 however, that the head shape at all 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.830
 the one can not be very us because 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.840
 on the head is a kind came or one 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:13.110
 a bead and that is with seals 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.660
 unknown this head shape reminded the thing 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.120
 but much more in what 

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.260
 examination in the anatomical 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.140
 could make investigations in the 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:24.330
 Remains of a man urine creature 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:28.139
 but these remains are all 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:30.900
 confiscated so much to this 

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:33.169
 tv broadcast the most convincing pictures 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.700
 However, they come from this Russian 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:39.330
 Underwater robot taking pictures 

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:42.720
 could be 530 meters deep where a fish 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:44.880
 is harmonized by a living thing and 

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:48.300
 That can only be a humorous thing 

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:51.270
 because it is unknown choice or fish 

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:53.580
 build harpoons and those in the deep 

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.230
 You can use the links to the videos 

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.630
 are in the video description 

00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:01.760
 thus far only times I wish you 

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.760
 all the best and had both
