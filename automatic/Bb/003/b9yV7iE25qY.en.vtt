so today we're going to work out of the
oh<00:00:37.830> let's<00:00:38.830> say<00:00:38.980> that<00:00:39.129> a<00:00:39.309> minor<00:00:39.750> diatonic<00:00:40.750> maybe

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:41.589 
oh let's say that a minor diatonic maybe

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:43.829 
oh let's say that a minor diatonic maybe
some<00:00:41.800> pentatonic<00:00:42.370> stuff<00:00:42.820> like<00:00:42.970> that<00:00:43.000> you

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
some pentatonic stuff like that you

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:45.180 
some pentatonic stuff like that you
should<00:00:44.019> know<00:00:44.140> both<00:00:44.290> of<00:00:44.440> those<00:00:44.530> scales<00:00:44.800> by<00:00:45.010> now

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
should know both of those scales by now

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
should know both of those scales by now
if<00:00:45.460> you've<00:00:46.030> been<00:00:46.180> following<00:00:46.239> along<00:00:48.210> but

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.140 
on how to spice up your scale practicing
right<00:00:55.920> because<00:00:56.920> nobody<00:00:57.489> likes<00:00:57.580> just<00:00:57.909> sitting

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
right because nobody likes just sitting

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:05.039 
right because nobody likes just sitting
down<00:00:58.299> doing<00:01:02.790> exactly<00:01:03.790> that<00:01:04.180> for<00:01:04.629> like<00:01:04.809> 20

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
down doing exactly that for like 20

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.370 
down doing exactly that for like 20
minutes<00:01:05.199> straight<00:01:05.560> right<00:01:06.150> although<00:01:07.380> don't

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
minutes straight right although don't

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.590 
minutes straight right although don't
get<00:01:08.500> me<00:01:08.590> wrong<00:01:08.799> it's<00:01:09.040> good<00:01:09.189> for<00:01:09.400> you<00:01:11.040> so

the<00:01:15.460> talent<00:01:15.790> button<00:01:16.000> off<00:01:18.660> one<00:01:19.660> of<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:19.810> things

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
the talent button off one of the things

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.520 
the talent button off one of the things
I<00:01:20.110> like<00:01:20.230> to<00:01:20.290> do<00:01:20.560> is<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:21.720> do<00:01:22.720> little<00:01:23.020> steps<00:01:23.290> right

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
I like to do is to do little steps right

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.070 
I like to do is to do little steps right
you<00:01:23.740> go<00:01:23.890> down<00:01:24.100> or<00:01:24.400> say<00:01:25.360> go<00:01:25.510> up<00:01:25.660> three<00:01:25.840> steps

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
you go down or say go up three steps

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.350 
you go down or say go up three steps
down<00:01:26.260> one<00:01:26.560> step<00:01:26.830> up<00:01:27.010> three<00:01:27.220> steps<00:01:27.520> down<00:01:28.060> one

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
down one step up three steps down one

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.600 
down one step up three steps down one
step<00:01:28.630> up<00:01:28.840> three<00:01:29.110> steps<00:01:29.380> down<00:01:29.680> one<00:01:29.920> step<00:01:30.190> and<00:01:30.430> so

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
step up three steps down one step and so

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.520 
step up three steps down one step and so
on<00:01:30.790> all<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.150> way<00:01:31.270> until<00:01:31.420> you<00:01:31.630> finish<00:01:31.900> the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
on all the way until you finish the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.010 
on all the way until you finish the
scale<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.130> then<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:33.610> head<00:01:33.760> back<00:01:33.790> down<00:01:34.210> right

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
scale and then you head back down right

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.660 
scale and then you head back down right
so<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:37.680> no<00:01:38.680> i'm<00:01:38.830> not<00:01:38.860> going<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.159> tap<00:01:39.310> this<00:01:39.490> out

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
so and no i'm not going to tap this out

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.540 
so and no i'm not going to tap this out
because<00:01:39.880> it's<00:01:40.620> it's<00:01:41.620> better<00:01:41.890> for<00:01:42.159> you<00:01:42.190> to<00:01:42.280> get

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
because it's it's better for you to get

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.700 
because it's it's better for you to get
the<00:01:42.670> concept<00:01:43.120> in<00:01:43.270> your<00:01:43.420> mind<00:01:43.630> than<00:01:44.409> to

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
the concept in your mind than to

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.740 
the concept in your mind than to
actually<00:01:44.860> get<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.520> actually<00:01:46.210> be<00:01:46.330> following

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
actually get to actually be following

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.850 
actually get to actually be following
the<00:01:46.870> tab<00:01:47.080> right<00:01:47.350> because<00:01:47.590> if<00:01:47.740> you're

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
the tab right because if you're

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.350 
the tab right because if you're
following<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.340> tab<00:01:48.580> for<00:01:48.610> something<00:01:49.240> like

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
following the tab for something like

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.850 
following the tab for something like
this<00:01:49.420> this<00:01:49.780> is<00:01:49.960> a<00:01:49.990> concept<00:01:50.409> that<00:01:50.530> i'm<00:01:50.680> teaching

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
this this is a concept that i'm teaching

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.790 
this this is a concept that i'm teaching
then<00:01:51.790> if<00:01:52.750> you're<00:01:52.900> having<00:01:53.080> to<00:01:53.229> follow<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.620> tab

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
then if you're having to follow the tab

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.950 
then if you're having to follow the tab
for<00:01:53.830> that<00:01:54.190> then<00:01:54.640> how<00:01:55.450> are<00:01:55.479> you<00:01:55.630> going<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.870> play

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
for that then how are you going to play

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.250 
for that then how are you going to play
solo<00:01:56.350> when<00:01:56.590> you<00:01:56.710> need<00:01:56.890> that<00:01:56.920> right<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:58.540> all<00:01:59.170> you

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
solo when you need that right so all you

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.800 
solo when you need that right so all you
got<00:01:59.440> to<00:01:59.530> do<00:01:59.620> is<00:01:59.650> look<00:01:59.950> at<00:02:00.070> your<00:02:00.250> scale<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:00.880> then

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
got to do is look at your scale and then

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.610 
got to do is look at your scale and then
go<00:02:02.260> you<00:02:02.710> know<00:02:02.799> one<00:02:03.070> two<00:02:03.400> three<00:02:03.940> down<00:02:04.870> one<00:02:05.170> two

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
go you know one two three down one two

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:13.050 
go you know one two three down one two
three<00:02:06.130> four<00:02:06.490> down<00:02:07.090> one<00:02:07.799> 345<00:02:08.799> down<00:02:11.220> 1456<00:02:12.220> etc<00:02:12.879> on

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
three four down one 345 down 1456 etc on

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.180 
three four down one 345 down 1456 etc on
all<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.480> way<00:02:13.569> up<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.840> scale<00:02:14.140> right<00:02:14.409> so<00:02:15.069> it

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
all the way up to the scale right so it

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:37.400 
all the way up to the scale right so it
sounds<00:02:15.370> like<00:02:15.580> this

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.200 

okay<00:02:38.250> so<00:02:38.310> obviously<00:02:38.520> I<00:02:38.790> did<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.180> the

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
okay so obviously I did that in the

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.120 
okay so obviously I did that in the
pentatonic<00:02:39.660> scale<00:02:40.080> there<00:02:42.770> then<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:43.890> can<00:02:44.040> go

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
pentatonic scale there then you can go

00:02:44.130 --> 00:03:09.860 
pentatonic scale there then you can go
back<00:02:44.160> down<00:02:44.340> right<00:03:06.230> ok<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:09.120> again<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.510> pattern

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
back down right ok so again the pattern

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.190 
back down right ok so again the pattern

00:05:59.079 --> 00:05:59.089 

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:00.769 

basically<00:06:00.089> you're<00:06:00.210> going<00:06:00.330> to<00:06:00.389> anchor<00:06:00.569> your

basically you're going to anchor your
from<00:06:00.960> here<00:06:01.139> for<00:06:01.349> index<00:06:01.680> finger<00:06:02.039> on<00:06:02.219> the<00:06:02.669> 5th

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
from here for index finger on the 5th

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:08.029 
from here for index finger on the 5th
fret<00:06:03.029> there<00:06:03.330> and<00:06:04.460> then<00:06:06.319> get<00:06:07.319> your<00:06:07.469> other<00:06:07.860> two

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
fret there and then get your other two

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.139 
fret there and then get your other two
fingers<00:06:08.399> in<00:06:08.550> place<00:06:08.789> here<00:06:09.089> and<00:06:09.439> then<00:06:10.879> just<00:06:11.879> pull

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:12.149 
fingers in place here and then just pull

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:14.520 
fingers in place here and then just pull
off<00:06:12.180> like

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
off like

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:16.540 
off like
takes<00:06:15.530> a<00:06:15.620> bit<00:06:15.770> of<00:06:15.800> strength<00:06:16.129> and<00:06:16.280> it<00:06:16.400> really

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
takes a bit of strength and it really

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.980 
takes a bit of strength and it really
kind<00:06:16.729> of<00:06:16.759> builds<00:06:17.060> up<00:06:17.180> your<00:06:17.330> finger<00:06:17.750> strength

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
kind of builds up your finger strength

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:26.170 
kind of builds up your finger strength
by<00:06:18.229> the<00:06:18.289> way

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.550 

and<00:06:26.600> then<00:06:27.080> the<00:06:27.169> rest<00:06:27.320> is<00:06:27.470> pulling<00:06:27.830> on<00:06:29.560> the

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 
and then the rest is pulling on the

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.990 
and then the rest is pulling on the
trick<00:06:30.770> to<00:06:30.800> that<00:06:31.009> is<00:06:31.070> basically<00:06:31.550> just<00:06:31.639> going<00:06:31.940> to

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
trick to that is basically just going to

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.860 
trick to that is basically just going to
keep<00:06:32.120> your<00:06:32.360> your<00:06:32.900> your<00:06:33.710> ring<00:06:33.889> finger<00:06:34.100> here

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
keep your your your ring finger here

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:41.020 
keep your your your ring finger here
anchored<00:06:35.870> on<00:06:36.020> there<00:06:38.740> by<00:06:39.740> your<00:06:39.919> little<00:06:40.729> pinky

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
anchored on there by your little pinky

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.029 
anchored on there by your little pinky
does<00:06:41.180> all<00:06:41.360> the<00:06:41.479> work<00:06:41.509> there<00:06:41.840> and<00:06:41.990> I<00:06:42.410> can<00:06:42.680> feel

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 
does all the work there and I can feel

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:45.010 
does all the work there and I can feel
it<00:06:43.160> right<00:06:43.340> now<00:06:43.370> it<00:06:43.880> is<00:06:44.060> going<00:06:44.509> to<00:06:44.600> improve<00:06:44.810> your

it right now it is going to improve your
finger<00:06:45.289> strength<00:06:45.500> that's<00:06:45.770> uh<00:06:46.840> and<00:06:47.840> then<00:06:47.990> later

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.320 
finger strength that's uh and then later

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:57.720 
finger strength that's uh and then later
on<00:06:48.440> you<00:06:48.680> can<00:06:48.800> do<00:06:48.919> that

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:57.730 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.860 

which<00:06:58.730> is<00:06:58.940> um<00:06:59.410> that's<00:07:00.410> another<00:07:00.620> way<00:07:00.800> of

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
which is um that's another way of
