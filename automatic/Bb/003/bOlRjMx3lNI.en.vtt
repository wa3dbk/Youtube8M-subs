and<00:00:18.300> easy<00:00:18.359> method<00:00:18.869> that's<00:00:19.470> not<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:19.859> method

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
and easy method that's not this method

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.910 
and easy method that's not this method
because<00:00:20.460> it's<00:00:20.609> smaller<00:00:20.910> than<00:00:21.439> the<00:00:22.439> old<00:00:22.650> method

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
basically like a house you had water

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.380 
basically like a house you had water
with<00:00:45.590> signs<00:00:46.590> on<00:00:46.950> underneath<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.850> water<00:00:48.030> and

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
with signs on underneath the water and

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.270 
with signs on underneath the water and
the<00:00:48.510> chickens<00:00:48.809> would<00:00:48.899> lay<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.050> eggs<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:50.250> eggs

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the chickens would lay the eggs the eggs

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.979 
the chickens would lay the eggs the eggs
would<00:00:50.670> fall<00:00:50.910> through<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.270> signs<00:00:51.570> which<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
would fall through the signs which the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.840 
would fall through the signs which the
water<00:00:52.140> was<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.649> then<00:00:53.219> you'd<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.460> water

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
water was on then you'd have water

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.520 
water was on then you'd have water
sliding<00:00:54.270> down<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.690> one<00:00:54.899> inch<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.289> then<00:00:55.410> you'd

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
sliding down to one inch and then you'd

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.160 
sliding down to one inch and then you'd
pick<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.860> all<00:00:55.980> up<00:00:56.010> now<00:00:56.910> personally<00:00:57.239> that's<00:00:58.020> a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.560 
pick it all up now personally that's a
great<00:00:58.289> method<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:59.100> there's<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.059> load<00:01:00.420> of

by five a five by three hopper or five
by<00:02:00.719> five<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> lot<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.619> vine<00:02:01.799> you're<00:02:02.070> probably

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
by five so a lot of vine you're probably

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.210 
by five so a lot of vine you're probably
going<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.460> be<00:02:02.549> thinking<00:02:02.969> but

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
going to be thinking but

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.210 
going to be thinking but
i<00:02:04.280> will<00:02:05.240> show<00:02:05.480> you<00:02:05.540> why<00:02:05.870> this<00:02:05.900> is<00:02:06.440> a<00:02:06.470> very<00:02:06.920> good

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
i will show you why this is a very good

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
make a little bit of fence around it

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.140 
make a little bit of fence around it
just<00:04:01.310> there<00:04:01.549> to<00:04:01.580> spruce<00:04:02.180> up

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
just there to spruce up

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.710 
just there to spruce up
because<00:04:04.689> it<00:04:04.840> makes<00:04:05.019> it<00:04:05.230> look<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.349> lot<00:04:05.620> nicer

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720

because it makes it look a lot nicer
that's<00:04:07.720> just<00:04:07.930> me<00:04:09.269> different<00:04:10.269> people<00:04:10.390> have

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
that's just me different people have

that's just me different people have
different<00:04:10.689> opinions<00:04:11.019> but<00:04:11.920> this<00:04:12.459> is<00:04:12.549> a<00:04:12.579> good

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
different opinions but this is a good

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.399 
different opinions but this is a good
way<00:04:12.909> to<00:04:12.939> keep<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.299> chickens<00:04:13.599> in<00:04:13.720> you<00:04:13.840> can<00:04:14.110> have

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
way to keep the chickens in you can have

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.759 
way to keep the chickens in you can have
walls<00:04:14.970> around<00:04:15.970> here<00:04:16.509> so<00:04:16.989> obviously<00:04:17.530> the

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
walls around here so obviously the

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.469 
walls around here so obviously the
chickens<00:04:18.130> will<00:04:18.310> not<00:04:18.459> get<00:04:18.609> out<00:04:18.729> I<00:04:19.000> personally

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
chickens will not get out I personally

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.960 
chickens will not get out I personally
like<00:04:19.900> fence<00:04:20.199> this<00:04:20.889> makes<00:04:21.130> a<00:04:21.250> lot<00:04:21.280> more<00:04:21.609> nicer

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
like fence this makes a lot more nicer

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.810

chickens and if we right-click these
hoppers<00:04:50.590> now<00:04:50.889> it<00:04:51.130> will<00:04:51.250> just<00:04:51.370> take<00:04:51.580> them<00:04:51.910> into

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
hoppers now it will just take them into

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.909 
hoppers now it will just take them into
a<00:04:52.150> hopper<00:04:52.300> which<00:04:52.630> we<00:04:52.750> don't<00:04:52.870> want<00:04:52.990> so<00:04:53.710> let's

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
a hopper which we don't want so let's

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.810 
a hopper which we don't want so let's
spawn<00:04:54.310> a<00:04:54.729> load<00:04:55.330> of<00:04:55.479> chickens<00:04:56.430> let's<00:04:57.430> move<00:04:57.639> this

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
spawn a load of chickens let's move this

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.689 
spawn a load of chickens let's move this

probably going to leave yet wondered

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.469 
probably going to leave yet wondered
little<00:05:10.840> in<00:05:11.610> so<00:05:12.610> what<00:05:12.849> will<00:05:12.970> happen<00:05:13.000> is

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
little in so what will happen is

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.570

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.939 
that these chickens will pop out eggs
and<00:05:15.910> they're<00:05:16.870> all<00:05:16.930> connected<00:05:17.260> so<00:05:17.710> that<00:05:17.740> all

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
and they're all connected so that all

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.430 
and they're all connected so that all
slide<00:05:18.580> into<00:05:18.910> each<00:05:19.030> other<00:05:19.240> and<00:05:19.570> then<00:05:20.139> they<00:05:20.260> all

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
slide into each other and then they all

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.469 
slide into each other and then they all
trickle<00:05:20.949> down<00:05:20.979> into<00:05:21.490> this<00:05:21.940> chest<00:05:22.240> which<00:05:22.419> you

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
trickle down into this chest which you

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:23.790 
trickle down into this chest which you
can<00:05:22.599> easily<00:05:22.720> access<00:05:23.020> by<00:05:23.380> right-clicking

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
can easily access by right-clicking

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.800 
can easily access by right-clicking
there's<00:05:24.310> nothing<00:05:24.610> at<00:05:24.729> the<00:05:24.820> moment<00:05:24.849> clearly

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
there's nothing at the moment clearly

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.689 
there's nothing at the moment clearly
because<00:05:26.139> we've<00:05:26.440> literally<00:05:26.830> spawned<00:05:27.370> them<00:05:27.580> in

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:27.699 
because we've literally spawned them in

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:29.580 
because we've literally spawned them in
instead<00:05:28.000> of<00:05:28.060> actually<00:05:28.419> put<00:05:28.570> men<00:05:28.810> now<00:05:29.320> if<00:05:29.409> the

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
instead of actually put men now if the

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.080 
instead of actually put men now if the
difference<00:05:29.889> between<00:05:30.010> spawning<00:05:30.580> them<00:05:30.909> and

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
difference between spawning them and

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.850 
difference between spawning them and
actually<00:05:31.210> having<00:05:31.810> them<00:05:31.990> is<00:05:32.500> tightly

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
actually having them is tightly

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.140 
actually having them is tightly
different<00:05:33.310> when<00:05:33.550> you<00:05:33.639> actually<00:05:33.789> have

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
different when you actually have

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.820 
different when you actually have
chickens<00:05:34.599> they<00:05:34.750> will<00:05:34.960> produce<00:05:35.169> eggs<00:05:35.530> a<00:05:35.680> lot

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
chickens they will produce eggs a lot

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.830 
chickens they will produce eggs a lot
quicker<00:05:36.070> than<00:05:36.220> spawn<00:05:36.550> them<00:05:36.699> in<00:05:36.909> spoiling<00:05:37.599> them

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
quicker than spawn them in spoiling them

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.050 
quicker than spawn them in spoiling them
in<00:05:37.960> will<00:05:38.139> take<00:05:38.320> you<00:05:38.409> an<00:05:38.500> awful<00:05:38.860> lot<00:05:38.919> of<00:05:39.070> time<00:05:39.250> so

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
in will take you an awful lot of time so

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.120 
in will take you an awful lot of time so
obviously<00:05:40.900> you<00:05:41.020> can't<00:05:41.260> base<00:05:41.409> on<00:05:41.560> Survivor<00:05:41.889> or

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
obviously you can't base on Survivor or

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.920 
obviously you can't base on Survivor or
hardcore<00:05:42.580> but<00:05:42.909> this<00:05:43.030> is<00:05:43.210> the<00:05:43.330> method<00:05:43.479> i<00:05:43.720> have

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
hardcore but this is the method i have

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.390 
hardcore but this is the method i have
used<00:05:44.139> for<00:05:44.320> the<00:05:44.409> chickens<00:05:44.740> that<00:05:44.800> I<00:05:44.949> have<00:05:45.190> now

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
used for the chickens that I have now

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.640 
used for the chickens that I have now
obviously<00:05:46.330> remember<00:05:46.659> guys<00:05:46.810> a<00:05:46.840> chicken<00:05:47.500> see

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
obviously remember guys a chicken see

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.529 
obviously remember guys a chicken see
seeds<00:05:48.010> chicken<00:05:48.520> will<00:05:48.610> follow<00:05:48.849> you<00:05:48.940> fat<00:05:49.180> seat

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
so we knit this background or a stroke

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.790 
so we knit this background or a stroke
at<00:05:51.340> chicken<00:05:51.820> run<00:05:51.849> it<00:05:52.750> back<00:05:52.930> put<00:05:53.500> in<00:05:53.650> like<00:05:53.770> a
