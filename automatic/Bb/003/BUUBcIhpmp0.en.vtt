the bounce and you know moves moves past
that<00:00:44.340> bounce<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:45.050> use<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.320> grip<00:00:46.620> most<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
that bounce I use this grip most of the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.439 
that bounce I use this grip most of the
time<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.910> very<00:00:48.719> tough<00:00:49.200> fast<00:00:50.160> deep<00:00:50.700> incoming

behind the baseline and and someone
plays<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.469> tough<00:01:01.649> ball<00:01:01.920> back<00:01:02.129> here<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.760> know

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
plays the tough ball back here you know

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.640 
plays the tough ball back here you know
sometimes<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:03.660> use<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.960> Continental

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
sometimes you can use that Continental

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.670 
sometimes you can use that Continental
grip<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.070> slice<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.030> backhand<00:01:06.540> back<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.560> if

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
grip and slice the backhand back but if

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.910 
grip and slice the backhand back but if
you're<00:01:07.890> right<00:01:08.189> up<00:01:08.400> here<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.920> baseline

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
you're right up here on this baseline

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.530 
you're right up here on this baseline
and<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.250> don't<00:01:11.460> want<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.700> give<00:01:11.880> up<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.210> court

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
and you don't want to give up this court

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.090 
and you don't want to give up this court
position<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.380> know<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.530> want<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.920> keep

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
position you know you want to keep

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.800 
position you know you want to keep
challenging<00:01:14.369> your<00:01:14.880> opponent<00:01:15.270> through<00:01:15.420> having

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
challenging your opponent through having

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.499 
challenging your opponent through having
good<00:01:16.110> consistent<00:01:17.100> core<00:01:17.369> position<00:01:17.939> if<00:01:18.119> they

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
good consistent core position if they

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.330 
good consistent core position if they
hit<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.689> tough<00:01:19.049> deep<00:01:19.560> ball<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:19.979> going<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.159> land

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
hit a tough deep ball it's going to land

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.039 
hit a tough deep ball it's going to land
deep<00:01:20.610> I'm<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.360> switch<00:01:21.570> over<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.960> that

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
deep I'm going to switch over to that

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.590 
deep I'm going to switch over to that
eastern<00:01:22.470> backhand<00:01:22.979> grip<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:24.090> provide<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
eastern backhand grip and just provide a

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.899 
eastern backhand grip and just provide a
little<00:01:24.810> backboard<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.159> incoming<00:01:26.580> ball

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
little backboard for that incoming ball

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.210 
little backboard for that incoming ball
so<00:01:27.360> it's<00:01:27.509> got<00:01:27.689> something<00:01:28.140> flat<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.799> rebound

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
so it's got something flat to rebound

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.999 
so it's got something flat to rebound
off<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.820> if<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.840> opponent<00:01:31.380> shot<00:01:31.560> lens<00:01:31.860> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
off of if the opponent shot lens a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.010 
off of if the opponent shot lens a
little<00:01:32.159> further<00:01:32.549> out<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:32.970> front<00:01:33.240> where<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.720> can

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
little further out in front where I can

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.359 
little further out in front where I can
get<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> little<00:01:34.409> bit<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.710> swing<00:01:35.040> through<00:01:35.340> it

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
get a little bit of swing through it

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.640 
get a little bit of swing through it
then<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.090> can<00:01:36.420> drive<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.900> with<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.049> little<00:01:37.409> bit<00:01:37.530> of

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
then I can drive it with a little bit of

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.340 
then I can drive it with a little bit of
topspin<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.939> that's<00:01:39.119> primarily<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:40.079> time

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
topspin so that's primarily the time

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.539 
topspin so that's primarily the time
that<00:01:40.500> you're<00:01:40.619> going<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.829> use<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.130> eastern

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
that you're going to use this eastern

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.880 
that you're going to use this eastern
backhand<00:01:42.119> grip<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.869> other<00:01:43.020> time<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.680> use<00:01:43.860> it

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
backhand grip the other time as I use it

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.740 
backhand grip the other time as I use it
sometimes<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> half<00:01:44.790> volley<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.659> know

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
sometimes in the half volley you know

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.780 
sometimes in the half volley you know
this<00:01:45.930> backhand<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.740> see<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.220> lot<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.520> players

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
this backhand I see a lot of players

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.190 
this backhand I see a lot of players
where<00:01:48.030> they<00:01:48.119> come<00:01:48.390> in<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.659> they<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.899> half

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
where they come in and they have a half

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.340 
where they come in and they have a half
volley<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.740> play<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:51.270> rather<00:01:51.780> than<00:01:52.110> stead

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
volley to play and and rather than stead

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.139 
volley to play and and rather than stead
of<00:01:52.409> coming<00:01:52.740> down<00:01:52.770> here<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.310> providing<00:01:53.970> a

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
of coming down here and providing a

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.870 
of coming down here and providing a
little<00:01:54.720> backboard<00:01:55.649> for<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> ball<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.340> rebound

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
little backboard for the ball to rebound

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.480 
little backboard for the ball to rebound
against<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:57.750> they<00:01:58.350> shuffle<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.009> feet<00:01:59.250> through

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
against as they shuffle the feet through

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.940 
against as they shuffle the feet through
that<00:01:59.729> half<00:02:00.000> volley<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.750> they<00:02:01.229> end<00:02:01.409> up<00:02:01.560> kind<00:02:01.799> of

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
that half volley is they end up kind of

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.819 
that half volley is they end up kind of
chopping<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.000> hacking<00:02:03.390> down<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.930> really

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
chopping and hacking down and really

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.100 
chopping and hacking down and really
really<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.250> tough<00:02:05.520> shot<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.420> that's<00:02:06.810> another

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
really is a tough shot so that's another

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.440 
really is a tough shot so that's another
time<00:02:07.380> when<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.710> can<00:02:07.860> use<00:02:08.099> this<00:02:08.450> eastern

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450
